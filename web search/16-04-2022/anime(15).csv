Review   by Rebecca Silverman, Mar 30th 2022       Lightning and Romance GN 1-2                     Synopsis:             Sumire is less than thrilled when, at the start of her second year in high school, she finds herself in a class with the resident bad “boy,” Reo. Reo's actually in his early twenties, and while no one can figure out why he's attending high school, the rumors about him are definitely not flattering. But as Sumire gets to know him, she finds out that there's a lot more to Reo than the unsavory rumors suggest. But does her romance stand a chance when he's determined to keep her out of his life?      Review:         Synopsis:        Sumire is less than thrilled when, at the start of her second year in high school, she finds herself in a class with the resident bad “boy,” Reo. Reo's actually in his early twenties, and while no one can figure out why he's attending high school, the rumors about him are definitely not flattering. But as Sumire gets to know him, she finds out that there's a lot more to Reo than the unsavory rumors suggest. But does her romance stand a chance when he's determined to keep her out of his life?     Review:            If you've been reading Rin Mikimoto's previously translated works, you may have figured out that she has a thing for the age-gap romance – all of her other translated works but Kira-kun Today fall under that heading. This time she's trying something new in the field: rather than having her heroine fall in love with a teacher (Love's Reach) or a famous, slightly older celebrity (Kiss Me at the Stroke of Midnight), the older man Sumire falls for is in her high school class, and unlike titles like A Girl and Her Guard Dog, he appears to be there strictly to learn.    There's absolutely nothing wrong with going back at a nontraditional age to finish your education, so although it's odd, it's not bad that 20-year-old Reo is sitting in a second-year high school classroom even if in real life we more often see this play out at the university level. While people are confused about Reo's presence, no one really makes any disparaging remarks about it, possibly because they're all three-quarters convinced that he's some sort of evil yakuza delinquent, a belief that the lightning bolt-shaped scar on his cheek only reinforces. Reo doesn't necessarily seem to mind that his classmates are largely afraid of him, possibly because he's very much aware that he's an adult in a room full of children, and while we don't get any real answers about why he's completing high school now, the very fact that he is doing so seems to be more important, and that, if we extrapolate from volume two, it's borne out of a desire to make up for some misspent youth.    That he also is much more fervent in his attempts to fend Sumire off than some of Mikimoto's other heroes is a bit of a saving grace as well. He knows that this is maybe not an awesome relationship to be embarking on. He does his level best to drive Sumire away, putting on a very good show in volume one of being disinterested, one which begins to crumble a bit in volume two. This is at least in part because Sumire comes from the Chutzpah School of Romance Heroines, and she's not about to let him dictate her feelings – especially not when he's kind of bad at hiding that he may like her, too (which begins to creep out in the first book and becomes solidified in the second). Despite the reciprocal nature of their feelings, however, he remains unrelenting in his commitment to not date Sumire. While we can all make a good guess that this really isn't going to last, the “we can't” approach is a nice change from the “no, really, I swear I don't like you” tactic that I feel like we see more of in the genre. That he seems to have some very good reasons beyond simply being older than her is an intriguing bit of story-building, and while it may turn out to be reasons that only Reo thinks are important, just being able to stick to his guns around the very open Sumire does a nice job of illustrating to the reader that he really is an adult to her teenager.    That Reo's family is somehow involved in all of this feels like a given by the end of volume two. We know from the outset of the series that he has a tenuous relationship with them, but the fancy party that Sumire's author father drags her to as his plus-one (he's a single dad and appears to be mostly devoted to his daughter) reveals that there may be more than run-of-the-mill estrangement going on. One of the best scenes in the these volumes comes from volume two, when Sumire stands up to Reo's grandfather for him; she doesn't have a full grasp of what's going on, but she can tell from the impressively tense undercurrent to their conversation that he's pressuring Reo to do things he's not comfortable with, and since she doesn't have a horse in their race (so to speak), she's in a better position to speak up. It also emphasizes how much younger she is emotionally than Reo; she lacks a grasp of the social nuances of the situation, or at least is young enough that she doesn't care about them. It may be only a few years, but the scene really does emphasize how big a difference there can be between your late teens and early twenties in terms of understanding – and that Sumire's actions feel like the right ones may say something about the social pressures Reo has learned to cave to.    Naturally around this time in volume two we learn that he and Sumire knew each other in the past, and that she's inadvertently behind his switch from his bad-boy ways to where he is now. Reo refuses to say more than that, hedging that it was a small nothing to Sumire that meant the world to him, and that's intriguing, but it needs development if it is to be a mitigating factor in their budding romance's inappropriateness. There's also a bit of an insta-love feel to Sumire falling for him, made more prominent by the fact that she's more than ready for romance, as we see from her conversations with her best friend Rio. That does make him feel a bit more like ""convenient love"" than ""true love,"" although his attachment to her from the past does indicate that such will not always be the case. It's a contrived situation all around, but there's still enough here to make this worth following, especially if you've enjoyed Mikimoto's work before, and her ugly-cute art style with its chibis looks much better here than in previous series.

Review   by Rebecca Silverman, Mar 30th 2022       Lightning and Romance GN 1-2                     Synopsis:             Sumire is less than thrilled when, at the start of her second year in high school, she finds herself in a class with the resident bad “boy,” Reo. Reo's actually in his early twenties, and while no one can figure out why he's attending high school, the rumors about him are definitely not flattering. But as Sumire gets to know him, she finds out that there's a lot more to Reo than the unsavory rumors suggest. But does her romance stand a chance when he's determined to keep her out of his life?      Review:         Synopsis:        Sumire is less than thrilled when, at the start of her second year in high school, she finds herself in a class with the resident bad “boy,” Reo. Reo's actually in his early twenties, and while no one can figure out why he's attending high school, the rumors about him are definitely not flattering. But as Sumire gets to know him, she finds out that there's a lot more to Reo than the unsavory rumors suggest. But does her romance stand a chance when he's determined to keep her out of his life?     Review:            If you've been reading Rin Mikimoto's previously translated works, you may have figured out that she has a thing for the age-gap romance – all of her other translated works but Kira-kun Today fall under that heading. This time she's trying something new in the field: rather than having her heroine fall in love with a teacher (Love's Reach) or a famous, slightly older celebrity (Kiss Me at the Stroke of Midnight), the older man Sumire falls for is in her high school class, and unlike titles like A Girl and Her Guard Dog, he appears to be there strictly to learn.    There's absolutely nothing wrong with going back at a nontraditional age to finish your education, so although it's odd, it's not bad that 20-year-old Reo is sitting in a second-year high school classroom even if in real life we more often see this play out at the university level. While people are confused about Reo's presence, no one really makes any disparaging remarks about it, possibly because they're all three-quarters convinced that he's some sort of evil yakuza delinquent, a belief that the lightning bolt-shaped scar on his cheek only reinforces. Reo doesn't necessarily seem to mind that his classmates are largely afraid of him, possibly because he's very much aware that he's an adult in a room full of children, and while we don't get any real answers about why he's completing high school now, the very fact that he is doing so seems to be more important, and that, if we extrapolate from volume two, it's borne out of a desire to make up for some misspent youth.    That he also is much more fervent in his attempts to fend Sumire off than some of Mikimoto's other heroes is a bit of a saving grace as well. He knows that this is maybe not an awesome relationship to be embarking on. He does his level best to drive Sumire away, putting on a very good show in volume one of being disinterested, one which begins to crumble a bit in volume two. This is at least in part because Sumire comes from the Chutzpah School of Romance Heroines, and she's not about to let him dictate her feelings – especially not when he's kind of bad at hiding that he may like her, too (which begins to creep out in the first book and becomes solidified in the second). Despite the reciprocal nature of their feelings, however, he remains unrelenting in his commitment to not date Sumire. While we can all make a good guess that this really isn't going to last, the “we can't” approach is a nice change from the “no, really, I swear I don't like you” tactic that I feel like we see more of in the genre. That he seems to have some very good reasons beyond simply being older than her is an intriguing bit of story-building, and while it may turn out to be reasons that only Reo thinks are important, just being able to stick to his guns around the very open Sumire does a nice job of illustrating to the reader that he really is an adult to her teenager.    That Reo's family is somehow involved in all of this feels like a given by the end of volume two. We know from the outset of the series that he has a tenuous relationship with them, but the fancy party that Sumire's author father drags her to as his plus-one (he's a single dad and appears to be mostly devoted to his daughter) reveals that there may be more than run-of-the-mill estrangement going on. One of the best scenes in the these volumes comes from volume two, when Sumire stands up to Reo's grandfather for him; she doesn't have a full grasp of what's going on, but she can tell from the impressively tense undercurrent to their conversation that he's pressuring Reo to do things he's not comfortable with, and since she doesn't have a horse in their race (so to speak), she's in a better position to speak up. It also emphasizes how much younger she is emotionally than Reo; she lacks a grasp of the social nuances of the situation, or at least is young enough that she doesn't care about them. It may be only a few years, but the scene really does emphasize how big a difference there can be between your late teens and early twenties in terms of understanding – and that Sumire's actions feel like the right ones may say something about the social pressures Reo has learned to cave to.    Naturally around this time in volume two we learn that he and Sumire knew each other in the past, and that she's inadvertently behind his switch from his bad-boy ways to where he is now. Reo refuses to say more than that, hedging that it was a small nothing to Sumire that meant the world to him, and that's intriguing, but it needs development if it is to be a mitigating factor in their budding romance's inappropriateness. There's also a bit of an insta-love feel to Sumire falling for him, made more prominent by the fact that she's more than ready for romance, as we see from her conversations with her best friend Rio. That does make him feel a bit more like ""convenient love"" than ""true love,"" although his attachment to her from the past does indicate that such will not always be the case. It's a contrived situation all around, but there's still enough here to make this worth following, especially if you've enjoyed Mikimoto's work before, and her ugly-cute art style with its chibis looks much better here than in previous series. (Although we won't talk about some of the questionable outfits that appear in the party chapters.) It's an age-gap romance with a different hook, and by volume two, that hook is baited well enough that it'll be hard to resist volume three.             Grade:      Overall : B Story : B+ Art : B-  + Reo's reservations about Sumire balance out her insta-love, volume two is stronger overall.

Review   by Rebecca Silverman, Mar 30th 2022       Lightning and Romance GN 1-2                     Synopsis:             Sumire is less than thrilled when, at the start of her second year in high school, she finds herself in a class with the resident bad “boy,” Reo. Reo's actually in his early twenties, and while no one can figure out why he's attending high school, the rumors about him are definitely not flattering. But as Sumire gets to know him, she finds out that there's a lot more to Reo than the unsavory rumors suggest. But does her romance stand a chance when he's determined to keep her out of his life?      Review:         Synopsis:        Sumire is less than thrilled when, at the start of her second year in high school, she finds herself in a class with the resident bad “boy,” Reo. Reo's actually in his early twenties, and while no one can figure out why he's attending high school, the rumors about him are definitely not flattering. But as Sumire gets to know him, she finds out that there's a lot more to Reo than the unsavory rumors suggest. But does her romance stand a chance when he's determined to keep her out of his life?     Review:            If you've been reading Rin Mikimoto's previously translated works, you may have figured out that she has a thing for the age-gap romance – all of her other translated works but Kira-kun Today fall under that heading. This time she's trying something new in the field: rather than having her heroine fall in love with a teacher (Love's Reach) or a famous, slightly older celebrity (Kiss Me at the Stroke of Midnight), the older man Sumire falls for is in her high school class, and unlike titles like A Girl and Her Guard Dog, he appears to be there strictly to learn.    There's absolutely nothing wrong with going back at a nontraditional age to finish your education, so although it's odd, it's not bad that 20-year-old Reo is sitting in a second-year high school classroom even if in real life we more often see this play out at the university level. While people are confused about Reo's presence, no one really makes any disparaging remarks about it, possibly because they're all three-quarters convinced that he's some sort of evil yakuza delinquent, a belief that the lightning bolt-shaped scar on his cheek only reinforces. Reo doesn't necessarily seem to mind that his classmates are largely afraid of him, possibly because he's very much aware that he's an adult in a room full of children, and while we don't get any real answers about why he's completing high school now, the very fact that he is doing so seems to be more important, and that, if we extrapolate from volume two, it's borne out of a desire to make up for some misspent youth.    That he also is much more fervent in his attempts to fend Sumire off than some of Mikimoto's other heroes is a bit of a saving grace as well. He knows that this is maybe not an awesome relationship to be embarking on. He does his level best to drive Sumire away, putting on a very good show in volume one of being disinterested, one which begins to crumble a bit in volume two. This is at least in part because Sumire comes from the Chutzpah School of Romance Heroines, and she's not about to let him dictate her feelings – especially not when he's kind of bad at hiding that he may like her, too (which begins to creep out in the first book and becomes solidified in the second). Despite the reciprocal nature of their feelings, however, he remains unrelenting in his commitment to not date Sumire. While we can all make a good guess that this really isn't going to last, the “we can't” approach is a nice change from the “no, really, I swear I don't like you” tactic that I feel like we see more of in the genre. That he seems to have some very good reasons beyond simply being older than her is an intriguing bit of story-building, and while it may turn out to be reasons that only Reo thinks are important, just being able to stick to his guns around the very open Sumire does a nice job of illustrating to the reader that he really is an adult to her teenager.    That Reo's family is somehow involved in all of this feels like a given by the end of volume two. We know from the outset of the series that he has a tenuous relationship with them, but the fancy party that Sumire's author father drags her to as his plus-one (he's a single dad and appears to be mostly devoted to his daughter) reveals that there may be more than run-of-the-mill estrangement going on. One of the best scenes in the these volumes comes from volume two, when Sumire stands up to Reo's grandfather for him; she doesn't have a full grasp of what's going on, but she can tell from the impressively tense undercurrent to their conversation that he's pressuring Reo to do things he's not comfortable with, and since she doesn't have a horse in their race (so to speak), she's in a better position to speak up. It also emphasizes how much younger she is emotionally than Reo; she lacks a grasp of the social nuances of the situation, or at least is young enough that she doesn't care about them. It may be only a few years, but the scene really does emphasize how big a difference there can be between your late teens and early twenties in terms of understanding – and that Sumire's actions feel like the right ones may say something about the social pressures Reo has learned to cave to.    Naturally around this time in volume two we learn that he and Sumire knew each other in the past, and that she's inadvertently behind his switch from his bad-boy ways to where he is now. Reo refuses to say more than that, hedging that it was a small nothing to Sumire that meant the world to him, and that's intriguing, but it needs development if it is to be a mitigating factor in their budding romance's inappropriateness. There's also a bit of an insta-love feel to Sumire falling for him, made more prominent by the fact that she's more than ready for romance, as we see from her conversations with her best friend Rio. That does make him feel a bit more like ""convenient love"" than ""true love,"" although his attachment to her from the past does indicate that such will not always be the case. It's a contrived situation all around, but there's still enough here to make this worth following, especially if you've enjoyed Mikimoto's work before, and her ugly-cute art style with its chibis looks much better here than in previous series. (Although we won't talk about some of the questionable outfits that appear in the party chapters.) It's an age-gap romance with a different hook, and by volume two, that hook is baited well enough that it'll be hard to resist volume three.             Grade:      Overall : B Story : B+ Art : B-  + Reo's reservations about Sumire balance out her insta-love, volume two is stronger overall. New character in volume two is fun. − Romance feels pretty abrupt, art isn't great at perspective.

Review   by Rebecca Silverman, Mar 30th 2022       Lightning and Romance GN 1-2                     Synopsis:             Sumire is less than thrilled when, at the start of her second year in high school, she finds herself in a class with the resident bad “boy,” Reo. Reo's actually in his early twenties, and while no one can figure out why he's attending high school, the rumors about him are definitely not flattering. But as Sumire gets to know him, she finds out that there's a lot more to Reo than the unsavory rumors suggest. But does her romance stand a chance when he's determined to keep her out of his life?      Review:         Synopsis:        Sumire is less than thrilled when, at the start of her second year in high school, she finds herself in a class with the resident bad “boy,” Reo. Reo's actually in his early twenties, and while no one can figure out why he's attending high school, the rumors about him are definitely not flattering. But as Sumire gets to know him, she finds out that there's a lot more to Reo than the unsavory rumors suggest. But does her romance stand a chance when he's determined to keep her out of his life?     Review:            If you've been reading Rin Mikimoto's previously translated works, you may have figured out that she has a thing for the age-gap romance – all of her other translated works but Kira-kun Today fall under that heading. This time she's trying something new in the field: rather than having her heroine fall in love with a teacher (Love's Reach) or a famous, slightly older celebrity (Kiss Me at the Stroke of Midnight), the older man Sumire falls for is in her high school class, and unlike titles like A Girl and Her Guard Dog, he appears to be there strictly to learn.    There's absolutely nothing wrong with going back at a nontraditional age to finish your education, so although it's odd, it's not bad that 20-year-old Reo is sitting in a second-year high school classroom even if in real life we more often see this play out at the university level. While people are confused about Reo's presence, no one really makes any disparaging remarks about it, possibly because they're all three-quarters convinced that he's some sort of evil yakuza delinquent, a belief that the lightning bolt-shaped scar on his cheek only reinforces. Reo doesn't necessarily seem to mind that his classmates are largely afraid of him, possibly because he's very much aware that he's an adult in a room full of children, and while we don't get any real answers about why he's completing high school now, the very fact that he is doing so seems to be more important, and that, if we extrapolate from volume two, it's borne out of a desire to make up for some misspent youth.    That he also is much more fervent in his attempts to fend Sumire off than some of Mikimoto's other heroes is a bit of a saving grace as well. He knows that this is maybe not an awesome relationship to be embarking on. He does his level best to drive Sumire away, putting on a very good show in volume one of being disinterested, one which begins to crumble a bit in volume two. This is at least in part because Sumire comes from the Chutzpah School of Romance Heroines, and she's not about to let him dictate her feelings – especially not when he's kind of bad at hiding that he may like her, too (which begins to creep out in the first book and becomes solidified in the second). Despite the reciprocal nature of their feelings, however, he remains unrelenting in his commitment to not date Sumire. While we can all make a good guess that this really isn't going to last, the “we can't” approach is a nice change from the “no, really, I swear I don't like you” tactic that I feel like we see more of in the genre. That he seems to have some very good reasons beyond simply being older than her is an intriguing bit of story-building, and while it may turn out to be reasons that only Reo thinks are important, just being able to stick to his guns around the very open Sumire does a nice job of illustrating to the reader that he really is an adult to her teenager.    That Reo's family is somehow involved in all of this feels like a given by the end of volume two. We know from the outset of the series that he has a tenuous relationship with them, but the fancy party that Sumire's author father drags her to as his plus-one (he's a single dad and appears to be mostly devoted to his daughter) reveals that there may be more than run-of-the-mill estrangement going on. One of the best scenes in the these volumes comes from volume two, when Sumire stands up to Reo's grandfather for him; she doesn't have a full grasp of what's going on, but she can tell from the impressively tense undercurrent to their conversation that he's pressuring Reo to do things he's not comfortable with, and since she doesn't have a horse in their race (so to speak), she's in a better position to speak up. It also emphasizes how much younger she is emotionally than Reo; she lacks a grasp of the social nuances of the situation, or at least is young enough that she doesn't care about them. It may be only a few years, but the scene really does emphasize how big a difference there can be between your late teens and early twenties in terms of understanding – and that Sumire's actions feel like the right ones may say something about the social pressures Reo has learned to cave to.    Naturally around this time in volume two we learn that he and Sumire knew each other in the past, and that she's inadvertently behind his switch from his bad-boy ways to where he is now. Reo refuses to say more than that, hedging that it was a small nothing to Sumire that meant the world to him, and that's intriguing, but it needs development if it is to be a mitigating factor in their budding romance's inappropriateness. There's also a bit of an insta-love feel to Sumire falling for him, made more prominent by the fact that she's more than ready for romance, as we see from her conversations with her best friend Rio. That does make him feel a bit more like ""convenient love"" than ""true love,"" although his attachment to her from the past does indicate that such will not always be the case. It's a contrived situation all around, but there's still enough here to make this worth following, especially if you've enjoyed Mikimoto's work before, and her ugly-cute art style with its chibis looks much better here than in previous series. (Although we won't talk about some of the questionable outfits that appear in the party chapters.) It's an age-gap romance with a different hook, and by volume two, that hook is baited well enough that it'll be hard to resist volume three.             Grade:      Overall : B Story : B+ Art : B-  + Reo's reservations about Sumire balance out her insta-love, volume two is stronger overall. New character in volume two is fun. − Romance feels pretty abrupt, art isn't great at perspective.

Boy, uh… pretty big announcement this weekend, huh? But before we get into that, I want to touch on something very briefly: there's some controversy going down among fans of the Touhou Project about recent requests to remove downloads of the original games in the series. I definitely want to write more about this in the very near future, but as I'm an extremely casual Touhou fan, I feel like I need to do a bit more research into the situation before I write a lengthy screed about preservation, piracy, creators’ wishes, and so forth. Just so you all are aware that I know things are happening in that particular corner of otakudom. We'll get to it. But right now, let's discuss this weekend's massive reveal. LET'S TALK ABOUT KINGDOM HEARTS There was a Kingdom Hearts 20th anniversary event over the weekend, and shit got real. On many different levels.   You have likely seen the announcement trailer for Kingdom Hearts IV by now, but here it is again in case you missed it, and boy is it over a curveball. I don't think anyone anticipated that our first glimpse of a new numbered Kingdom Hearts would be set in the Uncanny Valley with a photorealistic-ish Sora in a place that looks a lot like Shibuya. (Tetsuya Nomura sure loves Shibuya, doesn't he?) Though it might look like Earth, it's actually a place called the Quadratum. Meanwhile, Donald and Goofy are stuck back in the main Kingdom Hearts universe, wondering what the heck they're going to do with Sora gone. This sets up a new story for the series, which the trailer calls the “Lost Master Arc.” Of course, one thing everybody knows about Kingdom Hearts is that its story is hilariously convoluted, to the point that speculating about what's going on in Kingdom Hearts is as important to being a Kingdom Hearts fan as actually playing the games. And to get everything about the plot, you have to play all the games and their DLC. Seriously. Not only is the girl in the trailer, Strelitzia, from the mobile game Kingdom Hearts Union Cross, but the whole concept of Quadratum was revealed in Melody of Memory and expanded upon in the Kingdom Hearts 3 Re:Mind DLC that builds on upon an in-universe video game called Verum Rex that's based on Tetsuya Nomura's original design concepts for Final Fantasy Versus XIII. Did you get all that? So, as expected, fans dissected the trailer within minutes, crafting all kinds of theories about where Kingdom Hearts IV is headed (and also figuring out where Sora's apartment in Shibuya is located). You should have no problem finding articles and video essays about Kingdom Hearts IV predictions if you search, but perhaps the most interesting idea is that the new, real-world-ish setting of Quadratum might be a way to introduce more “realistic” (heavy airquotes) Disney-owned properties into the series, such as Star Wars and Marvel Comics. There's already heavy speculation about the forest seen in the trailer being the wooded Endor from Star Wars, and Marvel… well, Square Enix has already made a few Marvel games, haven't they? Don't expect Kingdom Hearts IV anytime soon, though: it's been made pretty clear that it's very early in development, and we'll be waiting a while for the next batch of information about it. Hopefully it doesn't fester in the years-long development hell Kingdom Hearts III got trapped in. (Though, given some of the overt references to concepts of the afterlife in the trailer, maybe development hell would be thematically appropriate!) But wait, remember what I said about needing to play everything Kingdom Hearts related in order to get the full picture of what's going on in the story? Well, add another mobile game to that list. Here's Kingdom Hearts Missing-Link.   I can't deny that, from a visual standpoint, this game looks great. Gameplay-wise… it's too early to say, though I have no doubt that the ugly spectre of gacha-gaming will no doubt reemerge here to siphon your money one roll at a time. But at least it looks good, right? HOLY MOLY, WITCH ON THE HOLY NIGHT IS COMING IN ENGLISH The big problem with being a Type-Moon fan outside of Japan is that while many derivative works – stuff like Melty Blood, Fate/Extella, and the juggernaut that is Fate/Grand Order – get localized and released, the visual novels and writings that have established the foundations of the Type-Moon universe have remained untranslated outside of assorted fan efforts. I assumed the Tsukihime remake would be a prime opportunity to correct this issue, but as of yet, we have heard nothing regarding a potential localization despite its closely associated fighting game spinoff Melty Blood Type Lumina getting a worldwide simu-release. However, a surprise announcement from earlier this week has reinvigorated hope that we might see more important Type-Moon works in English in the future. Not only was a remaster of the visual novel Mahou Tsukai no Yoru announced for Switch and PS4, but it will also be launching with options to play in English and Simplified/Traditional Chinese. That's kind of a big deal!  The official English title is Witch on the Holy Night, and it's due out later this year with Aniplex handling the publishing. Witch on the Holy Night is one of Type-Moon universe creator Kinoko Nasu's earliest works – he originally drafted it back in 1996, and many of the ideas and characters established in it would be built upon in subsequent works like Tsukihime. It could well be considered the foundational work for everything Type-Moon would create afterwards. So yes, we're finally getting a crucial piece of Nasu's history as a world-builder/storyteller and Type-Moon's history as a creative firm in English. That's great! I have a suspicion that this might be something of a litmus test – depending on response to Witch on the Holy Night, more localizations of Type-Moon visual novels (like the aforementioned Tsukihime) might be in the cards. So if that's something you want to see, I would not hesitate to grab this when it launches. Also, while we're talking about Type-Moon stuff, Melty Blood Type Lumina's getting some more DLC characters: Powered Ciel and Mario Gallo Bestino. They're available today and they're free, so go get ‘em!     GRIMGRIMOIRE ONCE AGAIN MAKES A SURPRISE APPEARANCE Hey, have you played 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim? It's out on Switch this week, and it's fantastic. It's probably developer Vanillaware's best game to date, their crowning achievement after years and years of releasing nothing but bangers like Odin Sphere, Muramasa the Demon Blade, and Dragon's Crown. But there's a particular Vanillaware game that often gets forgotten when you look over their history as an independent developer: GrimGrimoire, a 2D realtime strategy game that the then-fledgling company made to stay afloat while they were prepping Odin Sphere for release. GrimGrimoire didn't get quite the same marketing push from publisher NIS that Odin Sphere did under Atlus (and later Muramasa under Marvelous), so it's remained as an odd little footnote in Vanillaware's history compared to their more commercially successful titles. But with their profile more visible than ever thanks to 13 Sentinels’ mega-success and the market for remasters booming, Vanillaware and NIS got together again and said, “Hey, how about revisiting GrimGrimoire?”   GrimGrimoire OnceAgain will be releasing for PS4 and Switch on July 28th in Japan. I think it's safe to assume that a localization is in the cards, considering NIS America's sitting on a finished English script for the original and interest in Vanillaware's works is at a peak. You'll be getting the usual round of enhancements we expect from a remaster: improved visuals, gameplay/UX tweaks, more voice acting, and difficulty adjustments. But most importantly, you get to play a really neat (and really pretty) fantasy-themed take on the RTS genre on modern platforms. I'm certainly happy about it! NEWSBITS   Koumajou Remilia: Scarlet Symphony, the heavily Castlevania-inspired Touhou fangame, will be making its way to Switch and PC on July 28th. It'll support several languages out of the box, including English, and it looks and plays wonderfully. Even if you're not a Touhou fanatic, this is one worth checking out if you like Metroidvanias.  On the otome-game front, Taisho x Alice all in one is available… right now! Yes, a surprise drop on the Switch eShop! This fairytale-inspired romance has had… well, let's just say a difficult history of English releases, so hopefully this compilation of all of the series’ episodes winds up being the definitive edition.    Capcom Arcade 2nd Stadium has been announced as an expansion for the Capcom Arcade Stadium. No word on which games are included yet beyond Son Son and Three Wonders (which is also included as a preorder bonus for Capcom Fighting Collection), but 32 more titles in total are being promised. I'm hoping to see some of Capcom's 3D efforts like Strider II and Tech Romancer.   Capcom Arcade 2nd Stadium is bringing another 32 arcade classics to Switch, PS4, XB1, and PC!SonSon will be a free download with this collection, and pre-orders / early purchases of Capcom Fighting Collection will also get Three Wonders as a bonus at launch.More info soon! pic.twitter.com/mbvrpwr7LB— Capcom USA (@CapcomUSA_) April 11, 2022     So, here's where I do my parting spiel about posting in the ANN forums. We had a fun time last week sharing our secret gaming shames. With this week's news being dominated by Kingdom Hearts, I'd love to hear all of your thoughts and theories about what we've seen of KH4 so far. Maybe you've got a really obscure piece of favorite Disney media you want to see this time around – Flight of the Navigator deserves its time in the spotlight, says I! The forums are linked below, so don't be shy – come hang out! As for me, I'm going to play Gotta Protectors all weekend before I head northeast to visit my family for a bit.

Boy, uh… pretty big announcement this weekend, huh? But before we get into that, I want to touch on something very briefly: there's some controversy going down among fans of the Touhou Project about recent requests to remove downloads of the original games in the series. I definitely want to write more about this in the very near future, but as I'm an extremely casual Touhou fan, I feel like I need to do a bit more research into the situation before I write a lengthy screed about preservation, piracy, creators’ wishes, and so forth. Just so you all are aware that I know things are happening in that particular corner of otakudom. We'll get to it. But right now, let's discuss this weekend's massive reveal. LET'S TALK ABOUT KINGDOM HEARTS There was a Kingdom Hearts 20th anniversary event over the weekend, and shit got real. On many different levels.   You have likely seen the announcement trailer for Kingdom Hearts IV by now, but here it is again in case you missed it, and boy is it over a curveball. I don't think anyone anticipated that our first glimpse of a new numbered Kingdom Hearts would be set in the Uncanny Valley with a photorealistic-ish Sora in a place that looks a lot like Shibuya. (Tetsuya Nomura sure loves Shibuya, doesn't he?) Though it might look like Earth, it's actually a place called the Quadratum. Meanwhile, Donald and Goofy are stuck back in the main Kingdom Hearts universe, wondering what the heck they're going to do with Sora gone. This sets up a new story for the series, which the trailer calls the “Lost Master Arc.” Of course, one thing everybody knows about Kingdom Hearts is that its story is hilariously convoluted, to the point that speculating about what's going on in Kingdom Hearts is as important to being a Kingdom Hearts fan as actually playing the games. And to get everything about the plot, you have to play all the games and their DLC. Seriously. Not only is the girl in the trailer, Strelitzia, from the mobile game Kingdom Hearts Union Cross, but the whole concept of Quadratum was revealed in Melody of Memory and expanded upon in the Kingdom Hearts 3 Re:Mind DLC that builds on upon an in-universe video game called Verum Rex that's based on Tetsuya Nomura's original design concepts for Final Fantasy Versus XIII. Did you get all that? So, as expected, fans dissected the trailer within minutes, crafting all kinds of theories about where Kingdom Hearts IV is headed (and also figuring out where Sora's apartment in Shibuya is located). You should have no problem finding articles and video essays about Kingdom Hearts IV predictions if you search, but perhaps the most interesting idea is that the new, real-world-ish setting of Quadratum might be a way to introduce more “realistic” (heavy airquotes) Disney-owned properties into the series, such as Star Wars and Marvel Comics. There's already heavy speculation about the forest seen in the trailer being the wooded Endor from Star Wars, and Marvel… well, Square Enix has already made a few Marvel games, haven't they? Don't expect Kingdom Hearts IV anytime soon, though: it's been made pretty clear that it's very early in development, and we'll be waiting a while for the next batch of information about it. Hopefully it doesn't fester in the years-long development hell Kingdom Hearts III got trapped in. (Though, given some of the overt references to concepts of the afterlife in the trailer, maybe development hell would be thematically appropriate!) But wait, remember what I said about needing to play everything Kingdom Hearts related in order to get the full picture of what's going on in the story? Well, add another mobile game to that list. Here's Kingdom Hearts Missing-Link.   I can't deny that, from a visual standpoint, this game looks great. Gameplay-wise… it's too early to say, though I have no doubt that the ugly spectre of gacha-gaming will no doubt reemerge here to siphon your money one roll at a time. But at least it looks good, right? HOLY MOLY, WITCH ON THE HOLY NIGHT IS COMING IN ENGLISH The big problem with being a Type-Moon fan outside of Japan is that while many derivative works – stuff like Melty Blood, Fate/Extella, and the juggernaut that is Fate/Grand Order – get localized and released, the visual novels and writings that have established the foundations of the Type-Moon universe have remained untranslated outside of assorted fan efforts. I assumed the Tsukihime remake would be a prime opportunity to correct this issue, but as of yet, we have heard nothing regarding a potential localization despite its closely associated fighting game spinoff Melty Blood Type Lumina getting a worldwide simu-release. However, a surprise announcement from earlier this week has reinvigorated hope that we might see more important Type-Moon works in English in the future. Not only was a remaster of the visual novel Mahou Tsukai no Yoru announced for Switch and PS4, but it will also be launching with options to play in English and Simplified/Traditional Chinese. That's kind of a big deal!  The official English title is Witch on the Holy Night, and it's due out later this year with Aniplex handling the publishing. Witch on the Holy Night is one of Type-Moon universe creator Kinoko Nasu's earliest works – he originally drafted it back in 1996, and many of the ideas and characters established in it would be built upon in subsequent works like Tsukihime. It could well be considered the foundational work for everything Type-Moon would create afterwards. So yes, we're finally getting a crucial piece of Nasu's history as a world-builder/storyteller and Type-Moon's history as a creative firm in English. That's great! I have a suspicion that this might be something of a litmus test – depending on response to Witch on the Holy Night, more localizations of Type-Moon visual novels (like the aforementioned Tsukihime) might be in the cards. So if that's something you want to see, I would not hesitate to grab this when it launches. Also, while we're talking about Type-Moon stuff, Melty Blood Type Lumina's getting some more DLC characters: Powered Ciel and Mario Gallo Bestino. They're available today and they're free, so go get ‘em!     GRIMGRIMOIRE ONCE AGAIN MAKES A SURPRISE APPEARANCE Hey, have you played 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim? It's out on Switch this week, and it's fantastic. It's probably developer Vanillaware's best game to date, their crowning achievement after years and years of releasing nothing but bangers like Odin Sphere, Muramasa the Demon Blade, and Dragon's Crown. But there's a particular Vanillaware game that often gets forgotten when you look over their history as an independent developer: GrimGrimoire, a 2D realtime strategy game that the then-fledgling company made to stay afloat while they were prepping Odin Sphere for release. GrimGrimoire didn't get quite the same marketing push from publisher NIS that Odin Sphere did under Atlus (and later Muramasa under Marvelous), so it's remained as an odd little footnote in Vanillaware's history compared to their more commercially successful titles. But with their profile more visible than ever thanks to 13 Sentinels’ mega-success and the market for remasters booming, Vanillaware and NIS got together again and said, “Hey, how about revisiting GrimGrimoire?”   GrimGrimoire OnceAgain will be releasing for PS4 and Switch on July 28th in Japan. I think it's safe to assume that a localization is in the cards, considering NIS America's sitting on a finished English script for the original and interest in Vanillaware's works is at a peak. You'll be getting the usual round of enhancements we expect from a remaster: improved visuals, gameplay/UX tweaks, more voice acting, and difficulty adjustments. But most importantly, you get to play a really neat (and really pretty) fantasy-themed take on the RTS genre on modern platforms. I'm certainly happy about it! NEWSBITS   Koumajou Remilia: Scarlet Symphony, the heavily Castlevania-inspired Touhou fangame, will be making its way to Switch and PC on July 28th. It'll support several languages out of the box, including English, and it looks and plays wonderfully. Even if you're not a Touhou fanatic, this is one worth checking out if you like Metroidvanias.  On the otome-game front, Taisho x Alice all in one is available… right now! Yes, a surprise drop on the Switch eShop! This fairytale-inspired romance has had… well, let's just say a difficult history of English releases, so hopefully this compilation of all of the series’ episodes winds up being the definitive edition.    Capcom Arcade 2nd Stadium has been announced as an expansion for the Capcom Arcade Stadium. No word on which games are included yet beyond Son Son and Three Wonders (which is also included as a preorder bonus for Capcom Fighting Collection), but 32 more titles in total are being promised. I'm hoping to see some of Capcom's 3D efforts like Strider II and Tech Romancer.   Capcom Arcade 2nd Stadium is bringing another 32 arcade classics to Switch, PS4, XB1, and PC!SonSon will be a free download with this collection, and pre-orders / early purchases of Capcom Fighting Collection will also get Three Wonders as a bonus at launch.More info soon! pic.twitter.com/mbvrpwr7LB— Capcom USA (@CapcomUSA_) April 11, 2022     So, here's where I do my parting spiel about posting in the ANN forums. We had a fun time last week sharing our secret gaming shames. With this week's news being dominated by Kingdom Hearts, I'd love to hear all of your thoughts and theories about what we've seen of KH4 so far. Maybe you've got a really obscure piece of favorite Disney media you want to see this time around – Flight of the Navigator deserves its time in the spotlight, says I! The forums are linked below, so don't be shy – come hang out! As for me, I'm going to play Gotta Protectors all weekend before I head northeast to visit my family for a bit.

Boy, uh… pretty big announcement this weekend, huh? But before we get into that, I want to touch on something very briefly: there's some controversy going down among fans of the Touhou Project about recent requests to remove downloads of the original games in the series. I definitely want to write more about this in the very near future, but as I'm an extremely casual Touhou fan, I feel like I need to do a bit more research into the situation before I write a lengthy screed about preservation, piracy, creators’ wishes, and so forth. Just so you all are aware that I know things are happening in that particular corner of otakudom. We'll get to it. But right now, let's discuss this weekend's massive reveal. LET'S TALK ABOUT KINGDOM HEARTS There was a Kingdom Hearts 20th anniversary event over the weekend, and shit got real. On many different levels.   You have likely seen the announcement trailer for Kingdom Hearts IV by now, but here it is again in case you missed it, and boy is it over a curveball. I don't think anyone anticipated that our first glimpse of a new numbered Kingdom Hearts would be set in the Uncanny Valley with a photorealistic-ish Sora in a place that looks a lot like Shibuya. (Tetsuya Nomura sure loves Shibuya, doesn't he?) Though it might look like Earth, it's actually a place called the Quadratum. Meanwhile, Donald and Goofy are stuck back in the main Kingdom Hearts universe, wondering what the heck they're going to do with Sora gone. This sets up a new story for the series, which the trailer calls the “Lost Master Arc.” Of course, one thing everybody knows about Kingdom Hearts is that its story is hilariously convoluted, to the point that speculating about what's going on in Kingdom Hearts is as important to being a Kingdom Hearts fan as actually playing the games. And to get everything about the plot, you have to play all the games and their DLC. Seriously. Not only is the girl in the trailer, Strelitzia, from the mobile game Kingdom Hearts Union Cross, but the whole concept of Quadratum was revealed in Melody of Memory and expanded upon in the Kingdom Hearts 3 Re:Mind DLC that builds on upon an in-universe video game called Verum Rex that's based on Tetsuya Nomura's original design concepts for Final Fantasy Versus XIII. Did you get all that? So, as expected, fans dissected the trailer within minutes, crafting all kinds of theories about where Kingdom Hearts IV is headed (and also figuring out where Sora's apartment in Shibuya is located). You should have no problem finding articles and video essays about Kingdom Hearts IV predictions if you search, but perhaps the most interesting idea is that the new, real-world-ish setting of Quadratum might be a way to introduce more “realistic” (heavy airquotes) Disney-owned properties into the series, such as Star Wars and Marvel Comics. There's already heavy speculation about the forest seen in the trailer being the wooded Endor from Star Wars, and Marvel… well, Square Enix has already made a few Marvel games, haven't they? Don't expect Kingdom Hearts IV anytime soon, though: it's been made pretty clear that it's very early in development, and we'll be waiting a while for the next batch of information about it. Hopefully it doesn't fester in the years-long development hell Kingdom Hearts III got trapped in. (Though, given some of the overt references to concepts of the afterlife in the trailer, maybe development hell would be thematically appropriate!) But wait, remember what I said about needing to play everything Kingdom Hearts related in order to get the full picture of what's going on in the story? Well, add another mobile game to that list. Here's Kingdom Hearts Missing-Link.   I can't deny that, from a visual standpoint, this game looks great. Gameplay-wise… it's too early to say, though I have no doubt that the ugly spectre of gacha-gaming will no doubt reemerge here to siphon your money one roll at a time. But at least it looks good, right? HOLY MOLY, WITCH ON THE HOLY NIGHT IS COMING IN ENGLISH The big problem with being a Type-Moon fan outside of Japan is that while many derivative works – stuff like Melty Blood, Fate/Extella, and the juggernaut that is Fate/Grand Order – get localized and released, the visual novels and writings that have established the foundations of the Type-Moon universe have remained untranslated outside of assorted fan efforts. I assumed the Tsukihime remake would be a prime opportunity to correct this issue, but as of yet, we have heard nothing regarding a potential localization despite its closely associated fighting game spinoff Melty Blood Type Lumina getting a worldwide simu-release. However, a surprise announcement from earlier this week has reinvigorated hope that we might see more important Type-Moon works in English in the future. Not only was a remaster of the visual novel Mahou Tsukai no Yoru announced for Switch and PS4, but it will also be launching with options to play in English and Simplified/Traditional Chinese. That's kind of a big deal!  The official English title is Witch on the Holy Night, and it's due out later this year with Aniplex handling the publishing. Witch on the Holy Night is one of Type-Moon universe creator Kinoko Nasu's earliest works – he originally drafted it back in 1996, and many of the ideas and characters established in it would be built upon in subsequent works like Tsukihime. It could well be considered the foundational work for everything Type-Moon would create afterwards. So yes, we're finally getting a crucial piece of Nasu's history as a world-builder/storyteller and Type-Moon's history as a creative firm in English. That's great! I have a suspicion that this might be something of a litmus test – depending on response to Witch on the Holy Night, more localizations of Type-Moon visual novels (like the aforementioned Tsukihime) might be in the cards. So if that's something you want to see, I would not hesitate to grab this when it launches. Also, while we're talking about Type-Moon stuff, Melty Blood Type Lumina's getting some more DLC characters: Powered Ciel and Mario Gallo Bestino. They're available today and they're free, so go get ‘em!     GRIMGRIMOIRE ONCE AGAIN MAKES A SURPRISE APPEARANCE Hey, have you played 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim? It's out on Switch this week, and it's fantastic. It's probably developer Vanillaware's best game to date, their crowning achievement after years and years of releasing nothing but bangers like Odin Sphere, Muramasa the Demon Blade, and Dragon's Crown. But there's a particular Vanillaware game that often gets forgotten when you look over their history as an independent developer: GrimGrimoire, a 2D realtime strategy game that the then-fledgling company made to stay afloat while they were prepping Odin Sphere for release. GrimGrimoire didn't get quite the same marketing push from publisher NIS that Odin Sphere did under Atlus (and later Muramasa under Marvelous), so it's remained as an odd little footnote in Vanillaware's history compared to their more commercially successful titles. But with their profile more visible than ever thanks to 13 Sentinels’ mega-success and the market for remasters booming, Vanillaware and NIS got together again and said, “Hey, how about revisiting GrimGrimoire?”   GrimGrimoire OnceAgain will be releasing for PS4 and Switch on July 28th in Japan. I think it's safe to assume that a localization is in the cards, considering NIS America's sitting on a finished English script for the original and interest in Vanillaware's works is at a peak. You'll be getting the usual round of enhancements we expect from a remaster: improved visuals, gameplay/UX tweaks, more voice acting, and difficulty adjustments. But most importantly, you get to play a really neat (and really pretty) fantasy-themed take on the RTS genre on modern platforms. I'm certainly happy about it! NEWSBITS   Koumajou Remilia: Scarlet Symphony, the heavily Castlevania-inspired Touhou fangame, will be making its way to Switch and PC on July 28th. It'll support several languages out of the box, including English, and it looks and plays wonderfully. Even if you're not a Touhou fanatic, this is one worth checking out if you like Metroidvanias.  On the otome-game front, Taisho x Alice all in one is available… right now! Yes, a surprise drop on the Switch eShop! This fairytale-inspired romance has had… well, let's just say a difficult history of English releases, so hopefully this compilation of all of the series’ episodes winds up being the definitive edition.    Capcom Arcade 2nd Stadium has been announced as an expansion for the Capcom Arcade Stadium. No word on which games are included yet beyond Son Son and Three Wonders (which is also included as a preorder bonus for Capcom Fighting Collection), but 32 more titles in total are being promised. I'm hoping to see some of Capcom's 3D efforts like Strider II and Tech Romancer.   Capcom Arcade 2nd Stadium is bringing another 32 arcade classics to Switch, PS4, XB1, and PC!SonSon will be a free download with this collection, and pre-orders / early purchases of Capcom Fighting Collection will also get Three Wonders as a bonus at launch.More info soon! pic.twitter.com/mbvrpwr7LB— Capcom USA (@CapcomUSA_) April 11, 2022     So, here's where I do my parting spiel about posting in the ANN forums. We had a fun time last week sharing our secret gaming shames. With this week's news being dominated by Kingdom Hearts, I'd love to hear all of your thoughts and theories about what we've seen of KH4 so far. Maybe you've got a really obscure piece of favorite Disney media you want to see this time around – Flight of the Navigator deserves its time in the spotlight, says I!

Gameplay-wise… it's too early to say, though I have no doubt that the ugly spectre of gacha-gaming will no doubt reemerge here to siphon your money one roll at a time. But at least it looks good, right? HOLY MOLY, WITCH ON THE HOLY NIGHT IS COMING IN ENGLISH The big problem with being a Type-Moon fan outside of Japan is that while many derivative works – stuff like Melty Blood, Fate/Extella, and the juggernaut that is Fate/Grand Order – get localized and released, the visual novels and writings that have established the foundations of the Type-Moon universe have remained untranslated outside of assorted fan efforts. I assumed the Tsukihime remake would be a prime opportunity to correct this issue, but as of yet, we have heard nothing regarding a potential localization despite its closely associated fighting game spinoff Melty Blood Type Lumina getting a worldwide simu-release. However, a surprise announcement from earlier this week has reinvigorated hope that we might see more important Type-Moon works in English in the future. Not only was a remaster of the visual novel Mahou Tsukai no Yoru announced for Switch and PS4, but it will also be launching with options to play in English and Simplified/Traditional Chinese. That's kind of a big deal!  The official English title is Witch on the Holy Night, and it's due out later this year with Aniplex handling the publishing. Witch on the Holy Night is one of Type-Moon universe creator Kinoko Nasu's earliest works – he originally drafted it back in 1996, and many of the ideas and characters established in it would be built upon in subsequent works like Tsukihime. It could well be considered the foundational work for everything Type-Moon would create afterwards. So yes, we're finally getting a crucial piece of Nasu's history as a world-builder/storyteller and Type-Moon's history as a creative firm in English. That's great! I have a suspicion that this might be something of a litmus test – depending on response to Witch on the Holy Night, more localizations of Type-Moon visual novels (like the aforementioned Tsukihime) might be in the cards. So if that's something you want to see, I would not hesitate to grab this when it launches. Also, while we're talking about Type-Moon stuff, Melty Blood Type Lumina's getting some more DLC characters: Powered Ciel and Mario Gallo Bestino. They're available today and they're free, so go get ‘em!     GRIMGRIMOIRE ONCE AGAIN MAKES A SURPRISE APPEARANCE Hey, have you played 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim? It's out on Switch this week, and it's fantastic. It's probably developer Vanillaware's best game to date, their crowning achievement after years and years of releasing nothing but bangers like Odin Sphere, Muramasa the Demon Blade, and Dragon's Crown. But there's a particular Vanillaware game that often gets forgotten when you look over their history as an independent developer: GrimGrimoire, a 2D realtime strategy game that the then-fledgling company made to stay afloat while they were prepping Odin Sphere for release. GrimGrimoire didn't get quite the same marketing push from publisher NIS that Odin Sphere did under Atlus (and later Muramasa under Marvelous), so it's remained as an odd little footnote in Vanillaware's history compared to their more commercially successful titles. But with their profile more visible than ever thanks to 13 Sentinels’ mega-success and the market for remasters booming, Vanillaware and NIS got together again and said, “Hey, how about revisiting GrimGrimoire?”   GrimGrimoire OnceAgain will be releasing for PS4 and Switch on July 28th in Japan. I think it's safe to assume that a localization is in the cards, considering NIS America's sitting on a finished English script for the original and interest in Vanillaware's works is at a peak. You'll be getting the usual round of enhancements we expect from a remaster: improved visuals, gameplay/UX tweaks, more voice acting, and difficulty adjustments. But most importantly, you get to play a really neat (and really pretty) fantasy-themed take on the RTS genre on modern platforms. I'm certainly happy about it! NEWSBITS   Koumajou Remilia: Scarlet Symphony, the heavily Castlevania-inspired Touhou fangame, will be making its way to Switch and PC on July 28th. It'll support several languages out of the box, including English, and it looks and plays wonderfully. Even if you're not a Touhou fanatic, this is one worth checking out if you like Metroidvanias.  On the otome-game front, Taisho x Alice all in one is available… right now! Yes, a surprise drop on the Switch eShop! This fairytale-inspired romance has had… well, let's just say a difficult history of English releases, so hopefully this compilation of all of the series’ episodes winds up being the definitive edition.    Capcom Arcade 2nd Stadium has been announced as an expansion for the Capcom Arcade Stadium. No word on which games are included yet beyond Son Son and Three Wonders (which is also included as a preorder bonus for Capcom Fighting Collection), but 32 more titles in total are being promised. I'm hoping to see some of Capcom's 3D efforts like Strider II and Tech Romancer.   Capcom Arcade 2nd Stadium is bringing another 32 arcade classics to Switch, PS4, XB1, and PC!SonSon will be a free download with this collection, and pre-orders / early purchases of Capcom Fighting Collection will also get Three Wonders as a bonus at launch.More info soon! pic.twitter.com/mbvrpwr7LB— Capcom USA (@CapcomUSA_) April 11, 2022     So, here's where I do my parting spiel about posting in the ANN forums. We had a fun time last week sharing our secret gaming shames. With this week's news being dominated by Kingdom Hearts, I'd love to hear all of your thoughts and theories about what we've seen of KH4 so far. Maybe you've got a really obscure piece of favorite Disney media you want to see this time around – Flight of the Navigator deserves its time in the spotlight, says I!

Love of Kill Episode 12  by MrAJCosplay/Cartoon Cipher, Apr  3rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Love of Kill ?                     Community score: 3.6            Given the sheer amount of weight this final episode needed to carry, I must admit I'm a little bit conflicted. I kinda knew going in that there was no way this episode was going to tie up the present-day plot thread of the mob boss going after everybody. If anything, it just kinda hammers home how unimportant it is both to the present-day narrative and what goes on in the flashbacks. Looking back on the season as a whole, I definitely think that the material that is adapted shouldn't have taken up as many episodes as it did. While I will admit that the final revelations for everything in the past are mostly satisfying, it wasn't worth the incredibly slow, drawn-out pace that it took to get here. It genuinely feels like the writer of the season started with the decision to end the season with said revelations and then worked backwards to try to fill in the rest of the series. I don't know if this is all handled differently in the source material but that final shot of Château and Ryang-ha squaring off against this organization didn't exactly make me excited for future installments. At the same time, however, I did walk away with some sense of dramatic and emotional pay off.    This whole time I was led to believe that Ryang-ha was only interested in Chateau for more plot-driven reasons. When he says that he's happy the events of his past weren't just a dream, I was caught off guard by its surprising emotional impact. Château was traumatized by her past and completely forgot about it for the sake of her own sense of mental and emotional stability. So it also makes sense that years later growing up, she would start to feel the weight of what she did as a child to someone who was just trying to help her. The show is still very vague on what exactly the original Ryang-ha's mission was, so it's hard to see if he was always tasked with getting her to safety or if she was meant to be delivered to somebody else.    Again the show's plotting isn't necessarily the best, and as mentioned, I think cutting out some of the bloat in the previous episodes could've allowed the show to better flesh out the good elements that were actually here. The show manages to convey the emotions that Château and Ryang-ha felt for the original Ryang-ha, but I just wish I knew him more as a character. Ultimately, he definitely comes across as a naïve albeit kind-hearted kid that was just trying to help people regardless of whether or not he knew what Donny had planned for him all along. There is a sense of tragedy and sadness in him doing everything he can but alas, the show wasn't really about this boy. It has always been more interested in the current Ryang-ha and Château, and I think the reason why I feel so emotionally invested towards things in the end is because of what they're feeling, rather than the narrative putting me in a similar headspace to their emotional investment. A part of me does want to go back and rewatch the show now that I have this added context for why Ryang-ha was doing the things that he did, although I might also pick apart some of the really REALLY strong narrative conveniences that made them meet in the first place. I think the show excelled as a mystery and as a callback to that classic noir, “being in love with danger” aesthetic that we don't really see a lot of these days. I can see all of the building blocks to a successful thriller here but unfortunately, the show holds itself back from successfully landing the kill.

Love of Kill Episode 12  by MrAJCosplay/Cartoon Cipher, Apr  3rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Love of Kill ?                     Community score: 3.6            Given the sheer amount of weight this final episode needed to carry, I must admit I'm a little bit conflicted. I kinda knew going in that there was no way this episode was going to tie up the present-day plot thread of the mob boss going after everybody. If anything, it just kinda hammers home how unimportant it is both to the present-day narrative and what goes on in the flashbacks. Looking back on the season as a whole, I definitely think that the material that is adapted shouldn't have taken up as many episodes as it did. While I will admit that the final revelations for everything in the past are mostly satisfying, it wasn't worth the incredibly slow, drawn-out pace that it took to get here. It genuinely feels like the writer of the season started with the decision to end the season with said revelations and then worked backwards to try to fill in the rest of the series. I don't know if this is all handled differently in the source material but that final shot of Château and Ryang-ha squaring off against this organization didn't exactly make me excited for future installments. At the same time, however, I did walk away with some sense of dramatic and emotional pay off.    This whole time I was led to believe that Ryang-ha was only interested in Chateau for more plot-driven reasons. When he says that he's happy the events of his past weren't just a dream, I was caught off guard by its surprising emotional impact. Château was traumatized by her past and completely forgot about it for the sake of her own sense of mental and emotional stability. So it also makes sense that years later growing up, she would start to feel the weight of what she did as a child to someone who was just trying to help her. The show is still very vague on what exactly the original Ryang-ha's mission was, so it's hard to see if he was always tasked with getting her to safety or if she was meant to be delivered to somebody else.    Again the show's plotting isn't necessarily the best, and as mentioned, I think cutting out some of the bloat in the previous episodes could've allowed the show to better flesh out the good elements that were actually here. The show manages to convey the emotions that Château and Ryang-ha felt for the original Ryang-ha, but I just wish I knew him more as a character. Ultimately, he definitely comes across as a naïve albeit kind-hearted kid that was just trying to help people regardless of whether or not he knew what Donny had planned for him all along. There is a sense of tragedy and sadness in him doing everything he can but alas, the show wasn't really about this boy. It has always been more interested in the current Ryang-ha and Château, and I think the reason why I feel so emotionally invested towards things in the end is because of what they're feeling, rather than the narrative putting me in a similar headspace to their emotional investment. A part of me does want to go back and rewatch the show now that I have this added context for why Ryang-ha was doing the things that he did, although I might also pick apart some of the really REALLY strong narrative conveniences that made them meet in the first place. I think the show excelled as a mystery and as a callback to that classic noir, “being in love with danger” aesthetic that we don't really see a lot of these days. I can see all of the building blocks to a successful thriller here but unfortunately, the show holds itself back from successfully landing the kill.

It genuinely feels like the writer of the season started with the decision to end the season with said revelations and then worked backwards to try to fill in the rest of the series. I don't know if this is all handled differently in the source material but that final shot of Château and Ryang-ha squaring off against this organization didn't exactly make me excited for future installments. At the same time, however, I did walk away with some sense of dramatic and emotional pay off.    This whole time I was led to believe that Ryang-ha was only interested in Chateau for more plot-driven reasons. When he says that he's happy the events of his past weren't just a dream, I was caught off guard by its surprising emotional impact. Château was traumatized by her past and completely forgot about it for the sake of her own sense of mental and emotional stability. So it also makes sense that years later growing up, she would start to feel the weight of what she did as a child to someone who was just trying to help her. The show is still very vague on what exactly the original Ryang-ha's mission was, so it's hard to see if he was always tasked with getting her to safety or if she was meant to be delivered to somebody else.    Again the show's plotting isn't necessarily the best, and as mentioned, I think cutting out some of the bloat in the previous episodes could've allowed the show to better flesh out the good elements that were actually here. The show manages to convey the emotions that Château and Ryang-ha felt for the original Ryang-ha, but I just wish I knew him more as a character. Ultimately, he definitely comes across as a naïve albeit kind-hearted kid that was just trying to help people regardless of whether or not he knew what Donny had planned for him all along. There is a sense of tragedy and sadness in him doing everything he can but alas, the show wasn't really about this boy. It has always been more interested in the current Ryang-ha and Château, and I think the reason why I feel so emotionally invested towards things in the end is because of what they're feeling, rather than the narrative putting me in a similar headspace to their emotional investment. A part of me does want to go back and rewatch the show now that I have this added context for why Ryang-ha was doing the things that he did, although I might also pick apart some of the really REALLY strong narrative conveniences that made them meet in the first place. I think the show excelled as a mystery and as a callback to that classic noir, “being in love with danger” aesthetic that we don't really see a lot of these days. I can see all of the building blocks to a successful thriller here but unfortunately, the show holds itself back from successfully landing the kill.

Love of Kill Episode 12  by MrAJCosplay/Cartoon Cipher, Apr  3rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Love of Kill ?                     Community score: 3.6            Given the sheer amount of weight this final episode needed to carry, I must admit I'm a little bit conflicted. I kinda knew going in that there was no way this episode was going to tie up the present-day plot thread of the mob boss going after everybody. If anything, it just kinda hammers home how unimportant it is both to the present-day narrative and what goes on in the flashbacks. Looking back on the season as a whole, I definitely think that the material that is adapted shouldn't have taken up as many episodes as it did. While I will admit that the final revelations for everything in the past are mostly satisfying, it wasn't worth the incredibly slow, drawn-out pace that it took to get here. It genuinely feels like the writer of the season started with the decision to end the season with said revelations and then worked backwards to try to fill in the rest of the series. I don't know if this is all handled differently in the source material but that final shot of Château and Ryang-ha squaring off against this organization didn't exactly make me excited for future installments. At the same time, however, I did walk away with some sense of dramatic and emotional pay off.    This whole time I was led to believe that Ryang-ha was only interested in Chateau for more plot-driven reasons. When he says that he's happy the events of his past weren't just a dream, I was caught off guard by its surprising emotional impact. Château was traumatized by her past and completely forgot about it for the sake of her own sense of mental and emotional stability. So it also makes sense that years later growing up, she would start to feel the weight of what she did as a child to someone who was just trying to help her. The show is still very vague on what exactly the original Ryang-ha's mission was, so it's hard to see if he was always tasked with getting her to safety or if she was meant to be delivered to somebody else.    Again the show's plotting isn't necessarily the best, and as mentioned, I think cutting out some of the bloat in the previous episodes could've allowed the show to better flesh out the good elements that were actually here. The show manages to convey the emotions that Château and Ryang-ha felt for the original Ryang-ha, but I just wish I knew him more as a character.

News Odd Taxi Anime Film's Clip Featuring Daimon Brothers Streamed   posted on 2022-04-14 23:00 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         Film opened on April 1    The staff for Eiga Odd Taxi: In the Woods, the film project of the original anime Odd Taxi, began streaming a clip from the film on Thursday. The clip features a conversation between Odokawa and the Daimon Brothers about Dob.       The film opened on April 1 at #10 and earned 52 million yen (approximately US$4,23,685) in its first weekend.    The television anime's main cast and staff returned. ASMIK Ace is distributing. Crunchyroll will stream the film.    The film is a ""reconstruction"" of the television anime episodes, but it also depicts what happens after the television anime's finale.    The anime premiered in Japan in April 2021 and aired for 13 episodes. Crunchyroll streamed the anime in the West.    The story follows Odokawa, an eccentric, reticent 41-year-old taxi driver who has no relatives and does not have much to do with others. He does have conversations with his customers, including a college student who wants to go viral, a nurse hiding a secret, an unsuccessful comedian, a street rough, and an up-and-coming idol. These conversations lead him to a girl who has disappeared.    Manga creator Kadzuya Konomoto (Seto Utsumi) wrote the anime. Baku Kinoshita directed the anime with Norio Nitta as the assistant director. Kinoshita and Hiromi Nakayama designed the characters. Kohei Yoshida was the recording director at Pony Canyon Enterprise. PUNPEE VaVa OMSB were in charge of the music, and Pony Canyon was in charge of music production with collaboration by Summit, Inc. P.I.C.S. and OLM produced the anime. P.I.C.S. was also credited for the original work and planning. Skirt (singer-songwriter Wataru Sawabe's solo project) and rapper/DJ PUNPEE performed the show's opening theme song ""Odd Taxi,"" and Suzuko Mimori performed the ending theme song ""Sugarless Kiss.""    Takeichi Abaraya and Konomoto launched a manga adaptation of the anime in January 2021 on Shogakukan's digital manga label Superior Dalpana.

News Odd Taxi Anime Film's Clip Featuring Daimon Brothers Streamed   posted on 2022-04-14 23:00 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         Film opened on April 1    The staff for Eiga Odd Taxi: In the Woods, the film project of the original anime Odd Taxi, began streaming a clip from the film on Thursday. The clip features a conversation between Odokawa and the Daimon Brothers about Dob.       The film opened on April 1 at #10 and earned 52 million yen (approximately US$4,23,685) in its first weekend.    The television anime's main cast and staff returned. ASMIK Ace is distributing. Crunchyroll will stream the film.    The film is a ""reconstruction"" of the television anime episodes, but it also depicts what happens after the television anime's finale.    The anime premiered in Japan in April 2021 and aired for 13 episodes. Crunchyroll streamed the anime in the West.    The story follows Odokawa, an eccentric, reticent 41-year-old taxi driver who has no relatives and does not have much to do with others. He does have conversations with his customers, including a college student who wants to go viral, a nurse hiding a secret, an unsuccessful comedian, a street rough, and an up-and-coming idol. These conversations lead him to a girl who has disappeared.    Manga creator Kadzuya Konomoto (Seto Utsumi) wrote the anime. Baku Kinoshita directed the anime with Norio Nitta as the assistant director. Kinoshita and Hiromi Nakayama designed the characters. Kohei Yoshida was the recording director at Pony Canyon Enterprise. PUNPEE VaVa OMSB were in charge of the music, and Pony Canyon was in charge of music production with collaboration by Summit, Inc. P.I.C.S. and OLM produced the anime. P.I.C.S. was also credited for the original work and planning. Skirt (singer-songwriter Wataru Sawabe's solo project) and rapper/DJ PUNPEE performed the show's opening theme song ""Odd Taxi,"" and Suzuko Mimori performed the ending theme song ""Sugarless Kiss.""    Takeichi Abaraya and Konomoto launched a manga adaptation of the anime in January 2021 on Shogakukan's digital manga label Superior Dalpana.

How an April Fools Day Joke Revived Toonami   by Kennedy, Apr  1st 2022          By 2012, April Fools Day on Adult Swim had become a fun, albeit predictable, event. The nighttime programming block had fallen into the routine of airing The Room—a legendary 2003 independent film (which has been called “the Citizen Kane of bad movies”) spearheaded by cinematic Swiss army knife Tommy Wiseau. By midnight of April 1, 2012, nobody had any reason to believe that this year would be any different. The (excruciatingly long) opening credits sequence began, and for almost 30 whole seconds everything was the way it had been in the years before—until, that is, the movie faded to black for a moment, revealing that a dark blue robot was watching the movie. “Oh hi, Adult Swim,” the robot with Steve Blum's voice said, “I got the results of the test back. I definitely have April Fools.” The robot, as many anime fans instantly recognized, was TOM: the host of a beloved anime programming block called Toonami that aired on Cartoon Network between 1997 and 2008. A brief animation played after TOM made his quip, the Toonami logo appeared on-screen, and an episode of Bleach began to play. Without any warning, Toonami was airing on television for the first time in almost four years—and anime fans across the U.S. lost their collective mind.      To understand how this happened and why it was such a big deal, we first need to rewind back to the 2000s. Originally, the anime-and-action-cartoon programming block aired on weekday afternoons, but in 2004 it got moved to Saturday nights. It's hard to understate how massive a role Toonami played in anime's burst of popularity in the West throughout the 90s by shaping tastes and making anime more accessible in its heyday. Such was its success that within a few years, even Cartoon Network started airing some anime as well (the only anime it had ever aired before the debut of Toonami was Speed Racer). Furthermore, an adult-oriented nighttime programming block on the same channel called Adult Swim started up in 2001, and an anime called Cowboy Bebop was included in its original lineup. Over the years, both Cartoon Network and Adult Swim would continue to air more anime outside of Toonami (and in fact, Adult Swim even started its own anime-centric block called Adult Swim Action in 2002, which featured some anime that had previously aired on Toonami). But even then, Toonami still felt different. It had its own host (a robot named TOM, though he reincarnated a few times), its own lore, the occasional game review, and unlike Cartoon Network and Adult Swim, anime was a foremost part of Toonami's identity—it felt lovingly tailored specifically for anime fans in a way Cartoon Network and Adult Swim never would be. Dragon Ball Z, Sailor Moon, Naruto, and Gundam Wing are only a few of the anime that found massive success airing on Toonami, and dominated Western anime fan culture for several years.    But by 2008, Toonami had become a shadow of its former self. Once four-hours-long, it spent most of the year with its time cut in half and saturated with Naruto episodes—a far cry from the gateway to discovering a variety of new anime that it once was. The kids who grew up with Toonami's biggest hits like Dragon Ball Z and Sailor Moon were now older and looking for anime that felt a little more dark or mature. And while Toonami had the extremely popular Naruto, Adult Swim had the likes of InuYasha, Bleach, Fullmetal Alchemist, and Cowboy Bebop among plenty of other immensely successful anime that fit the bill—quality and quantity. While anime was never Adult Swim's primary focus, it had nonetheless become an anime powerhouse in its own right, and seemed to take over Toonami's status as the U.S.'s largest anime tastemaker in the mid and late 2000s. Factoring in the massive recession happening on top of all this, and the only thing shocking about Cartoon Network's announcing the cancellation of Toonami at Anime Weekend Atlanta 2008 (they cited declining viewership as the reason why) was how Toonami managed to last as long as it did. The final Toonami block would air the same evening the announcement was made: September 20, 2008.    Much to the disappointment of longtime fans, Toonami didn't go out with so much as a fizzle. Its time wasn't extended, it didn't re-run any of its classic hits—nothing was out of the ordinary. It was the same two-hour block it had been for some time, half of which was spent airing Naruto (the other half was an episode of Ben 10: Alien Force, followed by an episode of Samurai Jack). If not for a clip of TOM saying goodbye at the end, then that evening's block wouldn't have felt like an ending for anything—let alone a once-great programming block that managed to stay on the air for 11 years. While saddened by it, most fans discussing the announcement online seemed to be understanding of the decision, and accepted it pretty quickly. In Memoriam-style posts and content looking back fondly on Toonami's glory days and wondering where it all went wrong (when Toonami got moved to Saturday nights probably marked the beginning of the end, many agreed) seemed to outnumber petitions to undo the cancellation and outraged posts by a landslide. Thus quietly ended Toonami.      In the years following Toonami's cancellation, any lingering conversations about it amongst fans were usually less about bringing it back, and more about being nostalgic for its late 90s/early 2000s lineups. People missed Toonami, that much was clear, but they missed a certain type of Toonami. They missed the anime-centric block that was chock-loaded with a variety of iconic hits—not the glorified Naruto block it eventually became. But with Cartoon Network airing fewer and fewer anime, the idea that Toonami would ever come back seemed less likely than ever.    Enter fellow-programming block Adult Swim in the early months of 2012.    “Usually Adult Swim has a brainstorm about what we might do for April Fools Day on any given year, where everyone throws out ideas and we see what sticks,” recalled Toonami co-creator Jason DeMarco, “Mike Lazzo tossed out “what if we just brought Toonami back for a night, just switched over and it was suddenly like you were in 1999 and watching Cartoon Network?” Everyone loved the idea immediately, and the conversation very quickly moved on to “how the heck can we pull this off?””    Considering the dilapidated state of Toonami at the time of its cancellation, it comes as little shock that—per DeMarco—there hadn't been any meaningful conversations about getting it back on the air prior to this meeting. (“Previous to the April Fools conversation we had, I swear, never ONCE talked in any serious way about bringing Toonami back. We just didn't think it was possible.”) This idea to bring Toonami back for a night must've felt as sudden and out-of-the-blue as any idea possibly could've been—but this speed bump wasn't enough to stop the April Fools Toonami revival from happening.    With only a few months to plan everything, Adult Swim's work was cut out for them. “We made a list of what we thought were the definitive Toonami shows,” said DeMarco. “Then we strategized with Kim Manning, our head of programming, how best to approach distributors to see who might be willing to give us a one time license for, like, one episode of a show. We had no idea at all if any of them would work with us on such a weird request.”    Just like the original vision for this idea, the lineup Adult Swim ultimately ended up with was one that mostly felt like it could've pulled straight out of a schedule from 1999: Bleach, Dragon Ball Z, Gundam Wing, Tenchi Muyo!, Outlaw Star, The Big O, Yu-Yu Hakusho, Blue Submarine No. 6, Trigun, Astro Boy, and ending the night with Gigantor. Bleach was a particularly interesting addition to this lineup, not only because it was the only show that came out after 2000 (with the partial exceptions of The Big O and Blue Submarine No. 6, which began in late 90s but didn't finish til after the turn of the millennium), but also because it was the only show on the lineup that was an Adult Swim show, as opposed to a Toonami show. But it was, nonetheless, part of Toonami tonight. And even though Bleach wasn't traditional Toonami fare, TOM's appearance, Steve Blum's familiar voice, and the fact that any anime was airing at all was more than enough to signal to the viewers that at least for tonight, the Toonami people missed was back.     An image that started circulating at the time  As the night went on and viewers saw how increasingly nostalgic the lineup became, the reminiscent fans couldn't help but express their excitement on social media—which, importantly, also helped to rapidly spread the word that this was happening. Searching for tweets and posts with words like “Toonami” or “Dragon Ball Z” during the night of March 31-April 1, 2012 showcases the elated thoughts of countless anime fans, intent to watch Toonami until its final moments—whatever plans they had for the upcoming morning be damned. So abundant were the tweets about it that “Toonami” (and some adjacent words/phrases like “Outlaw Star”, “Gundam Wing”, etc) quickly became one of the top trending topics on Twitter that evening. Said DeMarco about the fan reactions, “It was incredible, one of the first experiences of my life where I really saw the power of social media to create a collective experience around a particular event as it unfolds. Seeing it blow up on Twitter and watching the mentions just grow, and keep growing, was amazing. All of us were texting each other that night as the event unfolded, and we all stayed up all night having a blast reading the reactions. Just a super great experience for all of us. We came in to work the following Monday still excited and talking about how amazing the response was.”    The outpouring of love from fans was so immense that while the idea of bringing Toonami back began as a joke, it suddenly no longer felt like one to Adult Swim by that next day back at work. Thus, they tweeted that fans could let them know how badly they wanted Toonami to return permanently with the hashtag #BringBackToonami. Not only did this tweet itself garner well over 10,000 retweets (and get the hashtag trending in a matter of hours), but several voice actors and prominent entities in the anime industry even made their own posts featuring the hashtag. Fan made videos, Facebook pages, and petitions dedicated to supporting the hashtag began to appear one after the other. Nerdcore rapper Richie Branson even made a rap about it (which would later be used in an Adult Swim bumper). If it wasn't already abundantly obvious (which it was), then it was now: Now that they knew what Toonami was capable of (once again) being, and that it could air on Adult Swim rather than Cartoon Network, people wanted Toonami back for real.    After a little over a month of cheers to bring back Toonami, Adult Swim finally announced on May 16 with the hashtag  #ToonamisBackBitches that it would be back on Adult Swim (presumably indefinitely) in just a few days, the late night between May 26 and 27. The lineup, it was soon announced after a few days of speculation, would be three hours long and would then repeat itself (meaning it would be on air for a total of 6 hours) and would mostly be anime that had previously aired on Adult Swim such as Bleach and Cowboy Bebop, but also the new-to-U.S.-TV titles Casshern Sins and Deadman Wonderland (shows like Naruto and Dragon Ball Z, DeMarco tweeted, were simply too expensive).    Following the announcement, exuberant forum threads, blog posts, tweets, and videos about the hashtag's success and Toonami's confirmed revival plastered the walls of every online anime community. Richie Branson even made another rap about it to celebrate. In many ways, this marriage of Toonami and Adult Swim felt like a fitting one–they were already both on the same channel, both aired in the evening/at night, and a lot of anime fans spent their younger years in a Toonami to Adult Swim pipeline anyways. This felt perfect.     Despite all the anticipation and fanfare that led up to it, whether or not the night between May 26 and 27 was more than just moderately successful for Toonami depends on who you ask. While its revival made plenty of headlines, many fans lost interest when they saw its mostly-recycled lineup (many were hoping for a higher concentration of shows that either hadn't previously aired in the U.S. or aired in the 90s) which was largely the result of time and money constraints.    “Basically the reaction to [the April Fools] event, combined with the responses to [the Adult Swim tweet about bringing back Toonami], allowed us to come to Lazzo with a request to bring it back for real,” recalled DeMarco, “Gill and I had a plan within a week and brought him a way to do it CHEAP and FAST. And thankfully he said yes. We set a target launch date, and started sprinted towards that date immediately.""    Nonetheless, when ratings came to light a few days later, while they seemed good to many (Deadman Wonderland, for example, ranked #1 in its time slot among adults age 18-24), DeMarco would describe the Toonami revival's inaugural weekend as having gone, “OKAY. Not bad but not measurably better than the week before. We need to do better. Hopefully we will!”    Encouraged by better ratings the following week, (“We're doing well! I'm encouraged.” DeMarco tweeted about it) Toonami marched on—its impact on anime, while not as large as it once was, still tangible. A few weeks prior to its airing on Adult Swim, Deadman Wonderland was on 59,860 user's lists on MyAnimeList. A month into Toonami's revival (June 26), it went up to appearing on 66,110 lists even though it had long since finished airing in Japan (April-July 2011). Casshern Sins—which originally aired in Japan between 2008 and 2009—went from being on 26,671 user's lists on May 4, 2012, to 28,852 on June 28, 2012. These numbers neither 100% definitively prove how many people continually tuned in to this new Toonami, nor are they even particularly earth-shattering, but they do help to further illustrate the influence Toonami was having in the early days of its revival.    Despite the perilous times Adult Swim, like a lot of broadcast television, is currently trying to navigate, Toonami has remained a fixture of Adult Swim in the ten years since its revival began. It's since aired the wildly popular likes of My Hero Academia, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, One-Punch Man, The Promised Neverland, among plenty of other such anime. While it's less of the trendsetter it once was and more of a trend reaffirmer, it still feels much more like the generation-shaping Toonami people knew and loved in the 90s/early 2000s again (as opposed to the zombified state it was in throughout 2008). And Steve Blum, by the way, is still voicing TOM. Adult Swim has also since become more involved in anime than ever by way of producing a few projects (including, but not limited to, the recently announced Housing Complex C and two new seasons of FLCL).    2022 is a unique year for Toonami, as it gets to celebrate not only the 25th anniversary of its original airing, but also the 10th anniversary of its revival. “It's just amazing to me that this is the tenth year of the Adult Swim iteration of Toonami. It's very rare that a person gets to have a second chance at creative work once it's been cancelled or wrapped up by the rights holders,” reflected DeMarco, “It's something that in our case, only happened with the unique combination of fan love and network freedom that Toonami and Adult Swim have. It's been an amazing experience for all of us at Toonami, and one that never ceases to give us joy. We just hope we are giving that joy back.”    Below is the full interview that I had with DeMarco about how Toonami got brought back from the grave:    On April 1, 2012, Toonami once again aired as an April Fools Day joke, despite its 2008 cancellation. How involved were you in the process of making this happen?   Very much so. I believe it was actually Mike Lazzo's idea in one of our brainstorming meetings we had about April Fools. He brought it up as a lark, and Gill Austin and I immediately walked out of that meeting beginning to try to figure out how to pull it off with no time and no money.    What made you (and/or Adult Swim) want to bring Toonami back after its 2008 cancellation?   Well those of us who had worked on Toonami had made our peace with its cancellation. But when we were offered a small chance to bring it back we knew we had to try. It had become clear to us in the years after it was cancelled in 2008 that there were people who WANTED it back.    How (and when) did plans to bring Toonami back start?   I believe it was two and a half months before April Fools Day 2012. Usually Adult Swim has a brainstorm about what we might do for April Fools Day on any given year, where everyone throws out ideas and we see what sticks. Mike Lazzo tossed out “what if we just brought Toonami back for a night, just switched over and it was suddenly like you were in 1999 and watching Cartoon Network?” Everyone loved the idea immediately, and the conversation very quickly moved on to “how the heck can we pull this off?”    Was the plan always to bring it back via an April Fools Day joke? If not, how did that happen?   Previous to the April Fools conversation we had, I swear, never ONCE talked in any serious way about bringing Toonami back. We just didn't think it was possible.    How did the shows that aired for this get picked?   We made a list of what we thought were the definitive Toonami shows. Then we strategized with Kim Manning, our head of programming, how best to approach distributors to see who might be willing to give us a one time license for, like, one episode of a show. We had no idea at all if any of them would work with us on such a weird request.    How was the reception to the April Fools Day joke? Any particularly memorable reactions?   It was incredible, one of the first experiences of my life where I really saw the power of social media to create a collective experience around a particular event as it unfolds. Seeing it blow up on Twitter and watching the mentions just grow, and keep growing, was amazing. All of us were texting each other that night as the event unfolded, and we all stayed up all night having a blast reading the reactions. Just a super great experience for all of us. We came in to work the following Monday still excited and talking about how amazing the response was.    The call from fans to bring back Toonami after this April Fools Day joke was pretty much immediate, and the next day Adult Swim tweeted, ""Want it back? Let us know. #BringBackToonami""--did all this directly contribute to Toonami's full revival a few months later?   Very much so. Basically the reaction to the event, combined with the responses to that Tweet, allowed us to come to Lazzo with a request to bring it back for real. Gill and I had a plan within a week and brought him a way to do it CHEAP and FAST. And thankfully he said yes. We set a target launch date, and started sprinted towards that date immediately.    10 years later, and Adult Swim is more involved in anime production than ever, such as through 2 new seasons of FLCL, Housing Complex C, and Uzumaki. How important has the revival of Toonami been to all this?   It's interesting. Obviously, anime and action have been a part of Adult Swim's DNA since the network's beginning. And even without Toonami returning, it's highly likely that Adult Swim would still be airing anime. Whether or not they would air AS MUCH anime or action, and move into original productions… I don't know. I'm gonna say that would be unlikely without a weekly Toonami block.    Any other thoughts/reflections/fun facts about Toonami's 2012 April Fools Day joke?   Refection-wise, it's just amazing to me that this is the tenth year of the Adult Swim iteration of Toonami. It's very rare that a person gets to have a second chance at creative work once it's been cancelled or wrapped up by the rights holders. It's something that in our case,  only happened with the unique combination of fan love and network freedom that Toonami and Adult Swim have. It's been an amazing experience for all of us at Toonami, and one that never ceases to give us joy. We just hope we are giving that joy back.     discuss this in the forum (7 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Feature homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            column          4 comments       This Week in Games - Let's Talk About Kingdom Hearts   Apr 16, 07:53 4 comments                 games    Heidi speculates on wtf is going on in the new Kingdom Hearts game and holy crap Witch on the Holy Night is getting a Western release?! ― Hi folks.

How an April Fools Day Joke Revived Toonami   by Kennedy, Apr  1st 2022          By 2012, April Fools Day on Adult Swim had become a fun, albeit predictable, event. The nighttime programming block had fallen into the routine of airing The Room—a legendary 2003 independent film (which has been called “the Citizen Kane of bad movies”) spearheaded by cinematic Swiss army knife Tommy Wiseau. By midnight of April 1, 2012, nobody had any reason to believe that this year would be any different. The (excruciatingly long) opening credits sequence began, and for almost 30 whole seconds everything was the way it had been in the years before—until, that is, the movie faded to black for a moment, revealing that a dark blue robot was watching the movie. “Oh hi, Adult Swim,” the robot with Steve Blum's voice said, “I got the results of the test back. I definitely have April Fools.” The robot, as many anime fans instantly recognized, was TOM: the host of a beloved anime programming block called Toonami that aired on Cartoon Network between 1997 and 2008. A brief animation played after TOM made his quip, the Toonami logo appeared on-screen, and an episode of Bleach began to play. Without any warning, Toonami was airing on television for the first time in almost four years—and anime fans across the U.S. lost their collective mind.      To understand how this happened and why it was such a big deal, we first need to rewind back to the 2000s. Originally, the anime-and-action-cartoon programming block aired on weekday afternoons, but in 2004 it got moved to Saturday nights. It's hard to understate how massive a role Toonami played in anime's burst of popularity in the West throughout the 90s by shaping tastes and making anime more accessible in its heyday. Such was its success that within a few years, even Cartoon Network started airing some anime as well (the only anime it had ever aired before the debut of Toonami was Speed Racer). Furthermore, an adult-oriented nighttime programming block on the same channel called Adult Swim started up in 2001, and an anime called Cowboy Bebop was included in its original lineup. Over the years, both Cartoon Network and Adult Swim would continue to air more anime outside of Toonami (and in fact, Adult Swim even started its own anime-centric block called Adult Swim Action in 2002, which featured some anime that had previously aired on Toonami). But even then, Toonami still felt different. It had its own host (a robot named TOM, though he reincarnated a few times), its own lore, the occasional game review, and unlike Cartoon Network and Adult Swim, anime was a foremost part of Toonami's identity—it felt lovingly tailored specifically for anime fans in a way Cartoon Network and Adult Swim never would be. Dragon Ball Z, Sailor Moon, Naruto, and Gundam Wing are only a few of the anime that found massive success airing on Toonami, and dominated Western anime fan culture for several years.    But by 2008, Toonami had become a shadow of its former self. Once four-hours-long, it spent most of the year with its time cut in half and saturated with Naruto episodes—a far cry from the gateway to discovering a variety of new anime that it once was. The kids who grew up with Toonami's biggest hits like Dragon Ball Z and Sailor Moon were now older and looking for anime that felt a little more dark or mature. And while Toonami had the extremely popular Naruto, Adult Swim had the likes of InuYasha, Bleach, Fullmetal Alchemist, and Cowboy Bebop among plenty of other immensely successful anime that fit the bill—quality and quantity. While anime was never Adult Swim's primary focus, it had nonetheless become an anime powerhouse in its own right, and seemed to take over Toonami's status as the U.S.'s largest anime tastemaker in the mid and late 2000s. Factoring in the massive recession happening on top of all this, and the only thing shocking about Cartoon Network's announcing the cancellation of Toonami at Anime Weekend Atlanta 2008 (they cited declining viewership as the reason why) was how Toonami managed to last as long as it did. The final Toonami block would air the same evening the announcement was made: September 20, 2008.    Much to the disappointment of longtime fans, Toonami didn't go out with so much as a fizzle. Its time wasn't extended, it didn't re-run any of its classic hits—nothing was out of the ordinary. It was the same two-hour block it had been for some time, half of which was spent airing Naruto (the other half was an episode of Ben 10: Alien Force, followed by an episode of Samurai Jack). If not for a clip of TOM saying goodbye at the end, then that evening's block wouldn't have felt like an ending for anything—let alone a once-great programming block that managed to stay on the air for 11 years. While saddened by it, most fans discussing the announcement online seemed to be understanding of the decision, and accepted it pretty quickly. In Memoriam-style posts and content looking back fondly on Toonami's glory days and wondering where it all went wrong (when Toonami got moved to Saturday nights probably marked the beginning of the end, many agreed) seemed to outnumber petitions to undo the cancellation and outraged posts by a landslide. Thus quietly ended Toonami.      In the years following Toonami's cancellation, any lingering conversations about it amongst fans were usually less about bringing it back, and more about being nostalgic for its late 90s/early 2000s lineups. People missed Toonami, that much was clear, but they missed a certain type of Toonami. They missed the anime-centric block that was chock-loaded with a variety of iconic hits—not the glorified Naruto block it eventually became. But with Cartoon Network airing fewer and fewer anime, the idea that Toonami would ever come back seemed less likely than ever.    Enter fellow-programming block Adult Swim in the early months of 2012.    “Usually Adult Swim has a brainstorm about what we might do for April Fools Day on any given year, where everyone throws out ideas and we see what sticks,” recalled Toonami co-creator Jason DeMarco, “Mike Lazzo tossed out “what if we just brought Toonami back for a night, just switched over and it was suddenly like you were in 1999 and watching Cartoon Network?” Everyone loved the idea immediately, and the conversation very quickly moved on to “how the heck can we pull this off?””    Considering the dilapidated state of Toonami at the time of its cancellation, it comes as little shock that—per DeMarco—there hadn't been any meaningful conversations about getting it back on the air prior to this meeting. (“Previous to the April Fools conversation we had, I swear, never ONCE talked in any serious way about bringing Toonami back. We just didn't think it was possible.”) This idea to bring Toonami back for a night must've felt as sudden and out-of-the-blue as any idea possibly could've been—but this speed bump wasn't enough to stop the April Fools Toonami revival from happening.    With only a few months to plan everything, Adult Swim's work was cut out for them. “We made a list of what we thought were the definitive Toonami shows,” said DeMarco. “Then we strategized with Kim Manning, our head of programming, how best to approach distributors to see who might be willing to give us a one time license for, like, one episode of a show. We had no idea at all if any of them would work with us on such a weird request.”    Just like the original vision for this idea, the lineup Adult Swim ultimately ended up with was one that mostly felt like it could've pulled straight out of a schedule from 1999: Bleach, Dragon Ball Z, Gundam Wing, Tenchi Muyo!, Outlaw Star, The Big O, Yu-Yu Hakusho, Blue Submarine No. 6, Trigun, Astro Boy, and ending the night with Gigantor. Bleach was a particularly interesting addition to this lineup, not only because it was the only show that came out after 2000 (with the partial exceptions of The Big O and Blue Submarine No. 6, which began in late 90s but didn't finish til after the turn of the millennium), but also because it was the only show on the lineup that was an Adult Swim show, as opposed to a Toonami show. But it was, nonetheless, part of Toonami tonight. And even though Bleach wasn't traditional Toonami fare, TOM's appearance, Steve Blum's familiar voice, and the fact that any anime was airing at all was more than enough to signal to the viewers that at least for tonight, the Toonami people missed was back.     An image that started circulating at the time  As the night went on and viewers saw how increasingly nostalgic the lineup became, the reminiscent fans couldn't help but express their excitement on social media—which, importantly, also helped to rapidly spread the word that this was happening. Searching for tweets and posts with words like “Toonami” or “Dragon Ball Z” during the night of March 31-April 1, 2012 showcases the elated thoughts of countless anime fans, intent to watch Toonami until its final moments—whatever plans they had for the upcoming morning be damned. So abundant were the tweets about it that “Toonami” (and some adjacent words/phrases like “Outlaw Star”, “Gundam Wing”, etc) quickly became one of the top trending topics on Twitter that evening. Said DeMarco about the fan reactions, “It was incredible, one of the first experiences of my life where I really saw the power of social media to create a collective experience around a particular event as it unfolds. Seeing it blow up on Twitter and watching the mentions just grow, and keep growing, was amazing. All of us were texting each other that night as the event unfolded, and we all stayed up all night having a blast reading the reactions. Just a super great experience for all of us. We came in to work the following Monday still excited and talking about how amazing the response was.”    The outpouring of love from fans was so immense that while the idea of bringing Toonami back began as a joke, it suddenly no longer felt like one to Adult Swim by that next day back at work. Thus, they tweeted that fans could let them know how badly they wanted Toonami to return permanently with the hashtag #BringBackToonami. Not only did this tweet itself garner well over 10,000 retweets (and get the hashtag trending in a matter of hours), but several voice actors and prominent entities in the anime industry even made their own posts featuring the hashtag. Fan made videos, Facebook pages, and petitions dedicated to supporting the hashtag began to appear one after the other. Nerdcore rapper Richie Branson even made a rap about it (which would later be used in an Adult Swim bumper). If it wasn't already abundantly obvious (which it was), then it was now: Now that they knew what Toonami was capable of (once again) being, and that it could air on Adult Swim rather than Cartoon Network, people wanted Toonami back for real.    After a little over a month of cheers to bring back Toonami, Adult Swim finally announced on May 16 with the hashtag  #ToonamisBackBitches that it would be back on Adult Swim (presumably indefinitely) in just a few days, the late night between May 26 and 27. The lineup, it was soon announced after a few days of speculation, would be three hours long and would then repeat itself (meaning it would be on air for a total of 6 hours) and would mostly be anime that had previously aired on Adult Swim such as Bleach and Cowboy Bebop, but also the new-to-U.S.-TV titles Casshern Sins and Deadman Wonderland (shows like Naruto and Dragon Ball Z, DeMarco tweeted, were simply too expensive).    Following the announcement, exuberant forum threads, blog posts, tweets, and videos about the hashtag's success and Toonami's confirmed revival plastered the walls of every online anime community. Richie Branson even made another rap about it to celebrate. In many ways, this marriage of Toonami and Adult Swim felt like a fitting one–they were already both on the same channel, both aired in the evening/at night, and a lot of anime fans spent their younger years in a Toonami to Adult Swim pipeline anyways. This felt perfect.     Despite all the anticipation and fanfare that led up to it, whether or not the night between May 26 and 27 was more than just moderately successful for Toonami depends on who you ask. While its revival made plenty of headlines, many fans lost interest when they saw its mostly-recycled lineup (many were hoping for a higher concentration of shows that either hadn't previously aired in the U.S. or aired in the 90s) which was largely the result of time and money constraints.    “Basically the reaction to [the April Fools] event, combined with the responses to [the Adult Swim tweet about bringing back Toonami], allowed us to come to Lazzo with a request to bring it back for real,” recalled DeMarco, “Gill and I had a plan within a week and brought him a way to do it CHEAP and FAST. And thankfully he said yes. We set a target launch date, and started sprinted towards that date immediately.""    Nonetheless, when ratings came to light a few days later, while they seemed good to many (Deadman Wonderland, for example, ranked #1 in its time slot among adults age 18-24), DeMarco would describe the Toonami revival's inaugural weekend as having gone, “OKAY. Not bad but not measurably better than the week before. We need to do better. Hopefully we will!”    Encouraged by better ratings the following week, (“We're doing well! I'm encouraged.” DeMarco tweeted about it) Toonami marched on—its impact on anime, while not as large as it once was, still tangible. A few weeks prior to its airing on Adult Swim, Deadman Wonderland was on 59,860 user's lists on MyAnimeList. A month into Toonami's revival (June 26), it went up to appearing on 66,110 lists even though it had long since finished airing in Japan (April-July 2011). Casshern Sins—which originally aired in Japan between 2008 and 2009—went from being on 26,671 user's lists on May 4, 2012, to 28,852 on June 28, 2012. These numbers neither 100% definitively prove how many people continually tuned in to this new Toonami, nor are they even particularly earth-shattering, but they do help to further illustrate the influence Toonami was having in the early days of its revival.    Despite the perilous times Adult Swim, like a lot of broadcast television, is currently trying to navigate, Toonami has remained a fixture of Adult Swim in the ten years since its revival began. It's since aired the wildly popular likes of My Hero Academia, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, One-Punch Man, The Promised Neverland, among plenty of other such anime. While it's less of the trendsetter it once was and more of a trend reaffirmer, it still feels much more like the generation-shaping Toonami people knew and loved in the 90s/early 2000s again (as opposed to the zombified state it was in throughout 2008). And Steve Blum, by the way, is still voicing TOM. Adult Swim has also since become more involved in anime than ever by way of producing a few projects (including, but not limited to, the recently announced Housing Complex C and two new seasons of FLCL).    2022 is a unique year for Toonami, as it gets to celebrate not only the 25th anniversary of its original airing, but also the 10th anniversary of its revival. “It's just amazing to me that this is the tenth year of the Adult Swim iteration of Toonami. It's very rare that a person gets to have a second chance at creative work once it's been cancelled or wrapped up by the rights holders,” reflected DeMarco, “It's something that in our case, only happened with the unique combination of fan love and network freedom that Toonami and Adult Swim have. It's been an amazing experience for all of us at Toonami, and one that never ceases to give us joy. We just hope we are giving that joy back.”    Below is the full interview that I had with DeMarco about how Toonami got brought back from the grave:    On April 1, 2012, Toonami once again aired as an April Fools Day joke, despite its 2008 cancellation. How involved were you in the process of making this happen?   Very much so. I believe it was actually Mike Lazzo's idea in one of our brainstorming meetings we had about April Fools. He brought it up as a lark, and Gill Austin and I immediately walked out of that meeting beginning to try to figure out how to pull it off with no time and no money.    What made you (and/or Adult Swim) want to bring Toonami back after its 2008 cancellation?   Well those of us who had worked on Toonami had made our peace with its cancellation. But when we were offered a small chance to bring it back we knew we had to try. It had become clear to us in the years after it was cancelled in 2008 that there were people who WANTED it back.    How (and when) did plans to bring Toonami back start?   I believe it was two and a half months before April Fools Day 2012. Usually Adult Swim has a brainstorm about what we might do for April Fools Day on any given year, where everyone throws out ideas and we see what sticks. Mike Lazzo tossed out “what if we just brought Toonami back for a night, just switched over and it was suddenly like you were in 1999 and watching Cartoon Network?” Everyone loved the idea immediately, and the conversation very quickly moved on to “how the heck can we pull this off?”    Was the plan always to bring it back via an April Fools Day joke? If not, how did that happen?   Previous to the April Fools conversation we had, I swear, never ONCE talked in any serious way about bringing Toonami back. We just didn't think it was possible.    How did the shows that aired for this get picked?   We made a list of what we thought were the definitive Toonami shows. Then we strategized with Kim Manning, our head of programming, how best to approach distributors to see who might be willing to give us a one time license for, like, one episode of a show. We had no idea at all if any of them would work with us on such a weird request.    How was the reception to the April Fools Day joke? Any particularly memorable reactions?   It was incredible, one of the first experiences of my life where I really saw the power of social media to create a collective experience around a particular event as it unfolds. Seeing it blow up on Twitter and watching the mentions just grow, and keep growing, was amazing. All of us were texting each other that night as the event unfolded, and we all stayed up all night having a blast reading the reactions. Just a super great experience for all of us. We came in to work the following Monday still excited and talking about how amazing the response was.    The call from fans to bring back Toonami after this April Fools Day joke was pretty much immediate, and the next day Adult Swim tweeted, ""Want it back? Let us know. #BringBackToonami""--did all this directly contribute to Toonami's full revival a few months later?   Very much so. Basically the reaction to the event, combined with the responses to that Tweet, allowed us to come to Lazzo with a request to bring it back for real. Gill and I had a plan within a week and brought him a way to do it CHEAP and FAST. And thankfully he said yes. We set a target launch date, and started sprinted towards that date immediately.    10 years later, and Adult Swim is more involved in anime production than ever, such as through 2 new seasons of FLCL, Housing Complex C, and Uzumaki. How important has the revival of Toonami been to all this?   It's interesting. Obviously, anime and action have been a part of Adult Swim's DNA since the network's beginning. And even without Toonami returning, it's highly likely that Adult Swim would still be airing anime. Whether or not they would air AS MUCH anime or action, and move into original productions… I don't know. I'm gonna say that would be unlikely without a weekly Toonami block.    Any other thoughts/reflections/fun facts about Toonami's 2012 April Fools Day joke?   Refection-wise, it's just amazing to me that this is the tenth year of the Adult Swim iteration of Toonami. It's very rare that a person gets to have a second chance at creative work once it's been cancelled or wrapped up by the rights holders. It's something that in our case,  only happened with the unique combination of fan love and network freedom that Toonami and Adult Swim have. It's been an amazing experience for all of us at Toonami, and one that never ceases to give us joy. We just hope we are giving that joy back.     discuss this in the forum (7 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Feature homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            column          4 comments       This Week in Games - Let's Talk About Kingdom Hearts   Apr 16, 07:53 4 comments                 games    Heidi speculates on wtf is going on in the new Kingdom Hearts game and holy crap Witch on the Holy Night is getting a Western release?! ― Hi folks.

How an April Fools Day Joke Revived Toonami   by Kennedy, Apr  1st 2022          By 2012, April Fools Day on Adult Swim had become a fun, albeit predictable, event. The nighttime programming block had fallen into the routine of airing The Room—a legendary 2003 independent film (which has been called “the Citizen Kane of bad movies”) spearheaded by cinematic Swiss army knife Tommy Wiseau. By midnight of April 1, 2012, nobody had any reason to believe that this year would be any different. The (excruciatingly long) opening credits sequence began, and for almost 30 whole seconds everything was the way it had been in the years before—until, that is, the movie faded to black for a moment, revealing that a dark blue robot was watching the movie. “Oh hi, Adult Swim,” the robot with Steve Blum's voice said, “I got the results of the test back. I definitely have April Fools.” The robot, as many anime fans instantly recognized, was TOM: the host of a beloved anime programming block called Toonami that aired on Cartoon Network between 1997 and 2008. A brief animation played after TOM made his quip, the Toonami logo appeared on-screen, and an episode of Bleach began to play. Without any warning, Toonami was airing on television for the first time in almost four years—and anime fans across the U.S. lost their collective mind.      To understand how this happened and why it was such a big deal, we first need to rewind back to the 2000s. Originally, the anime-and-action-cartoon programming block aired on weekday afternoons, but in 2004 it got moved to Saturday nights. It's hard to understate how massive a role Toonami played in anime's burst of popularity in the West throughout the 90s by shaping tastes and making anime more accessible in its heyday. Such was its success that within a few years, even Cartoon Network started airing some anime as well (the only anime it had ever aired before the debut of Toonami was Speed Racer). Furthermore, an adult-oriented nighttime programming block on the same channel called Adult Swim started up in 2001, and an anime called Cowboy Bebop was included in its original lineup. Over the years, both Cartoon Network and Adult Swim would continue to air more anime outside of Toonami (and in fact, Adult Swim even started its own anime-centric block called Adult Swim Action in 2002, which featured some anime that had previously aired on Toonami). But even then, Toonami still felt different. It had its own host (a robot named TOM, though he reincarnated a few times), its own lore, the occasional game review, and unlike Cartoon Network and Adult Swim, anime was a foremost part of Toonami's identity—it felt lovingly tailored specifically for anime fans in a way Cartoon Network and Adult Swim never would be. Dragon Ball Z, Sailor Moon, Naruto, and Gundam Wing are only a few of the anime that found massive success airing on Toonami, and dominated Western anime fan culture for several years.    But by 2008, Toonami had become a shadow of its former self. Once four-hours-long, it spent most of the year with its time cut in half and saturated with Naruto episodes—a far cry from the gateway to discovering a variety of new anime that it once was. The kids who grew up with Toonami's biggest hits like Dragon Ball Z and Sailor Moon were now older and looking for anime that felt a little more dark or mature. And while Toonami had the extremely popular Naruto, Adult Swim had the likes of InuYasha, Bleach, Fullmetal Alchemist, and Cowboy Bebop among plenty of other immensely successful anime that fit the bill—quality and quantity. While anime was never Adult Swim's primary focus, it had nonetheless become an anime powerhouse in its own right, and seemed to take over Toonami's status as the U.S.'s largest anime tastemaker in the mid and late 2000s. Factoring in the massive recession happening on top of all this, and the only thing shocking about Cartoon Network's announcing the cancellation of Toonami at Anime Weekend Atlanta 2008 (they cited declining viewership as the reason why) was how Toonami managed to last as long as it did. The final Toonami block would air the same evening the announcement was made: September 20, 2008.    Much to the disappointment of longtime fans, Toonami didn't go out with so much as a fizzle. Its time wasn't extended, it didn't re-run any of its classic hits—nothing was out of the ordinary. It was the same two-hour block it had been for some time, half of which was spent airing Naruto (the other half was an episode of Ben 10: Alien Force, followed by an episode of Samurai Jack). If not for a clip of TOM saying goodbye at the end, then that evening's block wouldn't have felt like an ending for anything—let alone a once-great programming block that managed to stay on the air for 11 years. While saddened by it, most fans discussing the announcement online seemed to be understanding of the decision, and accepted it pretty quickly. In Memoriam-style posts and content looking back fondly on Toonami's glory days and wondering where it all went wrong (when Toonami got moved to Saturday nights probably marked the beginning of the end, many agreed) seemed to outnumber petitions to undo the cancellation and outraged posts by a landslide. Thus quietly ended Toonami.      In the years following Toonami's cancellation, any lingering conversations about it amongst fans were usually less about bringing it back, and more about being nostalgic for its late 90s/early 2000s lineups. People missed Toonami, that much was clear, but they missed a certain type of Toonami. They missed the anime-centric block that was chock-loaded with a variety of iconic hits—not the glorified Naruto block it eventually became. But with Cartoon Network airing fewer and fewer anime, the idea that Toonami would ever come back seemed less likely than ever.    Enter fellow-programming block Adult Swim in the early months of 2012.    “Usually Adult Swim has a brainstorm about what we might do for April Fools Day on any given year, where everyone throws out ideas and we see what sticks,” recalled Toonami co-creator Jason DeMarco, “Mike Lazzo tossed out “what if we just brought Toonami back for a night, just switched over and it was suddenly like you were in 1999 and watching Cartoon Network?” Everyone loved the idea immediately, and the conversation very quickly moved on to “how the heck can we pull this off?””    Considering the dilapidated state of Toonami at the time of its cancellation, it comes as little shock that—per DeMarco—there hadn't been any meaningful conversations about getting it back on the air prior to this meeting. (“Previous to the April Fools conversation we had, I swear, never ONCE talked in any serious way about bringing Toonami back. We just didn't think it was possible.”) This idea to bring Toonami back for a night must've felt as sudden and out-of-the-blue as any idea possibly could've been—but this speed bump wasn't enough to stop the April Fools Toonami revival from happening.    With only a few months to plan everything, Adult Swim's work was cut out for them. “We made a list of what we thought were the definitive Toonami shows,” said DeMarco. “Then we strategized with Kim Manning, our head of programming, how best to approach distributors to see who might be willing to give us a one time license for, like, one episode of a show. We had no idea at all if any of them would work with us on such a weird request.”    Just like the original vision for this idea, the lineup Adult Swim ultimately ended up with was one that mostly felt like it could've pulled straight out of a schedule from 1999: Bleach, Dragon Ball Z, Gundam Wing, Tenchi Muyo!, Outlaw Star, The Big O, Yu-Yu Hakusho, Blue Submarine No. 6, Trigun, Astro Boy, and ending the night with Gigantor. Bleach was a particularly interesting addition to this lineup, not only because it was the only show that came out after 2000 (with the partial exceptions of The Big O and Blue Submarine No. 6, which began in late 90s but didn't finish til after the turn of the millennium), but also because it was the only show on the lineup that was an Adult Swim show, as opposed to a Toonami show. But it was, nonetheless, part of Toonami tonight. And even though Bleach wasn't traditional Toonami fare, TOM's appearance, Steve Blum's familiar voice, and the fact that any anime was airing at all was more than enough to signal to the viewers that at least for tonight, the Toonami people missed was back.     An image that started circulating at the time  As the night went on and viewers saw how increasingly nostalgic the lineup became, the reminiscent fans couldn't help but express their excitement on social media—which, importantly, also helped to rapidly spread the word that this was happening. Searching for tweets and posts with words like “Toonami” or “Dragon Ball Z” during the night of March 31-April 1, 2012 showcases the elated thoughts of countless anime fans, intent to watch Toonami until its final moments—whatever plans they had for the upcoming morning be damned. So abundant were the tweets about it that “Toonami” (and some adjacent words/phrases like “Outlaw Star”, “Gundam Wing”, etc) quickly became one of the top trending topics on Twitter that evening. Said DeMarco about the fan reactions, “It was incredible, one of the first experiences of my life where I really saw the power of social media to create a collective experience around a particular event as it unfolds. Seeing it blow up on Twitter and watching the mentions just grow, and keep growing, was amazing. All of us were texting each other that night as the event unfolded, and we all stayed up all night having a blast reading the reactions. Just a super great experience for all of us. We came in to work the following Monday still excited and talking about how amazing the response was.”    The outpouring of love from fans was so immense that while the idea of bringing Toonami back began as a joke, it suddenly no longer felt like one to Adult Swim by that next day back at work. Thus, they tweeted that fans could let them know how badly they wanted Toonami to return permanently with the hashtag #BringBackToonami. Not only did this tweet itself garner well over 10,000 retweets (and get the hashtag trending in a matter of hours), but several voice actors and prominent entities in the anime industry even made their own posts featuring the hashtag. Fan made videos, Facebook pages, and petitions dedicated to supporting the hashtag began to appear one after the other. Nerdcore rapper Richie Branson even made a rap about it (which would later be used in an Adult Swim bumper). If it wasn't already abundantly obvious (which it was), then it was now: Now that they knew what Toonami was capable of (once again) being, and that it could air on Adult Swim rather than Cartoon Network, people wanted Toonami back for real.    After a little over a month of cheers to bring back Toonami, Adult Swim finally announced on May 16 with the hashtag  #ToonamisBackBitches that it would be back on Adult Swim (presumably indefinitely) in just a few days, the late night between May 26 and 27. The lineup, it was soon announced after a few days of speculation, would be three hours long and would then repeat itself (meaning it would be on air for a total of 6 hours) and would mostly be anime that had previously aired on Adult Swim such as Bleach and Cowboy Bebop, but also the new-to-U.S.-TV titles Casshern Sins and Deadman Wonderland (shows like Naruto and Dragon Ball Z, DeMarco tweeted, were simply too expensive).    Following the announcement, exuberant forum threads, blog posts, tweets, and videos about the hashtag's success and Toonami's confirmed revival plastered the walls of every online anime community. Richie Branson even made another rap about it to celebrate. In many ways, this marriage of Toonami and Adult Swim felt like a fitting one–they were already both on the same channel, both aired in the evening/at night, and a lot of anime fans spent their younger years in a Toonami to Adult Swim pipeline anyways. This felt perfect.     Despite all the anticipation and fanfare that led up to it, whether or not the night between May 26 and 27 was more than just moderately successful for Toonami depends on who you ask. While its revival made plenty of headlines, many fans lost interest when they saw its mostly-recycled lineup (many were hoping for a higher concentration of shows that either hadn't previously aired in the U.S. or aired in the 90s) which was largely the result of time and money constraints.    “Basically the reaction to [the April Fools] event, combined with the responses to [the Adult Swim tweet about bringing back Toonami], allowed us to come to Lazzo with a request to bring it back for real,” recalled DeMarco, “Gill and I had a plan within a week and brought him a way to do it CHEAP and FAST. And thankfully he said yes. We set a target launch date, and started sprinted towards that date immediately.""    Nonetheless, when ratings came to light a few days later, while they seemed good to many (Deadman Wonderland, for example, ranked #1 in its time slot among adults age 18-24), DeMarco would describe the Toonami revival's inaugural weekend as having gone, “OKAY. Not bad but not measurably better than the week before. We need to do better. Hopefully we will!”    Encouraged by better ratings the following week, (“We're doing well! I'm encouraged.” DeMarco tweeted about it) Toonami marched on—its impact on anime, while not as large as it once was, still tangible. A few weeks prior to its airing on Adult Swim, Deadman Wonderland was on 59,860 user's lists on MyAnimeList. A month into Toonami's revival (June 26), it went up to appearing on 66,110 lists even though it had long since finished airing in Japan (April-July 2011). Casshern Sins—which originally aired in Japan between 2008 and 2009—went from being on 26,671 user's lists on May 4, 2012, to 28,852 on June 28, 2012. These numbers neither 100% definitively prove how many people continually tuned in to this new Toonami, nor are they even particularly earth-shattering, but they do help to further illustrate the influence Toonami was having in the early days of its revival.    Despite the perilous times Adult Swim, like a lot of broadcast television, is currently trying to navigate, Toonami has remained a fixture of Adult Swim in the ten years since its revival began. It's since aired the wildly popular likes of My Hero Academia, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, One-Punch Man, The Promised Neverland, among plenty of other such anime. While it's less of the trendsetter it once was and more of a trend reaffirmer, it still feels much more like the generation-shaping Toonami people knew and loved in the 90s/early 2000s again (as opposed to the zombified state it was in throughout 2008). And Steve Blum, by the way, is still voicing TOM. Adult Swim has also since become more involved in anime than ever by way of producing a few projects (including, but not limited to, the recently announced Housing Complex C and two new seasons of FLCL).    2022 is a unique year for Toonami, as it gets to celebrate not only the 25th anniversary of its original airing, but also the 10th anniversary of its revival. “It's just amazing to me that this is the tenth year of the Adult Swim iteration of Toonami. It's very rare that a person gets to have a second chance at creative work once it's been cancelled or wrapped up by the rights holders,” reflected DeMarco, “It's something that in our case, only happened with the unique combination of fan love and network freedom that Toonami and Adult Swim have. It's been an amazing experience for all of us at Toonami, and one that never ceases to give us joy. We just hope we are giving that joy back.”    Below is the full interview that I had with DeMarco about how Toonami got brought back from the grave:    On April 1, 2012, Toonami once again aired as an April Fools Day joke, despite its 2008 cancellation. How involved were you in the process of making this happen?   Very much so. I believe it was actually Mike Lazzo's idea in one of our brainstorming meetings we had about April Fools. He brought it up as a lark, and Gill Austin and I immediately walked out of that meeting beginning to try to figure out how to pull it off with no time and no money.    What made you (and/or Adult Swim) want to bring Toonami back after its 2008 cancellation?   Well those of us who had worked on Toonami had made our peace with its cancellation. But when we were offered a small chance to bring it back we knew we had to try. It had become clear to us in the years after it was cancelled in 2008 that there were people who WANTED it back.    How (and when) did plans to bring Toonami back start?   I believe it was two and a half months before April Fools Day 2012. Usually Adult Swim has a brainstorm about what we might do for April Fools Day on any given year, where everyone throws out ideas and we see what sticks. Mike Lazzo tossed out “what if we just brought Toonami back for a night, just switched over and it was suddenly like you were in 1999 and watching Cartoon Network?” Everyone loved the idea immediately, and the conversation very quickly moved on to “how the heck can we pull this off?”    Was the plan always to bring it back via an April Fools Day joke? If not, how did that happen?   Previous to the April Fools conversation we had, I swear, never ONCE talked in any serious way about bringing Toonami back. We just didn't think it was possible.    How did the shows that aired for this get picked?   We made a list of what we thought were the definitive Toonami shows. Then we strategized with Kim Manning, our head of programming, how best to approach distributors to see who might be willing to give us a one time license for, like, one episode of a show. We had no idea at all if any of them would work with us on such a weird request.    How was the reception to the April Fools Day joke? Any particularly memorable reactions?   It was incredible, one of the first experiences of my life where I really saw the power of social media to create a collective experience around a particular event as it unfolds. Seeing it blow up on Twitter and watching the mentions just grow, and keep growing, was amazing. All of us were texting each other that night as the event unfolded, and we all stayed up all night having a blast reading the reactions. Just a super great experience for all of us. We came in to work the following Monday still excited and talking about how amazing the response was.    The call from fans to bring back Toonami after this April Fools Day joke was pretty much immediate, and the next day Adult Swim tweeted, ""Want it back? Let us know. #BringBackToonami""--did all this directly contribute to Toonami's full revival a few months later?   Very much so. Basically the reaction to the event, combined with the responses to that Tweet, allowed us to come to Lazzo with a request to bring it back for real. Gill and I had a plan within a week and brought him a way to do it CHEAP and FAST. And thankfully he said yes. We set a target launch date, and started sprinted towards that date immediately.    10 years later, and Adult Swim is more involved in anime production than ever, such as through 2 new seasons of FLCL, Housing Complex C, and Uzumaki. How important has the revival of Toonami been to all this?   It's interesting. Obviously, anime and action have been a part of Adult Swim's DNA since the network's beginning. And even without Toonami returning, it's highly likely that Adult Swim would still be airing anime. Whether or not they would air AS MUCH anime or action, and move into original productions… I don't know. I'm gonna say that would be unlikely without a weekly Toonami block.    Any other thoughts/reflections/fun facts about Toonami's 2012 April Fools Day joke?   Refection-wise, it's just amazing to me that this is the tenth year of the Adult Swim iteration of Toonami. It's very rare that a person gets to have a second chance at creative work once it's been cancelled or wrapped up by the rights holders. It's something that in our case,  only happened with the unique combination of fan love and network freedom that Toonami and Adult Swim have. It's been an amazing experience for all of us at Toonami, and one that never ceases to give us joy. We just hope we are giving that joy back.     discuss this in the forum (7 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Feature homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            column          4 comments       This Week in Games - Let's Talk About Kingdom Hearts   Apr 16, 07:53 4 comments                 games    Heidi speculates on wtf is going on in the new Kingdom Hearts game and holy crap Witch on the Holy Night is getting a Western release?! ― Hi folks.

How an April Fools Day Joke Revived Toonami   by Kennedy, Apr  1st 2022          By 2012, April Fools Day on Adult Swim had become a fun, albeit predictable, event. The nighttime programming block had fallen into the routine of airing The Room—a legendary 2003 independent film (which has been called “the Citizen Kane of bad movies”) spearheaded by cinematic Swiss army knife Tommy Wiseau. By midnight of April 1, 2012, nobody had any reason to believe that this year would be any different. The (excruciatingly long) opening credits sequence began, and for almost 30 whole seconds everything was the way it had been in the years before—until, that is, the movie faded to black for a moment, revealing that a dark blue robot was watching the movie. “Oh hi, Adult Swim,” the robot with Steve Blum's voice said, “I got the results of the test back. I definitely have April Fools.” The robot, as many anime fans instantly recognized, was TOM: the host of a beloved anime programming block called Toonami that aired on Cartoon Network between 1997 and 2008. A brief animation played after TOM made his quip, the Toonami logo appeared on-screen, and an episode of Bleach began to play. Without any warning, Toonami was airing on television for the first time in almost four years—and anime fans across the U.S. lost their collective mind.      To understand how this happened and why it was such a big deal, we first need to rewind back to the 2000s. Originally, the anime-and-action-cartoon programming block aired on weekday afternoons, but in 2004 it got moved to Saturday nights. It's hard to understate how massive a role Toonami played in anime's burst of popularity in the West throughout the 90s by shaping tastes and making anime more accessible in its heyday. Such was its success that within a few years, even Cartoon Network started airing some anime as well (the only anime it had ever aired before the debut of Toonami was Speed Racer). Furthermore, an adult-oriented nighttime programming block on the same channel called Adult Swim started up in 2001, and an anime called Cowboy Bebop was included in its original lineup. Over the years, both Cartoon Network and Adult Swim would continue to air more anime outside of Toonami (and in fact, Adult Swim even started its own anime-centric block called Adult Swim Action in 2002, which featured some anime that had previously aired on Toonami). But even then, Toonami still felt different. It had its own host (a robot named TOM, though he reincarnated a few times), its own lore, the occasional game review, and unlike Cartoon Network and Adult Swim, anime was a foremost part of Toonami's identity—it felt lovingly tailored specifically for anime fans in a way Cartoon Network and Adult Swim never would be. Dragon Ball Z, Sailor Moon, Naruto, and Gundam Wing are only a few of the anime that found massive success airing on Toonami, and dominated Western anime fan culture for several years.    But by 2008, Toonami had become a shadow of its former self. Once four-hours-long, it spent most of the year with its time cut in half and saturated with Naruto episodes—a far cry from the gateway to discovering a variety of new anime that it once was. The kids who grew up with Toonami's biggest hits like Dragon Ball Z and Sailor Moon were now older and looking for anime that felt a little more dark or mature. And while Toonami had the extremely popular Naruto, Adult Swim had the likes of InuYasha, Bleach, Fullmetal Alchemist, and Cowboy Bebop among plenty of other immensely successful anime that fit the bill—quality and quantity. While anime was never Adult Swim's primary focus, it had nonetheless become an anime powerhouse in its own right, and seemed to take over Toonami's status as the U.S.'s largest anime tastemaker in the mid and late 2000s. Factoring in the massive recession happening on top of all this, and the only thing shocking about Cartoon Network's announcing the cancellation of Toonami at Anime Weekend Atlanta 2008 (they cited declining viewership as the reason why) was how Toonami managed to last as long as it did. The final Toonami block would air the same evening the announcement was made: September 20, 2008.    Much to the disappointment of longtime fans, Toonami didn't go out with so much as a fizzle. Its time wasn't extended, it didn't re-run any of its classic hits—nothing was out of the ordinary. It was the same two-hour block it had been for some time, half of which was spent airing Naruto (the other half was an episode of Ben 10: Alien Force, followed by an episode of Samurai Jack). If not for a clip of TOM saying goodbye at the end, then that evening's block wouldn't have felt like an ending for anything—let alone a once-great programming block that managed to stay on the air for 11 years. While saddened by it, most fans discussing the announcement online seemed to be understanding of the decision, and accepted it pretty quickly. In Memoriam-style posts and content looking back fondly on Toonami's glory days and wondering where it all went wrong (when Toonami got moved to Saturday nights probably marked the beginning of the end, many agreed) seemed to outnumber petitions to undo the cancellation and outraged posts by a landslide. Thus quietly ended Toonami.      In the years following Toonami's cancellation, any lingering conversations about it amongst fans were usually less about bringing it back, and more about being nostalgic for its late 90s/early 2000s lineups. People missed Toonami, that much was clear, but they missed a certain type of Toonami. They missed the anime-centric block that was chock-loaded with a variety of iconic hits—not the glorified Naruto block it eventually became. But with Cartoon Network airing fewer and fewer anime, the idea that Toonami would ever come back seemed less likely than ever.    Enter fellow-programming block Adult Swim in the early months of 2012.    “Usually Adult Swim has a brainstorm about what we might do for April Fools Day on any given year, where everyone throws out ideas and we see what sticks,” recalled Toonami co-creator Jason DeMarco, “Mike Lazzo tossed out “what if we just brought Toonami back for a night, just switched over and it was suddenly like you were in 1999 and watching Cartoon Network?” Everyone loved the idea immediately, and the conversation very quickly moved on to “how the heck can we pull this off?””    Considering the dilapidated state of Toonami at the time of its cancellation, it comes as little shock that—per DeMarco—there hadn't been any meaningful conversations about getting it back on the air prior to this meeting. (“Previous to the April Fools conversation we had, I swear, never ONCE talked in any serious way about bringing Toonami back. We just didn't think it was possible.”) This idea to bring Toonami back for a night must've felt as sudden and out-of-the-blue as any idea possibly could've been—but this speed bump wasn't enough to stop the April Fools Toonami revival from happening.    With only a few months to plan everything, Adult Swim's work was cut out for them. “We made a list of what we thought were the definitive Toonami shows,” said DeMarco. “Then we strategized with Kim Manning, our head of programming, how best to approach distributors to see who might be willing to give us a one time license for, like, one episode of a show. We had no idea at all if any of them would work with us on such a weird request.”    Just like the original vision for this idea, the lineup Adult Swim ultimately ended up with was one that mostly felt like it could've pulled straight out of a schedule from 1999: Bleach, Dragon Ball Z, Gundam Wing, Tenchi Muyo!, Outlaw Star, The Big O, Yu-Yu Hakusho, Blue Submarine No. 6, Trigun, Astro Boy, and ending the night with Gigantor. Bleach was a particularly interesting addition to this lineup, not only because it was the only show that came out after 2000 (with the partial exceptions of The Big O and Blue Submarine No. 6, which began in late 90s but didn't finish til after the turn of the millennium), but also because it was the only show on the lineup that was an Adult Swim show, as opposed to a Toonami show. But it was, nonetheless, part of Toonami tonight. And even though Bleach wasn't traditional Toonami fare, TOM's appearance, Steve Blum's familiar voice, and the fact that any anime was airing at all was more than enough to signal to the viewers that at least for tonight, the Toonami people missed was back.     An image that started circulating at the time  As the night went on and viewers saw how increasingly nostalgic the lineup became, the reminiscent fans couldn't help but express their excitement on social media—which, importantly, also helped to rapidly spread the word that this was happening. Searching for tweets and posts with words like “Toonami” or “Dragon Ball Z” during the night of March 31-April 1, 2012 showcases the elated thoughts of countless anime fans, intent to watch Toonami until its final moments—whatever plans they had for the upcoming morning be damned. So abundant were the tweets about it that “Toonami” (and some adjacent words/phrases like “Outlaw Star”, “Gundam Wing”, etc) quickly became one of the top trending topics on Twitter that evening. Said DeMarco about the fan reactions, “It was incredible, one of the first experiences of my life where I really saw the power of social media to create a collective experience around a particular event as it unfolds. Seeing it blow up on Twitter and watching the mentions just grow, and keep growing, was amazing. All of us were texting each other that night as the event unfolded, and we all stayed up all night having a blast reading the reactions. Just a super great experience for all of us. We came in to work the following Monday still excited and talking about how amazing the response was.”    The outpouring of love from fans was so immense that while the idea of bringing Toonami back began as a joke, it suddenly no longer felt like one to Adult Swim by that next day back at work. Thus, they tweeted that fans could let them know how badly they wanted Toonami to return permanently with the hashtag #BringBackToonami. Not only did this tweet itself garner well over 10,000 retweets (and get the hashtag trending in a matter of hours), but several voice actors and prominent entities in the anime industry even made their own posts featuring the hashtag. Fan made videos, Facebook pages, and petitions dedicated to supporting the hashtag began to appear one after the other. Nerdcore rapper Richie Branson even made a rap about it (which would later be used in an Adult Swim bumper). If it wasn't already abundantly obvious (which it was), then it was now: Now that they knew what Toonami was capable of (once again) being, and that it could air on Adult Swim rather than Cartoon Network, people wanted Toonami back for real.    After a little over a month of cheers to bring back Toonami, Adult Swim finally announced on May 16 with the hashtag  #ToonamisBackBitches that it would be back on Adult Swim (presumably indefinitely) in just a few days, the late night between May 26 and 27. The lineup, it was soon announced after a few days of speculation, would be three hours long and would then repeat itself (meaning it would be on air for a total of 6 hours) and would mostly be anime that had previously aired on Adult Swim such as Bleach and Cowboy Bebop, but also the new-to-U.S.-TV titles Casshern Sins and Deadman Wonderland (shows like Naruto and Dragon Ball Z, DeMarco tweeted, were simply too expensive).    Following the announcement, exuberant forum threads, blog posts, tweets, and videos about the hashtag's success and Toonami's confirmed revival plastered the walls of every online anime community. Richie Branson even made another rap about it to celebrate. In many ways, this marriage of Toonami and Adult Swim felt like a fitting one–they were already both on the same channel, both aired in the evening/at night, and a lot of anime fans spent their younger years in a Toonami to Adult Swim pipeline anyways. This felt perfect.     Despite all the anticipation and fanfare that led up to it, whether or not the night between May 26 and 27 was more than just moderately successful for Toonami depends on who you ask. While its revival made plenty of headlines, many fans lost interest when they saw its mostly-recycled lineup (many were hoping for a higher concentration of shows that either hadn't previously aired in the U.S. or aired in the 90s) which was largely the result of time and money constraints.    “Basically the reaction to [the April Fools] event, combined with the responses to [the Adult Swim tweet about bringing back Toonami], allowed us to come to Lazzo with a request to bring it back for real,” recalled DeMarco, “Gill and I had a plan within a week and brought him a way to do it CHEAP and FAST. And thankfully he said yes. We set a target launch date, and started sprinted towards that date immediately.""    Nonetheless, when ratings came to light a few days later, while they seemed good to many (Deadman Wonderland, for example, ranked #1 in its time slot among adults age 18-24), DeMarco would describe the Toonami revival's inaugural weekend as having gone, “OKAY. Not bad but not measurably better than the week before. We need to do better. Hopefully we will!”    Encouraged by better ratings the following week, (“We're doing well! I'm encouraged.” DeMarco tweeted about it) Toonami marched on—its impact on anime, while not as large as it once was, still tangible. A few weeks prior to its airing on Adult Swim, Deadman Wonderland was on 59,860 user's lists on MyAnimeList. A month into Toonami's revival (June 26), it went up to appearing on 66,110 lists even though it had long since finished airing in Japan (April-July 2011). Casshern Sins—which originally aired in Japan between 2008 and 2009—went from being on 26,671 user's lists on May 4, 2012, to 28,852 on June 28, 2012. These numbers neither 100% definitively prove how many people continually tuned in to this new Toonami, nor are they even particularly earth-shattering, but they do help to further illustrate the influence Toonami was having in the early days of its revival.    Despite the perilous times Adult Swim, like a lot of broadcast television, is currently trying to navigate, Toonami has remained a fixture of Adult Swim in the ten years since its revival began. It's since aired the wildly popular likes of My Hero Academia, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, One-Punch Man, The Promised Neverland, among plenty of other such anime. While it's less of the trendsetter it once was and more of a trend reaffirmer, it still feels much more like the generation-shaping Toonami people knew and loved in the 90s/early 2000s again (as opposed to the zombified state it was in throughout 2008). And Steve Blum, by the way, is still voicing TOM. Adult Swim has also since become more involved in anime than ever by way of producing a few projects (including, but not limited to, the recently announced Housing Complex C and two new seasons of FLCL).    2022 is a unique year for Toonami, as it gets to celebrate not only the 25th anniversary of its original airing, but also the 10th anniversary of its revival. “It's just amazing to me that this is the tenth year of the Adult Swim iteration of Toonami. It's very rare that a person gets to have a second chance at creative work once it's been cancelled or wrapped up by the rights holders,” reflected DeMarco, “It's something that in our case, only happened with the unique combination of fan love and network freedom that Toonami and Adult Swim have. It's been an amazing experience for all of us at Toonami, and one that never ceases to give us joy. We just hope we are giving that joy back.”    Below is the full interview that I had with DeMarco about how Toonami got brought back from the grave:    On April 1, 2012, Toonami once again aired as an April Fools Day joke, despite its 2008 cancellation. How involved were you in the process of making this happen?   Very much so. I believe it was actually Mike Lazzo's idea in one of our brainstorming meetings we had about April Fools. He brought it up as a lark, and Gill Austin and I immediately walked out of that meeting beginning to try to figure out how to pull it off with no time and no money.    What made you (and/or Adult Swim) want to bring Toonami back after its 2008 cancellation?   Well those of us who had worked on Toonami had made our peace with its cancellation. But when we were offered a small chance to bring it back we knew we had to try. It had become clear to us in the years after it was cancelled in 2008 that there were people who WANTED it back.    How (and when) did plans to bring Toonami back start?   I believe it was two and a half months before April Fools Day 2012. Usually Adult Swim has a brainstorm about what we might do for April Fools Day on any given year, where everyone throws out ideas and we see what sticks. Mike Lazzo tossed out “what if we just brought Toonami back for a night, just switched over and it was suddenly like you were in 1999 and watching Cartoon Network?” Everyone loved the idea immediately, and the conversation very quickly moved on to “how the heck can we pull this off?”    Was the plan always to bring it back via an April Fools Day joke? If not, how did that happen?   Previous to the April Fools conversation we had, I swear, never ONCE talked in any serious way about bringing Toonami back. We just didn't think it was possible.    How did the shows that aired for this get picked?   We made a list of what we thought were the definitive Toonami shows. Then we strategized with Kim Manning, our head of programming, how best to approach distributors to see who might be willing to give us a one time license for, like, one episode of a show. We had no idea at all if any of them would work with us on such a weird request.    How was the reception to the April Fools Day joke? Any particularly memorable reactions?   It was incredible, one of the first experiences of my life where I really saw the power of social media to create a collective experience around a particular event as it unfolds. Seeing it blow up on Twitter and watching the mentions just grow, and keep growing, was amazing. All of us were texting each other that night as the event unfolded, and we all stayed up all night having a blast reading the reactions. Just a super great experience for all of us. We came in to work the following Monday still excited and talking about how amazing the response was.    The call from fans to bring back Toonami after this April Fools Day joke was pretty much immediate, and the next day Adult Swim tweeted, ""Want it back? Let us know. #BringBackToonami""--did all this directly contribute to Toonami's full revival a few months later?   Very much so. Basically the reaction to the event, combined with the responses to that Tweet, allowed us to come to Lazzo with a request to bring it back for real. Gill and I had a plan within a week and brought him a way to do it CHEAP and FAST. And thankfully he said yes. We set a target launch date, and started sprinted towards that date immediately.    10 years later, and Adult Swim is more involved in anime production than ever, such as through 2 new seasons of FLCL, Housing Complex C, and Uzumaki. How important has the revival of Toonami been to all this?   It's interesting. Obviously, anime and action have been a part of Adult Swim's DNA since the network's beginning. And even without Toonami returning, it's highly likely that Adult Swim would still be airing anime. Whether or not they would air AS MUCH anime or action, and move into original productions… I don't know. I'm gonna say that would be unlikely without a weekly Toonami block.    Any other thoughts/reflections/fun facts about Toonami's 2012 April Fools Day joke?   Refection-wise, it's just amazing to me that this is the tenth year of the Adult Swim iteration of Toonami. It's very rare that a person gets to have a second chance at creative work once it's been cancelled or wrapped up by the rights holders. It's something that in our case,  only happened with the unique combination of fan love and network freedom that Toonami and Adult Swim have. It's been an amazing experience for all of us at Toonami, and one that never ceases to give us joy. We just hope we are giving that joy back.     discuss this in the forum (7 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Feature homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            column          4 comments       This Week in Games - Let's Talk About Kingdom Hearts   Apr 16, 07:53 4 comments                 games    Heidi speculates on wtf is going on in the new Kingdom Hearts game and holy crap Witch on the Holy Night is getting a Western release?! ― Hi folks.

How an April Fools Day Joke Revived Toonami   by Kennedy, Apr  1st 2022          By 2012, April Fools Day on Adult Swim had become a fun, albeit predictable, event. The nighttime programming block had fallen into the routine of airing The Room—a legendary 2003 independent film (which has been called “the Citizen Kane of bad movies”) spearheaded by cinematic Swiss army knife Tommy Wiseau. By midnight of April 1, 2012, nobody had any reason to believe that this year would be any different. The (excruciatingly long) opening credits sequence began, and for almost 30 whole seconds everything was the way it had been in the years before—until, that is, the movie faded to black for a moment, revealing that a dark blue robot was watching the movie. “Oh hi, Adult Swim,” the robot with Steve Blum's voice said, “I got the results of the test back. I definitely have April Fools.” The robot, as many anime fans instantly recognized, was TOM: the host of a beloved anime programming block called Toonami that aired on Cartoon Network between 1997 and 2008. A brief animation played after TOM made his quip, the Toonami logo appeared on-screen, and an episode of Bleach began to play. Without any warning, Toonami was airing on television for the first time in almost four years—and anime fans across the U.S. lost their collective mind.      To understand how this happened and why it was such a big deal, we first need to rewind back to the 2000s. Originally, the anime-and-action-cartoon programming block aired on weekday afternoons, but in 2004 it got moved to Saturday nights. It's hard to understate how massive a role Toonami played in anime's burst of popularity in the West throughout the 90s by shaping tastes and making anime more accessible in its heyday. Such was its success that within a few years, even Cartoon Network started airing some anime as well (the only anime it had ever aired before the debut of Toonami was Speed Racer). Furthermore, an adult-oriented nighttime programming block on the same channel called Adult Swim started up in 2001, and an anime called Cowboy Bebop was included in its original lineup. Over the years, both Cartoon Network and Adult Swim would continue to air more anime outside of Toonami (and in fact, Adult Swim even started its own anime-centric block called Adult Swim Action in 2002, which featured some anime that had previously aired on Toonami). But even then, Toonami still felt different. It had its own host (a robot named TOM, though he reincarnated a few times), its own lore, the occasional game review, and unlike Cartoon Network and Adult Swim, anime was a foremost part of Toonami's identity—it felt lovingly tailored specifically for anime fans in a way Cartoon Network and Adult Swim never would be. Dragon Ball Z, Sailor Moon, Naruto, and Gundam Wing are only a few of the anime that found massive success airing on Toonami, and dominated Western anime fan culture for several years.    But by 2008, Toonami had become a shadow of its former self. Once four-hours-long, it spent most of the year with its time cut in half and saturated with Naruto episodes—a far cry from the gateway to discovering a variety of new anime that it once was. The kids who grew up with Toonami's biggest hits like Dragon Ball Z and Sailor Moon were now older and looking for anime that felt a little more dark or mature. And while Toonami had the extremely popular Naruto, Adult Swim had the likes of InuYasha, Bleach, Fullmetal Alchemist, and Cowboy Bebop among plenty of other immensely successful anime that fit the bill—quality and quantity. While anime was never Adult Swim's primary focus, it had nonetheless become an anime powerhouse in its own right, and seemed to take over Toonami's status as the U.S.'s largest anime tastemaker in the mid and late 2000s. Factoring in the massive recession happening on top of all this, and the only thing shocking about Cartoon Network's announcing the cancellation of Toonami at Anime Weekend Atlanta 2008 (they cited declining viewership as the reason why) was how Toonami managed to last as long as it did. The final Toonami block would air the same evening the announcement was made: September 20, 2008.    Much to the disappointment of longtime fans, Toonami didn't go out with so much as a fizzle. Its time wasn't extended, it didn't re-run any of its classic hits—nothing was out of the ordinary. It was the same two-hour block it had been for some time, half of which was spent airing Naruto (the other half was an episode of Ben 10: Alien Force, followed by an episode of Samurai Jack). If not for a clip of TOM saying goodbye at the end, then that evening's block wouldn't have felt like an ending for anything—let alone a once-great programming block that managed to stay on the air for 11 years. While saddened by it, most fans discussing the announcement online seemed to be understanding of the decision, and accepted it pretty quickly. In Memoriam-style posts and content looking back fondly on Toonami's glory days and wondering where it all went wrong (when Toonami got moved to Saturday nights probably marked the beginning of the end, many agreed) seemed to outnumber petitions to undo the cancellation and outraged posts by a landslide. Thus quietly ended Toonami.      In the years following Toonami's cancellation, any lingering conversations about it amongst fans were usually less about bringing it back, and more about being nostalgic for its late 90s/early 2000s lineups. People missed Toonami, that much was clear, but they missed a certain type of Toonami. They missed the anime-centric block that was chock-loaded with a variety of iconic hits—not the glorified Naruto block it eventually became. But with Cartoon Network airing fewer and fewer anime, the idea that Toonami would ever come back seemed less likely than ever.    Enter fellow-programming block Adult Swim in the early months of 2012.    “Usually Adult Swim has a brainstorm about what we might do for April Fools Day on any given year, where everyone throws out ideas and we see what sticks,” recalled Toonami co-creator Jason DeMarco, “Mike Lazzo tossed out “what if we just brought Toonami back for a night, just switched over and it was suddenly like you were in 1999 and watching Cartoon Network?” Everyone loved the idea immediately, and the conversation very quickly moved on to “how the heck can we pull this off?””    Considering the dilapidated state of Toonami at the time of its cancellation, it comes as little shock that—per DeMarco—there hadn't been any meaningful conversations about getting it back on the air prior to this meeting. (“Previous to the April Fools conversation we had, I swear, never ONCE talked in any serious way about bringing Toonami back. We just didn't think it was possible.”) This idea to bring Toonami back for a night must've felt as sudden and out-of-the-blue as any idea possibly could've been—but this speed bump wasn't enough to stop the April Fools Toonami revival from happening.    With only a few months to plan everything, Adult Swim's work was cut out for them. “We made a list of what we thought were the definitive Toonami shows,” said DeMarco. “Then we strategized with Kim Manning, our head of programming, how best to approach distributors to see who might be willing to give us a one time license for, like, one episode of a show. We had no idea at all if any of them would work with us on such a weird request.”    Just like the original vision for this idea, the lineup Adult Swim ultimately ended up with was one that mostly felt like it could've pulled straight out of a schedule from 1999: Bleach, Dragon Ball Z, Gundam Wing, Tenchi Muyo!, Outlaw Star, The Big O, Yu-Yu Hakusho, Blue Submarine No. 6, Trigun, Astro Boy, and ending the night with Gigantor. Bleach was a particularly interesting addition to this lineup, not only because it was the only show that came out after 2000 (with the partial exceptions of The Big O and Blue Submarine No. 6, which began in late 90s but didn't finish til after the turn of the millennium), but also because it was the only show on the lineup that was an Adult Swim show, as opposed to a Toonami show. But it was, nonetheless, part of Toonami tonight. And even though Bleach wasn't traditional Toonami fare, TOM's appearance, Steve Blum's familiar voice, and the fact that any anime was airing at all was more than enough to signal to the viewers that at least for tonight, the Toonami people missed was back.     An image that started circulating at the time  As the night went on and viewers saw how increasingly nostalgic the lineup became, the reminiscent fans couldn't help but express their excitement on social media—which, importantly, also helped to rapidly spread the word that this was happening. Searching for tweets and posts with words like “Toonami” or “Dragon Ball Z” during the night of March 31-April 1, 2012 showcases the elated thoughts of countless anime fans, intent to watch Toonami until its final moments—whatever plans they had for the upcoming morning be damned. So abundant were the tweets about it that “Toonami” (and some adjacent words/phrases like “Outlaw Star”, “Gundam Wing”, etc) quickly became one of the top trending topics on Twitter that evening. Said DeMarco about the fan reactions, “It was incredible, one of the first experiences of my life where I really saw the power of social media to create a collective experience around a particular event as it unfolds. Seeing it blow up on Twitter and watching the mentions just grow, and keep growing, was amazing. All of us were texting each other that night as the event unfolded, and we all stayed up all night having a blast reading the reactions. Just a super great experience for all of us. We came in to work the following Monday still excited and talking about how amazing the response was.”    The outpouring of love from fans was so immense that while the idea of bringing Toonami back began as a joke, it suddenly no longer felt like one to Adult Swim by that next day back at work. Thus, they tweeted that fans could let them know how badly they wanted Toonami to return permanently with the hashtag #BringBackToonami. Not only did this tweet itself garner well over 10,000 retweets (and get the hashtag trending in a matter of hours), but several voice actors and prominent entities in the anime industry even made their own posts featuring the hashtag. Fan made videos, Facebook pages, and petitions dedicated to supporting the hashtag began to appear one after the other. Nerdcore rapper Richie Branson even made a rap about it (which would later be used in an Adult Swim bumper). If it wasn't already abundantly obvious (which it was), then it was now: Now that they knew what Toonami was capable of (once again) being, and that it could air on Adult Swim rather than Cartoon Network, people wanted Toonami back for real.    After a little over a month of cheers to bring back Toonami, Adult Swim finally announced on May 16 with the hashtag  #ToonamisBackBitches that it would be back on Adult Swim (presumably indefinitely) in just a few days, the late night between May 26 and 27. The lineup, it was soon announced after a few days of speculation, would be three hours long and would then repeat itself (meaning it would be on air for a total of 6 hours) and would mostly be anime that had previously aired on Adult Swim such as Bleach and Cowboy Bebop, but also the new-to-U.S.-TV titles Casshern Sins and Deadman Wonderland (shows like Naruto and Dragon Ball Z, DeMarco tweeted, were simply too expensive).    Following the announcement, exuberant forum threads, blog posts, tweets, and videos about the hashtag's success and Toonami's confirmed revival plastered the walls of every online anime community. Richie Branson even made another rap about it to celebrate. In many ways, this marriage of Toonami and Adult Swim felt like a fitting one–they were already both on the same channel, both aired in the evening/at night, and a lot of anime fans spent their younger years in a Toonami to Adult Swim pipeline anyways. This felt perfect.     Despite all the anticipation and fanfare that led up to it, whether or not the night between May 26 and 27 was more than just moderately successful for Toonami depends on who you ask. While its revival made plenty of headlines, many fans lost interest when they saw its mostly-recycled lineup (many were hoping for a higher concentration of shows that either hadn't previously aired in the U.S. or aired in the 90s) which was largely the result of time and money constraints.    “Basically the reaction to [the April Fools] event, combined with the responses to [the Adult Swim tweet about bringing back Toonami], allowed us to come to Lazzo with a request to bring it back for real,” recalled DeMarco, “Gill and I had a plan within a week and brought him a way to do it CHEAP and FAST. And thankfully he said yes. We set a target launch date, and started sprinted towards that date immediately.""    Nonetheless, when ratings came to light a few days later, while they seemed good to many (Deadman Wonderland, for example, ranked #1 in its time slot among adults age 18-24), DeMarco would describe the Toonami revival's inaugural weekend as having gone, “OKAY. Not bad but not measurably better than the week before. We need to do better. Hopefully we will!”    Encouraged by better ratings the following week, (“We're doing well! I'm encouraged.” DeMarco tweeted about it) Toonami marched on—its impact on anime, while not as large as it once was, still tangible. A few weeks prior to its airing on Adult Swim, Deadman Wonderland was on 59,860 user's lists on MyAnimeList. A month into Toonami's revival (June 26), it went up to appearing on 66,110 lists even though it had long since finished airing in Japan (April-July 2011). Casshern Sins—which originally aired in Japan between 2008 and 2009—went from being on 26,671 user's lists on May 4, 2012, to 28,852 on June 28, 2012. These numbers neither 100% definitively prove how many people continually tuned in to this new Toonami, nor are they even particularly earth-shattering, but they do help to further illustrate the influence Toonami was having in the early days of its revival.    Despite the perilous times Adult Swim, like a lot of broadcast television, is currently trying to navigate, Toonami has remained a fixture of Adult Swim in the ten years since its revival began. It's since aired the wildly popular likes of My Hero Academia, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, One-Punch Man, The Promised Neverland, among plenty of other such anime. While it's less of the trendsetter it once was and more of a trend reaffirmer, it still feels much more like the generation-shaping Toonami people knew and loved in the 90s/early 2000s again (as opposed to the zombified state it was in throughout 2008). And Steve Blum, by the way, is still voicing TOM. Adult Swim has also since become more involved in anime than ever by way of producing a few projects (including, but not limited to, the recently announced Housing Complex C and two new seasons of FLCL).    2022 is a unique year for Toonami, as it gets to celebrate not only the 25th anniversary of its original airing, but also the 10th anniversary of its revival. “It's just amazing to me that this is the tenth year of the Adult Swim iteration of Toonami. It's very rare that a person gets to have a second chance at creative work once it's been cancelled or wrapped up by the rights holders,” reflected DeMarco, “It's something that in our case, only happened with the unique combination of fan love and network freedom that Toonami and Adult Swim have. It's been an amazing experience for all of us at Toonami, and one that never ceases to give us joy. We just hope we are giving that joy back.”    Below is the full interview that I had with DeMarco about how Toonami got brought back from the grave:    On April 1, 2012, Toonami once again aired as an April Fools Day joke, despite its 2008 cancellation. How involved were you in the process of making this happen?   Very much so. I believe it was actually Mike Lazzo's idea in one of our brainstorming meetings we had about April Fools. He brought it up as a lark, and Gill Austin and I immediately walked out of that meeting beginning to try to figure out how to pull it off with no time and no money.    What made you (and/or Adult Swim) want to bring Toonami back after its 2008 cancellation?   Well those of us who had worked on Toonami had made our peace with its cancellation. But when we were offered a small chance to bring it back we knew we had to try. It had become clear to us in the years after it was cancelled in 2008 that there were people who WANTED it back.    How (and when) did plans to bring Toonami back start?   I believe it was two and a half months before April Fools Day 2012. Usually Adult Swim has a brainstorm about what we might do for April Fools Day on any given year, where everyone throws out ideas and we see what sticks. Mike Lazzo tossed out “what if we just brought Toonami back for a night, just switched over and it was suddenly like you were in 1999 and watching Cartoon Network?” Everyone loved the idea immediately, and the conversation very quickly moved on to “how the heck can we pull this off?”    Was the plan always to bring it back via an April Fools Day joke? If not, how did that happen?   Previous to the April Fools conversation we had, I swear, never ONCE talked in any serious way about bringing Toonami back. We just didn't think it was possible.    How did the shows that aired for this get picked?   We made a list of what we thought were the definitive Toonami shows. Then we strategized with Kim Manning, our head of programming, how best to approach distributors to see who might be willing to give us a one time license for, like, one episode of a show. We had no idea at all if any of them would work with us on such a weird request.    How was the reception to the April Fools Day joke? Any particularly memorable reactions?   It was incredible, one of the first experiences of my life where I really saw the power of social media to create a collective experience around a particular event as it unfolds. Seeing it blow up on Twitter and watching the mentions just grow, and keep growing, was amazing. All of us were texting each other that night as the event unfolded, and we all stayed up all night having a blast reading the reactions. Just a super great experience for all of us. We came in to work the following Monday still excited and talking about how amazing the response was.    The call from fans to bring back Toonami after this April Fools Day joke was pretty much immediate, and the next day Adult Swim tweeted, ""Want it back? Let us know. #BringBackToonami""--did all this directly contribute to Toonami's full revival a few months later?   Very much so. Basically the reaction to the event, combined with the responses to that Tweet, allowed us to come to Lazzo with a request to bring it back for real. Gill and I had a plan within a week and brought him a way to do it CHEAP and FAST. And thankfully he said yes. We set a target launch date, and started sprinted towards that date immediately.    10 years later, and Adult Swim is more involved in anime production than ever, such as through 2 new seasons of FLCL, Housing Complex C, and Uzumaki. How important has the revival of Toonami been to all this?   It's interesting. Obviously, anime and action have been a part of Adult Swim's DNA since the network's beginning. And even without Toonami returning, it's highly likely that Adult Swim would still be airing anime. Whether or not they would air AS MUCH anime or action, and move into original productions… I don't know. I'm gonna say that would be unlikely without a weekly Toonami block.    Any other thoughts/reflections/fun facts about Toonami's 2012 April Fools Day joke?   Refection-wise, it's just amazing to me that this is the tenth year of the Adult Swim iteration of Toonami. It's very rare that a person gets to have a second chance at creative work once it's been cancelled or wrapped up by the rights holders. It's something that in our case,  only happened with the unique combination of fan love and network freedom that Toonami and Adult Swim have. It's been an amazing experience for all of us at Toonami, and one that never ceases to give us joy. We just hope we are giving that joy back.     discuss this in the forum (7 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Feature homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4, 'https://ew.com/article/2008/12/12/crazy-cult-room/': 1, 'https://twitter.com/adultswim/status/187004036824834049': 1, 'https://twitter.com/blumspew/status/188501360331857921': 1, 'https://twitter.com/LauraBaileyVO/status/191621438317404160': 1, 'https://twitter.com/VoiceOfOBrien/status/187017191344963585': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/funimation/posts/adult-swim-just-asked-on-twitter-tonight-adultswim-want-it-back-let-us-know-brin/378737742158052/': 1, 'https://twitter.com/WeAreAKon/status/187337710481047552': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlbbLFgiVQk': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNEsz347UBU': 1, 'https://twitter.com/adultswim/status/202866436597743616': 1, 'https://twitter.com/Clarknova1/status/204614840298385410': 1, 'https://twitter.com/Clarknova1/status/207971067497676800': 1, 'https://twitter.com/Clarknova1/status/212721465743781888': 1, 'https://web.archive.org/web/20120512015148/https://myanimelist.net/anime/6880/Deadman_Wonderland': 1, 'https://web.archive.org/web/20120626184052/https://myanimelist.net/anime/6880/Deadman_Wonderland': 1, 'https://web.archive.org/web/20120504115441/https://myanimelist.net/anime/4981/Casshern_Sins': 1, 'https://web.archive.org/web/20120628163229/https://myanimelist.net/anime/4981/Casshern_Sins': 1}"

How an April Fools Day Joke Revived Toonami   by Kennedy, Apr  1st 2022          By 2012, April Fools Day on Adult Swim had become a fun, albeit predictable, event. The nighttime programming block had fallen into the routine of airing The Room—a legendary 2003 independent film (which has been called “the Citizen Kane of bad movies”) spearheaded by cinematic Swiss army knife Tommy Wiseau. By midnight of April 1, 2012, nobody had any reason to believe that this year would be any different. The (excruciatingly long) opening credits sequence began, and for almost 30 whole seconds everything was the way it had been in the years before—until, that is, the movie faded to black for a moment, revealing that a dark blue robot was watching the movie. “Oh hi, Adult Swim,” the robot with Steve Blum's voice said, “I got the results of the test back. I definitely have April Fools.” The robot, as many anime fans instantly recognized, was TOM: the host of a beloved anime programming block called Toonami that aired on Cartoon Network between 1997 and 2008. A brief animation played after TOM made his quip, the Toonami logo appeared on-screen, and an episode of Bleach began to play. Without any warning, Toonami was airing on television for the first time in almost four years—and anime fans across the U.S. lost their collective mind.      To understand how this happened and why it was such a big deal, we first need to rewind back to the 2000s. Originally, the anime-and-action-cartoon programming block aired on weekday afternoons, but in 2004 it got moved to Saturday nights. It's hard to understate how massive a role Toonami played in anime's burst of popularity in the West throughout the 90s by shaping tastes and making anime more accessible in its heyday. Such was its success that within a few years, even Cartoon Network started airing some anime as well (the only anime it had ever aired before the debut of Toonami was Speed Racer). Furthermore, an adult-oriented nighttime programming block on the same channel called Adult Swim started up in 2001, and an anime called Cowboy Bebop was included in its original lineup. Over the years, both Cartoon Network and Adult Swim would continue to air more anime outside of Toonami (and in fact, Adult Swim even started its own anime-centric block called Adult Swim Action in 2002, which featured some anime that had previously aired on Toonami). But even then, Toonami still felt different. It had its own host (a robot named TOM, though he reincarnated a few times), its own lore, the occasional game review, and unlike Cartoon Network and Adult Swim, anime was a foremost part of Toonami's identity—it felt lovingly tailored specifically for anime fans in a way Cartoon Network and Adult Swim never would be. Dragon Ball Z, Sailor Moon, Naruto, and Gundam Wing are only a few of the anime that found massive success airing on Toonami, and dominated Western anime fan culture for several years.    But by 2008, Toonami had become a shadow of its former self. Once four-hours-long, it spent most of the year with its time cut in half and saturated with Naruto episodes—a far cry from the gateway to discovering a variety of new anime that it once was. The kids who grew up with Toonami's biggest hits like Dragon Ball Z and Sailor Moon were now older and looking for anime that felt a little more dark or mature. And while Toonami had the extremely popular Naruto, Adult Swim had the likes of InuYasha, Bleach, Fullmetal Alchemist, and Cowboy Bebop among plenty of other immensely successful anime that fit the bill—quality and quantity. While anime was never Adult Swim's primary focus, it had nonetheless become an anime powerhouse in its own right, and seemed to take over Toonami's status as the U.S.'s largest anime tastemaker in the mid and late 2000s. Factoring in the massive recession happening on top of all this, and the only thing shocking about Cartoon Network's announcing the cancellation of Toonami at Anime Weekend Atlanta 2008 (they cited declining viewership as the reason why) was how Toonami managed to last as long as it did. The final Toonami block would air the same evening the announcement was made: September 20, 2008.    Much to the disappointment of longtime fans, Toonami didn't go out with so much as a fizzle. Its time wasn't extended, it didn't re-run any of its classic hits—nothing was out of the ordinary. It was the same two-hour block it had been for some time, half of which was spent airing Naruto (the other half was an episode of Ben 10: Alien Force, followed by an episode of Samurai Jack). If not for a clip of TOM saying goodbye at the end, then that evening's block wouldn't have felt like an ending for anything—let alone a once-great programming block that managed to stay on the air for 11 years. While saddened by it, most fans discussing the announcement online seemed to be understanding of the decision, and accepted it pretty quickly. In Memoriam-style posts and content looking back fondly on Toonami's glory days and wondering where it all went wrong (when Toonami got moved to Saturday nights probably marked the beginning of the end, many agreed) seemed to outnumber petitions to undo the cancellation and outraged posts by a landslide. Thus quietly ended Toonami.      In the years following Toonami's cancellation, any lingering conversations about it amongst fans were usually less about bringing it back, and more about being nostalgic for its late 90s/early 2000s lineups. People missed Toonami, that much was clear, but they missed a certain type of Toonami. They missed the anime-centric block that was chock-loaded with a variety of iconic hits—not the glorified Naruto block it eventually became. But with Cartoon Network airing fewer and fewer anime, the idea that Toonami would ever come back seemed less likely than ever.    Enter fellow-programming block Adult Swim in the early months of 2012.    “Usually Adult Swim has a brainstorm about what we might do for April Fools Day on any given year, where everyone throws out ideas and we see what sticks,” recalled Toonami co-creator Jason DeMarco, “Mike Lazzo tossed out “what if we just brought Toonami back for a night, just switched over and it was suddenly like you were in 1999 and watching Cartoon Network?” Everyone loved the idea immediately, and the conversation very quickly moved on to “how the heck can we pull this off?””    Considering the dilapidated state of Toonami at the time of its cancellation, it comes as little shock that—per DeMarco—there hadn't been any meaningful conversations about getting it back on the air prior to this meeting. (“Previous to the April Fools conversation we had, I swear, never ONCE talked in any serious way about bringing Toonami back. We just didn't think it was possible.”) This idea to bring Toonami back for a night must've felt as sudden and out-of-the-blue as any idea possibly could've been—but this speed bump wasn't enough to stop the April Fools Toonami revival from happening.    With only a few months to plan everything, Adult Swim's work was cut out for them. “We made a list of what we thought were the definitive Toonami shows,” said DeMarco. “Then we strategized with Kim Manning, our head of programming, how best to approach distributors to see who might be willing to give us a one time license for, like, one episode of a show. We had no idea at all if any of them would work with us on such a weird request.”    Just like the original vision for this idea, the lineup Adult Swim ultimately ended up with was one that mostly felt like it could've pulled straight out of a schedule from 1999: Bleach, Dragon Ball Z, Gundam Wing, Tenchi Muyo!, Outlaw Star, The Big O, Yu-Yu Hakusho, Blue Submarine No. 6, Trigun, Astro Boy, and ending the night with Gigantor. Bleach was a particularly interesting addition to this lineup, not only because it was the only show that came out after 2000 (with the partial exceptions of The Big O and Blue Submarine No. 6, which began in late 90s but didn't finish til after the turn of the millennium), but also because it was the only show on the lineup that was an Adult Swim show, as opposed to a Toonami show. But it was, nonetheless, part of Toonami tonight. And even though Bleach wasn't traditional Toonami fare, TOM's appearance, Steve Blum's familiar voice, and the fact that any anime was airing at all was more than enough to signal to the viewers that at least for tonight, the Toonami people missed was back.     An image that started circulating at the time  As the night went on and viewers saw how increasingly nostalgic the lineup became, the reminiscent fans couldn't help but express their excitement on social media—which, importantly, also helped to rapidly spread the word that this was happening. Searching for tweets and posts with words like “Toonami” or “Dragon Ball Z” during the night of March 31-April 1, 2012 showcases the elated thoughts of countless anime fans, intent to watch Toonami until its final moments—whatever plans they had for the upcoming morning be damned. So abundant were the tweets about it that “Toonami” (and some adjacent words/phrases like “Outlaw Star”, “Gundam Wing”, etc) quickly became one of the top trending topics on Twitter that evening. Said DeMarco about the fan reactions, “It was incredible, one of the first experiences of my life where I really saw the power of social media to create a collective experience around a particular event as it unfolds. Seeing it blow up on Twitter and watching the mentions just grow, and keep growing, was amazing. All of us were texting each other that night as the event unfolded, and we all stayed up all night having a blast reading the reactions. Just a super great experience for all of us. We came in to work the following Monday still excited and talking about how amazing the response was.”    The outpouring of love from fans was so immense that while the idea of bringing Toonami back began as a joke, it suddenly no longer felt like one to Adult Swim by that next day back at work. Thus, they tweeted that fans could let them know how badly they wanted Toonami to return permanently with the hashtag #BringBackToonami. Not only did this tweet itself garner well over 10,000 retweets (and get the hashtag trending in a matter of hours), but several voice actors and prominent entities in the anime industry even made their own posts featuring the hashtag. Fan made videos, Facebook pages, and petitions dedicated to supporting the hashtag began to appear one after the other. Nerdcore rapper Richie Branson even made a rap about it (which would later be used in an Adult Swim bumper). If it wasn't already abundantly obvious (which it was), then it was now: Now that they knew what Toonami was capable of (once again) being, and that it could air on Adult Swim rather than Cartoon Network, people wanted Toonami back for real.    After a little over a month of cheers to bring back Toonami, Adult Swim finally announced on May 16 with the hashtag  #ToonamisBackBitches that it would be back on Adult Swim (presumably indefinitely) in just a few days, the late night between May 26 and 27. The lineup, it was soon announced after a few days of speculation, would be three hours long and would then repeat itself (meaning it would be on air for a total of 6 hours) and would mostly be anime that had previously aired on Adult Swim such as Bleach and Cowboy Bebop, but also the new-to-U.S.-TV titles Casshern Sins and Deadman Wonderland (shows like Naruto and Dragon Ball Z, DeMarco tweeted, were simply too expensive).    Following the announcement, exuberant forum threads, blog posts, tweets, and videos about the hashtag's success and Toonami's confirmed revival plastered the walls of every online anime community. Richie Branson even made another rap about it to celebrate. In many ways, this marriage of Toonami and Adult Swim felt like a fitting one–they were already both on the same channel, both aired in the evening/at night, and a lot of anime fans spent their younger years in a Toonami to Adult Swim pipeline anyways. This felt perfect.     Despite all the anticipation and fanfare that led up to it, whether or not the night between May 26 and 27 was more than just moderately successful for Toonami depends on who you ask. While its revival made plenty of headlines, many fans lost interest when they saw its mostly-recycled lineup (many were hoping for a higher concentration of shows that either hadn't previously aired in the U.S. or aired in the 90s) which was largely the result of time and money constraints.    “Basically the reaction to [the April Fools] event, combined with the responses to [the Adult Swim tweet about bringing back Toonami], allowed us to come to Lazzo with a request to bring it back for real,” recalled DeMarco, “Gill and I had a plan within a week and brought him a way to do it CHEAP and FAST. And thankfully he said yes. We set a target launch date, and started sprinted towards that date immediately.""    Nonetheless, when ratings came to light a few days later, while they seemed good to many (Deadman Wonderland, for example, ranked #1 in its time slot among adults age 18-24), DeMarco would describe the Toonami revival's inaugural weekend as having gone, “OKAY. Not bad but not measurably better than the week before. We need to do better. Hopefully we will!”    Encouraged by better ratings the following week, (“We're doing well! I'm encouraged.” DeMarco tweeted about it) Toonami marched on—its impact on anime, while not as large as it once was, still tangible. A few weeks prior to its airing on Adult Swim, Deadman Wonderland was on 59,860 user's lists on MyAnimeList. A month into Toonami's revival (June 26), it went up to appearing on 66,110 lists even though it had long since finished airing in Japan (April-July 2011). Casshern Sins—which originally aired in Japan between 2008 and 2009—went from being on 26,671 user's lists on May 4, 2012, to 28,852 on June 28, 2012. These numbers neither 100% definitively prove how many people continually tuned in to this new Toonami, nor are they even particularly earth-shattering, but they do help to further illustrate the influence Toonami was having in the early days of its revival.    Despite the perilous times Adult Swim, like a lot of broadcast television, is currently trying to navigate, Toonami has remained a fixture of Adult Swim in the ten years since its revival began. It's since aired the wildly popular likes of My Hero Academia, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, One-Punch Man, The Promised Neverland, among plenty of other such anime. While it's less of the trendsetter it once was and more of a trend reaffirmer, it still feels much more like the generation-shaping Toonami people knew and loved in the 90s/early 2000s again (as opposed to the zombified state it was in throughout 2008). And Steve Blum, by the way, is still voicing TOM. Adult Swim has also since become more involved in anime than ever by way of producing a few projects (including, but not limited to, the recently announced Housing Complex C and two new seasons of FLCL).    2022 is a unique year for Toonami, as it gets to celebrate not only the 25th anniversary of its original airing, but also the 10th anniversary of its revival. “It's just amazing to me that this is the tenth year of the Adult Swim iteration of Toonami. It's very rare that a person gets to have a second chance at creative work once it's been cancelled or wrapped up by the rights holders,” reflected DeMarco, “It's something that in our case, only happened with the unique combination of fan love and network freedom that Toonami and Adult Swim have. It's been an amazing experience for all of us at Toonami, and one that never ceases to give us joy. We just hope we are giving that joy back.”    Below is the full interview that I had with DeMarco about how Toonami got brought back from the grave:    On April 1, 2012, Toonami once again aired as an April Fools Day joke, despite its 2008 cancellation. How involved were you in the process of making this happen?   Very much so. I believe it was actually Mike Lazzo's idea in one of our brainstorming meetings we had about April Fools. He brought it up as a lark, and Gill Austin and I immediately walked out of that meeting beginning to try to figure out how to pull it off with no time and no money.    What made you (and/or Adult Swim) want to bring Toonami back after its 2008 cancellation?   Well those of us who had worked on Toonami had made our peace with its cancellation. But when we were offered a small chance to bring it back we knew we had to try. It had become clear to us in the years after it was cancelled in 2008 that there were people who WANTED it back.    How (and when) did plans to bring Toonami back start?   I believe it was two and a half months before April Fools Day 2012. Usually Adult Swim has a brainstorm about what we might do for April Fools Day on any given year, where everyone throws out ideas and we see what sticks. Mike Lazzo tossed out “what if we just brought Toonami back for a night, just switched over and it was suddenly like you were in 1999 and watching Cartoon Network?” Everyone loved the idea immediately, and the conversation very quickly moved on to “how the heck can we pull this off?”    Was the plan always to bring it back via an April Fools Day joke? If not, how did that happen?   Previous to the April Fools conversation we had, I swear, never ONCE talked in any serious way about bringing Toonami back. We just didn't think it was possible.    How did the shows that aired for this get picked?   We made a list of what we thought were the definitive Toonami shows. Then we strategized with Kim Manning, our head of programming, how best to approach distributors to see who might be willing to give us a one time license for, like, one episode of a show. We had no idea at all if any of them would work with us on such a weird request.    How was the reception to the April Fools Day joke? Any particularly memorable reactions?   It was incredible, one of the first experiences of my life where I really saw the power of social media to create a collective experience around a particular event as it unfolds. Seeing it blow up on Twitter and watching the mentions just grow, and keep growing, was amazing. All of us were texting each other that night as the event unfolded, and we all stayed up all night having a blast reading the reactions. Just a super great experience for all of us.

Whether or not they would air AS MUCH anime or action, and move into original productions… I don't know. I'm gonna say that would be unlikely without a weekly Toonami block.

But by 2008, Toonami had become a shadow of its former self. Once four-hours-long, it spent most of the year with its time cut in half and saturated with Naruto episodes—a far cry from the gateway to discovering a variety of new anime that it once was. The kids who grew up with Toonami's biggest hits like Dragon Ball Z and Sailor Moon were now older and looking for anime that felt a little more dark or mature. And while Toonami had the extremely popular Naruto, Adult Swim had the likes of InuYasha, Bleach, Fullmetal Alchemist, and Cowboy Bebop among plenty of other immensely successful anime that fit the bill—quality and quantity. While anime was never Adult Swim's primary focus, it had nonetheless become an anime powerhouse in its own right, and seemed to take over Toonami's status as the U.S.'s largest anime tastemaker in the mid and late 2000s. Factoring in the massive recession happening on top of all this, and the only thing shocking about Cartoon Network's announcing the cancellation of Toonami at Anime Weekend Atlanta 2008 (they cited declining viewership as the reason why) was how Toonami managed to last as long as it did. The final Toonami block would air the same evening the announcement was made: September 20, 2008.    Much to the disappointment of longtime fans, Toonami didn't go out with so much as a fizzle. Its time wasn't extended, it didn't re-run any of its classic hits—nothing was out of the ordinary. It was the same two-hour block it had been for some time, half of which was spent airing Naruto (the other half was an episode of Ben 10: Alien Force, followed by an episode of Samurai Jack). If not for a clip of TOM saying goodbye at the end, then that evening's block wouldn't have felt like an ending for anything—let alone a once-great programming block that managed to stay on the air for 11 years. While saddened by it, most fans discussing the announcement online seemed to be understanding of the decision, and accepted it pretty quickly. In Memoriam-style posts and content looking back fondly on Toonami's glory days and wondering where it all went wrong (when Toonami got moved to Saturday nights probably marked the beginning of the end, many agreed) seemed to outnumber petitions to undo the cancellation and outraged posts by a landslide. Thus quietly ended Toonami.      In the years following Toonami's cancellation, any lingering conversations about it amongst fans were usually less about bringing it back, and more about being nostalgic for its late 90s/early 2000s lineups. People missed Toonami, that much was clear, but they missed a certain type of Toonami. They missed the anime-centric block that was chock-loaded with a variety of iconic hits—not the glorified Naruto block it eventually became. But with Cartoon Network airing fewer and fewer anime, the idea that Toonami would ever come back seemed less likely than ever.    Enter fellow-programming block Adult Swim in the early months of 2012.    “Usually Adult Swim has a brainstorm about what we might do for April Fools Day on any given year, where everyone throws out ideas and we see what sticks,” recalled Toonami co-creator Jason DeMarco, “Mike Lazzo tossed out “what if we just brought Toonami back for a night, just switched over and it was suddenly like you were in 1999 and watching Cartoon Network?” Everyone loved the idea immediately, and the conversation very quickly moved on to “how the heck can we pull this off?””    Considering the dilapidated state of Toonami at the time of its cancellation, it comes as little shock that—per DeMarco—there hadn't been any meaningful conversations about getting it back on the air prior to this meeting. (“Previous to the April Fools conversation we had, I swear, never ONCE talked in any serious way about bringing Toonami back. We just didn't think it was possible.”) This idea to bring Toonami back for a night must've felt as sudden and out-of-the-blue as any idea possibly could've been—but this speed bump wasn't enough to stop the April Fools Toonami revival from happening.    With only a few months to plan everything, Adult Swim's work was cut out for them. “We made a list of what we thought were the definitive Toonami shows,” said DeMarco. “Then we strategized with Kim Manning, our head of programming, how best to approach distributors to see who might be willing to give us a one time license for, like, one episode of a show. We had no idea at all if any of them would work with us on such a weird request.”    Just like the original vision for this idea, the lineup Adult Swim ultimately ended up with was one that mostly felt like it could've pulled straight out of a schedule from 1999: Bleach, Dragon Ball Z, Gundam Wing, Tenchi Muyo!, Outlaw Star, The Big O, Yu-Yu Hakusho, Blue Submarine No. 6, Trigun, Astro Boy, and ending the night with Gigantor. Bleach was a particularly interesting addition to this lineup, not only because it was the only show that came out after 2000 (with the partial exceptions of The Big O and Blue Submarine No. 6, which began in late 90s but didn't finish til after the turn of the millennium), but also because it was the only show on the lineup that was an Adult Swim show, as opposed to a Toonami show. But it was, nonetheless, part of Toonami tonight. And even though Bleach wasn't traditional Toonami fare, TOM's appearance, Steve Blum's familiar voice, and the fact that any anime was airing at all was more than enough to signal to the viewers that at least for tonight, the Toonami people missed was back.     An image that started circulating at the time  As the night went on and viewers saw how increasingly nostalgic the lineup became, the reminiscent fans couldn't help but express their excitement on social media—which, importantly, also helped to rapidly spread the word that this was happening. Searching for tweets and posts with words like “Toonami” or “Dragon Ball Z” during the night of March 31-April 1, 2012 showcases the elated thoughts of countless anime fans, intent to watch Toonami until its final moments—whatever plans they had for the upcoming morning be damned. So abundant were the tweets about it that “Toonami” (and some adjacent words/phrases like “Outlaw Star”, “Gundam Wing”, etc) quickly became one of the top trending topics on Twitter that evening. Said DeMarco about the fan reactions, “It was incredible, one of the first experiences of my life where I really saw the power of social media to create a collective experience around a particular event as it unfolds. Seeing it blow up on Twitter and watching the mentions just grow, and keep growing, was amazing. All of us were texting each other that night as the event unfolded, and we all stayed up all night having a blast reading the reactions. Just a super great experience for all of us. We came in to work the following Monday still excited and talking about how amazing the response was.”    The outpouring of love from fans was so immense that while the idea of bringing Toonami back began as a joke, it suddenly no longer felt like one to Adult Swim by that next day back at work. Thus, they tweeted that fans could let them know how badly they wanted Toonami to return permanently with the hashtag #BringBackToonami. Not only did this tweet itself garner well over 10,000 retweets (and get the hashtag trending in a matter of hours), but several voice actors and prominent entities in the anime industry even made their own posts featuring the hashtag. Fan made videos, Facebook pages, and petitions dedicated to supporting the hashtag began to appear one after the other. Nerdcore rapper Richie Branson even made a rap about it (which would later be used in an Adult Swim bumper). If it wasn't already abundantly obvious (which it was), then it was now: Now that they knew what Toonami was capable of (once again) being, and that it could air on Adult Swim rather than Cartoon Network, people wanted Toonami back for real.    After a little over a month of cheers to bring back Toonami, Adult Swim finally announced on May 16 with the hashtag  #ToonamisBackBitches that it would be back on Adult Swim (presumably indefinitely) in just a few days, the late night between May 26 and 27. The lineup, it was soon announced after a few days of speculation, would be three hours long and would then repeat itself (meaning it would be on air for a total of 6 hours) and would mostly be anime that had previously aired on Adult Swim such as Bleach and Cowboy Bebop, but also the new-to-U.S.-TV titles Casshern Sins and Deadman Wonderland (shows like Naruto and Dragon Ball Z, DeMarco tweeted, were simply too expensive).    Following the announcement, exuberant forum threads, blog posts, tweets, and videos about the hashtag's success and Toonami's confirmed revival plastered the walls of every online anime community. Richie Branson even made another rap about it to celebrate. In many ways, this marriage of Toonami and Adult Swim felt like a fitting one–they were already both on the same channel, both aired in the evening/at night, and a lot of anime fans spent their younger years in a Toonami to Adult Swim pipeline anyways. This felt perfect.     Despite all the anticipation and fanfare that led up to it, whether or not the night between May 26 and 27 was more than just moderately successful for Toonami depends on who you ask. While its revival made plenty of headlines, many fans lost interest when they saw its mostly-recycled lineup (many were hoping for a higher concentration of shows that either hadn't previously aired in the U.S. or aired in the 90s) which was largely the result of time and money constraints.    “Basically the reaction to [the April Fools] event, combined with the responses to [the Adult Swim tweet about bringing back Toonami], allowed us to come to Lazzo with a request to bring it back for real,” recalled DeMarco, “Gill and I had a plan within a week and brought him a way to do it CHEAP and FAST. And thankfully he said yes. We set a target launch date, and started sprinted towards that date immediately.""    Nonetheless, when ratings came to light a few days later, while they seemed good to many (Deadman Wonderland, for example, ranked #1 in its time slot among adults age 18-24), DeMarco would describe the Toonami revival's inaugural weekend as having gone, “OKAY. Not bad but not measurably better than the week before. We need to do better. Hopefully we will!”    Encouraged by better ratings the following week, (“We're doing well! I'm encouraged.” DeMarco tweeted about it) Toonami marched on—its impact on anime, while not as large as it once was, still tangible. A few weeks prior to its airing on Adult Swim, Deadman Wonderland was on 59,860 user's lists on MyAnimeList. A month into Toonami's revival (June 26), it went up to appearing on 66,110 lists even though it had long since finished airing in Japan (April-July 2011). Casshern Sins—which originally aired in Japan between 2008 and 2009—went from being on 26,671 user's lists on May 4, 2012, to 28,852 on June 28, 2012. These numbers neither 100% definitively prove how many people continually tuned in to this new Toonami, nor are they even particularly earth-shattering, but they do help to further illustrate the influence Toonami was having in the early days of its revival.    Despite the perilous times Adult Swim, like a lot of broadcast television, is currently trying to navigate, Toonami has remained a fixture of Adult Swim in the ten years since its revival began. It's since aired the wildly popular likes of My Hero Academia, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, One-Punch Man, The Promised Neverland, among plenty of other such anime. While it's less of the trendsetter it once was and more of a trend reaffirmer, it still feels much more like the generation-shaping Toonami people knew and loved in the 90s/early 2000s again (as opposed to the zombified state it was in throughout 2008). And Steve Blum, by the way, is still voicing TOM. Adult Swim has also since become more involved in anime than ever by way of producing a few projects (including, but not limited to, the recently announced Housing Complex C and two new seasons of FLCL).    2022 is a unique year for Toonami, as it gets to celebrate not only the 25th anniversary of its original airing, but also the 10th anniversary of its revival. “It's just amazing to me that this is the tenth year of the Adult Swim iteration of Toonami. It's very rare that a person gets to have a second chance at creative work once it's been cancelled or wrapped up by the rights holders,” reflected DeMarco, “It's something that in our case, only happened with the unique combination of fan love and network freedom that Toonami and Adult Swim have. It's been an amazing experience for all of us at Toonami, and one that never ceases to give us joy. We just hope we are giving that joy back.”    Below is the full interview that I had with DeMarco about how Toonami got brought back from the grave:    On April 1, 2012, Toonami once again aired as an April Fools Day joke, despite its 2008 cancellation. How involved were you in the process of making this happen?   Very much so. I believe it was actually Mike Lazzo's idea in one of our brainstorming meetings we had about April Fools. He brought it up as a lark, and Gill Austin and I immediately walked out of that meeting beginning to try to figure out how to pull it off with no time and no money.    What made you (and/or Adult Swim) want to bring Toonami back after its 2008 cancellation?   Well those of us who had worked on Toonami had made our peace with its cancellation. But when we were offered a small chance to bring it back we knew we had to try. It had become clear to us in the years after it was cancelled in 2008 that there were people who WANTED it back.    How (and when) did plans to bring Toonami back start?   I believe it was two and a half months before April Fools Day 2012. Usually Adult Swim has a brainstorm about what we might do for April Fools Day on any given year, where everyone throws out ideas and we see what sticks. Mike Lazzo tossed out “what if we just brought Toonami back for a night, just switched over and it was suddenly like you were in 1999 and watching Cartoon Network?” Everyone loved the idea immediately, and the conversation very quickly moved on to “how the heck can we pull this off?”    Was the plan always to bring it back via an April Fools Day joke? If not, how did that happen?   Previous to the April Fools conversation we had, I swear, never ONCE talked in any serious way about bringing Toonami back. We just didn't think it was possible.    How did the shows that aired for this get picked?   We made a list of what we thought were the definitive Toonami shows. Then we strategized with Kim Manning, our head of programming, how best to approach distributors to see who might be willing to give us a one time license for, like, one episode of a show. We had no idea at all if any of them would work with us on such a weird request.    How was the reception to the April Fools Day joke? Any particularly memorable reactions?   It was incredible, one of the first experiences of my life where I really saw the power of social media to create a collective experience around a particular event as it unfolds. Seeing it blow up on Twitter and watching the mentions just grow, and keep growing, was amazing. All of us were texting each other that night as the event unfolded, and we all stayed up all night having a blast reading the reactions. Just a super great experience for all of us. We came in to work the following Monday still excited and talking about how amazing the response was.    The call from fans to bring back Toonami after this April Fools Day joke was pretty much immediate, and the next day Adult Swim tweeted, ""Want it back? Let us know. #BringBackToonami""--did all this directly contribute to Toonami's full revival a few months later?   Very much so. Basically the reaction to the event, combined with the responses to that Tweet, allowed us to come to Lazzo with a request to bring it back for real. Gill and I had a plan within a week and brought him a way to do it CHEAP and FAST. And thankfully he said yes. We set a target launch date, and started sprinted towards that date immediately.    10 years later, and Adult Swim is more involved in anime production than ever, such as through 2 new seasons of FLCL, Housing Complex C, and Uzumaki. How important has the revival of Toonami been to all this?   It's interesting. Obviously, anime and action have been a part of Adult Swim's DNA since the network's beginning. And even without Toonami returning, it's highly likely that Adult Swim would still be airing anime. Whether or not they would air AS MUCH anime or action, and move into original productions… I don't know. I'm gonna say that would be unlikely without a weekly Toonami block.    Any other thoughts/reflections/fun facts about Toonami's 2012 April Fools Day joke?   Refection-wise, it's just amazing to me that this is the tenth year of the Adult Swim iteration of Toonami. It's very rare that a person gets to have a second chance at creative work once it's been cancelled or wrapped up by the rights holders. It's something that in our case,  only happened with the unique combination of fan love and network freedom that Toonami and Adult Swim have. It's been an amazing experience for all of us at Toonami, and one that never ceases to give us joy. We just hope we are giving that joy back.     discuss this in the forum (7 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Feature homepage / archives      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4, 'https://ew.com/article/2008/12/12/crazy-cult-room/': 1, 'https://twitter.com/adultswim/status/187004036824834049': 1, 'https://twitter.com/blumspew/status/188501360331857921': 1, 'https://twitter.com/LauraBaileyVO/status/191621438317404160': 1, 'https://twitter.com/VoiceOfOBrien/status/187017191344963585': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/funimation/posts/adult-swim-just-asked-on-twitter-tonight-adultswim-want-it-back-let-us-know-brin/378737742158052/': 1, 'https://twitter.com/WeAreAKon/status/187337710481047552': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlbbLFgiVQk': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNEsz347UBU': 1, 'https://twitter.com/adultswim/status/202866436597743616': 1, 'https://twitter.com/Clarknova1/status/204614840298385410': 1, 'https://twitter.com/Clarknova1/status/207971067497676800': 1, 'https://twitter.com/Clarknova1/status/212721465743781888': 1, 'https://web.archive.org/web/20120512015148/https://myanimelist.net/anime/6880/Deadman_Wonderland': 1, 'https://web.archive.org/web/20120626184052/https://myanimelist.net/anime/6880/Deadman_Wonderland': 1, 'https://web.archive.org/web/20120504115441/https://myanimelist.net/anime/4981/Casshern_Sins': 1, 'https://web.archive.org/web/20120628163229/https://myanimelist.net/anime/4981/Casshern_Sins': 1}"

The nighttime programming block had fallen into the routine of airing The Room—a legendary 2003 independent film (which has been called “the Citizen Kane of bad movies”) spearheaded by cinematic Swiss army knife Tommy Wiseau. By midnight of April 1, 2012, nobody had any reason to believe that this year would be any different. The (excruciatingly long) opening credits sequence began, and for almost 30 whole seconds everything was the way it had been in the years before—until, that is, the movie faded to black for a moment, revealing that a dark blue robot was watching the movie. “Oh hi, Adult Swim,” the robot with Steve Blum's voice said, “I got the results of the test back. I definitely have April Fools.” The robot, as many anime fans instantly recognized, was TOM: the host of a beloved anime programming block called Toonami that aired on Cartoon Network between 1997 and 2008. A brief animation played after TOM made his quip, the Toonami logo appeared on-screen, and an episode of Bleach began to play. Without any warning, Toonami was airing on television for the first time in almost four years—and anime fans across the U.S. lost their collective mind.      To understand how this happened and why it was such a big deal, we first need to rewind back to the 2000s. Originally, the anime-and-action-cartoon programming block aired on weekday afternoons, but in 2004 it got moved to Saturday nights. It's hard to understate how massive a role Toonami played in anime's burst of popularity in the West throughout the 90s by shaping tastes and making anime more accessible in its heyday. Such was its success that within a few years, even Cartoon Network started airing some anime as well (the only anime it had ever aired before the debut of Toonami was Speed Racer). Furthermore, an adult-oriented nighttime programming block on the same channel called Adult Swim started up in 2001, and an anime called Cowboy Bebop was included in its original lineup. Over the years, both Cartoon Network and Adult Swim would continue to air more anime outside of Toonami (and in fact, Adult Swim even started its own anime-centric block called Adult Swim Action in 2002, which featured some anime that had previously aired on Toonami). But even then, Toonami still felt different. It had its own host (a robot named TOM, though he reincarnated a few times), its own lore, the occasional game review, and unlike Cartoon Network and Adult Swim, anime was a foremost part of Toonami's identity—it felt lovingly tailored specifically for anime fans in a way Cartoon Network and Adult Swim never would be. Dragon Ball Z, Sailor Moon, Naruto, and Gundam Wing are only a few of the anime that found massive success airing on Toonami, and dominated Western anime fan culture for several years.    But by 2008, Toonami had become a shadow of its former self.

And while Toonami had the extremely popular Naruto, Adult Swim had the likes of InuYasha, Bleach, Fullmetal Alchemist, and Cowboy Bebop among plenty of other immensely successful anime that fit the bill—quality and quantity.

While its revival made plenty of headlines, many fans lost interest when they saw its mostly-recycled lineup (many were hoping for a higher concentration of shows that either hadn't previously aired in the U.S. or aired in the 90s) which was largely the result of time and money constraints.    “Basically the reaction to [the April Fools] event, combined with the responses to [the Adult Swim tweet about bringing back Toonami], allowed us to come to Lazzo with a request to bring it back for real,” recalled DeMarco, “Gill and I had a plan within a week and brought him a way to do it CHEAP and FAST. And thankfully he said yes. We set a target launch date, and started sprinted towards that date immediately.""    Nonetheless, when ratings came to light a few days later, while they seemed good to many (Deadman Wonderland, for example, ranked #1 in its time slot among adults age 18-24), DeMarco would describe the Toonami revival's inaugural weekend as having gone, “OKAY. Not bad but not measurably better than the week before. We need to do better. Hopefully we will!”    Encouraged by better ratings the following week, (“We're doing well! I'm encouraged.” DeMarco tweeted about it) Toonami marched on—its impact on anime, while not as large as it once was, still tangible. A few weeks prior to its airing on Adult Swim, Deadman Wonderland was on 59,860 user's lists on MyAnimeList. A month into Toonami's revival (June 26), it went up to appearing on 66,110 lists even though it had long since finished airing in Japan (April-July 2011). Casshern Sins—which originally aired in Japan between 2008 and 2009—went from being on 26,671 user's lists on May 4, 2012, to 28,852 on June 28, 2012. These numbers neither 100% definitively prove how many people continually tuned in to this new Toonami, nor are they even particularly earth-shattering, but they do help to further illustrate the influence Toonami was having in the early days of its revival.    Despite the perilous times Adult Swim, like a lot of broadcast television, is currently trying to navigate, Toonami has remained a fixture of Adult Swim in the ten years since its revival began. It's since aired the wildly popular likes of My Hero Academia, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, One-Punch Man, The Promised Neverland, among plenty of other such anime. While it's less of the trendsetter it once was and more of a trend reaffirmer, it still feels much more like the generation-shaping Toonami people knew and loved in the 90s/early 2000s again (as opposed to the zombified state it was in throughout 2008). And Steve Blum, by the way, is still voicing TOM. Adult Swim has also since become more involved in anime than ever by way of producing a few projects (including, but not limited to, the recently announced Housing Complex C and two new seasons of FLCL).    2022 is a unique year for Toonami, as it gets to celebrate not only the 25th anniversary of its original airing, but also the 10th anniversary of its revival. “It's just amazing to me that this is the tenth year of the Adult Swim iteration of Toonami. It's very rare that a person gets to have a second chance at creative work once it's been cancelled or wrapped up by the rights holders,” reflected DeMarco, “It's something that in our case, only happened with the unique combination of fan love and network freedom that Toonami and Adult Swim have. It's been an amazing experience for all of us at Toonami, and one that never ceases to give us joy. We just hope we are giving that joy back.”    Below is the full interview that I had with DeMarco about how Toonami got brought back from the grave:    On April 1, 2012, Toonami once again aired as an April Fools Day joke, despite its 2008 cancellation. How involved were you in the process of making this happen?   Very much so. I believe it was actually Mike Lazzo's idea in one of our brainstorming meetings we had about April Fools. He brought it up as a lark, and Gill Austin and I immediately walked out of that meeting beginning to try to figure out how to pull it off with no time and no money.    What made you (and/or Adult Swim) want to bring Toonami back after its 2008 cancellation?   Well those of us who had worked on Toonami had made our peace with its cancellation. But when we were offered a small chance to bring it back we knew we had to try. It had become clear to us in the years after it was cancelled in 2008 that there were people who WANTED it back.    How (and when) did plans to bring Toonami back start?   I believe it was two and a half months before April Fools Day 2012. Usually Adult Swim has a brainstorm about what we might do for April Fools Day on any given year, where everyone throws out ideas and we see what sticks. Mike Lazzo tossed out “what if we just brought Toonami back for a night, just switched over and it was suddenly like you were in 1999 and watching Cartoon Network?” Everyone loved the idea immediately, and the conversation very quickly moved on to “how the heck can we pull this off?”    Was the plan always to bring it back via an April Fools Day joke? If not, how did that happen?   Previous to the April Fools conversation we had, I swear, never ONCE talked in any serious way about bringing Toonami back. We just didn't think it was possible.    How did the shows that aired for this get picked?   We made a list of what we thought were the definitive Toonami shows. Then we strategized with Kim Manning, our head of programming, how best to approach distributors to see who might be willing to give us a one time license for, like, one episode of a show. We had no idea at all if any of them would work with us on such a weird request.    How was the reception to the April Fools Day joke? Any particularly memorable reactions?   It was incredible, one of the first experiences of my life where I really saw the power of social media to create a collective experience around a particular event as it unfolds. Seeing it blow up on Twitter and watching the mentions just grow, and keep growing, was amazing. All of us were texting each other that night as the event unfolded, and we all stayed up all night having a blast reading the reactions. Just a super great experience for all of us. We came in to work the following Monday still excited and talking about how amazing the response was.    The call from fans to bring back Toonami after this April Fools Day joke was pretty much immediate, and the next day Adult Swim tweeted, ""Want it back? Let us know. #BringBackToonami""--did all this directly contribute to Toonami's full revival a few months later?   Very much so. Basically the reaction to the event, combined with the responses to that Tweet, allowed us to come to Lazzo with a request to bring it back for real. Gill and I had a plan within a week and brought him a way to do it CHEAP and FAST. And thankfully he said yes. We set a target launch date, and started sprinted towards that date immediately.    10 years later, and Adult Swim is more involved in anime production than ever, such as through 2 new seasons of FLCL, Housing Complex C, and Uzumaki. How important has the revival of Toonami been to all this?   It's interesting. Obviously, anime and action have been a part of Adult Swim's DNA since the network's beginning. And even without Toonami returning, it's highly likely that Adult Swim would still be airing anime. Whether or not they would air AS MUCH anime or action, and move into original productions… I don't know. I'm gonna say that would be unlikely without a weekly Toonami block.    Any other thoughts/reflections/fun facts about Toonami's 2012 April Fools Day joke?   Refection-wise, it's just amazing to me that this is the tenth year of the Adult Swim iteration of Toonami. It's very rare that a person gets to have a second chance at creative work once it's been cancelled or wrapped up by the rights holders. It's something that in our case,  only happened with the unique combination of fan love and network freedom that Toonami and Adult Swim have. It's been an amazing experience for all of us at Toonami, and one that never ceases to give us joy. We just hope we are giving that joy back.     discuss this in the forum (7 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Feature homepage / archives     ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4, 'https://ew.com/article/2008/12/12/crazy-cult-room/': 1, 'https://twitter.com/adultswim/status/187004036824834049': 1, 'https://twitter.com/blumspew/status/188501360331857921': 1, 'https://twitter.com/LauraBaileyVO/status/191621438317404160': 1, 'https://twitter.com/VoiceOfOBrien/status/187017191344963585': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/funimation/posts/adult-swim-just-asked-on-twitter-tonight-adultswim-want-it-back-let-us-know-brin/378737742158052/': 1, 'https://twitter.com/WeAreAKon/status/187337710481047552': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlbbLFgiVQk': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNEsz347UBU': 1, 'https://twitter.com/adultswim/status/202866436597743616': 1, 'https://twitter.com/Clarknova1/status/204614840298385410': 1, 'https://twitter.com/Clarknova1/status/207971067497676800': 1, 'https://twitter.com/Clarknova1/status/212721465743781888': 1, 'https://web.archive.org/web/20120512015148/https://myanimelist.net/anime/6880/Deadman_Wonderland': 1, 'https://web.archive.org/web/20120626184052/https://myanimelist.net/anime/6880/Deadman_Wonderland': 1, 'https://web.archive.org/web/20120504115441/https://myanimelist.net/anime/4981/Casshern_Sins': 1, 'https://web.archive.org/web/20120628163229/https://myanimelist.net/anime/4981/Casshern_Sins': 1}"

The nighttime programming block had fallen into the routine of airing The Room—a legendary 2003 independent film (which has been called “the Citizen Kane of bad movies”) spearheaded by cinematic Swiss army knife Tommy Wiseau. By midnight of April 1, 2012, nobody had any reason to believe that this year would be any different. The (excruciatingly long) opening credits sequence began, and for almost 30 whole seconds everything was the way it had been in the years before—until, that is, the movie faded to black for a moment, revealing that a dark blue robot was watching the movie. “Oh hi, Adult Swim,” the robot with Steve Blum's voice said, “I got the results of the test back. I definitely have April Fools.” The robot, as many anime fans instantly recognized, was TOM: the host of a beloved anime programming block called Toonami that aired on Cartoon Network between 1997 and 2008. A brief animation played after TOM made his quip, the Toonami logo appeared on-screen, and an episode of Bleach began to play. Without any warning, Toonami was airing on television for the first time in almost four years—and anime fans across the U.S. lost their collective mind.      To understand how this happened and why it was such a big deal, we first need to rewind back to the 2000s. Originally, the anime-and-action-cartoon programming block aired on weekday afternoons, but in 2004 it got moved to Saturday nights. It's hard to understate how massive a role Toonami played in anime's burst of popularity in the West throughout the 90s by shaping tastes and making anime more accessible in its heyday. Such was its success that within a few years, even Cartoon Network started airing some anime as well (the only anime it had ever aired before the debut of Toonami was Speed Racer). Furthermore, an adult-oriented nighttime programming block on the same channel called Adult Swim started up in 2001, and an anime called Cowboy Bebop was included in its original lineup. Over the years, both Cartoon Network and Adult Swim would continue to air more anime outside of Toonami (and in fact, Adult Swim even started its own anime-centric block called Adult Swim Action in 2002, which featured some anime that had previously aired on Toonami). But even then, Toonami still felt different. It had its own host (a robot named TOM, though he reincarnated a few times), its own lore, the occasional game review, and unlike Cartoon Network and Adult Swim, anime was a foremost part of Toonami's identity—it felt lovingly tailored specifically for anime fans in a way Cartoon Network and Adult Swim never would be. Dragon Ball Z, Sailor Moon, Naruto, and Gundam Wing are only a few of the anime that found massive success airing on Toonami, and dominated Western anime fan culture for several years.    But by 2008, Toonami had become a shadow of its former self. Once four-hours-long, it spent most of the year with its time cut in half and saturated with Naruto episodes—a far cry from the gateway to discovering a variety of new anime that it once was. The kids who grew up with Toonami's biggest hits like Dragon Ball Z and Sailor Moon were now older and looking for anime that felt a little more dark or mature. And while Toonami had the extremely popular Naruto, Adult Swim had the likes of InuYasha, Bleach, Fullmetal Alchemist, and Cowboy Bebop among plenty of other immensely successful anime that fit the bill—quality and quantity. While anime was never Adult Swim's primary focus, it had nonetheless become an anime powerhouse in its own right, and seemed to take over Toonami's status as the U.S.'s largest anime tastemaker in the mid and late 2000s. Factoring in the massive recession happening on top of all this, and the only thing shocking about Cartoon Network's announcing the cancellation of Toonami at Anime Weekend Atlanta 2008 (they cited declining viewership as the reason why) was how Toonami managed to last as long as it did. The final Toonami block would air the same evening the announcement was made: September 20, 2008.    Much to the disappointment of longtime fans, Toonami didn't go out with so much as a fizzle. Its time wasn't extended, it didn't re-run any of its classic hits—nothing was out of the ordinary. It was the same two-hour block it had been for some time, half of which was spent airing Naruto (the other half was an episode of Ben 10: Alien Force, followed by an episode of Samurai Jack). If not for a clip of TOM saying goodbye at the end, then that evening's block wouldn't have felt like an ending for anything—let alone a once-great programming block that managed to stay on the air for 11 years. While saddened by it, most fans discussing the announcement online seemed to be understanding of the decision, and accepted it pretty quickly. In Memoriam-style posts and content looking back fondly on Toonami's glory days and wondering where it all went wrong (when Toonami got moved to Saturday nights probably marked the beginning of the end, many agreed) seemed to outnumber petitions to undo the cancellation and outraged posts by a landslide. Thus quietly ended Toonami.      In the years following Toonami's cancellation, any lingering conversations about it amongst fans were usually less about bringing it back, and more about being nostalgic for its late 90s/early 2000s lineups. People missed Toonami, that much was clear, but they missed a certain type of Toonami. They missed the anime-centric block that was chock-loaded with a variety of iconic hits—not the glorified Naruto block it eventually became. But with Cartoon Network airing fewer and fewer anime, the idea that Toonami would ever come back seemed less likely than ever.    Enter fellow-programming block Adult Swim in the early months of 2012.    “Usually Adult Swim has a brainstorm about what we might do for April Fools Day on any given year, where everyone throws out ideas and we see what sticks,” recalled Toonami co-creator Jason DeMarco, “Mike Lazzo tossed out “what if we just brought Toonami back for a night, just switched over and it was suddenly like you were in 1999 and watching Cartoon Network?” Everyone loved the idea immediately, and the conversation very quickly moved on to “how the heck can we pull this off?””    Considering the dilapidated state of Toonami at the time of its cancellation, it comes as little shock that—per DeMarco—there hadn't been any meaningful conversations about getting it back on the air prior to this meeting. (“Previous to the April Fools conversation we had, I swear, never ONCE talked in any serious way about bringing Toonami back. We just didn't think it was possible.”) This idea to bring Toonami back for a night must've felt as sudden and out-of-the-blue as any idea possibly could've been—but this speed bump wasn't enough to stop the April Fools Toonami revival from happening.    With only a few months to plan everything, Adult Swim's work was cut out for them. “We made a list of what we thought were the definitive Toonami shows,” said DeMarco. “Then we strategized with Kim Manning, our head of programming, how best to approach distributors to see who might be willing to give us a one time license for, like, one episode of a show. We had no idea at all if any of them would work with us on such a weird request.”    Just like the original vision for this idea, the lineup Adult Swim ultimately ended up with was one that mostly felt like it could've pulled straight out of a schedule from 1999: Bleach, Dragon Ball Z, Gundam Wing, Tenchi Muyo!, Outlaw Star, The Big O, Yu-Yu Hakusho, Blue Submarine No. 6, Trigun, Astro Boy, and ending the night with Gigantor. Bleach was a particularly interesting addition to this lineup, not only because it was the only show that came out after 2000 (with the partial exceptions of The Big O and Blue Submarine No. 6, which began in late 90s but didn't finish til after the turn of the millennium), but also because it was the only show on the lineup that was an Adult Swim show, as opposed to a Toonami show. But it was, nonetheless, part of Toonami tonight. And even though Bleach wasn't traditional Toonami fare, TOM's appearance, Steve Blum's familiar voice, and the fact that any anime was airing at all was more than enough to signal to the viewers that at least for tonight, the Toonami people missed was back.     An image that started circulating at the time  As the night went on and viewers saw how increasingly nostalgic the lineup became, the reminiscent fans couldn't help but express their excitement on social media—which, importantly, also helped to rapidly spread the word that this was happening. Searching for tweets and posts with words like “Toonami” or “Dragon Ball Z” during the night of March 31-April 1, 2012 showcases the elated thoughts of countless anime fans, intent to watch Toonami until its final moments—whatever plans they had for the upcoming morning be damned. So abundant were the tweets about it that “Toonami” (and some adjacent words/phrases like “Outlaw Star”, “Gundam Wing”, etc) quickly became one of the top trending topics on Twitter that evening. Said DeMarco about the fan reactions, “It was incredible, one of the first experiences of my life where I really saw the power of social media to create a collective experience around a particular event as it unfolds. Seeing it blow up on Twitter and watching the mentions just grow, and keep growing, was amazing. All of us were texting each other that night as the event unfolded, and we all stayed up all night having a blast reading the reactions. Just a super great experience for all of us. We came in to work the following Monday still excited and talking about how amazing the response was.”    The outpouring of love from fans was so immense that while the idea of bringing Toonami back began as a joke, it suddenly no longer felt like one to Adult Swim by that next day back at work. Thus, they tweeted that fans could let them know how badly they wanted Toonami to return permanently with the hashtag #BringBackToonami. Not only did this tweet itself garner well over 10,000 retweets (and get the hashtag trending in a matter of hours), but several voice actors and prominent entities in the anime industry even made their own posts featuring the hashtag. Fan made videos, Facebook pages, and petitions dedicated to supporting the hashtag began to appear one after the other. Nerdcore rapper Richie Branson even made a rap about it (which would later be used in an Adult Swim bumper). If it wasn't already abundantly obvious (which it was), then it was now: Now that they knew what Toonami was capable of (once again) being, and that it could air on Adult Swim rather than Cartoon Network, people wanted Toonami back for real.    After a little over a month of cheers to bring back Toonami, Adult Swim finally announced on May 16 with the hashtag  #ToonamisBackBitches that it would be back on Adult Swim (presumably indefinitely) in just a few days, the late night between May 26 and 27. The lineup, it was soon announced after a few days of speculation, would be three hours long and would then repeat itself (meaning it would be on air for a total of 6 hours) and would mostly be anime that had previously aired on Adult Swim such as Bleach and Cowboy Bebop, but also the new-to-U.S.-TV titles Casshern Sins and Deadman Wonderland (shows like Naruto and Dragon Ball Z, DeMarco tweeted, were simply too expensive).    Following the announcement, exuberant forum threads, blog posts, tweets, and videos about the hashtag's success and Toonami's confirmed revival plastered the walls of every online anime community. Richie Branson even made another rap about it to celebrate. In many ways, this marriage of Toonami and Adult Swim felt like a fitting one–they were already both on the same channel, both aired in the evening/at night, and a lot of anime fans spent their younger years in a Toonami to Adult Swim pipeline anyways. This felt perfect.     Despite all the anticipation and fanfare that led up to it, whether or not the night between May 26 and 27 was more than just moderately successful for Toonami depends on who you ask. While its revival made plenty of headlines, many fans lost interest when they saw its mostly-recycled lineup (many were hoping for a higher concentration of shows that either hadn't previously aired in the U.S. or aired in the 90s) which was largely the result of time and money constraints.    “Basically the reaction to [the April Fools] event, combined with the responses to [the Adult Swim tweet about bringing back Toonami], allowed us to come to Lazzo with a request to bring it back for real,” recalled DeMarco, “Gill and I had a plan within a week and brought him a way to do it CHEAP and FAST. And thankfully he said yes. We set a target launch date, and started sprinted towards that date immediately.""    Nonetheless, when ratings came to light a few days later, while they seemed good to many (Deadman Wonderland, for example, ranked #1 in its time slot among adults age 18-24), DeMarco would describe the Toonami revival's inaugural weekend as having gone, “OKAY. Not bad but not measurably better than the week before. We need to do better. Hopefully we will!”    Encouraged by better ratings the following week, (“We're doing well! I'm encouraged.” DeMarco tweeted about it) Toonami marched on—its impact on anime, while not as large as it once was, still tangible. A few weeks prior to its airing on Adult Swim, Deadman Wonderland was on 59,860 user's lists on MyAnimeList. A month into Toonami's revival (June 26), it went up to appearing on 66,110 lists even though it had long since finished airing in Japan (April-July 2011). Casshern Sins—which originally aired in Japan between 2008 and 2009—went from being on 26,671 user's lists on May 4, 2012, to 28,852 on June 28, 2012.

The nighttime programming block had fallen into the routine of airing The Room—a legendary 2003 independent film (which has been called “the Citizen Kane of bad movies”) spearheaded by cinematic Swiss army knife Tommy Wiseau. By midnight of April 1, 2012, nobody had any reason to believe that this year would be any different. The (excruciatingly long) opening credits sequence began, and for almost 30 whole seconds everything was the way it had been in the years before—until, that is, the movie faded to black for a moment, revealing that a dark blue robot was watching the movie. “Oh hi, Adult Swim,” the robot with Steve Blum's voice said, “I got the results of the test back. I definitely have April Fools.” The robot, as many anime fans instantly recognized, was TOM: the host of a beloved anime programming block called Toonami that aired on Cartoon Network between 1997 and 2008. A brief animation played after TOM made his quip, the Toonami logo appeared on-screen, and an episode of Bleach began to play. Without any warning, Toonami was airing on television for the first time in almost four years—and anime fans across the U.S. lost their collective mind.      To understand how this happened and why it was such a big deal, we first need to rewind back to the 2000s. Originally, the anime-and-action-cartoon programming block aired on weekday afternoons, but in 2004 it got moved to Saturday nights. It's hard to understate how massive a role Toonami played in anime's burst of popularity in the West throughout the 90s by shaping tastes and making anime more accessible in its heyday. Such was its success that within a few years, even Cartoon Network started airing some anime as well (the only anime it had ever aired before the debut of Toonami was Speed Racer). Furthermore, an adult-oriented nighttime programming block on the same channel called Adult Swim started up in 2001, and an anime called Cowboy Bebop was included in its original lineup. Over the years, both Cartoon Network and Adult Swim would continue to air more anime outside of Toonami (and in fact, Adult Swim even started its own anime-centric block called Adult Swim Action in 2002, which featured some anime that had previously aired on Toonami). But even then, Toonami still felt different. It had its own host (a robot named TOM, though he reincarnated a few times), its own lore, the occasional game review, and unlike Cartoon Network and Adult Swim, anime was a foremost part of Toonami's identity—it felt lovingly tailored specifically for anime fans in a way Cartoon Network and Adult Swim never would be. Dragon Ball Z, Sailor Moon, Naruto, and Gundam Wing are only a few of the anime that found massive success airing on Toonami, and dominated Western anime fan culture for several years.    But by 2008, Toonami had become a shadow of its former self. Once four-hours-long, it spent most of the year with its time cut in half and saturated with Naruto episodes—a far cry from the gateway to discovering a variety of new anime that it once was. The kids who grew up with Toonami's biggest hits like Dragon Ball Z and Sailor Moon were now older and looking for anime that felt a little more dark or mature. And while Toonami had the extremely popular Naruto, Adult Swim had the likes of InuYasha, Bleach, Fullmetal Alchemist, and Cowboy Bebop among plenty of other immensely successful anime that fit the bill—quality and quantity. While anime was never Adult Swim's primary focus, it had nonetheless become an anime powerhouse in its own right, and seemed to take over Toonami's status as the U.S.'s largest anime tastemaker in the mid and late 2000s. Factoring in the massive recession happening on top of all this, and the only thing shocking about Cartoon Network's announcing the cancellation of Toonami at Anime Weekend Atlanta 2008 (they cited declining viewership as the reason why) was how Toonami managed to last as long as it did. The final Toonami block would air the same evening the announcement was made: September 20, 2008.    Much to the disappointment of longtime fans, Toonami didn't go out with so much as a fizzle. Its time wasn't extended, it didn't re-run any of its classic hits—nothing was out of the ordinary. It was the same two-hour block it had been for some time, half of which was spent airing Naruto (the other half was an episode of Ben 10: Alien Force, followed by an episode of Samurai Jack). If not for a clip of TOM saying goodbye at the end, then that evening's block wouldn't have felt like an ending for anything—let alone a once-great programming block that managed to stay on the air for 11 years. While saddened by it, most fans discussing the announcement online seemed to be understanding of the decision, and accepted it pretty quickly. In Memoriam-style posts and content looking back fondly on Toonami's glory days and wondering where it all went wrong (when Toonami got moved to Saturday nights probably marked the beginning of the end, many agreed) seemed to outnumber petitions to undo the cancellation and outraged posts by a landslide. Thus quietly ended Toonami.      In the years following Toonami's cancellation, any lingering conversations about it amongst fans were usually less about bringing it back, and more about being nostalgic for its late 90s/early 2000s lineups. People missed Toonami, that much was clear, but they missed a certain type of Toonami. They missed the anime-centric block that was chock-loaded with a variety of iconic hits—not the glorified Naruto block it eventually became. But with Cartoon Network airing fewer and fewer anime, the idea that Toonami would ever come back seemed less likely than ever.    Enter fellow-programming block Adult Swim in the early months of 2012.    “Usually Adult Swim has a brainstorm about what we might do for April Fools Day on any given year, where everyone throws out ideas and we see what sticks,” recalled Toonami co-creator Jason DeMarco, “Mike Lazzo tossed out “what if we just brought Toonami back for a night, just switched over and it was suddenly like you were in 1999 and watching Cartoon Network?” Everyone loved the idea immediately, and the conversation very quickly moved on to “how the heck can we pull this off?””    Considering the dilapidated state of Toonami at the time of its cancellation, it comes as little shock that—per DeMarco—there hadn't been any meaningful conversations about getting it back on the air prior to this meeting. (“Previous to the April Fools conversation we had, I swear, never ONCE talked in any serious way about bringing Toonami back. We just didn't think it was possible.”) This idea to bring Toonami back for a night must've felt as sudden and out-of-the-blue as any idea possibly could've been—but this speed bump wasn't enough to stop the April Fools Toonami revival from happening.    With only a few months to plan everything, Adult Swim's work was cut out for them. “We made a list of what we thought were the definitive Toonami shows,” said DeMarco. “Then we strategized with Kim Manning, our head of programming, how best to approach distributors to see who might be willing to give us a one time license for, like, one episode of a show. We had no idea at all if any of them would work with us on such a weird request.”    Just like the original vision for this idea, the lineup Adult Swim ultimately ended up with was one that mostly felt like it could've pulled straight out of a schedule from 1999: Bleach, Dragon Ball Z, Gundam Wing, Tenchi Muyo!, Outlaw Star, The Big O, Yu-Yu Hakusho, Blue Submarine No. 6, Trigun, Astro Boy, and ending the night with Gigantor. Bleach was a particularly interesting addition to this lineup, not only because it was the only show that came out after 2000 (with the partial exceptions of The Big O and Blue Submarine No. 6, which began in late 90s but didn't finish til after the turn of the millennium), but also because it was the only show on the lineup that was an Adult Swim show, as opposed to a Toonami show. But it was, nonetheless, part of Toonami tonight. And even though Bleach wasn't traditional Toonami fare, TOM's appearance, Steve Blum's familiar voice, and the fact that any anime was airing at all was more than enough to signal to the viewers that at least for tonight, the Toonami people missed was back.     An image that started circulating at the time  As the night went on and viewers saw how increasingly nostalgic the lineup became, the reminiscent fans couldn't help but express their excitement on social media—which, importantly, also helped to rapidly spread the word that this was happening. Searching for tweets and posts with words like “Toonami” or “Dragon Ball Z” during the night of March 31-April 1, 2012 showcases the elated thoughts of countless anime fans, intent to watch Toonami until its final moments—whatever plans they had for the upcoming morning be damned. So abundant were the tweets about it that “Toonami” (and some adjacent words/phrases like “Outlaw Star”, “Gundam Wing”, etc) quickly became one of the top trending topics on Twitter that evening. Said DeMarco about the fan reactions, “It was incredible, one of the first experiences of my life where I really saw the power of social media to create a collective experience around a particular event as it unfolds. Seeing it blow up on Twitter and watching the mentions just grow, and keep growing, was amazing. All of us were texting each other that night as the event unfolded, and we all stayed up all night having a blast reading the reactions. Just a super great experience for all of us. We came in to work the following Monday still excited and talking about how amazing the response was.”    The outpouring of love from fans was so immense that while the idea of bringing Toonami back began as a joke, it suddenly no longer felt like one to Adult Swim by that next day back at work. Thus, they tweeted that fans could let them know how badly they wanted Toonami to return permanently with the hashtag #BringBackToonami. Not only did this tweet itself garner well over 10,000 retweets (and get the hashtag trending in a matter of hours), but several voice actors and prominent entities in the anime industry even made their own posts featuring the hashtag. Fan made videos, Facebook pages, and petitions dedicated to supporting the hashtag began to appear one after the other. Nerdcore rapper Richie Branson even made a rap about it (which would later be used in an Adult Swim bumper). If it wasn't already abundantly obvious (which it was), then it was now: Now that they knew what Toonami was capable of (once again) being, and that it could air on Adult Swim rather than Cartoon Network, people wanted Toonami back for real.    After a little over a month of cheers to bring back Toonami, Adult Swim finally announced on May 16 with the hashtag  #ToonamisBackBitches that it would be back on Adult Swim (presumably indefinitely) in just a few days, the late night between May 26 and 27. The lineup, it was soon announced after a few days of speculation, would be three hours long and would then repeat itself (meaning it would be on air for a total of 6 hours) and would mostly be anime that had previously aired on Adult Swim such as Bleach and Cowboy Bebop, but also the new-to-U.S.-TV titles Casshern Sins and Deadman Wonderland (shows like Naruto and Dragon Ball Z, DeMarco tweeted, were simply too expensive).    Following the announcement, exuberant forum threads, blog posts, tweets, and videos about the hashtag's success and Toonami's confirmed revival plastered the walls of every online anime community. Richie Branson even made another rap about it to celebrate. In many ways, this marriage of Toonami and Adult Swim felt like a fitting one–they were already both on the same channel, both aired in the evening/at night, and a lot of anime fans spent their younger years in a Toonami to Adult Swim pipeline anyways. This felt perfect.     Despite all the anticipation and fanfare that led up to it, whether or not the night between May 26 and 27 was more than just moderately successful for Toonami depends on who you ask. While its revival made plenty of headlines, many fans lost interest when they saw its mostly-recycled lineup (many were hoping for a higher concentration of shows that either hadn't previously aired in the U.S. or aired in the 90s) which was largely the result of time and money constraints.    “Basically the reaction to [the April Fools] event, combined with the responses to [the Adult Swim tweet about bringing back Toonami], allowed us to come to Lazzo with a request to bring it back for real,” recalled DeMarco, “Gill and I had a plan within a week and brought him a way to do it CHEAP and FAST. And thankfully he said yes. We set a target launch date, and started sprinted towards that date immediately.""    Nonetheless, when ratings came to light a few days later, while they seemed good to many (Deadman Wonderland, for example, ranked #1 in its time slot among adults age 18-24), DeMarco would describe the Toonami revival's inaugural weekend as having gone, “OKAY. Not bad but not measurably better than the week before. We need to do better. Hopefully we will!”    Encouraged by better ratings the following week, (“We're doing well! I'm encouraged.” DeMarco tweeted about it) Toonami marched on—its impact on anime, while not as large as it once was, still tangible. A few weeks prior to its airing on Adult Swim, Deadman Wonderland was on 59,860 user's lists on MyAnimeList. A month into Toonami's revival (June 26), it went up to appearing on 66,110 lists even though it had long since finished airing in Japan (April-July 2011). Casshern Sins—which originally aired in Japan between 2008 and 2009—went from being on 26,671 user's lists on May 4, 2012, to 28,852 on June 28, 2012. These numbers neither 100% definitively prove how many people continually tuned in to this new Toonami, nor are they even particularly earth-shattering, but they do help to further illustrate the influence Toonami was having in the early days of its revival.    Despite the perilous times Adult Swim, like a lot of broadcast television, is currently trying to navigate, Toonami has remained a fixture of Adult Swim in the ten years since its revival began. It's since aired the wildly popular likes of My Hero Academia, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, One-Punch Man, The Promised Neverland, among plenty of other such anime. While it's less of the trendsetter it once was and more of a trend reaffirmer, it still feels much more like the generation-shaping Toonami people knew and loved in the 90s/early 2000s again (as opposed to the zombified state it was in throughout 2008). And Steve Blum, by the way, is still voicing TOM. Adult Swim has also since become more involved in anime than ever by way of producing a few projects (including, but not limited to, the recently announced Housing Complex C and two new seasons of FLCL).    2022 is a unique year for Toonami, as it gets to celebrate not only the 25th anniversary of its original airing, but also the 10th anniversary of its revival. “It's just amazing to me that this is the tenth year of the Adult Swim iteration of Toonami. It's very rare that a person gets to have a second chance at creative work once it's been cancelled or wrapped up by the rights holders,” reflected DeMarco, “It's something that in our case, only happened with the unique combination of fan love and network freedom that Toonami and Adult Swim have. It's been an amazing experience for all of us at Toonami, and one that never ceases to give us joy. We just hope we are giving that joy back.”    Below is the full interview that I had with DeMarco about how Toonami got brought back from the grave:    On April 1, 2012, Toonami once again aired as an April Fools Day joke, despite its 2008 cancellation. How involved were you in the process of making this happen?   Very much so. I believe it was actually Mike Lazzo's idea in one of our brainstorming meetings we had about April Fools. He brought it up as a lark, and Gill Austin and I immediately walked out of that meeting beginning to try to figure out how to pull it off with no time and no money.    What made you (and/or Adult Swim) want to bring Toonami back after its 2008 cancellation?   Well those of us who had worked on Toonami had made our peace with its cancellation. But when we were offered a small chance to bring it back we knew we had to try. It had become clear to us in the years after it was cancelled in 2008 that there were people who WANTED it back.    How (and when) did plans to bring Toonami back start?   I believe it was two and a half months before April Fools Day 2012. Usually Adult Swim has a brainstorm about what we might do for April Fools Day on any given year, where everyone throws out ideas and we see what sticks. Mike Lazzo tossed out “what if we just brought Toonami back for a night, just switched over and it was suddenly like you were in 1999 and watching Cartoon Network?” Everyone loved the idea immediately, and the conversation very quickly moved on to “how the heck can we pull this off?”    Was the plan always to bring it back via an April Fools Day joke? If not, how did that happen?   Previous to the April Fools conversation we had, I swear, never ONCE talked in any serious way about bringing Toonami back. We just didn't think it was possible.    How did the shows that aired for this get picked?   We made a list of what we thought were the definitive Toonami shows. Then we strategized with Kim Manning, our head of programming, how best to approach distributors to see who might be willing to give us a one time license for, like, one episode of a show. We had no idea at all if any of them would work with us on such a weird request.    How was the reception to the April Fools Day joke? Any particularly memorable reactions?   It was incredible, one of the first experiences of my life where I really saw the power of social media to create a collective experience around a particular event as it unfolds. Seeing it blow up on Twitter and watching the mentions just grow, and keep growing, was amazing. All of us were texting each other that night as the event unfolded, and we all stayed up all night having a blast reading the reactions. Just a super great experience for all of us. We came in to work the following Monday still excited and talking about how amazing the response was.    The call from fans to bring back Toonami after this April Fools Day joke was pretty much immediate, and the next day Adult Swim tweeted, ""Want it back? Let us know. #BringBackToonami""--did all this directly contribute to Toonami's full revival a few months later?   Very much so. Basically the reaction to the event, combined with the responses to that Tweet, allowed us to come to Lazzo with a request to bring it back for real. Gill and I had a plan within a week and brought him a way to do it CHEAP and FAST. And thankfully he said yes. We set a target launch date, and started sprinted towards that date immediately.    10 years later, and Adult Swim is more involved in anime production than ever, such as through 2 new seasons of FLCL, Housing Complex C, and Uzumaki. How important has the revival of Toonami been to all this?   It's interesting. Obviously, anime and action have been a part of Adult Swim's DNA since the network's beginning. And even without Toonami returning, it's highly likely that Adult Swim would still be airing anime. Whether or not they would air AS MUCH anime or action, and move into original productions… I don't know. I'm gonna say that would be unlikely without a weekly Toonami block.    Any other thoughts/reflections/fun facts about Toonami's 2012 April Fools Day joke?   Refection-wise, it's just amazing to me that this is the tenth year of the Adult Swim iteration of Toonami. It's very rare that a person gets to have a second chance at creative work once it's been cancelled or wrapped up by the rights holders. It's something that in our case,  only happened with the unique combination of fan love and network freedom that Toonami and Adult Swim have. It's been an amazing experience for all of us at Toonami, and one that never ceases to give us joy. We just hope we are giving that joy back.     discuss this in the forum (7 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Feature homepage / archives   ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4, 'https://ew.com/article/2008/12/12/crazy-cult-room/': 1, 'https://twitter.com/adultswim/status/187004036824834049': 1, 'https://twitter.com/blumspew/status/188501360331857921': 1, 'https://twitter.com/LauraBaileyVO/status/191621438317404160': 1, 'https://twitter.com/VoiceOfOBrien/status/187017191344963585': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/funimation/posts/adult-swim-just-asked-on-twitter-tonight-adultswim-want-it-back-let-us-know-brin/378737742158052/': 1, 'https://twitter.com/WeAreAKon/status/187337710481047552': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlbbLFgiVQk': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNEsz347UBU': 1, 'https://twitter.com/adultswim/status/202866436597743616': 1, 'https://twitter.com/Clarknova1/status/204614840298385410': 1, 'https://twitter.com/Clarknova1/status/207971067497676800': 1, 'https://twitter.com/Clarknova1/status/212721465743781888': 1, 'https://web.archive.org/web/20120512015148/https://myanimelist.net/anime/6880/Deadman_Wonderland': 1, 'https://web.archive.org/web/20120626184052/https://myanimelist.net/anime/6880/Deadman_Wonderland': 1, 'https://web.archive.org/web/20120504115441/https://myanimelist.net/anime/4981/Casshern_Sins': 1, 'https://web.archive.org/web/20120628163229/https://myanimelist.net/anime/4981/Casshern_Sins': 1}"

Enter fellow-programming block Adult Swim in the early months of 2012.    “Usually Adult Swim has a brainstorm about what we might do for April Fools Day on any given year, where everyone throws out ideas and we see what sticks,” recalled Toonami co-creator Jason DeMarco, “Mike Lazzo tossed out “what if we just brought Toonami back for a night, just switched over and it was suddenly like you were in 1999 and watching Cartoon Network?” Everyone loved the idea immediately, and the conversation very quickly moved on to “how the heck can we pull this off?””    Considering the dilapidated state of Toonami at the time of its cancellation, it comes as little shock that—per DeMarco—there hadn't been any meaningful conversations about getting it back on the air prior to this meeting. (“Previous to the April Fools conversation we had, I swear, never ONCE talked in any serious way about bringing Toonami back. We just didn't think it was possible.”) This idea to bring Toonami back for a night must've felt as sudden and out-of-the-blue as any idea possibly could've been—but this speed bump wasn't enough to stop the April Fools Toonami revival from happening.    With only a few months to plan everything, Adult Swim's work was cut out for them. “We made a list of what we thought were the definitive Toonami shows,” said DeMarco. “Then we strategized with Kim Manning, our head of programming, how best to approach distributors to see who might be willing to give us a one time license for, like, one episode of a show. We had no idea at all if any of them would work with us on such a weird request.”    Just like the original vision for this idea, the lineup Adult Swim ultimately ended up with was one that mostly felt like it could've pulled straight out of a schedule from 1999: Bleach, Dragon Ball Z, Gundam Wing, Tenchi Muyo!, Outlaw Star, The Big O, Yu-Yu Hakusho, Blue Submarine No. 6, Trigun, Astro Boy, and ending the night with Gigantor. Bleach was a particularly interesting addition to this lineup, not only because it was the only show that came out after 2000 (with the partial exceptions of The Big O and Blue Submarine No. 6, which began in late 90s but didn't finish til after the turn of the millennium), but also because it was the only show on the lineup that was an Adult Swim show, as opposed to a Toonami show. But it was, nonetheless, part of Toonami tonight. And even though Bleach wasn't traditional Toonami fare, TOM's appearance, Steve Blum's familiar voice, and the fact that any anime was airing at all was more than enough to signal to the viewers that at least for tonight, the Toonami people missed was back.     An image that started circulating at the time  As the night went on and viewers saw how increasingly nostalgic the lineup became, the reminiscent fans couldn't help but express their excitement on social media—which, importantly, also helped to rapidly spread the word that this was happening. Searching for tweets and posts with words like “Toonami” or “Dragon Ball Z” during the night of March 31-April 1, 2012 showcases the elated thoughts of countless anime fans, intent to watch Toonami until its final moments—whatever plans they had for the upcoming morning be damned. So abundant were the tweets about it that “Toonami” (and some adjacent words/phrases like “Outlaw Star”, “Gundam Wing”, etc) quickly became one of the top trending topics on Twitter that evening. Said DeMarco about the fan reactions, “It was incredible, one of the first experiences of my life where I really saw the power of social media to create a collective experience around a particular event as it unfolds. Seeing it blow up on Twitter and watching the mentions just grow, and keep growing, was amazing. All of us were texting each other that night as the event unfolded, and we all stayed up all night having a blast reading the reactions. Just a super great experience for all of us. We came in to work the following Monday still excited and talking about how amazing the response was.”    The outpouring of love from fans was so immense that while the idea of bringing Toonami back began as a joke, it suddenly no longer felt like one to Adult Swim by that next day back at work. Thus, they tweeted that fans could let them know how badly they wanted Toonami to return permanently with the hashtag #BringBackToonami. Not only did this tweet itself garner well over 10,000 retweets (and get the hashtag trending in a matter of hours), but several voice actors and prominent entities in the anime industry even made their own posts featuring the hashtag. Fan made videos, Facebook pages, and petitions dedicated to supporting the hashtag began to appear one after the other. Nerdcore rapper Richie Branson even made a rap about it (which would later be used in an Adult Swim bumper). If it wasn't already abundantly obvious (which it was), then it was now: Now that they knew what Toonami was capable of (once again) being, and that it could air on Adult Swim rather than Cartoon Network, people wanted Toonami back for real.    After a little over a month of cheers to bring back Toonami, Adult Swim finally announced on May 16 with the hashtag  #ToonamisBackBitches that it would be back on Adult Swim (presumably indefinitely) in just a few days, the late night between May 26 and 27. The lineup, it was soon announced after a few days of speculation, would be three hours long and would then repeat itself (meaning it would be on air for a total of 6 hours) and would mostly be anime that had previously aired on Adult Swim such as Bleach and Cowboy Bebop, but also the new-to-U.S.-TV titles Casshern Sins and Deadman Wonderland (shows like Naruto and Dragon Ball Z, DeMarco tweeted, were simply too expensive).    Following the announcement, exuberant forum threads, blog posts, tweets, and videos about the hashtag's success and Toonami's confirmed revival plastered the walls of every online anime community. Richie Branson even made another rap about it to celebrate. In many ways, this marriage of Toonami and Adult Swim felt like a fitting one–they were already both on the same channel, both aired in the evening/at night, and a lot of anime fans spent their younger years in a Toonami to Adult Swim pipeline anyways. This felt perfect.     Despite all the anticipation and fanfare that led up to it, whether or not the night between May 26 and 27 was more than just moderately successful for Toonami depends on who you ask. While its revival made plenty of headlines, many fans lost interest when they saw its mostly-recycled lineup (many were hoping for a higher concentration of shows that either hadn't previously aired in the U.S. or aired in the 90s) which was largely the result of time and money constraints.    “Basically the reaction to [the April Fools] event, combined with the responses to [the Adult Swim tweet about bringing back Toonami], allowed us to come to Lazzo with a request to bring it back for real,” recalled DeMarco, “Gill and I had a plan within a week and brought him a way to do it CHEAP and FAST. And thankfully he said yes. We set a target launch date, and started sprinted towards that date immediately.""    Nonetheless, when ratings came to light a few days later, while they seemed good to many (Deadman Wonderland, for example, ranked #1 in its time slot among adults age 18-24), DeMarco would describe the Toonami revival's inaugural weekend as having gone, “OKAY. Not bad but not measurably better than the week before. We need to do better. Hopefully we will!”    Encouraged by better ratings the following week, (“We're doing well! I'm encouraged.” DeMarco tweeted about it) Toonami marched on—its impact on anime, while not as large as it once was, still tangible. A few weeks prior to its airing on Adult Swim, Deadman Wonderland was on 59,860 user's lists on MyAnimeList. A month into Toonami's revival (June 26), it went up to appearing on 66,110 lists even though it had long since finished airing in Japan (April-July 2011). Casshern Sins—which originally aired in Japan between 2008 and 2009—went from being on 26,671 user's lists on May 4, 2012, to 28,852 on June 28, 2012. These numbers neither 100% definitively prove how many people continually tuned in to this new Toonami, nor are they even particularly earth-shattering, but they do help to further illustrate the influence Toonami was having in the early days of its revival.    Despite the perilous times Adult Swim, like a lot of broadcast television, is currently trying to navigate, Toonami has remained a fixture of Adult Swim in the ten years since its revival began. It's since aired the wildly popular likes of My Hero Academia, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, One-Punch Man, The Promised Neverland, among plenty of other such anime. While it's less of the trendsetter it once was and more of a trend reaffirmer, it still feels much more like the generation-shaping Toonami people knew and loved in the 90s/early 2000s again (as opposed to the zombified state it was in throughout 2008). And Steve Blum, by the way, is still voicing TOM. Adult Swim has also since become more involved in anime than ever by way of producing a few projects (including, but not limited to, the recently announced Housing Complex C and two new seasons of FLCL).    2022 is a unique year for Toonami, as it gets to celebrate not only the 25th anniversary of its original airing, but also the 10th anniversary of its revival. “It's just amazing to me that this is the tenth year of the Adult Swim iteration of Toonami. It's very rare that a person gets to have a second chance at creative work once it's been cancelled or wrapped up by the rights holders,” reflected DeMarco, “It's something that in our case, only happened with the unique combination of fan love and network freedom that Toonami and Adult Swim have. It's been an amazing experience for all of us at Toonami, and one that never ceases to give us joy. We just hope we are giving that joy back.”    Below is the full interview that I had with DeMarco about how Toonami got brought back from the grave:    On April 1, 2012, Toonami once again aired as an April Fools Day joke, despite its 2008 cancellation. How involved were you in the process of making this happen?   Very much so. I believe it was actually Mike Lazzo's idea in one of our brainstorming meetings we had about April Fools. He brought it up as a lark, and Gill Austin and I immediately walked out of that meeting beginning to try to figure out how to pull it off with no time and no money.    What made you (and/or Adult Swim) want to bring Toonami back after its 2008 cancellation?   Well those of us who had worked on Toonami had made our peace with its cancellation. But when we were offered a small chance to bring it back we knew we had to try. It had become clear to us in the years after it was cancelled in 2008 that there were people who WANTED it back.    How (and when) did plans to bring Toonami back start?   I believe it was two and a half months before April Fools Day 2012. Usually Adult Swim has a brainstorm about what we might do for April Fools Day on any given year, where everyone throws out ideas and we see what sticks. Mike Lazzo tossed out “what if we just brought Toonami back for a night, just switched over and it was suddenly like you were in 1999 and watching Cartoon Network?” Everyone loved the idea immediately, and the conversation very quickly moved on to “how the heck can we pull this off?”    Was the plan always to bring it back via an April Fools Day joke? If not, how did that happen?   Previous to the April Fools conversation we had, I swear, never ONCE talked in any serious way about bringing Toonami back. We just didn't think it was possible.    How did the shows that aired for this get picked?   We made a list of what we thought were the definitive Toonami shows. Then we strategized with Kim Manning, our head of programming, how best to approach distributors to see who might be willing to give us a one time license for, like, one episode of a show. We had no idea at all if any of them would work with us on such a weird request.    How was the reception to the April Fools Day joke? Any particularly memorable reactions?   It was incredible, one of the first experiences of my life where I really saw the power of social media to create a collective experience around a particular event as it unfolds. Seeing it blow up on Twitter and watching the mentions just grow, and keep growing, was amazing. All of us were texting each other that night as the event unfolded, and we all stayed up all night having a blast reading the reactions. Just a super great experience for all of us. We came in to work the following Monday still excited and talking about how amazing the response was.    The call from fans to bring back Toonami after this April Fools Day joke was pretty much immediate, and the next day Adult Swim tweeted, ""Want it back? Let us know. #BringBackToonami""--did all this directly contribute to Toonami's full revival a few months later?   Very much so. Basically the reaction to the event, combined with the responses to that Tweet, allowed us to come to Lazzo with a request to bring it back for real. Gill and I had a plan within a week and brought him a way to do it CHEAP and FAST. And thankfully he said yes. We set a target launch date, and started sprinted towards that date immediately.    10 years later, and Adult Swim is more involved in anime production than ever, such as through 2 new seasons of FLCL, Housing Complex C, and Uzumaki. How important has the revival of Toonami been to all this?   It's interesting. Obviously, anime and action have been a part of Adult Swim's DNA since the network's beginning. And even without Toonami returning, it's highly likely that Adult Swim would still be airing anime. Whether or not they would air AS MUCH anime or action, and move into original productions… I don't know. I'm gonna say that would be unlikely without a weekly Toonami block.    Any other thoughts/reflections/fun facts about Toonami's 2012 April Fools Day joke?   Refection-wise, it's just amazing to me that this is the tenth year of the Adult Swim iteration of Toonami. It's very rare that a person gets to have a second chance at creative work once it's been cancelled or wrapped up by the rights holders. It's something that in our case,  only happened with the unique combination of fan love and network freedom that Toonami and Adult Swim have. It's been an amazing experience for all of us at Toonami, and one that never ceases to give us joy. We just hope we are giving that joy back.

The nighttime programming block had fallen into the routine of airing The Room—a legendary 2003 independent film (which has been called “the Citizen Kane of bad movies”) spearheaded by cinematic Swiss army knife Tommy Wiseau. By midnight of April 1, 2012, nobody had any reason to believe that this year would be any different. The (excruciatingly long) opening credits sequence began, and for almost 30 whole seconds everything was the way it had been in the years before—until, that is, the movie faded to black for a moment, revealing that a dark blue robot was watching the movie. “Oh hi, Adult Swim,” the robot with Steve Blum's voice said, “I got the results of the test back. I definitely have April Fools.” The robot, as many anime fans instantly recognized, was TOM: the host of a beloved anime programming block called Toonami that aired on Cartoon Network between 1997 and 2008. A brief animation played after TOM made his quip, the Toonami logo appeared on-screen, and an episode of Bleach began to play. Without any warning, Toonami was airing on television for the first time in almost four years—and anime fans across the U.S. lost their collective mind.      To understand how this happened and why it was such a big deal, we first need to rewind back to the 2000s. Originally, the anime-and-action-cartoon programming block aired on weekday afternoons, but in 2004 it got moved to Saturday nights. It's hard to understate how massive a role Toonami played in anime's burst of popularity in the West throughout the 90s by shaping tastes and making anime more accessible in its heyday. Such was its success that within a few years, even Cartoon Network started airing some anime as well (the only anime it had ever aired before the debut of Toonami was Speed Racer). Furthermore, an adult-oriented nighttime programming block on the same channel called Adult Swim started up in 2001, and an anime called Cowboy Bebop was included in its original lineup. Over the years, both Cartoon Network and Adult Swim would continue to air more anime outside of Toonami (and in fact, Adult Swim even started its own anime-centric block called Adult Swim Action in 2002, which featured some anime that had previously aired on Toonami). But even then, Toonami still felt different. It had its own host (a robot named TOM, though he reincarnated a few times), its own lore, the occasional game review, and unlike Cartoon Network and Adult Swim, anime was a foremost part of Toonami's identity—it felt lovingly tailored specifically for anime fans in a way Cartoon Network and Adult Swim never would be. Dragon Ball Z, Sailor Moon, Naruto, and Gundam Wing are only a few of the anime that found massive success airing on Toonami, and dominated Western anime fan culture for several years.    But by 2008, Toonami had become a shadow of its former self. Once four-hours-long, it spent most of the year with its time cut in half and saturated with Naruto episodes—a far cry from the gateway to discovering a variety of new anime that it once was. The kids who grew up with Toonami's biggest hits like Dragon Ball Z and Sailor Moon were now older and looking for anime that felt a little more dark or mature. And while Toonami had the extremely popular Naruto, Adult Swim had the likes of InuYasha, Bleach, Fullmetal Alchemist, and Cowboy Bebop among plenty of other immensely successful anime that fit the bill—quality and quantity. While anime was never Adult Swim's primary focus, it had nonetheless become an anime powerhouse in its own right, and seemed to take over Toonami's status as the U.S.'s largest anime tastemaker in the mid and late 2000s. Factoring in the massive recession happening on top of all this, and the only thing shocking about Cartoon Network's announcing the cancellation of Toonami at Anime Weekend Atlanta 2008 (they cited declining viewership as the reason why) was how Toonami managed to last as long as it did. The final Toonami block would air the same evening the announcement was made: September 20, 2008.    Much to the disappointment of longtime fans, Toonami didn't go out with so much as a fizzle. Its time wasn't extended, it didn't re-run any of its classic hits—nothing was out of the ordinary. It was the same two-hour block it had been for some time, half of which was spent airing Naruto (the other half was an episode of Ben 10: Alien Force, followed by an episode of Samurai Jack). If not for a clip of TOM saying goodbye at the end, then that evening's block wouldn't have felt like an ending for anything—let alone a once-great programming block that managed to stay on the air for 11 years. While saddened by it, most fans discussing the announcement online seemed to be understanding of the decision, and accepted it pretty quickly. In Memoriam-style posts and content looking back fondly on Toonami's glory days and wondering where it all went wrong (when Toonami got moved to Saturday nights probably marked the beginning of the end, many agreed) seemed to outnumber petitions to undo the cancellation and outraged posts by a landslide. Thus quietly ended Toonami.      In the years following Toonami's cancellation, any lingering conversations about it amongst fans were usually less about bringing it back, and more about being nostalgic for its late 90s/early 2000s lineups. People missed Toonami, that much was clear, but they missed a certain type of Toonami. They missed the anime-centric block that was chock-loaded with a variety of iconic hits—not the glorified Naruto block it eventually became. But with Cartoon Network airing fewer and fewer anime, the idea that Toonami would ever come back seemed less likely than ever.    Enter fellow-programming block Adult Swim in the early months of 2012.    “Usually Adult Swim has a brainstorm about what we might do for April Fools Day on any given year, where everyone throws out ideas and we see what sticks,” recalled Toonami co-creator Jason DeMarco, “Mike Lazzo tossed out “what if we just brought Toonami back for a night, just switched over and it was suddenly like you were in 1999 and watching Cartoon Network?” Everyone loved the idea immediately, and the conversation very quickly moved on to “how the heck can we pull this off?””    Considering the dilapidated state of Toonami at the time of its cancellation, it comes as little shock that—per DeMarco—there hadn't been any meaningful conversations about getting it back on the air prior to this meeting. (“Previous to the April Fools conversation we had, I swear, never ONCE talked in any serious way about bringing Toonami back. We just didn't think it was possible.”) This idea to bring Toonami back for a night must've felt as sudden and out-of-the-blue as any idea possibly could've been—but this speed bump wasn't enough to stop the April Fools Toonami revival from happening.    With only a few months to plan everything, Adult Swim's work was cut out for them. “We made a list of what we thought were the definitive Toonami shows,” said DeMarco. “Then we strategized with Kim Manning, our head of programming, how best to approach distributors to see who might be willing to give us a one time license for, like, one episode of a show.

Bleach was a particularly interesting addition to this lineup, not only because it was the only show that came out after 2000 (with the partial exceptions of The Big O and Blue Submarine No. 6, which began in late 90s but didn't finish til after the turn of the millennium), but also because it was the only show on the lineup that was an Adult Swim show, as opposed to a Toonami show.

It's very rare that a person gets to have a second chance at creative work once it's been cancelled or wrapped up by the rights holders,” reflected DeMarco, “It's something that in our case, only happened with the unique combination of fan love and network freedom that Toonami and Adult Swim have. It's been an amazing experience for all of us at Toonami, and one that never ceases to give us joy. We just hope we are giving that joy back.”    Below is the full interview that I had with DeMarco about how Toonami got brought back from the grave:    On April 1, 2012, Toonami once again aired as an April Fools Day joke, despite its 2008 cancellation. How involved were you in the process of making this happen?   Very much so. I believe it was actually Mike Lazzo's idea in one of our brainstorming meetings we had about April Fools. He brought it up as a lark, and Gill Austin and I immediately walked out of that meeting beginning to try to figure out how to pull it off with no time and no money.    What made you (and/or Adult Swim) want to bring Toonami back after its 2008 cancellation?   Well those of us who had worked on Toonami had made our peace with its cancellation. But when we were offered a small chance to bring it back we knew we had to try. It had become clear to us in the years after it was cancelled in 2008 that there were people who WANTED it back.    How (and when) did plans to bring Toonami back start?   I believe it was two and a half months before April Fools Day 2012. Usually Adult Swim has a brainstorm about what we might do for April Fools Day on any given year, where everyone throws out ideas and we see what sticks. Mike Lazzo tossed out “what if we just brought Toonami back for a night, just switched over and it was suddenly like you were in 1999 and watching Cartoon Network?” Everyone loved the idea immediately, and the conversation very quickly moved on to “how the heck can we pull this off?”    Was the plan always to bring it back via an April Fools Day joke? If not, how did that happen?   Previous to the April Fools conversation we had, I swear, never ONCE talked in any serious way about bringing Toonami back. We just didn't think it was possible.    How did the shows that aired for this get picked?   We made a list of what we thought were the definitive Toonami shows. Then we strategized with Kim Manning, our head of programming, how best to approach distributors to see who might be willing to give us a one time license for, like, one episode of a show. We had no idea at all if any of them would work with us on such a weird request.    How was the reception to the April Fools Day joke? Any particularly memorable reactions?   It was incredible, one of the first experiences of my life where I really saw the power of social media to create a collective experience around a particular event as it unfolds. Seeing it blow up on Twitter and watching the mentions just grow, and keep growing, was amazing. All of us were texting each other that night as the event unfolded, and we all stayed up all night having a blast reading the reactions. Just a super great experience for all of us. We came in to work the following Monday still excited and talking about how amazing the response was.    The call from fans to bring back Toonami after this April Fools Day joke was pretty much immediate, and the next day Adult Swim tweeted, ""Want it back? Let us know. #BringBackToonami""--did all this directly contribute to Toonami's full revival a few months later?   Very much so. Basically the reaction to the event, combined with the responses to that Tweet, allowed us to come to Lazzo with a request to bring it back for real. Gill and I had a plan within a week and brought him a way to do it CHEAP and FAST. And thankfully he said yes. We set a target launch date, and started sprinted towards that date immediately.    10 years later, and Adult Swim is more involved in anime production than ever, such as through 2 new seasons of FLCL, Housing Complex C, and Uzumaki. How important has the revival of Toonami been to all this?   It's interesting. Obviously, anime and action have been a part of Adult Swim's DNA since the network's beginning. And even without Toonami returning, it's highly likely that Adult Swim would still be airing anime. Whether or not they would air AS MUCH anime or action, and move into original productions… I don't know. I'm gonna say that would be unlikely without a weekly Toonami block.    Any other thoughts/reflections/fun facts about Toonami's 2012 April Fools Day joke?   Refection-wise, it's just amazing to me that this is the tenth year of the Adult Swim iteration of Toonami. It's very rare that a person gets to have a second chance at creative work once it's been cancelled or wrapped up by the rights holders. It's something that in our case,  only happened with the unique combination of fan love and network freedom that Toonami and Adult Swim have. It's been an amazing experience for all of us at Toonami, and one that never ceases to give us joy. We just hope we are giving that joy back.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Dance Dance Danseur   Apr  9th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Dance Dance Danseur ?                     Community score: 3.7              What is this?   Junpei Murao was fascinated with ballet as a child, but in his second year of middle school, his father passed away and he decided he needed to become more ""masculine,"" and he gave up on his aspirations. While still having an attachment to ballet, he takes up the martial art of Jeet Kune Do, and becomes popular in his class. Then one day, a new transfer student named Miyako Godai arrives in Junpei's class, and her mother runs a ballet studio. Miyako realizes that Junpei is interested in ballet, and invites him to do ballet together.    Dance Dance Danseur is based on George Asakura's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                 Hey, did you know that toxic masculinity really messes people up? It's insidious. It trickles down to others subconsciously, teaching men, even as children, to encourage those who follow the classical male ideal and shame those who do not. Dance Dance Danseur is like a case study showing how these commonly held beliefs can rob a child of his dream and destiny—and how he has to fight against his own ingrained worldview to get them back.    As a child, we see that Junpei was willing and able to follow his dream to become a ballet dancer. He was even willing to fight his friends when they disparaged it. However, what really messed him up was the death of his father. His father was a martial artist and stuntman; in other words, he was about as stereotypical of a manly man as you can get.    When Junpei brings up his dream to his father, his father initially tries to dissuade him and get him to do Jeet Kun Do instead. This is partly due to his own ingrained toxic masculinity, but it's also because he wants a shared interest through which he can connect with his son. But Junpei can't see that second bit. All he can see is that his father wanted him to do something more manly than ballet, an idea that is reinforced when his uncle (a likewise manly man) tells the young boy to be strong for his family after his father's passing. In his own way, he is trying to help Junpei through his grief by giving him a reason to fight on, but Junpei (being a literal child) only hears: manly=good, girly=bad.    Now, years later, Junpei has done everything he can to be the manliest man he can be. He sees it as his way of honoring his father, making his family and friends happy with how great he has become. The only problem is that in doing so, he has forgone his own chance at true happiness. Is it any surprise he's turned out to be such an angry young man? He forced his own desires deep down inside but they keep bubbling up. The loving support of his mother and sister isn't enough for him to accept his true self. What he needs is someone to confront him on a “masculine level”—to aggressively attack him right in the male ego and make doing ballet part of his manly pride. Its only through regaining his own inborn self-worth—by determining for himself what it means to be a man—that Junpei can find happiness. And while in this episode he has taken a step towards that, it is only the first step of many.    Dance Dance Danseur's first episode is a fantastic breakdown of toxic masculinity and the harm it subconsciously inflicts on children. Moreover, it has fantastic animation and a great moral. Honestly, there's not much here to dislike.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This is one of those premieres that's frustrating in good and bad ways. For the good, when this episode ended I seriously wanted the next one right away, which means this premiere did its job. For the bad, part of the reason I wanted another episode is because this one only feels like half a story.    On the one hand, that may be a good decision – plenty of otherwise good shows rush through their premieres in order to get to some kind of climax, sacrificing important character work to reach a suitably big moment to end on. So it may ultimately be good thing that Junpei's story feels like it's still stuck on the tarmac waiting for permission to take off. Because what we do get from him is really interesting, and tells us a lot about who this kid is and what the overall theme of this story will be. We see a kid who clearly wants to follow his passion, but a mixture of grief and toxic masculinity keeps him from pursuing it.    Those combative forces cause him to waffle a lot through this episode, insisting he's left ballet behind as a childhood whim while coming back to Miyako's studio every day once the offer's extended. It can be a little irksome to see him going back and forth like that, but it also builds anticipation for that moment when he'll finally let go of all that baggage and dance the way he so obviously wants to. But that moment is not coming now, and it does feel a little underwhelming when the episode just kind of stops, rather than ending. We've gotten the setup, but no payoff. There's enough good stuff here that I'm confident that payoff will deliver, but having to wait is, well, frustrating.    The other stumbling block for some will probably be the character designs. An admirable job has been done to translate George Asakura's lanky, limpid-eyed designs for animation. The dance scenes are also all-around solid, capturing the grace and precision that can make ballet such a delight to watch. It's everything that isn't a dance sequence that leaves some worries for me – there's a number of awkward still frames and edits that could just be a consequence of the brisk pace of this premiere, or be portents of a looming production collapse from an overburdened MAPPA. I'd like it to be the former, as there's a ton of potential for an anime that can really deliver on honest-to-goodness ballet performances, and it'd suck to see that fall apart.    Hangups aside, there's a lot of good here and it's a unique offering in an already packed season. That will hopefully make it stand out, and if nothing else I'll be hanging around until we get that big moment of catharsis for Junpei. Consider it a hesitant thumbs up.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                If you don't know, until I broke my left ankle in four places, I was a dancer. Primarily modern dance, but ballet as well, and I was serious about it that I would have, as the unpleasantly abrasive dance teacher says in this episode, given up everything else to pursue it. But that's not how life works, and it certainly gives me mixed feelings about Dance Dance Danseur's first episode. On the one hand, I absolutely agree with some of what the teacher says – to really excel in dance on a professional level, you do have to start early and you do have to give up most other things…and even then, it might not work out, as one of my cousins learned when she was told she didn't have the right body type to ever be a prima ballerina. But there are also ways to enjoy being a dancer without putting in that level of commitment, and there's nothing that says that Junpei can't perform and be a dancer while still keeping up with his other activities.    That of course is part of the conflict. Junpei's always wanted to do ballet, but the levels of fragile and toxic masculinity around him are astronomical, preventing him from pursuing what he loves. His dad's comment that people “already think he's a girl” because he plays piano made my skin crawl, because way to randomly gender music and dance, sir. Then when his uncle (who I suspect may be one of those family friend uncles rather than blood related) tells him after his father's death that Jumpei has to be the man in the family now, the damage is complete—Junpei has to be the man, dancing isn't manly, therefore, he can't be a dancer. It's terrible and all too familiar, and the poor kid is still busy lying to himself when he's a second year in middle school, fooling everyone except his older sister and Miyako, the newish girl at school. Miyako knows a dance move when she sees one, no matter what crap Junpei feeds everyone else about martial arts kicks, and she becomes the one person who's willing to support him—or at least to do so without being a jerk about it, like her mother.    Basically this episode was an exercise in frustration begging for relief that will almost certainly come in later episodes. Junpei is clearly working towards accepting himself and what he loves, and he's got a lot to work through, including being a fourteen-year-old boy who can't think of any reason why Miyako would want him to dance besides that she likes him. (More likely the reason is that there are so few male dancers that she's having a hard time finding a partner her age.) It's mostly a good frustration, because it does look to be in service of something rewarding, and the dancing is well enough animated that we can feel the muscles engaging, especially in the opening performance that hooks Jumpei on dance in the first place. Likewise we can see how Jumpei is self-taught in his movements, which is an excellent detail. I'll need to give it a couple more episodes before I decide, because this is a subject I could be very picky about, but since it seems to be as close to a Swan anime (or even getting the rest of the manga in English) as I'm likely to get, I suspect I'll end up taking it.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            column          4 comments       This Week in Games - Let's Talk About Kingdom Hearts   Apr 16, 07:53 4 comments                 games    Heidi speculates on wtf is going on in the new Kingdom Hearts game and holy crap Witch on the Holy Night is getting a Western release?! ― Hi folks.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Dance Dance Danseur   Apr  9th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Dance Dance Danseur ?                     Community score: 3.7              What is this?   Junpei Murao was fascinated with ballet as a child, but in his second year of middle school, his father passed away and he decided he needed to become more ""masculine,"" and he gave up on his aspirations. While still having an attachment to ballet, he takes up the martial art of Jeet Kune Do, and becomes popular in his class. Then one day, a new transfer student named Miyako Godai arrives in Junpei's class, and her mother runs a ballet studio. Miyako realizes that Junpei is interested in ballet, and invites him to do ballet together.    Dance Dance Danseur is based on George Asakura's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                 Hey, did you know that toxic masculinity really messes people up? It's insidious. It trickles down to others subconsciously, teaching men, even as children, to encourage those who follow the classical male ideal and shame those who do not. Dance Dance Danseur is like a case study showing how these commonly held beliefs can rob a child of his dream and destiny—and how he has to fight against his own ingrained worldview to get them back.    As a child, we see that Junpei was willing and able to follow his dream to become a ballet dancer. He was even willing to fight his friends when they disparaged it. However, what really messed him up was the death of his father. His father was a martial artist and stuntman; in other words, he was about as stereotypical of a manly man as you can get.    When Junpei brings up his dream to his father, his father initially tries to dissuade him and get him to do Jeet Kun Do instead. This is partly due to his own ingrained toxic masculinity, but it's also because he wants a shared interest through which he can connect with his son. But Junpei can't see that second bit. All he can see is that his father wanted him to do something more manly than ballet, an idea that is reinforced when his uncle (a likewise manly man) tells the young boy to be strong for his family after his father's passing. In his own way, he is trying to help Junpei through his grief by giving him a reason to fight on, but Junpei (being a literal child) only hears: manly=good, girly=bad.    Now, years later, Junpei has done everything he can to be the manliest man he can be. He sees it as his way of honoring his father, making his family and friends happy with how great he has become. The only problem is that in doing so, he has forgone his own chance at true happiness. Is it any surprise he's turned out to be such an angry young man? He forced his own desires deep down inside but they keep bubbling up. The loving support of his mother and sister isn't enough for him to accept his true self. What he needs is someone to confront him on a “masculine level”—to aggressively attack him right in the male ego and make doing ballet part of his manly pride. Its only through regaining his own inborn self-worth—by determining for himself what it means to be a man—that Junpei can find happiness. And while in this episode he has taken a step towards that, it is only the first step of many.    Dance Dance Danseur's first episode is a fantastic breakdown of toxic masculinity and the harm it subconsciously inflicts on children. Moreover, it has fantastic animation and a great moral. Honestly, there's not much here to dislike.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This is one of those premieres that's frustrating in good and bad ways. For the good, when this episode ended I seriously wanted the next one right away, which means this premiere did its job. For the bad, part of the reason I wanted another episode is because this one only feels like half a story.    On the one hand, that may be a good decision – plenty of otherwise good shows rush through their premieres in order to get to some kind of climax, sacrificing important character work to reach a suitably big moment to end on. So it may ultimately be good thing that Junpei's story feels like it's still stuck on the tarmac waiting for permission to take off. Because what we do get from him is really interesting, and tells us a lot about who this kid is and what the overall theme of this story will be. We see a kid who clearly wants to follow his passion, but a mixture of grief and toxic masculinity keeps him from pursuing it.    Those combative forces cause him to waffle a lot through this episode, insisting he's left ballet behind as a childhood whim while coming back to Miyako's studio every day once the offer's extended. It can be a little irksome to see him going back and forth like that, but it also builds anticipation for that moment when he'll finally let go of all that baggage and dance the way he so obviously wants to. But that moment is not coming now, and it does feel a little underwhelming when the episode just kind of stops, rather than ending. We've gotten the setup, but no payoff. There's enough good stuff here that I'm confident that payoff will deliver, but having to wait is, well, frustrating.    The other stumbling block for some will probably be the character designs. An admirable job has been done to translate George Asakura's lanky, limpid-eyed designs for animation. The dance scenes are also all-around solid, capturing the grace and precision that can make ballet such a delight to watch. It's everything that isn't a dance sequence that leaves some worries for me – there's a number of awkward still frames and edits that could just be a consequence of the brisk pace of this premiere, or be portents of a looming production collapse from an overburdened MAPPA. I'd like it to be the former, as there's a ton of potential for an anime that can really deliver on honest-to-goodness ballet performances, and it'd suck to see that fall apart.    Hangups aside, there's a lot of good here and it's a unique offering in an already packed season. That will hopefully make it stand out, and if nothing else I'll be hanging around until we get that big moment of catharsis for Junpei. Consider it a hesitant thumbs up.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                If you don't know, until I broke my left ankle in four places, I was a dancer. Primarily modern dance, but ballet as well, and I was serious about it that I would have, as the unpleasantly abrasive dance teacher says in this episode, given up everything else to pursue it. But that's not how life works, and it certainly gives me mixed feelings about Dance Dance Danseur's first episode. On the one hand, I absolutely agree with some of what the teacher says – to really excel in dance on a professional level, you do have to start early and you do have to give up most other things…and even then, it might not work out, as one of my cousins learned when she was told she didn't have the right body type to ever be a prima ballerina. But there are also ways to enjoy being a dancer without putting in that level of commitment, and there's nothing that says that Junpei can't perform and be a dancer while still keeping up with his other activities.    That of course is part of the conflict. Junpei's always wanted to do ballet, but the levels of fragile and toxic masculinity around him are astronomical, preventing him from pursuing what he loves. His dad's comment that people “already think he's a girl” because he plays piano made my skin crawl, because way to randomly gender music and dance, sir. Then when his uncle (who I suspect may be one of those family friend uncles rather than blood related) tells him after his father's death that Jumpei has to be the man in the family now, the damage is complete—Junpei has to be the man, dancing isn't manly, therefore, he can't be a dancer. It's terrible and all too familiar, and the poor kid is still busy lying to himself when he's a second year in middle school, fooling everyone except his older sister and Miyako, the newish girl at school. Miyako knows a dance move when she sees one, no matter what crap Junpei feeds everyone else about martial arts kicks, and she becomes the one person who's willing to support him—or at least to do so without being a jerk about it, like her mother.    Basically this episode was an exercise in frustration begging for relief that will almost certainly come in later episodes. Junpei is clearly working towards accepting himself and what he loves, and he's got a lot to work through, including being a fourteen-year-old boy who can't think of any reason why Miyako would want him to dance besides that she likes him. (More likely the reason is that there are so few male dancers that she's having a hard time finding a partner her age.) It's mostly a good frustration, because it does look to be in service of something rewarding, and the dancing is well enough animated that we can feel the muscles engaging, especially in the opening performance that hooks Jumpei on dance in the first place. Likewise we can see how Jumpei is self-taught in his movements, which is an excellent detail. I'll need to give it a couple more episodes before I decide, because this is a subject I could be very picky about, but since it seems to be as close to a Swan anime (or even getting the rest of the manga in English) as I'm likely to get, I suspect I'll end up taking it.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            column          4 comments       This Week in Games - Let's Talk About Kingdom Hearts   Apr 16, 07:53 4 comments                 games    Heidi speculates on wtf is going on in the new Kingdom Hearts game and holy crap Witch on the Holy Night is getting a Western release?! ― Hi folks.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Dance Dance Danseur   Apr  9th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Dance Dance Danseur ?                     Community score: 3.7              What is this?   Junpei Murao was fascinated with ballet as a child, but in his second year of middle school, his father passed away and he decided he needed to become more ""masculine,"" and he gave up on his aspirations. While still having an attachment to ballet, he takes up the martial art of Jeet Kune Do, and becomes popular in his class. Then one day, a new transfer student named Miyako Godai arrives in Junpei's class, and her mother runs a ballet studio. Miyako realizes that Junpei is interested in ballet, and invites him to do ballet together.    Dance Dance Danseur is based on George Asakura's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                 Hey, did you know that toxic masculinity really messes people up? It's insidious. It trickles down to others subconsciously, teaching men, even as children, to encourage those who follow the classical male ideal and shame those who do not. Dance Dance Danseur is like a case study showing how these commonly held beliefs can rob a child of his dream and destiny—and how he has to fight against his own ingrained worldview to get them back.    As a child, we see that Junpei was willing and able to follow his dream to become a ballet dancer. He was even willing to fight his friends when they disparaged it. However, what really messed him up was the death of his father. His father was a martial artist and stuntman; in other words, he was about as stereotypical of a manly man as you can get.    When Junpei brings up his dream to his father, his father initially tries to dissuade him and get him to do Jeet Kun Do instead. This is partly due to his own ingrained toxic masculinity, but it's also because he wants a shared interest through which he can connect with his son. But Junpei can't see that second bit. All he can see is that his father wanted him to do something more manly than ballet, an idea that is reinforced when his uncle (a likewise manly man) tells the young boy to be strong for his family after his father's passing. In his own way, he is trying to help Junpei through his grief by giving him a reason to fight on, but Junpei (being a literal child) only hears: manly=good, girly=bad.    Now, years later, Junpei has done everything he can to be the manliest man he can be. He sees it as his way of honoring his father, making his family and friends happy with how great he has become. The only problem is that in doing so, he has forgone his own chance at true happiness. Is it any surprise he's turned out to be such an angry young man? He forced his own desires deep down inside but they keep bubbling up. The loving support of his mother and sister isn't enough for him to accept his true self. What he needs is someone to confront him on a “masculine level”—to aggressively attack him right in the male ego and make doing ballet part of his manly pride. Its only through regaining his own inborn self-worth—by determining for himself what it means to be a man—that Junpei can find happiness. And while in this episode he has taken a step towards that, it is only the first step of many.    Dance Dance Danseur's first episode is a fantastic breakdown of toxic masculinity and the harm it subconsciously inflicts on children. Moreover, it has fantastic animation and a great moral. Honestly, there's not much here to dislike.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This is one of those premieres that's frustrating in good and bad ways. For the good, when this episode ended I seriously wanted the next one right away, which means this premiere did its job. For the bad, part of the reason I wanted another episode is because this one only feels like half a story.    On the one hand, that may be a good decision – plenty of otherwise good shows rush through their premieres in order to get to some kind of climax, sacrificing important character work to reach a suitably big moment to end on. So it may ultimately be good thing that Junpei's story feels like it's still stuck on the tarmac waiting for permission to take off. Because what we do get from him is really interesting, and tells us a lot about who this kid is and what the overall theme of this story will be. We see a kid who clearly wants to follow his passion, but a mixture of grief and toxic masculinity keeps him from pursuing it.    Those combative forces cause him to waffle a lot through this episode, insisting he's left ballet behind as a childhood whim while coming back to Miyako's studio every day once the offer's extended. It can be a little irksome to see him going back and forth like that, but it also builds anticipation for that moment when he'll finally let go of all that baggage and dance the way he so obviously wants to. But that moment is not coming now, and it does feel a little underwhelming when the episode just kind of stops, rather than ending. We've gotten the setup, but no payoff. There's enough good stuff here that I'm confident that payoff will deliver, but having to wait is, well, frustrating.    The other stumbling block for some will probably be the character designs. An admirable job has been done to translate George Asakura's lanky, limpid-eyed designs for animation. The dance scenes are also all-around solid, capturing the grace and precision that can make ballet such a delight to watch. It's everything that isn't a dance sequence that leaves some worries for me – there's a number of awkward still frames and edits that could just be a consequence of the brisk pace of this premiere, or be portents of a looming production collapse from an overburdened MAPPA. I'd like it to be the former, as there's a ton of potential for an anime that can really deliver on honest-to-goodness ballet performances, and it'd suck to see that fall apart.    Hangups aside, there's a lot of good here and it's a unique offering in an already packed season. That will hopefully make it stand out, and if nothing else I'll be hanging around until we get that big moment of catharsis for Junpei. Consider it a hesitant thumbs up.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                If you don't know, until I broke my left ankle in four places, I was a dancer. Primarily modern dance, but ballet as well, and I was serious about it that I would have, as the unpleasantly abrasive dance teacher says in this episode, given up everything else to pursue it. But that's not how life works, and it certainly gives me mixed feelings about Dance Dance Danseur's first episode. On the one hand, I absolutely agree with some of what the teacher says – to really excel in dance on a professional level, you do have to start early and you do have to give up most other things…and even then, it might not work out, as one of my cousins learned when she was told she didn't have the right body type to ever be a prima ballerina. But there are also ways to enjoy being a dancer without putting in that level of commitment, and there's nothing that says that Junpei can't perform and be a dancer while still keeping up with his other activities.    That of course is part of the conflict. Junpei's always wanted to do ballet, but the levels of fragile and toxic masculinity around him are astronomical, preventing him from pursuing what he loves. His dad's comment that people “already think he's a girl” because he plays piano made my skin crawl, because way to randomly gender music and dance, sir. Then when his uncle (who I suspect may be one of those family friend uncles rather than blood related) tells him after his father's death that Jumpei has to be the man in the family now, the damage is complete—Junpei has to be the man, dancing isn't manly, therefore, he can't be a dancer. It's terrible and all too familiar, and the poor kid is still busy lying to himself when he's a second year in middle school, fooling everyone except his older sister and Miyako, the newish girl at school. Miyako knows a dance move when she sees one, no matter what crap Junpei feeds everyone else about martial arts kicks, and she becomes the one person who's willing to support him—or at least to do so without being a jerk about it, like her mother.    Basically this episode was an exercise in frustration begging for relief that will almost certainly come in later episodes. Junpei is clearly working towards accepting himself and what he loves, and he's got a lot to work through, including being a fourteen-year-old boy who can't think of any reason why Miyako would want him to dance besides that she likes him. (More likely the reason is that there are so few male dancers that she's having a hard time finding a partner her age.) It's mostly a good frustration, because it does look to be in service of something rewarding, and the dancing is well enough animated that we can feel the muscles engaging, especially in the opening performance that hooks Jumpei on dance in the first place. Likewise we can see how Jumpei is self-taught in his movements, which is an excellent detail. I'll need to give it a couple more episodes before I decide, because this is a subject I could be very picky about, but since it seems to be as close to a Swan anime (or even getting the rest of the manga in English) as I'm likely to get, I suspect I'll end up taking it.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            column          4 comments       This Week in Games - Let's Talk About Kingdom Hearts   Apr 16, 07:53 4 comments                 games    Heidi speculates on wtf is going on in the new Kingdom Hearts game and holy crap Witch on the Holy Night is getting a Western release?! ― Hi folks.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Dance Dance Danseur   Apr  9th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Dance Dance Danseur ?                     Community score: 3.7              What is this?   Junpei Murao was fascinated with ballet as a child, but in his second year of middle school, his father passed away and he decided he needed to become more ""masculine,"" and he gave up on his aspirations. While still having an attachment to ballet, he takes up the martial art of Jeet Kune Do, and becomes popular in his class. Then one day, a new transfer student named Miyako Godai arrives in Junpei's class, and her mother runs a ballet studio. Miyako realizes that Junpei is interested in ballet, and invites him to do ballet together.    Dance Dance Danseur is based on George Asakura's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                 Hey, did you know that toxic masculinity really messes people up? It's insidious. It trickles down to others subconsciously, teaching men, even as children, to encourage those who follow the classical male ideal and shame those who do not. Dance Dance Danseur is like a case study showing how these commonly held beliefs can rob a child of his dream and destiny—and how he has to fight against his own ingrained worldview to get them back.    As a child, we see that Junpei was willing and able to follow his dream to become a ballet dancer. He was even willing to fight his friends when they disparaged it. However, what really messed him up was the death of his father. His father was a martial artist and stuntman; in other words, he was about as stereotypical of a manly man as you can get.    When Junpei brings up his dream to his father, his father initially tries to dissuade him and get him to do Jeet Kun Do instead. This is partly due to his own ingrained toxic masculinity, but it's also because he wants a shared interest through which he can connect with his son. But Junpei can't see that second bit. All he can see is that his father wanted him to do something more manly than ballet, an idea that is reinforced when his uncle (a likewise manly man) tells the young boy to be strong for his family after his father's passing. In his own way, he is trying to help Junpei through his grief by giving him a reason to fight on, but Junpei (being a literal child) only hears: manly=good, girly=bad.    Now, years later, Junpei has done everything he can to be the manliest man he can be. He sees it as his way of honoring his father, making his family and friends happy with how great he has become. The only problem is that in doing so, he has forgone his own chance at true happiness. Is it any surprise he's turned out to be such an angry young man? He forced his own desires deep down inside but they keep bubbling up. The loving support of his mother and sister isn't enough for him to accept his true self. What he needs is someone to confront him on a “masculine level”—to aggressively attack him right in the male ego and make doing ballet part of his manly pride. Its only through regaining his own inborn self-worth—by determining for himself what it means to be a man—that Junpei can find happiness. And while in this episode he has taken a step towards that, it is only the first step of many.    Dance Dance Danseur's first episode is a fantastic breakdown of toxic masculinity and the harm it subconsciously inflicts on children. Moreover, it has fantastic animation and a great moral. Honestly, there's not much here to dislike.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This is one of those premieres that's frustrating in good and bad ways. For the good, when this episode ended I seriously wanted the next one right away, which means this premiere did its job. For the bad, part of the reason I wanted another episode is because this one only feels like half a story.    On the one hand, that may be a good decision – plenty of otherwise good shows rush through their premieres in order to get to some kind of climax, sacrificing important character work to reach a suitably big moment to end on. So it may ultimately be good thing that Junpei's story feels like it's still stuck on the tarmac waiting for permission to take off. Because what we do get from him is really interesting, and tells us a lot about who this kid is and what the overall theme of this story will be. We see a kid who clearly wants to follow his passion, but a mixture of grief and toxic masculinity keeps him from pursuing it.    Those combative forces cause him to waffle a lot through this episode, insisting he's left ballet behind as a childhood whim while coming back to Miyako's studio every day once the offer's extended. It can be a little irksome to see him going back and forth like that, but it also builds anticipation for that moment when he'll finally let go of all that baggage and dance the way he so obviously wants to. But that moment is not coming now, and it does feel a little underwhelming when the episode just kind of stops, rather than ending. We've gotten the setup, but no payoff. There's enough good stuff here that I'm confident that payoff will deliver, but having to wait is, well, frustrating.    The other stumbling block for some will probably be the character designs. An admirable job has been done to translate George Asakura's lanky, limpid-eyed designs for animation. The dance scenes are also all-around solid, capturing the grace and precision that can make ballet such a delight to watch. It's everything that isn't a dance sequence that leaves some worries for me – there's a number of awkward still frames and edits that could just be a consequence of the brisk pace of this premiere, or be portents of a looming production collapse from an overburdened MAPPA. I'd like it to be the former, as there's a ton of potential for an anime that can really deliver on honest-to-goodness ballet performances, and it'd suck to see that fall apart.    Hangups aside, there's a lot of good here and it's a unique offering in an already packed season. That will hopefully make it stand out, and if nothing else I'll be hanging around until we get that big moment of catharsis for Junpei. Consider it a hesitant thumbs up.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                If you don't know, until I broke my left ankle in four places, I was a dancer. Primarily modern dance, but ballet as well, and I was serious about it that I would have, as the unpleasantly abrasive dance teacher says in this episode, given up everything else to pursue it. But that's not how life works, and it certainly gives me mixed feelings about Dance Dance Danseur's first episode. On the one hand, I absolutely agree with some of what the teacher says – to really excel in dance on a professional level, you do have to start early and you do have to give up most other things…and even then, it might not work out, as one of my cousins learned when she was told she didn't have the right body type to ever be a prima ballerina. But there are also ways to enjoy being a dancer without putting in that level of commitment, and there's nothing that says that Junpei can't perform and be a dancer while still keeping up with his other activities.    That of course is part of the conflict. Junpei's always wanted to do ballet, but the levels of fragile and toxic masculinity around him are astronomical, preventing him from pursuing what he loves. His dad's comment that people “already think he's a girl” because he plays piano made my skin crawl, because way to randomly gender music and dance, sir. Then when his uncle (who I suspect may be one of those family friend uncles rather than blood related) tells him after his father's death that Jumpei has to be the man in the family now, the damage is complete—Junpei has to be the man, dancing isn't manly, therefore, he can't be a dancer. It's terrible and all too familiar, and the poor kid is still busy lying to himself when he's a second year in middle school, fooling everyone except his older sister and Miyako, the newish girl at school. Miyako knows a dance move when she sees one, no matter what crap Junpei feeds everyone else about martial arts kicks, and she becomes the one person who's willing to support him—or at least to do so without being a jerk about it, like her mother.    Basically this episode was an exercise in frustration begging for relief that will almost certainly come in later episodes. Junpei is clearly working towards accepting himself and what he loves, and he's got a lot to work through, including being a fourteen-year-old boy who can't think of any reason why Miyako would want him to dance besides that she likes him. (More likely the reason is that there are so few male dancers that she's having a hard time finding a partner her age.) It's mostly a good frustration, because it does look to be in service of something rewarding, and the dancing is well enough animated that we can feel the muscles engaging, especially in the opening performance that hooks Jumpei on dance in the first place. Likewise we can see how Jumpei is self-taught in his movements, which is an excellent detail. I'll need to give it a couple more episodes before I decide, because this is a subject I could be very picky about, but since it seems to be as close to a Swan anime (or even getting the rest of the manga in English) as I'm likely to get, I suspect I'll end up taking it.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            column          4 comments       This Week in Games - Let's Talk About Kingdom Hearts   Apr 16, 07:53 4 comments                 games    Heidi speculates on wtf is going on in the new Kingdom Hearts game and holy crap Witch on the Holy Night is getting a Western release?! ― Hi folks.

On the one hand, that may be a good decision – plenty of otherwise good shows rush through their premieres in order to get to some kind of climax, sacrificing important character work to reach a suitably big moment to end on. So it may ultimately be good thing that Junpei's story feels like it's still stuck on the tarmac waiting for permission to take off. Because what we do get from him is really interesting, and tells us a lot about who this kid is and what the overall theme of this story will be. We see a kid who clearly wants to follow his passion, but a mixture of grief and toxic masculinity keeps him from pursuing it.    Those combative forces cause him to waffle a lot through this episode, insisting he's left ballet behind as a childhood whim while coming back to Miyako's studio every day once the offer's extended. It can be a little irksome to see him going back and forth like that, but it also builds anticipation for that moment when he'll finally let go of all that baggage and dance the way he so obviously wants to. But that moment is not coming now, and it does feel a little underwhelming when the episode just kind of stops, rather than ending. We've gotten the setup, but no payoff. There's enough good stuff here that I'm confident that payoff will deliver, but having to wait is, well, frustrating.    The other stumbling block for some will probably be the character designs. An admirable job has been done to translate George Asakura's lanky, limpid-eyed designs for animation. The dance scenes are also all-around solid, capturing the grace and precision that can make ballet such a delight to watch. It's everything that isn't a dance sequence that leaves some worries for me – there's a number of awkward still frames and edits that could just be a consequence of the brisk pace of this premiere, or be portents of a looming production collapse from an overburdened MAPPA. I'd like it to be the former, as there's a ton of potential for an anime that can really deliver on honest-to-goodness ballet performances, and it'd suck to see that fall apart.    Hangups aside, there's a lot of good here and it's a unique offering in an already packed season. That will hopefully make it stand out, and if nothing else I'll be hanging around until we get that big moment of catharsis for Junpei. Consider it a hesitant thumbs up.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                If you don't know, until I broke my left ankle in four places, I was a dancer. Primarily modern dance, but ballet as well, and I was serious about it that I would have, as the unpleasantly abrasive dance teacher says in this episode, given up everything else to pursue it. But that's not how life works, and it certainly gives me mixed feelings about Dance Dance Danseur's first episode. On the one hand, I absolutely agree with some of what the teacher says – to really excel in dance on a professional level, you do have to start early and you do have to give up most other things…and even then, it might not work out, as one of my cousins learned when she was told she didn't have the right body type to ever be a prima ballerina. But there are also ways to enjoy being a dancer without putting in that level of commitment, and there's nothing that says that Junpei can't perform and be a dancer while still keeping up with his other activities.    That of course is part of the conflict. Junpei's always wanted to do ballet, but the levels of fragile and toxic masculinity around him are astronomical, preventing him from pursuing what he loves. His dad's comment that people “already think he's a girl” because he plays piano made my skin crawl, because way to randomly gender music and dance, sir. Then when his uncle (who I suspect may be one of those family friend uncles rather than blood related) tells him after his father's death that Jumpei has to be the man in the family now, the damage is complete—Junpei has to be the man, dancing isn't manly, therefore, he can't be a dancer. It's terrible and all too familiar, and the poor kid is still busy lying to himself when he's a second year in middle school, fooling everyone except his older sister and Miyako, the newish girl at school. Miyako knows a dance move when she sees one, no matter what crap Junpei feeds everyone else about martial arts kicks, and she becomes the one person who's willing to support him—or at least to do so without being a jerk about it, like her mother.    Basically this episode was an exercise in frustration begging for relief that will almost certainly come in later episodes. Junpei is clearly working towards accepting himself and what he loves, and he's got a lot to work through, including being a fourteen-year-old boy who can't think of any reason why Miyako would want him to dance besides that she likes him. (More likely the reason is that there are so few male dancers that she's having a hard time finding a partner her age.) It's mostly a good frustration, because it does look to be in service of something rewarding, and the dancing is well enough animated that we can feel the muscles engaging, especially in the opening performance that hooks Jumpei on dance in the first place. Likewise we can see how Jumpei is self-taught in his movements, which is an excellent detail. I'll need to give it a couple more episodes before I decide, because this is a subject I could be very picky about, but since it seems to be as close to a Swan anime (or even getting the rest of the manga in English) as I'm likely to get, I suspect I'll end up taking it.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Dance Dance Danseur   Apr  9th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Dance Dance Danseur ?                     Community score: 3.7              What is this?   Junpei Murao was fascinated with ballet as a child, but in his second year of middle school, his father passed away and he decided he needed to become more ""masculine,"" and he gave up on his aspirations. While still having an attachment to ballet, he takes up the martial art of Jeet Kune Do, and becomes popular in his class. Then one day, a new transfer student named Miyako Godai arrives in Junpei's class, and her mother runs a ballet studio. Miyako realizes that Junpei is interested in ballet, and invites him to do ballet together.    Dance Dance Danseur is based on George Asakura's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                 Hey, did you know that toxic masculinity really messes people up? It's insidious. It trickles down to others subconsciously, teaching men, even as children, to encourage those who follow the classical male ideal and shame those who do not. Dance Dance Danseur is like a case study showing how these commonly held beliefs can rob a child of his dream and destiny—and how he has to fight against his own ingrained worldview to get them back.    As a child, we see that Junpei was willing and able to follow his dream to become a ballet dancer. He was even willing to fight his friends when they disparaged it. However, what really messed him up was the death of his father. His father was a martial artist and stuntman; in other words, he was about as stereotypical of a manly man as you can get.    When Junpei brings up his dream to his father, his father initially tries to dissuade him and get him to do Jeet Kun Do instead. This is partly due to his own ingrained toxic masculinity, but it's also because he wants a shared interest through which he can connect with his son. But Junpei can't see that second bit. All he can see is that his father wanted him to do something more manly than ballet, an idea that is reinforced when his uncle (a likewise manly man) tells the young boy to be strong for his family after his father's passing. In his own way, he is trying to help Junpei through his grief by giving him a reason to fight on, but Junpei (being a literal child) only hears: manly=good, girly=bad.    Now, years later, Junpei has done everything he can to be the manliest man he can be. He sees it as his way of honoring his father, making his family and friends happy with how great he has become. The only problem is that in doing so, he has forgone his own chance at true happiness. Is it any surprise he's turned out to be such an angry young man? He forced his own desires deep down inside but they keep bubbling up. The loving support of his mother and sister isn't enough for him to accept his true self. What he needs is someone to confront him on a “masculine level”—to aggressively attack him right in the male ego and make doing ballet part of his manly pride. Its only through regaining his own inborn self-worth—by determining for himself what it means to be a man—that Junpei can find happiness. And while in this episode he has taken a step towards that, it is only the first step of many.    Dance Dance Danseur's first episode is a fantastic breakdown of toxic masculinity and the harm it subconsciously inflicts on children. Moreover, it has fantastic animation and a great moral. Honestly, there's not much here to dislike.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This is one of those premieres that's frustrating in good and bad ways.

Because what we do get from him is really interesting, and tells us a lot about who this kid is and what the overall theme of this story will be. We see a kid who clearly wants to follow his passion, but a mixture of grief and toxic masculinity keeps him from pursuing it.    Those combative forces cause him to waffle a lot through this episode, insisting he's left ballet behind as a childhood whim while coming back to Miyako's studio every day once the offer's extended. It can be a little irksome to see him going back and forth like that, but it also builds anticipation for that moment when he'll finally let go of all that baggage and dance the way he so obviously wants to. But that moment is not coming now, and it does feel a little underwhelming when the episode just kind of stops, rather than ending. We've gotten the setup, but no payoff. There's enough good stuff here that I'm confident that payoff will deliver, but having to wait is, well, frustrating.    The other stumbling block for some will probably be the character designs. An admirable job has been done to translate George Asakura's lanky, limpid-eyed designs for animation. The dance scenes are also all-around solid, capturing the grace and precision that can make ballet such a delight to watch. It's everything that isn't a dance sequence that leaves some worries for me – there's a number of awkward still frames and edits that could just be a consequence of the brisk pace of this premiere, or be portents of a looming production collapse from an overburdened MAPPA. I'd like it to be the former, as there's a ton of potential for an anime that can really deliver on honest-to-goodness ballet performances, and it'd suck to see that fall apart.    Hangups aside, there's a lot of good here and it's a unique offering in an already packed season. That will hopefully make it stand out, and if nothing else I'll be hanging around until we get that big moment of catharsis for Junpei. Consider it a hesitant thumbs up.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                If you don't know, until I broke my left ankle in four places, I was a dancer. Primarily modern dance, but ballet as well, and I was serious about it that I would have, as the unpleasantly abrasive dance teacher says in this episode, given up everything else to pursue it. But that's not how life works, and it certainly gives me mixed feelings about Dance Dance Danseur's first episode. On the one hand, I absolutely agree with some of what the teacher says – to really excel in dance on a professional level, you do have to start early and you do have to give up most other things…and even then, it might not work out, as one of my cousins learned when she was told she didn't have the right body type to ever be a prima ballerina. But there are also ways to enjoy being a dancer without putting in that level of commitment, and there's nothing that says that Junpei can't perform and be a dancer while still keeping up with his other activities.    That of course is part of the conflict. Junpei's always wanted to do ballet, but the levels of fragile and toxic masculinity around him are astronomical, preventing him from pursuing what he loves. His dad's comment that people “already think he's a girl” because he plays piano made my skin crawl, because way to randomly gender music and dance, sir. Then when his uncle (who I suspect may be one of those family friend uncles rather than blood related) tells him after his father's death that Jumpei has to be the man in the family now, the damage is complete—Junpei has to be the man, dancing isn't manly, therefore, he can't be a dancer. It's terrible and all too familiar, and the poor kid is still busy lying to himself when he's a second year in middle school, fooling everyone except his older sister and Miyako, the newish girl at school. Miyako knows a dance move when she sees one, no matter what crap Junpei feeds everyone else about martial arts kicks, and she becomes the one person who's willing to support him—or at least to do so without being a jerk about it, like her mother.    Basically this episode was an exercise in frustration begging for relief that will almost certainly come in later episodes. Junpei is clearly working towards accepting himself and what he loves, and he's got a lot to work through, including being a fourteen-year-old boy who can't think of any reason why Miyako would want him to dance besides that she likes him. (More likely the reason is that there are so few male dancers that she's having a hard time finding a partner her age.) It's mostly a good frustration, because it does look to be in service of something rewarding, and the dancing is well enough animated that we can feel the muscles engaging, especially in the opening performance that hooks Jumpei on dance in the first place. Likewise we can see how Jumpei is self-taught in his movements, which is an excellent detail. I'll need to give it a couple more episodes before I decide, because this is a subject I could be very picky about, but since it seems to be as close to a Swan anime (or even getting the rest of the manga in English) as I'm likely to get, I suspect I'll end up taking it.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives     ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 3.7              What is this?   Junpei Murao was fascinated with ballet as a child, but in his second year of middle school, his father passed away and he decided he needed to become more ""masculine,"" and he gave up on his aspirations. While still having an attachment to ballet, he takes up the martial art of Jeet Kune Do, and becomes popular in his class. Then one day, a new transfer student named Miyako Godai arrives in Junpei's class, and her mother runs a ballet studio. Miyako realizes that Junpei is interested in ballet, and invites him to do ballet together.    Dance Dance Danseur is based on George Asakura's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                 Hey, did you know that toxic masculinity really messes people up? It's insidious. It trickles down to others subconsciously, teaching men, even as children, to encourage those who follow the classical male ideal and shame those who do not. Dance Dance Danseur is like a case study showing how these commonly held beliefs can rob a child of his dream and destiny—and how he has to fight against his own ingrained worldview to get them back.    As a child, we see that Junpei was willing and able to follow his dream to become a ballet dancer. He was even willing to fight his friends when they disparaged it. However, what really messed him up was the death of his father. His father was a martial artist and stuntman; in other words, he was about as stereotypical of a manly man as you can get.    When Junpei brings up his dream to his father, his father initially tries to dissuade him and get him to do Jeet Kun Do instead. This is partly due to his own ingrained toxic masculinity, but it's also because he wants a shared interest through which he can connect with his son. But Junpei can't see that second bit. All he can see is that his father wanted him to do something more manly than ballet, an idea that is reinforced when his uncle (a likewise manly man) tells the young boy to be strong for his family after his father's passing. In his own way, he is trying to help Junpei through his grief by giving him a reason to fight on, but Junpei (being a literal child) only hears: manly=good, girly=bad.    Now, years later, Junpei has done everything he can to be the manliest man he can be. He sees it as his way of honoring his father, making his family and friends happy with how great he has become. The only problem is that in doing so, he has forgone his own chance at true happiness. Is it any surprise he's turned out to be such an angry young man? He forced his own desires deep down inside but they keep bubbling up. The loving support of his mother and sister isn't enough for him to accept his true self. What he needs is someone to confront him on a “masculine level”—to aggressively attack him right in the male ego and make doing ballet part of his manly pride. Its only through regaining his own inborn self-worth—by determining for himself what it means to be a man—that Junpei can find happiness. And while in this episode he has taken a step towards that, it is only the first step of many.    Dance Dance Danseur's first episode is a fantastic breakdown of toxic masculinity and the harm it subconsciously inflicts on children. Moreover, it has fantastic animation and a great moral. Honestly, there's not much here to dislike.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This is one of those premieres that's frustrating in good and bad ways. For the good, when this episode ended I seriously wanted the next one right away, which means this premiere did its job. For the bad, part of the reason I wanted another episode is because this one only feels like half a story.

I'd like it to be the former, as there's a ton of potential for an anime that can really deliver on honest-to-goodness ballet performances, and it'd suck to see that fall apart.    Hangups aside, there's a lot of good here and it's a unique offering in an already packed season. That will hopefully make it stand out, and if nothing else I'll be hanging around until we get that big moment of catharsis for Junpei. Consider it a hesitant thumbs up.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                If you don't know, until I broke my left ankle in four places, I was a dancer. Primarily modern dance, but ballet as well, and I was serious about it that I would have, as the unpleasantly abrasive dance teacher says in this episode, given up everything else to pursue it. But that's not how life works, and it certainly gives me mixed feelings about Dance Dance Danseur's first episode. On the one hand, I absolutely agree with some of what the teacher says – to really excel in dance on a professional level, you do have to start early and you do have to give up most other things…and even then, it might not work out, as one of my cousins learned when she was told she didn't have the right body type to ever be a prima ballerina. But there are also ways to enjoy being a dancer without putting in that level of commitment, and there's nothing that says that Junpei can't perform and be a dancer while still keeping up with his other activities.    That of course is part of the conflict. Junpei's always wanted to do ballet, but the levels of fragile and toxic masculinity around him are astronomical, preventing him from pursuing what he loves. His dad's comment that people “already think he's a girl” because he plays piano made my skin crawl, because way to randomly gender music and dance, sir. Then when his uncle (who I suspect may be one of those family friend uncles rather than blood related) tells him after his father's death that Jumpei has to be the man in the family now, the damage is complete—Junpei has to be the man, dancing isn't manly, therefore, he can't be a dancer. It's terrible and all too familiar, and the poor kid is still busy lying to himself when he's a second year in middle school, fooling everyone except his older sister and Miyako, the newish girl at school. Miyako knows a dance move when she sees one, no matter what crap Junpei feeds everyone else about martial arts kicks, and she becomes the one person who's willing to support him—or at least to do so without being a jerk about it, like her mother.    Basically this episode was an exercise in frustration begging for relief that will almost certainly come in later episodes. Junpei is clearly working towards accepting himself and what he loves, and he's got a lot to work through, including being a fourteen-year-old boy who can't think of any reason why Miyako would want him to dance besides that she likes him. (More likely the reason is that there are so few male dancers that she's having a hard time finding a partner her age.) It's mostly a good frustration, because it does look to be in service of something rewarding, and the dancing is well enough animated that we can feel the muscles engaging, especially in the opening performance that hooks Jumpei on dance in the first place. Likewise we can see how Jumpei is self-taught in his movements, which is an excellent detail. I'll need to give it a couple more episodes before I decide, because this is a subject I could be very picky about, but since it seems to be as close to a Swan anime (or even getting the rest of the manga in English) as I'm likely to get, I suspect I'll end up taking it.

16-04-2022,anime,2,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/preview-guide/2022/spring/dance-dance-danseur/.183671,Dance Dance Danseur - The Spring 2022 Preview Guide - Anime News Network:SEA,"            How would you rate episode 1 of Dance Dance Danseur ?                     Community score: 3.7              What is this?   Junpei Murao was fascinated with ballet as a child, but in his second year of middle school, his father passed away and he decided he needed to become more ""masculine,"" and he gave up on his aspirations. While still having an attachment to ballet, he takes up the martial art of Jeet Kune Do, and becomes popular in his class. Then one day, a new transfer student named Miyako Godai arrives in Junpei's class, and her mother runs a ballet studio. Miyako realizes that Junpei is interested in ballet, and invites him to do ballet together.    Dance Dance Danseur is based on George Asakura's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                 Hey, did you know that toxic masculinity really messes people up? It's insidious. It trickles down to others subconsciously, teaching men, even as children, to encourage those who follow the classical male ideal and shame those who do not. Dance Dance Danseur is like a case study showing how these commonly held beliefs can rob a child of his dream and destiny—and how he has to fight against his own ingrained worldview to get them back.    As a child, we see that Junpei was willing and able to follow his dream to become a ballet dancer. He was even willing to fight his friends when they disparaged it. However, what really messed him up was the death of his father. His father was a martial artist and stuntman; in other words, he was about as stereotypical of a manly man as you can get.    When Junpei brings up his dream to his father, his father initially tries to dissuade him and get him to do Jeet Kun Do instead. This is partly due to his own ingrained toxic masculinity, but it's also because he wants a shared interest through which he can connect with his son. But Junpei can't see that second bit. All he can see is that his father wanted him to do something more manly than ballet, an idea that is reinforced when his uncle (a likewise manly man) tells the young boy to be strong for his family after his father's passing. In his own way, he is trying to help Junpei through his grief by giving him a reason to fight on, but Junpei (being a literal child) only hears: manly=good, girly=bad.    Now, years later, Junpei has done everything he can to be the manliest man he can be. He sees it as his way of honoring his father, making his family and friends happy with how great he has become. The only problem is that in doing so, he has forgone his own chance at true happiness. Is it any surprise he's turned out to be such an angry young man? He forced his own desires deep down inside but they keep bubbling up. The loving support of his mother and sister isn't enough for him to accept his true self. What he needs is someone to confront him on a “masculine level”—to aggressively attack him right in the male ego and make doing ballet part of his manly pride. Its only through regaining his own inborn self-worth—by determining for himself what it means to be a man—that Junpei can find happiness. And while in this episode he has taken a step towards that, it is only the first step of many.    Dance Dance Danseur's first episode is a fantastic breakdown of toxic masculinity and the harm it subconsciously inflicts on children. Moreover, it has fantastic animation and a great moral. Honestly, there's not much here to dislike.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This is one of those premieres that's frustrating in good and bad ways. For the good, when this episode ended I seriously wanted the next one right away, which means this premiere did its job. For the bad, part of the reason I wanted another episode is because this one only feels like half a story.    On the one hand, that may be a good decision – plenty of otherwise good shows rush through their premieres in order to get to some kind of climax, sacrificing important character work to reach a suitably big moment to end on. So it may ultimately be good thing that Junpei's story feels like it's still stuck on the tarmac waiting for permission to take off. Because what we do get from him is really interesting, and tells us a lot about who this kid is and what the overall theme of this story will be. We see a kid who clearly wants to follow his passion, but a mixture of grief and toxic masculinity keeps him from pursuing it.    Those combative forces cause him to waffle a lot through this episode, insisting he's left ballet behind as a childhood whim while coming back to Miyako's studio every day once the offer's extended. It can be a little irksome to see him going back and forth like that, but it also builds anticipation for that moment when he'll finally let go of all that baggage and dance the way he so obviously wants to. But that moment is not coming now, and it does feel a little underwhelming when the episode just kind of stops, rather than ending. We've gotten the setup, but no payoff. There's enough good stuff here that I'm confident that payoff will deliver, but having to wait is, well, frustrating.    The other stumbling block for some will probably be the character designs. An admirable job has been done to translate George Asakura's lanky, limpid-eyed designs for animation. The dance scenes are also all-around solid, capturing the grace and precision that can make ballet such a delight to watch. It's everything that isn't a dance sequence that leaves some worries for me – there's a number of awkward still frames and edits that could just be a consequence of the brisk pace of this premiere, or be portents of a looming production collapse from an overburdened MAPPA. I'd like it to be the former, as there's a ton of potential for an anime that can really deliver on honest-to-goodness ballet performances, and it'd suck to see that fall apart.
