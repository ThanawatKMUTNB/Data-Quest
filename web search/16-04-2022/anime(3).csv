Interest Help Bojji & Kage Escape the Underworld In Ranking of Kings Escape Room   posted on 2022-04-13 01:45 UTC-8 by Kim Morrissy         Game will run in North Shinjuku's Dramatic Hole from April 29 to May 29    The Ranking of Kings anime is getting a ""dramatic"" escape room, which will run in North Shinjuku's Dramatic Hole from April 29 to May 29. Participants will aid Bojji and Kage as they attempt to break free from the Underworld dungeon, which is rumored to be a place where nobody can escape from.     Yodaka no Record, the game's organizer, describes the ""Escape from the Still-as-death Underworld Dungeon"" game concept as a ""dramatic"" escape room because players will experience events ""far removed from daily life"" as they progress in the dramatic story. The game will feature voices by Minami Hinata (Bojji), Ayumu Murase (Kage), Rina Satou (Hilling), and Takahiro Sakurai (Despa).    Sōsuke Tōka's Ranking of Kings (Ōsama Ranking) manga centers around Bojji, a deaf, powerless prince who cannot even wield a children's sword. He is able to make his first-ever friend, ""Kage"" (shadow) — a literal shadow on the ground who somehow understands Bojji well. The story follows Bojji's coming-of-age as he meets various people in his life, starting with his fateful encounter with Kage.    The manga inspired a television anime that premiered on October 14, and ran for two continuous cours (quarters of the year). Funimation streamed the anime as it aired in Japan, and it is also streaming an English dub.

Interest Help Bojji & Kage Escape the Underworld In Ranking of Kings Escape Room   posted on 2022-04-13 01:45 UTC-8 by Kim Morrissy         Game will run in North Shinjuku's Dramatic Hole from April 29 to May 29    The Ranking of Kings anime is getting a ""dramatic"" escape room, which will run in North Shinjuku's Dramatic Hole from April 29 to May 29. Participants will aid Bojji and Kage as they attempt to break free from the Underworld dungeon, which is rumored to be a place where nobody can escape from.     Yodaka no Record, the game's organizer, describes the ""Escape from the Still-as-death Underworld Dungeon"" game concept as a ""dramatic"" escape room because players will experience events ""far removed from daily life"" as they progress in the dramatic story. The game will feature voices by Minami Hinata (Bojji), Ayumu Murase (Kage), Rina Satou (Hilling), and Takahiro Sakurai (Despa).    Sōsuke Tōka's Ranking of Kings (Ōsama Ranking) manga centers around Bojji, a deaf, powerless prince who cannot even wield a children's sword. He is able to make his first-ever friend, ""Kage"" (shadow) — a literal shadow on the ground who somehow understands Bojji well. The story follows Bojji's coming-of-age as he meets various people in his life, starting with his fateful encounter with Kage.    The manga inspired a television anime that premiered on October 14, and ran for two continuous cours (quarters of the year). Funimation streamed the anime as it aired in Japan, and it is also streaming an English dub.

Interest Help Bojji & Kage Escape the Underworld In Ranking of Kings Escape Room   posted on 2022-04-13 01:45 UTC-8 by Kim Morrissy         Game will run in North Shinjuku's Dramatic Hole from April 29 to May 29    The Ranking of Kings anime is getting a ""dramatic"" escape room, which will run in North Shinjuku's Dramatic Hole from April 29 to May 29. Participants will aid Bojji and Kage as they attempt to break free from the Underworld dungeon, which is rumored to be a place where nobody can escape from.     Yodaka no Record, the game's organizer, describes the ""Escape from the Still-as-death Underworld Dungeon"" game concept as a ""dramatic"" escape room because players will experience events ""far removed from daily life"" as they progress in the dramatic story. The game will feature voices by Minami Hinata (Bojji), Ayumu Murase (Kage), Rina Satou (Hilling), and Takahiro Sakurai (Despa).    Sōsuke Tōka's Ranking of Kings (Ōsama Ranking) manga centers around Bojji, a deaf, powerless prince who cannot even wield a children's sword. He is able to make his first-ever friend, ""Kage"" (shadow) — a literal shadow on the ground who somehow understands Bojji well. The story follows Bojji's coming-of-age as he meets various people in his life, starting with his fateful encounter with Kage.    The manga inspired a television anime that premiered on October 14, and ran for two continuous cours (quarters of the year). Funimation streamed the anime as it aired in Japan, and it is also streaming an English dub.

Participants will aid Bojji and Kage as they attempt to break free from the Underworld dungeon, which is rumored to be a place where nobody can escape from.     Yodaka no Record, the game's organizer, describes the ""Escape from the Still-as-death Underworld Dungeon"" game concept as a ""dramatic"" escape room because players will experience events ""far removed from daily life"" as they progress in the dramatic story. The game will feature voices by Minami Hinata (Bojji), Ayumu Murase (Kage), Rina Satou (Hilling), and Takahiro Sakurai (Despa).    Sōsuke Tōka's Ranking of Kings (Ōsama Ranking) manga centers around Bojji, a deaf, powerless prince who cannot even wield a children's sword. He is able to make his first-ever friend, ""Kage"" (shadow) — a literal shadow on the ground who somehow understands Bojji well. The story follows Bojji's coming-of-age as he meets various people in his life, starting with his fateful encounter with Kage.    The manga inspired a television anime that premiered on October 14, and ran for two continuous cours (quarters of the year). Funimation streamed the anime as it aired in Japan, and it is also streaming an English dub.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Deaimon: Recipe for Happiness   Apr  7th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Deaimon: Recipe for Happiness ?                     Community score: 4.1              What is this?   Nagomu is a man who left his home in Kyoto and his family's confectionary shop when he became a musician. Upon hearing that his father has been hospitalized though, he comes back home to take over the family business. However, while he was gone, a young girl named Itsuka started working at the shop. The whereabouts of Itsuka's parents is unknown, and she has no other relatives, and Nagomu finds himself as foster parent for Itsuka. Itsuka, on the other hand, dislikes Nagomu for abandoning the family to become a musician. She proclaims that it will be her who will take over the shop one day instead of Nagomu.    Deaimon: Recipe for Happiness is based on Rin Asano's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Wednesdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                 While perhaps Usagi Drop is the most obvious comparison, Deaimon reminded me most of Poco's Udon World, a lovely series about a man who moves back home to take over his family's udon shop and finds himself caring for a young tanuki as a father figure that no one watched. It's cozy and gentle, exploring the intersection and tensions between modern adulthood and maintaining family and cultural traditions. Nagomu always genuinely loved the wagashi he made, but his love was a bit too intense and he ended up pursuing a career as a musician instead. Now that his band has broken up, he comes home and has to renavigate his relationship with his family, with wagashi, and with this new little interloper named Itsuka.    Okay, “interloper” is a little rude and not even really representative of how Nagumo or the show's narrative regard her. After all, it's not like Itsuka chose to be there; she was abandoned by her parents, left in the hands of basically strangers, and feels obligated to work far harder than any ten-year-old should need to. The way the two play off each other is sweet. Nagumo is a huge goof, a big puppyish man full of nothing but love, enthusiasm, and a willingness to make a fool of himself, while Itsuka is far too serious and hardworking for her age, denying her own childhood due to her sense of obligation and trauma over abandonment.    I've seen this described as “dadime” (a portmanteau of ""dad"" and ""anime""), which is one of my personal weaknesses. While Nagumo is old enough to be Itsuka's father, I don't think it's quite accurate. He's more of a big brother than a dad, but either way, he's exactly what Itsuka needs. I look forward to seeing their relationship unfold.      James Beckett  Rating:                 I'm the kind of guy that's awfully susceptible to the allure of “Dad Simulators” like The Walking Dead games or The Last of Us, though I haven't had so much luck with such subject matter in anime outside of a select few titles (Hinamatsuri comes to mind, and maybe Kakushigoto). Maybe that means I just have an unhealthy fixation on grimdark tragedies stuffed with zombies and betrayal, or maybe I just have a hard time vibing with the overly cutesy approach that comedy anime tend to approach the concept with. I also love the culinary arts, though, and I was interested to see if Deaimon clicked with me because of the educational potential.    I wasn't one hundred percent on board with the central dynamic that Nagomu and Itsuka shared at first, but they could become quite endearing given enough time. There's not much to say about Nagomu at first, a rather run-of-the-mill sort of guy that fails to inspire a whole lot of interest on his own, and Itsuka's arrival as the supposed “true” heir of the family confectionary came across as a bit contrived for my tastes. The best of these surrogate-father-meets-unlikely-daughter stories make the two characters seem like a natural fit for one another, even when they're at odds, and I just wasn't sure if this pair had that level of chemistry.    By the end of the episode, though, I was feeling more positively about the story. Itsuka is trying her gosh best to do a good job, and she deserves a pat on the head, damn it. The way that she and Nagomu are able to slowly forge their familial bond is predictable but eventually rather sweet. I could see Deaimon growing on me a lot of its protagonists continue to develop and grow at a solid pace. I don't know if this anime is going to skyrocket to the top of my watchlist, but I'll gladly check out another episode or two, just in case it ends up being a surprise success after all.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                 Plot-wise, this anime is quite simple: a man moves back into his parents' home to help out with the family business only to discover they have taken in an orphan. Needless to say, rather than being plot-driven, this anime is character-driven. And although it has only 22 minutes of runtime, Deaimon does some darn good character building.    On one hand we have Nogamu: the man with no shame. He wears his heart on his sleeve and lets criticism bounce off of him like it's nothing. What's interesting is that he did have someone whose words he took to heart: his late grandfather. The reason he left the family business in the first place, despite loving it dearly, was overhearing his grandfather say he wasn't suited for the job. And rather than confronting his grandfather, he ran away to Tokyo to become a musician instead.    Our secondary lead, Itsuka has also built her world around the words of the most important person in her life: her father. Unwilling or unable to continue his life as a single father, Itsuka's father abandoned her with Nogamu's family, telling the young girl that she was useless shortly before disappearing into the night. Thus, Itsuka is determined to be useful—to show the world that she is not only self-sufficient but can be depended on when troubles arise. Of course, despite the pain and anger in her heart, it's clear that her reason for becoming this way isn't to prove her father wrong but rather the irrational hope that should she succeed, her father will return for her. It's heartbreaking, especially when you remember she actively goes to the train station after school looking for men with guitars (the image she has of her father).    And what's interesting is that while Nogamu's mother wants him to take on a fatherly role in Itsuka's life, that's not what she needs now. What she needs is a friend who can understand what she's going through—someone who understands that the words of someone you love can shape your entire world. That is what Nogamu an Itsuka share and that will be the basis for their relationship as things continue forward. It's a solid emotional core to build a series around and I look forward to seeing how things go next week.      Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                 Alright, time for another Dad anime! It's been a little while since we last got a show about a single 30-something dude suddenly becoming a parental figure to a young girl, and since we still haven't gotten a second season of Barakamon, this cozy little muffin of a show will have to do. I use muffin because I know precisely nothing about traditional Japanese sweets. But I do know a thing or two about found family shows, and so far Deiamon's off to a decent, if unexceptional start.    Though the Dad Anime bit may be a little premature. Sure, the show itself is insistent about it – Itsuka first meets Nagomu by mistaking him for her absentee father, and Nagomu's own mother basically asks him to become the girl's surrogate parent. But Nagomu himself doesn't really have Dad energy, adoptive or otherwise. He's got the vibe of an adult older brother who went off to do his own thing after college, or sometimes he's kind of Steve from Blue's Clues where he seems as much like a child as the actual 10-year-old. This gives him a somewhat unique dynamic with Itsuka that can be pretty charming at its best, but can also feel too vague to give their interactions the bite necessary to carry a lot of this episode.    Itsuka, on the other hand, is all but certainly going to carry this show if the premiere is anything to go on. Her personal conflict of feeling she has to be “useful” in order to maintain her place at the shop – and with her loving caretakers – speaks to some serious trauma. And seeing her slowly come to accept the unconditional love of her new home and family could be heartwarming as all get-out. So if they can build a good rapport between here and Nagomu, I think there's room for a really nice show in here.    I just wish the way we got to all that was a little less clumsy. There's a scene where, unprompted, Nagomu just unloads his entire backstory for leaving the family business for a full decade, and it's all built on how he gets really upset over selling his family's beloved sweets to other people. Meanwhile the climactic conflict comes from some random person prank calling the store with a fake order, and I guess none of the adults at the store thought to get contact information or take any sort of deposit before committing to a big(?) order of sweets. It's an awkward and contrived way to have Itsuka mess up without actually messing up, so that it can be easily resolved in time for credits to roll, which makes the resolution feel artificial. In a show that is built on personal emotions and relationships, that's a bad sign.    But those could just be growing pains from having to get all of this out in a single episode, and I'd like it if the show could find its footing. It's no Barakamon, but few things are. If it can get its act together, Deiamon could be plenty sweet and filling.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                At least one star of this rating is for the scrumptious looking traditional Japanese sweets. That's important, since the show is set in a traditional confectionery, but even so each little manju and treat is a beautiful work of art that simultaneously makes you want to eat them and to carefully display them on the mantelpiece. I fully admit that I have a very, very sweet tooth, but even if I didn't the glimpses we get of the confections are just lovely.    That stands to be what this series is as a whole – just lovely, although certainly not without its angst. The confectionery, run by an older couple, is also home to two young people who are trying to work through some pretty heavy subjects in their lives. Nagomu, finally returning home after ten years, is coping with what looks an awful lot like a failed career as some sort of chestnut-themed singer while also coming to terms with the overheard conversation that sent him packing a decade ago. That almost pales in comparison to poor little Itsuka, whose father, a distant acquaintance of the shop owners, basically dumped her with them a year ago. That's put Itsuka in an unbearable position – a piece of her seems to know that the couple regards her as their grandchild and truly love her, but she also feels like she has to go above and beyond to make herself “valuable” to them, to prove that she deserves her place in their home. Presumably telling her that she would someday inherit the confectionary was intended to show her that they had no intention of throwing her out; instead it's become an additional burden on the girl, who now feels that she must be an even more determined worker to prove that she's allowed to be their grandchild.    That she'd see Nagumo as a threat since he's actually blood-related family makes a lot of sense, and not just to Itsuka. Her adoptive grandmother is well aware of how hard Itsuka is working herself and of the insecurities plaguing her, and while her request that Nagumo parent the girl (who, heartbreakingly, still looks for her missing dad at the train station frequently) is a bit much, it's also easy to see that she thinks she's helping both of them. And really, Nagumo is well-placed to help Itsuka deal with things, because he's the one she's afraid is usurping her place. It's all very poignant, and while those of us burned by the Bunny Drop manga's second half may be leery, I think this is going to be sweet in a few senses of the word.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            column          3 comments       This Week in Games - Let's Talk About Kingdom Hearts   Apr 16, 07:53 3 comments                 games    Heidi speculates on wtf is going on in the new Kingdom Hearts game and holy crap Witch on the Holy Night is getting a Western release?! ― Hi folks.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Deaimon: Recipe for Happiness   Apr  7th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Deaimon: Recipe for Happiness ?                     Community score: 4.1              What is this?   Nagomu is a man who left his home in Kyoto and his family's confectionary shop when he became a musician. Upon hearing that his father has been hospitalized though, he comes back home to take over the family business. However, while he was gone, a young girl named Itsuka started working at the shop. The whereabouts of Itsuka's parents is unknown, and she has no other relatives, and Nagomu finds himself as foster parent for Itsuka. Itsuka, on the other hand, dislikes Nagomu for abandoning the family to become a musician. She proclaims that it will be her who will take over the shop one day instead of Nagomu.    Deaimon: Recipe for Happiness is based on Rin Asano's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Wednesdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                 While perhaps Usagi Drop is the most obvious comparison, Deaimon reminded me most of Poco's Udon World, a lovely series about a man who moves back home to take over his family's udon shop and finds himself caring for a young tanuki as a father figure that no one watched. It's cozy and gentle, exploring the intersection and tensions between modern adulthood and maintaining family and cultural traditions. Nagomu always genuinely loved the wagashi he made, but his love was a bit too intense and he ended up pursuing a career as a musician instead. Now that his band has broken up, he comes home and has to renavigate his relationship with his family, with wagashi, and with this new little interloper named Itsuka.    Okay, “interloper” is a little rude and not even really representative of how Nagumo or the show's narrative regard her. After all, it's not like Itsuka chose to be there; she was abandoned by her parents, left in the hands of basically strangers, and feels obligated to work far harder than any ten-year-old should need to. The way the two play off each other is sweet. Nagumo is a huge goof, a big puppyish man full of nothing but love, enthusiasm, and a willingness to make a fool of himself, while Itsuka is far too serious and hardworking for her age, denying her own childhood due to her sense of obligation and trauma over abandonment.    I've seen this described as “dadime” (a portmanteau of ""dad"" and ""anime""), which is one of my personal weaknesses. While Nagumo is old enough to be Itsuka's father, I don't think it's quite accurate. He's more of a big brother than a dad, but either way, he's exactly what Itsuka needs. I look forward to seeing their relationship unfold.      James Beckett  Rating:                 I'm the kind of guy that's awfully susceptible to the allure of “Dad Simulators” like The Walking Dead games or The Last of Us, though I haven't had so much luck with such subject matter in anime outside of a select few titles (Hinamatsuri comes to mind, and maybe Kakushigoto). Maybe that means I just have an unhealthy fixation on grimdark tragedies stuffed with zombies and betrayal, or maybe I just have a hard time vibing with the overly cutesy approach that comedy anime tend to approach the concept with. I also love the culinary arts, though, and I was interested to see if Deaimon clicked with me because of the educational potential.    I wasn't one hundred percent on board with the central dynamic that Nagomu and Itsuka shared at first, but they could become quite endearing given enough time. There's not much to say about Nagomu at first, a rather run-of-the-mill sort of guy that fails to inspire a whole lot of interest on his own, and Itsuka's arrival as the supposed “true” heir of the family confectionary came across as a bit contrived for my tastes. The best of these surrogate-father-meets-unlikely-daughter stories make the two characters seem like a natural fit for one another, even when they're at odds, and I just wasn't sure if this pair had that level of chemistry.    By the end of the episode, though, I was feeling more positively about the story. Itsuka is trying her gosh best to do a good job, and she deserves a pat on the head, damn it. The way that she and Nagomu are able to slowly forge their familial bond is predictable but eventually rather sweet. I could see Deaimon growing on me a lot of its protagonists continue to develop and grow at a solid pace. I don't know if this anime is going to skyrocket to the top of my watchlist, but I'll gladly check out another episode or two, just in case it ends up being a surprise success after all.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                 Plot-wise, this anime is quite simple: a man moves back into his parents' home to help out with the family business only to discover they have taken in an orphan. Needless to say, rather than being plot-driven, this anime is character-driven. And although it has only 22 minutes of runtime, Deaimon does some darn good character building.    On one hand we have Nogamu: the man with no shame. He wears his heart on his sleeve and lets criticism bounce off of him like it's nothing. What's interesting is that he did have someone whose words he took to heart: his late grandfather. The reason he left the family business in the first place, despite loving it dearly, was overhearing his grandfather say he wasn't suited for the job. And rather than confronting his grandfather, he ran away to Tokyo to become a musician instead.    Our secondary lead, Itsuka has also built her world around the words of the most important person in her life: her father. Unwilling or unable to continue his life as a single father, Itsuka's father abandoned her with Nogamu's family, telling the young girl that she was useless shortly before disappearing into the night. Thus, Itsuka is determined to be useful—to show the world that she is not only self-sufficient but can be depended on when troubles arise. Of course, despite the pain and anger in her heart, it's clear that her reason for becoming this way isn't to prove her father wrong but rather the irrational hope that should she succeed, her father will return for her. It's heartbreaking, especially when you remember she actively goes to the train station after school looking for men with guitars (the image she has of her father).    And what's interesting is that while Nogamu's mother wants him to take on a fatherly role in Itsuka's life, that's not what she needs now. What she needs is a friend who can understand what she's going through—someone who understands that the words of someone you love can shape your entire world. That is what Nogamu an Itsuka share and that will be the basis for their relationship as things continue forward. It's a solid emotional core to build a series around and I look forward to seeing how things go next week.      Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                 Alright, time for another Dad anime! It's been a little while since we last got a show about a single 30-something dude suddenly becoming a parental figure to a young girl, and since we still haven't gotten a second season of Barakamon, this cozy little muffin of a show will have to do. I use muffin because I know precisely nothing about traditional Japanese sweets. But I do know a thing or two about found family shows, and so far Deiamon's off to a decent, if unexceptional start.    Though the Dad Anime bit may be a little premature. Sure, the show itself is insistent about it – Itsuka first meets Nagomu by mistaking him for her absentee father, and Nagomu's own mother basically asks him to become the girl's surrogate parent. But Nagomu himself doesn't really have Dad energy, adoptive or otherwise. He's got the vibe of an adult older brother who went off to do his own thing after college, or sometimes he's kind of Steve from Blue's Clues where he seems as much like a child as the actual 10-year-old. This gives him a somewhat unique dynamic with Itsuka that can be pretty charming at its best, but can also feel too vague to give their interactions the bite necessary to carry a lot of this episode.    Itsuka, on the other hand, is all but certainly going to carry this show if the premiere is anything to go on. Her personal conflict of feeling she has to be “useful” in order to maintain her place at the shop – and with her loving caretakers – speaks to some serious trauma. And seeing her slowly come to accept the unconditional love of her new home and family could be heartwarming as all get-out. So if they can build a good rapport between here and Nagomu, I think there's room for a really nice show in here.    I just wish the way we got to all that was a little less clumsy. There's a scene where, unprompted, Nagomu just unloads his entire backstory for leaving the family business for a full decade, and it's all built on how he gets really upset over selling his family's beloved sweets to other people. Meanwhile the climactic conflict comes from some random person prank calling the store with a fake order, and I guess none of the adults at the store thought to get contact information or take any sort of deposit before committing to a big(?) order of sweets. It's an awkward and contrived way to have Itsuka mess up without actually messing up, so that it can be easily resolved in time for credits to roll, which makes the resolution feel artificial. In a show that is built on personal emotions and relationships, that's a bad sign.    But those could just be growing pains from having to get all of this out in a single episode, and I'd like it if the show could find its footing. It's no Barakamon, but few things are. If it can get its act together, Deiamon could be plenty sweet and filling.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                At least one star of this rating is for the scrumptious looking traditional Japanese sweets. That's important, since the show is set in a traditional confectionery, but even so each little manju and treat is a beautiful work of art that simultaneously makes you want to eat them and to carefully display them on the mantelpiece. I fully admit that I have a very, very sweet tooth, but even if I didn't the glimpses we get of the confections are just lovely.    That stands to be what this series is as a whole – just lovely, although certainly not without its angst. The confectionery, run by an older couple, is also home to two young people who are trying to work through some pretty heavy subjects in their lives. Nagomu, finally returning home after ten years, is coping with what looks an awful lot like a failed career as some sort of chestnut-themed singer while also coming to terms with the overheard conversation that sent him packing a decade ago. That almost pales in comparison to poor little Itsuka, whose father, a distant acquaintance of the shop owners, basically dumped her with them a year ago. That's put Itsuka in an unbearable position – a piece of her seems to know that the couple regards her as their grandchild and truly love her, but she also feels like she has to go above and beyond to make herself “valuable” to them, to prove that she deserves her place in their home. Presumably telling her that she would someday inherit the confectionary was intended to show her that they had no intention of throwing her out; instead it's become an additional burden on the girl, who now feels that she must be an even more determined worker to prove that she's allowed to be their grandchild.    That she'd see Nagumo as a threat since he's actually blood-related family makes a lot of sense, and not just to Itsuka. Her adoptive grandmother is well aware of how hard Itsuka is working herself and of the insecurities plaguing her, and while her request that Nagumo parent the girl (who, heartbreakingly, still looks for her missing dad at the train station frequently) is a bit much, it's also easy to see that she thinks she's helping both of them. And really, Nagumo is well-placed to help Itsuka deal with things, because he's the one she's afraid is usurping her place. It's all very poignant, and while those of us burned by the Bunny Drop manga's second half may be leery, I think this is going to be sweet in a few senses of the word.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            column          3 comments       This Week in Games - Let's Talk About Kingdom Hearts   Apr 16, 07:53 3 comments                 games    Heidi speculates on wtf is going on in the new Kingdom Hearts game and holy crap Witch on the Holy Night is getting a Western release?! ― Hi folks.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Deaimon: Recipe for Happiness   Apr  7th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Deaimon: Recipe for Happiness ?                     Community score: 4.1              What is this?   Nagomu is a man who left his home in Kyoto and his family's confectionary shop when he became a musician. Upon hearing that his father has been hospitalized though, he comes back home to take over the family business. However, while he was gone, a young girl named Itsuka started working at the shop. The whereabouts of Itsuka's parents is unknown, and she has no other relatives, and Nagomu finds himself as foster parent for Itsuka. Itsuka, on the other hand, dislikes Nagomu for abandoning the family to become a musician. She proclaims that it will be her who will take over the shop one day instead of Nagomu.    Deaimon: Recipe for Happiness is based on Rin Asano's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Wednesdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                 While perhaps Usagi Drop is the most obvious comparison, Deaimon reminded me most of Poco's Udon World, a lovely series about a man who moves back home to take over his family's udon shop and finds himself caring for a young tanuki as a father figure that no one watched. It's cozy and gentle, exploring the intersection and tensions between modern adulthood and maintaining family and cultural traditions. Nagomu always genuinely loved the wagashi he made, but his love was a bit too intense and he ended up pursuing a career as a musician instead. Now that his band has broken up, he comes home and has to renavigate his relationship with his family, with wagashi, and with this new little interloper named Itsuka.    Okay, “interloper” is a little rude and not even really representative of how Nagumo or the show's narrative regard her. After all, it's not like Itsuka chose to be there; she was abandoned by her parents, left in the hands of basically strangers, and feels obligated to work far harder than any ten-year-old should need to. The way the two play off each other is sweet. Nagumo is a huge goof, a big puppyish man full of nothing but love, enthusiasm, and a willingness to make a fool of himself, while Itsuka is far too serious and hardworking for her age, denying her own childhood due to her sense of obligation and trauma over abandonment.    I've seen this described as “dadime” (a portmanteau of ""dad"" and ""anime""), which is one of my personal weaknesses. While Nagumo is old enough to be Itsuka's father, I don't think it's quite accurate. He's more of a big brother than a dad, but either way, he's exactly what Itsuka needs. I look forward to seeing their relationship unfold.      James Beckett  Rating:                 I'm the kind of guy that's awfully susceptible to the allure of “Dad Simulators” like The Walking Dead games or The Last of Us, though I haven't had so much luck with such subject matter in anime outside of a select few titles (Hinamatsuri comes to mind, and maybe Kakushigoto). Maybe that means I just have an unhealthy fixation on grimdark tragedies stuffed with zombies and betrayal, or maybe I just have a hard time vibing with the overly cutesy approach that comedy anime tend to approach the concept with. I also love the culinary arts, though, and I was interested to see if Deaimon clicked with me because of the educational potential.    I wasn't one hundred percent on board with the central dynamic that Nagomu and Itsuka shared at first, but they could become quite endearing given enough time. There's not much to say about Nagomu at first, a rather run-of-the-mill sort of guy that fails to inspire a whole lot of interest on his own, and Itsuka's arrival as the supposed “true” heir of the family confectionary came across as a bit contrived for my tastes. The best of these surrogate-father-meets-unlikely-daughter stories make the two characters seem like a natural fit for one another, even when they're at odds, and I just wasn't sure if this pair had that level of chemistry.    By the end of the episode, though, I was feeling more positively about the story. Itsuka is trying her gosh best to do a good job, and she deserves a pat on the head, damn it. The way that she and Nagomu are able to slowly forge their familial bond is predictable but eventually rather sweet. I could see Deaimon growing on me a lot of its protagonists continue to develop and grow at a solid pace. I don't know if this anime is going to skyrocket to the top of my watchlist, but I'll gladly check out another episode or two, just in case it ends up being a surprise success after all.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                 Plot-wise, this anime is quite simple: a man moves back into his parents' home to help out with the family business only to discover they have taken in an orphan. Needless to say, rather than being plot-driven, this anime is character-driven. And although it has only 22 minutes of runtime, Deaimon does some darn good character building.    On one hand we have Nogamu: the man with no shame. He wears his heart on his sleeve and lets criticism bounce off of him like it's nothing. What's interesting is that he did have someone whose words he took to heart: his late grandfather. The reason he left the family business in the first place, despite loving it dearly, was overhearing his grandfather say he wasn't suited for the job. And rather than confronting his grandfather, he ran away to Tokyo to become a musician instead.    Our secondary lead, Itsuka has also built her world around the words of the most important person in her life: her father. Unwilling or unable to continue his life as a single father, Itsuka's father abandoned her with Nogamu's family, telling the young girl that she was useless shortly before disappearing into the night. Thus, Itsuka is determined to be useful—to show the world that she is not only self-sufficient but can be depended on when troubles arise. Of course, despite the pain and anger in her heart, it's clear that her reason for becoming this way isn't to prove her father wrong but rather the irrational hope that should she succeed, her father will return for her. It's heartbreaking, especially when you remember she actively goes to the train station after school looking for men with guitars (the image she has of her father).    And what's interesting is that while Nogamu's mother wants him to take on a fatherly role in Itsuka's life, that's not what she needs now. What she needs is a friend who can understand what she's going through—someone who understands that the words of someone you love can shape your entire world. That is what Nogamu an Itsuka share and that will be the basis for their relationship as things continue forward. It's a solid emotional core to build a series around and I look forward to seeing how things go next week.      Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                 Alright, time for another Dad anime! It's been a little while since we last got a show about a single 30-something dude suddenly becoming a parental figure to a young girl, and since we still haven't gotten a second season of Barakamon, this cozy little muffin of a show will have to do. I use muffin because I know precisely nothing about traditional Japanese sweets. But I do know a thing or two about found family shows, and so far Deiamon's off to a decent, if unexceptional start.    Though the Dad Anime bit may be a little premature. Sure, the show itself is insistent about it – Itsuka first meets Nagomu by mistaking him for her absentee father, and Nagomu's own mother basically asks him to become the girl's surrogate parent. But Nagomu himself doesn't really have Dad energy, adoptive or otherwise. He's got the vibe of an adult older brother who went off to do his own thing after college, or sometimes he's kind of Steve from Blue's Clues where he seems as much like a child as the actual 10-year-old. This gives him a somewhat unique dynamic with Itsuka that can be pretty charming at its best, but can also feel too vague to give their interactions the bite necessary to carry a lot of this episode.    Itsuka, on the other hand, is all but certainly going to carry this show if the premiere is anything to go on. Her personal conflict of feeling she has to be “useful” in order to maintain her place at the shop – and with her loving caretakers – speaks to some serious trauma. And seeing her slowly come to accept the unconditional love of her new home and family could be heartwarming as all get-out. So if they can build a good rapport between here and Nagomu, I think there's room for a really nice show in here.    I just wish the way we got to all that was a little less clumsy. There's a scene where, unprompted, Nagomu just unloads his entire backstory for leaving the family business for a full decade, and it's all built on how he gets really upset over selling his family's beloved sweets to other people. Meanwhile the climactic conflict comes from some random person prank calling the store with a fake order, and I guess none of the adults at the store thought to get contact information or take any sort of deposit before committing to a big(?) order of sweets. It's an awkward and contrived way to have Itsuka mess up without actually messing up, so that it can be easily resolved in time for credits to roll, which makes the resolution feel artificial. In a show that is built on personal emotions and relationships, that's a bad sign.    But those could just be growing pains from having to get all of this out in a single episode, and I'd like it if the show could find its footing. It's no Barakamon, but few things are. If it can get its act together, Deiamon could be plenty sweet and filling.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                At least one star of this rating is for the scrumptious looking traditional Japanese sweets. That's important, since the show is set in a traditional confectionery, but even so each little manju and treat is a beautiful work of art that simultaneously makes you want to eat them and to carefully display them on the mantelpiece. I fully admit that I have a very, very sweet tooth, but even if I didn't the glimpses we get of the confections are just lovely.    That stands to be what this series is as a whole – just lovely, although certainly not without its angst. The confectionery, run by an older couple, is also home to two young people who are trying to work through some pretty heavy subjects in their lives. Nagomu, finally returning home after ten years, is coping with what looks an awful lot like a failed career as some sort of chestnut-themed singer while also coming to terms with the overheard conversation that sent him packing a decade ago. That almost pales in comparison to poor little Itsuka, whose father, a distant acquaintance of the shop owners, basically dumped her with them a year ago. That's put Itsuka in an unbearable position – a piece of her seems to know that the couple regards her as their grandchild and truly love her, but she also feels like she has to go above and beyond to make herself “valuable” to them, to prove that she deserves her place in their home. Presumably telling her that she would someday inherit the confectionary was intended to show her that they had no intention of throwing her out; instead it's become an additional burden on the girl, who now feels that she must be an even more determined worker to prove that she's allowed to be their grandchild.    That she'd see Nagumo as a threat since he's actually blood-related family makes a lot of sense, and not just to Itsuka. Her adoptive grandmother is well aware of how hard Itsuka is working herself and of the insecurities plaguing her, and while her request that Nagumo parent the girl (who, heartbreakingly, still looks for her missing dad at the train station frequently) is a bit much, it's also easy to see that she thinks she's helping both of them. And really, Nagumo is well-placed to help Itsuka deal with things, because he's the one she's afraid is usurping her place. It's all very poignant, and while those of us burned by the Bunny Drop manga's second half may be leery, I think this is going to be sweet in a few senses of the word.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            column          3 comments       This Week in Games - Let's Talk About Kingdom Hearts   Apr 16, 07:53 3 comments                 games    Heidi speculates on wtf is going on in the new Kingdom Hearts game and holy crap Witch on the Holy Night is getting a Western release?! ― Hi folks.

It's cozy and gentle, exploring the intersection and tensions between modern adulthood and maintaining family and cultural traditions. Nagomu always genuinely loved the wagashi he made, but his love was a bit too intense and he ended up pursuing a career as a musician instead. Now that his band has broken up, he comes home and has to renavigate his relationship with his family, with wagashi, and with this new little interloper named Itsuka.    Okay, “interloper” is a little rude and not even really representative of how Nagumo or the show's narrative regard her. After all, it's not like Itsuka chose to be there; she was abandoned by her parents, left in the hands of basically strangers, and feels obligated to work far harder than any ten-year-old should need to. The way the two play off each other is sweet. Nagumo is a huge goof, a big puppyish man full of nothing but love, enthusiasm, and a willingness to make a fool of himself, while Itsuka is far too serious and hardworking for her age, denying her own childhood due to her sense of obligation and trauma over abandonment.    I've seen this described as “dadime” (a portmanteau of ""dad"" and ""anime""), which is one of my personal weaknesses. While Nagumo is old enough to be Itsuka's father, I don't think it's quite accurate. He's more of a big brother than a dad, but either way, he's exactly what Itsuka needs. I look forward to seeing their relationship unfold.      James Beckett  Rating:                 I'm the kind of guy that's awfully susceptible to the allure of “Dad Simulators” like The Walking Dead games or The Last of Us, though I haven't had so much luck with such subject matter in anime outside of a select few titles (Hinamatsuri comes to mind, and maybe Kakushigoto). Maybe that means I just have an unhealthy fixation on grimdark tragedies stuffed with zombies and betrayal, or maybe I just have a hard time vibing with the overly cutesy approach that comedy anime tend to approach the concept with. I also love the culinary arts, though, and I was interested to see if Deaimon clicked with me because of the educational potential.    I wasn't one hundred percent on board with the central dynamic that Nagomu and Itsuka shared at first, but they could become quite endearing given enough time. There's not much to say about Nagomu at first, a rather run-of-the-mill sort of guy that fails to inspire a whole lot of interest on his own, and Itsuka's arrival as the supposed “true” heir of the family confectionary came across as a bit contrived for my tastes. The best of these surrogate-father-meets-unlikely-daughter stories make the two characters seem like a natural fit for one another, even when they're at odds, and I just wasn't sure if this pair had that level of chemistry.    By the end of the episode, though, I was feeling more positively about the story. Itsuka is trying her gosh best to do a good job, and she deserves a pat on the head, damn it. The way that she and Nagomu are able to slowly forge their familial bond is predictable but eventually rather sweet. I could see Deaimon growing on me a lot of its protagonists continue to develop and grow at a solid pace. I don't know if this anime is going to skyrocket to the top of my watchlist, but I'll gladly check out another episode or two, just in case it ends up being a surprise success after all.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                 Plot-wise, this anime is quite simple: a man moves back into his parents' home to help out with the family business only to discover they have taken in an orphan. Needless to say, rather than being plot-driven, this anime is character-driven. And although it has only 22 minutes of runtime, Deaimon does some darn good character building.    On one hand we have Nogamu: the man with no shame. He wears his heart on his sleeve and lets criticism bounce off of him like it's nothing. What's interesting is that he did have someone whose words he took to heart: his late grandfather. The reason he left the family business in the first place, despite loving it dearly, was overhearing his grandfather say he wasn't suited for the job. And rather than confronting his grandfather, he ran away to Tokyo to become a musician instead.    Our secondary lead, Itsuka has also built her world around the words of the most important person in her life: her father. Unwilling or unable to continue his life as a single father, Itsuka's father abandoned her with Nogamu's family, telling the young girl that she was useless shortly before disappearing into the night. Thus, Itsuka is determined to be useful—to show the world that she is not only self-sufficient but can be depended on when troubles arise. Of course, despite the pain and anger in her heart, it's clear that her reason for becoming this way isn't to prove her father wrong but rather the irrational hope that should she succeed, her father will return for her. It's heartbreaking, especially when you remember she actively goes to the train station after school looking for men with guitars (the image she has of her father).    And what's interesting is that while Nogamu's mother wants him to take on a fatherly role in Itsuka's life, that's not what she needs now. What she needs is a friend who can understand what she's going through—someone who understands that the words of someone you love can shape your entire world. That is what Nogamu an Itsuka share and that will be the basis for their relationship as things continue forward. It's a solid emotional core to build a series around and I look forward to seeing how things go next week.      Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                 Alright, time for another Dad anime! It's been a little while since we last got a show about a single 30-something dude suddenly becoming a parental figure to a young girl, and since we still haven't gotten a second season of Barakamon, this cozy little muffin of a show will have to do. I use muffin because I know precisely nothing about traditional Japanese sweets. But I do know a thing or two about found family shows, and so far Deiamon's off to a decent, if unexceptional start.    Though the Dad Anime bit may be a little premature. Sure, the show itself is insistent about it – Itsuka first meets Nagomu by mistaking him for her absentee father, and Nagomu's own mother basically asks him to become the girl's surrogate parent. But Nagomu himself doesn't really have Dad energy, adoptive or otherwise. He's got the vibe of an adult older brother who went off to do his own thing after college, or sometimes he's kind of Steve from Blue's Clues where he seems as much like a child as the actual 10-year-old. This gives him a somewhat unique dynamic with Itsuka that can be pretty charming at its best, but can also feel too vague to give their interactions the bite necessary to carry a lot of this episode.    Itsuka, on the other hand, is all but certainly going to carry this show if the premiere is anything to go on. Her personal conflict of feeling she has to be “useful” in order to maintain her place at the shop – and with her loving caretakers – speaks to some serious trauma. And seeing her slowly come to accept the unconditional love of her new home and family could be heartwarming as all get-out. So if they can build a good rapport between here and Nagomu, I think there's room for a really nice show in here.    I just wish the way we got to all that was a little less clumsy. There's a scene where, unprompted, Nagomu just unloads his entire backstory for leaving the family business for a full decade, and it's all built on how he gets really upset over selling his family's beloved sweets to other people. Meanwhile the climactic conflict comes from some random person prank calling the store with a fake order, and I guess none of the adults at the store thought to get contact information or take any sort of deposit before committing to a big(?) order of sweets. It's an awkward and contrived way to have Itsuka mess up without actually messing up, so that it can be easily resolved in time for credits to roll, which makes the resolution feel artificial. In a show that is built on personal emotions and relationships, that's a bad sign.    But those could just be growing pains from having to get all of this out in a single episode, and I'd like it if the show could find its footing. It's no Barakamon, but few things are. If it can get its act together, Deiamon could be plenty sweet and filling.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                At least one star of this rating is for the scrumptious looking traditional Japanese sweets. That's important, since the show is set in a traditional confectionery, but even so each little manju and treat is a beautiful work of art that simultaneously makes you want to eat them and to carefully display them on the mantelpiece. I fully admit that I have a very, very sweet tooth, but even if I didn't the glimpses we get of the confections are just lovely.    That stands to be what this series is as a whole – just lovely, although certainly not without its angst. The confectionery, run by an older couple, is also home to two young people who are trying to work through some pretty heavy subjects in their lives. Nagomu, finally returning home after ten years, is coping with what looks an awful lot like a failed career as some sort of chestnut-themed singer while also coming to terms with the overheard conversation that sent him packing a decade ago. That almost pales in comparison to poor little Itsuka, whose father, a distant acquaintance of the shop owners, basically dumped her with them a year ago. That's put Itsuka in an unbearable position – a piece of her seems to know that the couple regards her as their grandchild and truly love her, but she also feels like she has to go above and beyond to make herself “valuable” to them, to prove that she deserves her place in their home. Presumably telling her that she would someday inherit the confectionary was intended to show her that they had no intention of throwing her out; instead it's become an additional burden on the girl, who now feels that she must be an even more determined worker to prove that she's allowed to be their grandchild.    That she'd see Nagumo as a threat since he's actually blood-related family makes a lot of sense, and not just to Itsuka. Her adoptive grandmother is well aware of how hard Itsuka is working herself and of the insecurities plaguing her, and while her request that Nagumo parent the girl (who, heartbreakingly, still looks for her missing dad at the train station frequently) is a bit much, it's also easy to see that she thinks she's helping both of them. And really, Nagumo is well-placed to help Itsuka deal with things, because he's the one she's afraid is usurping her place. It's all very poignant, and while those of us burned by the Bunny Drop manga's second half may be leery, I think this is going to be sweet in a few senses of the word.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            column          3 comments       This Week in Games - Let's Talk About Kingdom Hearts   Apr 16, 07:53 3 comments                 games    Heidi speculates on wtf is going on in the new Kingdom Hearts game and holy crap Witch on the Holy Night is getting a Western release?! ― Hi folks.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Deaimon: Recipe for Happiness   Apr  7th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Deaimon: Recipe for Happiness ?                     Community score: 4.1              What is this?   Nagomu is a man who left his home in Kyoto and his family's confectionary shop when he became a musician. Upon hearing that his father has been hospitalized though, he comes back home to take over the family business. However, while he was gone, a young girl named Itsuka started working at the shop. The whereabouts of Itsuka's parents is unknown, and she has no other relatives, and Nagomu finds himself as foster parent for Itsuka. Itsuka, on the other hand, dislikes Nagomu for abandoning the family to become a musician. She proclaims that it will be her who will take over the shop one day instead of Nagomu.    Deaimon: Recipe for Happiness is based on Rin Asano's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Wednesdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                 While perhaps Usagi Drop is the most obvious comparison, Deaimon reminded me most of Poco's Udon World, a lovely series about a man who moves back home to take over his family's udon shop and finds himself caring for a young tanuki as a father figure that no one watched.

I've seen this described as “dadime” (a portmanteau of ""dad"" and ""anime""), which is one of my personal weaknesses. While Nagumo is old enough to be Itsuka's father, I don't think it's quite accurate. He's more of a big brother than a dad, but either way, he's exactly what Itsuka needs.

James Beckett  Rating:                 I'm the kind of guy that's awfully susceptible to the allure of “Dad Simulators” like The Walking Dead games or The Last of Us, though I haven't had so much luck with such subject matter in anime outside of a select few titles (Hinamatsuri comes to mind, and maybe Kakushigoto).

And seeing her slowly come to accept the unconditional love of her new home and family could be heartwarming as all get-out. So if they can build a good rapport between here and Nagomu, I think there's room for a really nice show in here.    I just wish the way we got to all that was a little less clumsy. There's a scene where, unprompted, Nagomu just unloads his entire backstory for leaving the family business for a full decade, and it's all built on how he gets really upset over selling his family's beloved sweets to other people. Meanwhile the climactic conflict comes from some random person prank calling the store with a fake order, and I guess none of the adults at the store thought to get contact information or take any sort of deposit before committing to a big(?) order of sweets. It's an awkward and contrived way to have Itsuka mess up without actually messing up, so that it can be easily resolved in time for credits to roll, which makes the resolution feel artificial. In a show that is built on personal emotions and relationships, that's a bad sign.    But those could just be growing pains from having to get all of this out in a single episode, and I'd like it if the show could find its footing. It's no Barakamon, but few things are. If it can get its act together, Deiamon could be plenty sweet and filling.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                At least one star of this rating is for the scrumptious looking traditional Japanese sweets. That's important, since the show is set in a traditional confectionery, but even so each little manju and treat is a beautiful work of art that simultaneously makes you want to eat them and to carefully display them on the mantelpiece. I fully admit that I have a very, very sweet tooth, but even if I didn't the glimpses we get of the confections are just lovely.    That stands to be what this series is as a whole – just lovely, although certainly not without its angst. The confectionery, run by an older couple, is also home to two young people who are trying to work through some pretty heavy subjects in their lives. Nagomu, finally returning home after ten years, is coping with what looks an awful lot like a failed career as some sort of chestnut-themed singer while also coming to terms with the overheard conversation that sent him packing a decade ago. That almost pales in comparison to poor little Itsuka, whose father, a distant acquaintance of the shop owners, basically dumped her with them a year ago. That's put Itsuka in an unbearable position – a piece of her seems to know that the couple regards her as their grandchild and truly love her, but she also feels like she has to go above and beyond to make herself “valuable” to them, to prove that she deserves her place in their home. Presumably telling her that she would someday inherit the confectionary was intended to show her that they had no intention of throwing her out; instead it's become an additional burden on the girl, who now feels that she must be an even more determined worker to prove that she's allowed to be their grandchild.    That she'd see Nagumo as a threat since he's actually blood-related family makes a lot of sense, and not just to Itsuka. Her adoptive grandmother is well aware of how hard Itsuka is working herself and of the insecurities plaguing her, and while her request that Nagumo parent the girl (who, heartbreakingly, still looks for her missing dad at the train station frequently) is a bit much, it's also easy to see that she thinks she's helping both of them. And really, Nagumo is well-placed to help Itsuka deal with things, because he's the one she's afraid is usurping her place. It's all very poignant, and while those of us burned by the Bunny Drop manga's second half may be leery, I think this is going to be sweet in a few senses of the word.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Deaimon: Recipe for Happiness   Apr  7th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Deaimon: Recipe for Happiness ?                     Community score: 4.1              What is this?   Nagomu is a man who left his home in Kyoto and his family's confectionary shop when he became a musician. Upon hearing that his father has been hospitalized though, he comes back home to take over the family business. However, while he was gone, a young girl named Itsuka started working at the shop. The whereabouts of Itsuka's parents is unknown, and she has no other relatives, and Nagomu finds himself as foster parent for Itsuka. Itsuka, on the other hand, dislikes Nagomu for abandoning the family to become a musician. She proclaims that it will be her who will take over the shop one day instead of Nagomu.    Deaimon: Recipe for Happiness is based on Rin Asano's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Wednesdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                 While perhaps Usagi Drop is the most obvious comparison, Deaimon reminded me most of Poco's Udon World, a lovely series about a man who moves back home to take over his family's udon shop and finds himself caring for a young tanuki as a father figure that no one watched. It's cozy and gentle, exploring the intersection and tensions between modern adulthood and maintaining family and cultural traditions. Nagomu always genuinely loved the wagashi he made, but his love was a bit too intense and he ended up pursuing a career as a musician instead. Now that his band has broken up, he comes home and has to renavigate his relationship with his family, with wagashi, and with this new little interloper named Itsuka.    Okay, “interloper” is a little rude and not even really representative of how Nagumo or the show's narrative regard her. After all, it's not like Itsuka chose to be there; she was abandoned by her parents, left in the hands of basically strangers, and feels obligated to work far harder than any ten-year-old should need to. The way the two play off each other is sweet. Nagumo is a huge goof, a big puppyish man full of nothing but love, enthusiasm, and a willingness to make a fool of himself, while Itsuka is far too serious and hardworking for her age, denying her own childhood due to her sense of obligation and trauma over abandonment.    I've seen this described as “dadime” (a portmanteau of ""dad"" and ""anime""), which is one of my personal weaknesses. While Nagumo is old enough to be Itsuka's father, I don't think it's quite accurate. He's more of a big brother than a dad, but either way, he's exactly what Itsuka needs. I look forward to seeing their relationship unfold.      James Beckett  Rating:                 I'm the kind of guy that's awfully susceptible to the allure of “Dad Simulators” like The Walking Dead games or The Last of Us, though I haven't had so much luck with such subject matter in anime outside of a select few titles (Hinamatsuri comes to mind, and maybe Kakushigoto). Maybe that means I just have an unhealthy fixation on grimdark tragedies stuffed with zombies and betrayal, or maybe I just have a hard time vibing with the overly cutesy approach that comedy anime tend to approach the concept with. I also love the culinary arts, though, and I was interested to see if Deaimon clicked with me because of the educational potential.    I wasn't one hundred percent on board with the central dynamic that Nagomu and Itsuka shared at first, but they could become quite endearing given enough time. There's not much to say about Nagomu at first, a rather run-of-the-mill sort of guy that fails to inspire a whole lot of interest on his own, and Itsuka's arrival as the supposed “true” heir of the family confectionary came across as a bit contrived for my tastes. The best of these surrogate-father-meets-unlikely-daughter stories make the two characters seem like a natural fit for one another, even when they're at odds, and I just wasn't sure if this pair had that level of chemistry.    By the end of the episode, though, I was feeling more positively about the story. Itsuka is trying her gosh best to do a good job, and she deserves a pat on the head, damn it. The way that she and Nagomu are able to slowly forge their familial bond is predictable but eventually rather sweet. I could see Deaimon growing on me a lot of its protagonists continue to develop and grow at a solid pace. I don't know if this anime is going to skyrocket to the top of my watchlist, but I'll gladly check out another episode or two, just in case it ends up being a surprise success after all.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                 Plot-wise, this anime is quite simple: a man moves back into his parents' home to help out with the family business only to discover they have taken in an orphan. Needless to say, rather than being plot-driven, this anime is character-driven. And although it has only 22 minutes of runtime, Deaimon does some darn good character building.    On one hand we have Nogamu: the man with no shame. He wears his heart on his sleeve and lets criticism bounce off of him like it's nothing. What's interesting is that he did have someone whose words he took to heart: his late grandfather. The reason he left the family business in the first place, despite loving it dearly, was overhearing his grandfather say he wasn't suited for the job. And rather than confronting his grandfather, he ran away to Tokyo to become a musician instead.    Our secondary lead, Itsuka has also built her world around the words of the most important person in her life: her father. Unwilling or unable to continue his life as a single father, Itsuka's father abandoned her with Nogamu's family, telling the young girl that she was useless shortly before disappearing into the night. Thus, Itsuka is determined to be useful—to show the world that she is not only self-sufficient but can be depended on when troubles arise. Of course, despite the pain and anger in her heart, it's clear that her reason for becoming this way isn't to prove her father wrong but rather the irrational hope that should she succeed, her father will return for her. It's heartbreaking, especially when you remember she actively goes to the train station after school looking for men with guitars (the image she has of her father).    And what's interesting is that while Nogamu's mother wants him to take on a fatherly role in Itsuka's life, that's not what she needs now. What she needs is a friend who can understand what she's going through—someone who understands that the words of someone you love can shape your entire world. That is what Nogamu an Itsuka share and that will be the basis for their relationship as things continue forward. It's a solid emotional core to build a series around and I look forward to seeing how things go next week.      Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                 Alright, time for another Dad anime! It's been a little while since we last got a show about a single 30-something dude suddenly becoming a parental figure to a young girl, and since we still haven't gotten a second season of Barakamon, this cozy little muffin of a show will have to do. I use muffin because I know precisely nothing about traditional Japanese sweets. But I do know a thing or two about found family shows, and so far Deiamon's off to a decent, if unexceptional start.    Though the Dad Anime bit may be a little premature. Sure, the show itself is insistent about it – Itsuka first meets Nagomu by mistaking him for her absentee father, and Nagomu's own mother basically asks him to become the girl's surrogate parent. But Nagomu himself doesn't really have Dad energy, adoptive or otherwise. He's got the vibe of an adult older brother who went off to do his own thing after college, or sometimes he's kind of Steve from Blue's Clues where he seems as much like a child as the actual 10-year-old. This gives him a somewhat unique dynamic with Itsuka that can be pretty charming at its best, but can also feel too vague to give their interactions the bite necessary to carry a lot of this episode.    Itsuka, on the other hand, is all but certainly going to carry this show if the premiere is anything to go on. Her personal conflict of feeling she has to be “useful” in order to maintain her place at the shop – and with her loving caretakers – speaks to some serious trauma.

Community score: 4.1              What is this?   Nagomu is a man who left his home in Kyoto and his family's confectionary shop when he became a musician. Upon hearing that his father has been hospitalized though, he comes back home to take over the family business. However, while he was gone, a young girl named Itsuka started working at the shop. The whereabouts of Itsuka's parents is unknown, and she has no other relatives, and Nagomu finds himself as foster parent for Itsuka. Itsuka, on the other hand, dislikes Nagomu for abandoning the family to become a musician. She proclaims that it will be her who will take over the shop one day instead of Nagomu.    Deaimon: Recipe for Happiness is based on Rin Asano's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Wednesdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                 While perhaps Usagi Drop is the most obvious comparison, Deaimon reminded me most of Poco's Udon World, a lovely series about a man who moves back home to take over his family's udon shop and finds himself caring for a young tanuki as a father figure that no one watched. It's cozy and gentle, exploring the intersection and tensions between modern adulthood and maintaining family and cultural traditions. Nagomu always genuinely loved the wagashi he made, but his love was a bit too intense and he ended up pursuing a career as a musician instead. Now that his band has broken up, he comes home and has to renavigate his relationship with his family, with wagashi, and with this new little interloper named Itsuka.    Okay, “interloper” is a little rude and not even really representative of how Nagumo or the show's narrative regard her. After all, it's not like Itsuka chose to be there; she was abandoned by her parents, left in the hands of basically strangers, and feels obligated to work far harder than any ten-year-old should need to. The way the two play off each other is sweet. Nagumo is a huge goof, a big puppyish man full of nothing but love, enthusiasm, and a willingness to make a fool of himself, while Itsuka is far too serious and hardworking for her age, denying her own childhood due to her sense of obligation and trauma over abandonment.    I've seen this described as “dadime” (a portmanteau of ""dad"" and ""anime""), which is one of my personal weaknesses. While Nagumo is old enough to be Itsuka's father, I don't think it's quite accurate. He's more of a big brother than a dad, but either way, he's exactly what Itsuka needs. I look forward to seeing their relationship unfold.      James Beckett  Rating:                 I'm the kind of guy that's awfully susceptible to the allure of “Dad Simulators” like The Walking Dead games or The Last of Us, though I haven't had so much luck with such subject matter in anime outside of a select few titles (Hinamatsuri comes to mind, and maybe Kakushigoto). Maybe that means I just have an unhealthy fixation on grimdark tragedies stuffed with zombies and betrayal, or maybe I just have a hard time vibing with the overly cutesy approach that comedy anime tend to approach the concept with. I also love the culinary arts, though, and I was interested to see if Deaimon clicked with me because of the educational potential.    I wasn't one hundred percent on board with the central dynamic that Nagomu and Itsuka shared at first, but they could become quite endearing given enough time. There's not much to say about Nagomu at first, a rather run-of-the-mill sort of guy that fails to inspire a whole lot of interest on his own, and Itsuka's arrival as the supposed “true” heir of the family confectionary came across as a bit contrived for my tastes. The best of these surrogate-father-meets-unlikely-daughter stories make the two characters seem like a natural fit for one another, even when they're at odds, and I just wasn't sure if this pair had that level of chemistry.    By the end of the episode, though, I was feeling more positively about the story. Itsuka is trying her gosh best to do a good job, and she deserves a pat on the head, damn it. The way that she and Nagomu are able to slowly forge their familial bond is predictable but eventually rather sweet. I could see Deaimon growing on me a lot of its protagonists continue to develop and grow at a solid pace. I don't know if this anime is going to skyrocket to the top of my watchlist, but I'll gladly check out another episode or two, just in case it ends up being a surprise success after all.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                 Plot-wise, this anime is quite simple: a man moves back into his parents' home to help out with the family business only to discover they have taken in an orphan. Needless to say, rather than being plot-driven, this anime is character-driven. And although it has only 22 minutes of runtime, Deaimon does some darn good character building.    On one hand we have Nogamu: the man with no shame. He wears his heart on his sleeve and lets criticism bounce off of him like it's nothing. What's interesting is that he did have someone whose words he took to heart: his late grandfather. The reason he left the family business in the first place, despite loving it dearly, was overhearing his grandfather say he wasn't suited for the job. And rather than confronting his grandfather, he ran away to Tokyo to become a musician instead.    Our secondary lead, Itsuka has also built her world around the words of the most important person in her life: her father. Unwilling or unable to continue his life as a single father, Itsuka's father abandoned her with Nogamu's family, telling the young girl that she was useless shortly before disappearing into the night. Thus, Itsuka is determined to be useful—to show the world that she is not only self-sufficient but can be depended on when troubles arise. Of course, despite the pain and anger in her heart, it's clear that her reason for becoming this way isn't to prove her father wrong but rather the irrational hope that should she succeed, her father will return for her. It's heartbreaking, especially when you remember she actively goes to the train station after school looking for men with guitars (the image she has of her father).    And what's interesting is that while Nogamu's mother wants him to take on a fatherly role in Itsuka's life, that's not what she needs now. What she needs is a friend who can understand what she's going through—someone who understands that the words of someone you love can shape your entire world. That is what Nogamu an Itsuka share and that will be the basis for their relationship as things continue forward. It's a solid emotional core to build a series around and I look forward to seeing how things go next week.      Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                 Alright, time for another Dad anime! It's been a little while since we last got a show about a single 30-something dude suddenly becoming a parental figure to a young girl, and since we still haven't gotten a second season of Barakamon, this cozy little muffin of a show will have to do. I use muffin because I know precisely nothing about traditional Japanese sweets. But I do know a thing or two about found family shows, and so far Deiamon's off to a decent, if unexceptional start.    Though the Dad Anime bit may be a little premature. Sure, the show itself is insistent about it – Itsuka first meets Nagomu by mistaking him for her absentee father, and Nagomu's own mother basically asks him to become the girl's surrogate parent. But Nagomu himself doesn't really have Dad energy, adoptive or otherwise. He's got the vibe of an adult older brother who went off to do his own thing after college, or sometimes he's kind of Steve from Blue's Clues where he seems as much like a child as the actual 10-year-old. This gives him a somewhat unique dynamic with Itsuka that can be pretty charming at its best, but can also feel too vague to give their interactions the bite necessary to carry a lot of this episode.    Itsuka, on the other hand, is all but certainly going to carry this show if the premiere is anything to go on. Her personal conflict of feeling she has to be “useful” in order to maintain her place at the shop – and with her loving caretakers – speaks to some serious trauma. And seeing her slowly come to accept the unconditional love of her new home and family could be heartwarming as all get-out. So if they can build a good rapport between here and Nagomu, I think there's room for a really nice show in here.    I just wish the way we got to all that was a little less clumsy. There's a scene where, unprompted, Nagomu just unloads his entire backstory for leaving the family business for a full decade, and it's all built on how he gets really upset over selling his family's beloved sweets to other people. Meanwhile the climactic conflict comes from some random person prank calling the store with a fake order, and I guess none of the adults at the store thought to get contact information or take any sort of deposit before committing to a big(?) order of sweets. It's an awkward and contrived way to have Itsuka mess up without actually messing up, so that it can be easily resolved in time for credits to roll, which makes the resolution feel artificial. In a show that is built on personal emotions and relationships, that's a bad sign.    But those could just be growing pains from having to get all of this out in a single episode, and I'd like it if the show could find its footing. It's no Barakamon, but few things are. If it can get its act together, Deiamon could be plenty sweet and filling.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                At least one star of this rating is for the scrumptious looking traditional Japanese sweets. That's important, since the show is set in a traditional confectionery, but even so each little manju and treat is a beautiful work of art that simultaneously makes you want to eat them and to carefully display them on the mantelpiece. I fully admit that I have a very, very sweet tooth, but even if I didn't the glimpses we get of the confections are just lovely.    That stands to be what this series is as a whole – just lovely, although certainly not without its angst. The confectionery, run by an older couple, is also home to two young people who are trying to work through some pretty heavy subjects in their lives. Nagomu, finally returning home after ten years, is coping with what looks an awful lot like a failed career as some sort of chestnut-themed singer while also coming to terms with the overheard conversation that sent him packing a decade ago. That almost pales in comparison to poor little Itsuka, whose father, a distant acquaintance of the shop owners, basically dumped her with them a year ago. That's put Itsuka in an unbearable position – a piece of her seems to know that the couple regards her as their grandchild and truly love her, but she also feels like she has to go above and beyond to make herself “valuable” to them, to prove that she deserves her place in their home. Presumably telling her that she would someday inherit the confectionary was intended to show her that they had no intention of throwing her out; instead it's become an additional burden on the girl, who now feels that she must be an even more determined worker to prove that she's allowed to be their grandchild.    That she'd see Nagumo as a threat since he's actually blood-related family makes a lot of sense, and not just to Itsuka. Her adoptive grandmother is well aware of how hard Itsuka is working herself and of the insecurities plaguing her, and while her request that Nagumo parent the girl (who, heartbreakingly, still looks for her missing dad at the train station frequently) is a bit much, it's also easy to see that she thinks she's helping both of them. And really, Nagumo is well-placed to help Itsuka deal with things, because he's the one she's afraid is usurping her place. It's all very poignant, and while those of us burned by the Bunny Drop manga's second half may be leery, I think this is going to be sweet in a few senses of the word.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives     ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

On one hand we have Nogamu: the man with no shame. He wears his heart on his sleeve and lets criticism bounce off of him like it's nothing. What's interesting is that he did have someone whose words he took to heart: his late grandfather. The reason he left the family business in the first place, despite loving it dearly, was overhearing his grandfather say he wasn't suited for the job. And rather than confronting his grandfather, he ran away to Tokyo to become a musician instead.    Our secondary lead, Itsuka has also built her world around the words of the most important person in her life: her father. Unwilling or unable to continue his life as a single father, Itsuka's father abandoned her with Nogamu's family, telling the young girl that she was useless shortly before disappearing into the night. Thus, Itsuka is determined to be useful—to show the world that she is not only self-sufficient but can be depended on when troubles arise. Of course, despite the pain and anger in her heart, it's clear that her reason for becoming this way isn't to prove her father wrong but rather the irrational hope that should she succeed, her father will return for her. It's heartbreaking, especially when you remember she actively goes to the train station after school looking for men with guitars (the image she has of her father).    And what's interesting is that while Nogamu's mother wants him to take on a fatherly role in Itsuka's life, that's not what she needs now. What she needs is a friend who can understand what she's going through—someone who understands that the words of someone you love can shape your entire world. That is what Nogamu an Itsuka share and that will be the basis for their relationship as things continue forward. It's a solid emotional core to build a series around and I look forward to seeing how things go next week.      Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                 Alright, time for another Dad anime! It's been a little while since we last got a show about a single 30-something dude suddenly becoming a parental figure to a young girl, and since we still haven't gotten a second season of Barakamon, this cozy little muffin of a show will have to do. I use muffin because I know precisely nothing about traditional Japanese sweets. But I do know a thing or two about found family shows, and so far Deiamon's off to a decent, if unexceptional start.    Though the Dad Anime bit may be a little premature. Sure, the show itself is insistent about it – Itsuka first meets Nagomu by mistaking him for her absentee father, and Nagomu's own mother basically asks him to become the girl's surrogate parent. But Nagomu himself doesn't really have Dad energy, adoptive or otherwise. He's got the vibe of an adult older brother who went off to do his own thing after college, or sometimes he's kind of Steve from Blue's Clues where he seems as much like a child as the actual 10-year-old. This gives him a somewhat unique dynamic with Itsuka that can be pretty charming at its best, but can also feel too vague to give their interactions the bite necessary to carry a lot of this episode.    Itsuka, on the other hand, is all but certainly going to carry this show if the premiere is anything to go on. Her personal conflict of feeling she has to be “useful” in order to maintain her place at the shop – and with her loving caretakers – speaks to some serious trauma. And seeing her slowly come to accept the unconditional love of her new home and family could be heartwarming as all get-out. So if they can build a good rapport between here and Nagomu, I think there's room for a really nice show in here.    I just wish the way we got to all that was a little less clumsy. There's a scene where, unprompted, Nagomu just unloads his entire backstory for leaving the family business for a full decade, and it's all built on how he gets really upset over selling his family's beloved sweets to other people. Meanwhile the climactic conflict comes from some random person prank calling the store with a fake order, and I guess none of the adults at the store thought to get contact information or take any sort of deposit before committing to a big(?) order of sweets. It's an awkward and contrived way to have Itsuka mess up without actually messing up, so that it can be easily resolved in time for credits to roll, which makes the resolution feel artificial. In a show that is built on personal emotions and relationships, that's a bad sign.    But those could just be growing pains from having to get all of this out in a single episode, and I'd like it if the show could find its footing. It's no Barakamon, but few things are. If it can get its act together, Deiamon could be plenty sweet and filling.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                At least one star of this rating is for the scrumptious looking traditional Japanese sweets. That's important, since the show is set in a traditional confectionery, but even so each little manju and treat is a beautiful work of art that simultaneously makes you want to eat them and to carefully display them on the mantelpiece. I fully admit that I have a very, very sweet tooth, but even if I didn't the glimpses we get of the confections are just lovely.    That stands to be what this series is as a whole – just lovely, although certainly not without its angst. The confectionery, run by an older couple, is also home to two young people who are trying to work through some pretty heavy subjects in their lives. Nagomu, finally returning home after ten years, is coping with what looks an awful lot like a failed career as some sort of chestnut-themed singer while also coming to terms with the overheard conversation that sent him packing a decade ago. That almost pales in comparison to poor little Itsuka, whose father, a distant acquaintance of the shop owners, basically dumped her with them a year ago. That's put Itsuka in an unbearable position – a piece of her seems to know that the couple regards her as their grandchild and truly love her, but she also feels like she has to go above and beyond to make herself “valuable” to them, to prove that she deserves her place in their home. Presumably telling her that she would someday inherit the confectionary was intended to show her that they had no intention of throwing her out; instead it's become an additional burden on the girl, who now feels that she must be an even more determined worker to prove that she's allowed to be their grandchild.    That she'd see Nagumo as a threat since he's actually blood-related family makes a lot of sense, and not just to Itsuka. Her adoptive grandmother is well aware of how hard Itsuka is working herself and of the insecurities plaguing her, and while her request that Nagumo parent the girl (who, heartbreakingly, still looks for her missing dad at the train station frequently) is a bit much, it's also easy to see that she thinks she's helping both of them. And really, Nagumo is well-placed to help Itsuka deal with things, because he's the one she's afraid is usurping her place. It's all very poignant, and while those of us burned by the Bunny Drop manga's second half may be leery, I think this is going to be sweet in a few senses of the word.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives   ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 4.1              What is this?   Nagomu is a man who left his home in Kyoto and his family's confectionary shop when he became a musician. Upon hearing that his father has been hospitalized though, he comes back home to take over the family business. However, while he was gone, a young girl named Itsuka started working at the shop. The whereabouts of Itsuka's parents is unknown, and she has no other relatives, and Nagomu finds himself as foster parent for Itsuka. Itsuka, on the other hand, dislikes Nagomu for abandoning the family to become a musician. She proclaims that it will be her who will take over the shop one day instead of Nagomu.    Deaimon: Recipe for Happiness is based on Rin Asano's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Wednesdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                 While perhaps Usagi Drop is the most obvious comparison, Deaimon reminded me most of Poco's Udon World, a lovely series about a man who moves back home to take over his family's udon shop and finds himself caring for a young tanuki as a father figure that no one watched. It's cozy and gentle, exploring the intersection and tensions between modern adulthood and maintaining family and cultural traditions. Nagomu always genuinely loved the wagashi he made, but his love was a bit too intense and he ended up pursuing a career as a musician instead. Now that his band has broken up, he comes home and has to renavigate his relationship with his family, with wagashi, and with this new little interloper named Itsuka.    Okay, “interloper” is a little rude and not even really representative of how Nagumo or the show's narrative regard her. After all, it's not like Itsuka chose to be there; she was abandoned by her parents, left in the hands of basically strangers, and feels obligated to work far harder than any ten-year-old should need to. The way the two play off each other is sweet. Nagumo is a huge goof, a big puppyish man full of nothing but love, enthusiasm, and a willingness to make a fool of himself, while Itsuka is far too serious and hardworking for her age, denying her own childhood due to her sense of obligation and trauma over abandonment.    I've seen this described as “dadime” (a portmanteau of ""dad"" and ""anime""), which is one of my personal weaknesses. While Nagumo is old enough to be Itsuka's father, I don't think it's quite accurate. He's more of a big brother than a dad, but either way, he's exactly what Itsuka needs. I look forward to seeing their relationship unfold.      James Beckett  Rating:                 I'm the kind of guy that's awfully susceptible to the allure of “Dad Simulators” like The Walking Dead games or The Last of Us, though I haven't had so much luck with such subject matter in anime outside of a select few titles (Hinamatsuri comes to mind, and maybe Kakushigoto). Maybe that means I just have an unhealthy fixation on grimdark tragedies stuffed with zombies and betrayal, or maybe I just have a hard time vibing with the overly cutesy approach that comedy anime tend to approach the concept with. I also love the culinary arts, though, and I was interested to see if Deaimon clicked with me because of the educational potential.    I wasn't one hundred percent on board with the central dynamic that Nagomu and Itsuka shared at first, but they could become quite endearing given enough time. There's not much to say about Nagomu at first, a rather run-of-the-mill sort of guy that fails to inspire a whole lot of interest on his own, and Itsuka's arrival as the supposed “true” heir of the family confectionary came across as a bit contrived for my tastes. The best of these surrogate-father-meets-unlikely-daughter stories make the two characters seem like a natural fit for one another, even when they're at odds, and I just wasn't sure if this pair had that level of chemistry.    By the end of the episode, though, I was feeling more positively about the story. Itsuka is trying her gosh best to do a good job, and she deserves a pat on the head, damn it. The way that she and Nagomu are able to slowly forge their familial bond is predictable but eventually rather sweet. I could see Deaimon growing on me a lot of its protagonists continue to develop and grow at a solid pace. I don't know if this anime is going to skyrocket to the top of my watchlist, but I'll gladly check out another episode or two, just in case it ends up being a surprise success after all.

Her adoptive grandmother is well aware of how hard Itsuka is working herself and of the insecurities plaguing her, and while her request that Nagumo parent the girl (who, heartbreakingly, still looks for her missing dad at the train station frequently) is a bit much, it's also easy to see that she thinks she's helping both of them. And really, Nagumo is well-placed to help Itsuka deal with things, because he's the one she's afraid is usurping her place. It's all very poignant, and while those of us burned by the Bunny Drop manga's second half may be leery, I think this is going to be sweet in a few senses of the word.

News Kapamilya Channel Airs Live-Action Your Lie in April Film in Philippines on Saturday   posted on 2022-04-13 17:30 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda         Film debuts on Saturday at 11:00 p.m.    Philippine television channel Kapamilya Channel revealed in an ad on Wednesday that it will air the live-action film adaptation of Naoshi Arakawa's Your Lie in April (Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso) manga in the Philippines this Saturday at 11:00 p.m.    The film opened in Japan in September 2016 and earned 245 million yen (about US$2.40 million) by selling 200,000 tickets to rank #3 in its opening weekend. Pioneer Films opened the film in the Philippines in December 2016. ABS-CBN's now-defunct Asianovela Channel previously aired the film in September 2018.    Kento Yamazaki (Orange live-action film's Kakeru, Death Note live-action series' L) played main character Kōsei Arima, while Suzu Hirose (Chihayafuru: Shimo no Ku's Chihaya, Umimachi Diary live-action film's Suzu) played heroine Kaori Miyazono. E-girls all-female pop group member Anna Ishii played Kōsei's childhood friend Tsubaki Sawabe, and Taishi Nakagawa (Ao Oni ver.2.0's Hiroshi, Minami-kun no Koibito ~My Little Lover live-action series' Minami) played Ryōta Watari. Other cast members included Rei Dan as Kōsei's mother Saki Arima, and Yuka Itaya as Hiroko Seto, Saki's colleague and Kōsei's guardian.    Boku no Hatsukoi wo Kimi ni Sasagu and Kiyoku Yawaku live-action romance film director Takehiko Shinjō directed off scripts by Strawberry Night live-action series scriptwriter Yukari Tatsui. Ryo Yoshimata composed the film's music. Ikimono-gakari performed the film's theme song ""Last Scene.""    Arakawa's original manga follows Kōsei Arima, a former child prodigy who lost his ability to play the piano when his mother died. His daily life is monochrome, but it begins to gain color when he meets a female violinist by chance. Kaori Miyazono is an audacious go-getter who is overflowing with personality. Enchanted by the girl, Kōsei begins to rediscover his love for piano when Kaori invites him to be her accompanist for a competition.    The manga debuted in Kodansha's Monthly Shonen Magazine in 2011, and ended in February 2015. Kodansha published the 11th and final compiled volume in Japan in May 2015, which shipped with an OVA episode. The series won the Best Shōnen Manga category in Kodansha's 37th Annual Manga Awards in 2013. A television anime series adaptation of Arakawa's manga premiered in 2014. HERO TV aired the anime from April to May 2016.

News Kapamilya Channel Airs Live-Action Your Lie in April Film in Philippines on Saturday   posted on 2022-04-13 17:30 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda         Film debuts on Saturday at 11:00 p.m.    Philippine television channel Kapamilya Channel revealed in an ad on Wednesday that it will air the live-action film adaptation of Naoshi Arakawa's Your Lie in April (Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso) manga in the Philippines this Saturday at 11:00 p.m.    The film opened in Japan in September 2016 and earned 245 million yen (about US$2.40 million) by selling 200,000 tickets to rank #3 in its opening weekend. Pioneer Films opened the film in the Philippines in December 2016. ABS-CBN's now-defunct Asianovela Channel previously aired the film in September 2018.    Kento Yamazaki (Orange live-action film's Kakeru, Death Note live-action series' L) played main character Kōsei Arima, while Suzu Hirose (Chihayafuru: Shimo no Ku's Chihaya, Umimachi Diary live-action film's Suzu) played heroine Kaori Miyazono. E-girls all-female pop group member Anna Ishii played Kōsei's childhood friend Tsubaki Sawabe, and Taishi Nakagawa (Ao Oni ver.2.0's Hiroshi, Minami-kun no Koibito ~My Little Lover live-action series' Minami) played Ryōta Watari. Other cast members included Rei Dan as Kōsei's mother Saki Arima, and Yuka Itaya as Hiroko Seto, Saki's colleague and Kōsei's guardian.    Boku no Hatsukoi wo Kimi ni Sasagu and Kiyoku Yawaku live-action romance film director Takehiko Shinjō directed off scripts by Strawberry Night live-action series scriptwriter Yukari Tatsui. Ryo Yoshimata composed the film's music. Ikimono-gakari performed the film's theme song ""Last Scene.""    Arakawa's original manga follows Kōsei Arima, a former child prodigy who lost his ability to play the piano when his mother died. His daily life is monochrome, but it begins to gain color when he meets a female violinist by chance. Kaori Miyazono is an audacious go-getter who is overflowing with personality. Enchanted by the girl, Kōsei begins to rediscover his love for piano when Kaori invites him to be her accompanist for a competition.    The manga debuted in Kodansha's Monthly Shonen Magazine in 2011, and ended in February 2015. Kodansha published the 11th and final compiled volume in Japan in May 2015, which shipped with an OVA episode. The series won the Best Shōnen Manga category in Kodansha's 37th Annual Manga Awards in 2013. A television anime series adaptation of Arakawa's manga premiered in 2014. HERO TV aired the anime from April to May 2016.

News Kapamilya Channel Airs Live-Action Your Lie in April Film in Philippines on Saturday   posted on 2022-04-13 17:30 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda         Film debuts on Saturday at 11:00 p.m.    Philippine television channel Kapamilya Channel revealed in an ad on Wednesday that it will air the live-action film adaptation of Naoshi Arakawa's Your Lie in April (Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso) manga in the Philippines this Saturday at 11:00 p.m.    The film opened in Japan in September 2016 and earned 245 million yen (about US$2.40 million) by selling 200,000 tickets to rank #3 in its opening weekend. Pioneer Films opened the film in the Philippines in December 2016. ABS-CBN's now-defunct Asianovela Channel previously aired the film in September 2018.    Kento Yamazaki (Orange live-action film's Kakeru, Death Note live-action series' L) played main character Kōsei Arima, while Suzu Hirose (Chihayafuru: Shimo no Ku's Chihaya, Umimachi Diary live-action film's Suzu) played heroine Kaori Miyazono. E-girls all-female pop group member Anna Ishii played Kōsei's childhood friend Tsubaki Sawabe, and Taishi Nakagawa (Ao Oni ver.2.0's Hiroshi, Minami-kun no Koibito ~My Little Lover live-action series' Minami) played Ryōta Watari. Other cast members included Rei Dan as Kōsei's mother Saki Arima, and Yuka Itaya as Hiroko Seto, Saki's colleague and Kōsei's guardian.    Boku no Hatsukoi wo Kimi ni Sasagu and Kiyoku Yawaku live-action romance film director Takehiko Shinjō directed off scripts by Strawberry Night live-action series scriptwriter Yukari Tatsui. Ryo Yoshimata composed the film's music. Ikimono-gakari performed the film's theme song ""Last Scene.""    Arakawa's original manga follows Kōsei Arima, a former child prodigy who lost his ability to play the piano when his mother died. His daily life is monochrome, but it begins to gain color when he meets a female violinist by chance. Kaori Miyazono is an audacious go-getter who is overflowing with personality. Enchanted by the girl, Kōsei begins to rediscover his love for piano when Kaori invites him to be her accompanist for a competition.    The manga debuted in Kodansha's Monthly Shonen Magazine in 2011, and ended in February 2015. Kodansha published the 11th and final compiled volume in Japan in May 2015, which shipped with an OVA episode. The series won the Best Shōnen Manga category in Kodansha's 37th Annual Manga Awards in 2013. A television anime series adaptation of Arakawa's manga premiered in 2014. HERO TV aired the anime from April to May 2016.

Pioneer Films opened the film in the Philippines in December 2016. ABS-CBN's now-defunct Asianovela Channel previously aired the film in September 2018.    Kento Yamazaki (Orange live-action film's Kakeru, Death Note live-action series' L) played main character Kōsei Arima, while Suzu Hirose (Chihayafuru: Shimo no Ku's Chihaya, Umimachi Diary live-action film's Suzu) played heroine Kaori Miyazono.

Enchanted by the girl, Kōsei begins to rediscover his love for piano when Kaori invites him to be her accompanist for a competition.    The manga debuted in Kodansha's Monthly Shonen Magazine in 2011, and ended in February 2015. Kodansha published the 11th and final compiled volume in Japan in May 2015, which shipped with an OVA episode.

News Tsurune Anime Film Posts 2nd Teaser, Key Visual   posted on 2022-04-15 12:07 UTC-8 by Egan Loo         MoviTicke Cards offered with 'flower visual portraits'    Kyoto Animation posted the second teaser trailer and key visual for the Gekijōban Tsurune: Hajimari no Issha (Tsurune The Movie: The First Arrow) film on Friday. Cast members Yūto Uemura (Minato Narumiya) and Shintarō Asanuma (Masaki Takigawa) narrate the teaser.       Participating theaters and the retail site Major will begin offering the second batch of advance tickets — MoviTicke Cards, each in a bundle with one of five randomly distributed ""flower visual portrait"" illustrated by characer designer  Miku Kadowaki:       Takuya Yamamura is returning to direct the film at Kyoto Animation. Yamamura is also writing the script, with supervision by the television anime's scriptwriter Michiko Yokote. Miku Kadowaki is returning as character designer. Masaru Yokoyama (new Fruits Basket anime, Your Lie in April) is replacing Harumi Fuuki as the composer.    The other staff members include:    Chief Animation Director: Nobuaki Maruki  Art Director: Shōko Ochiai  3D Art: Mutsuo Shinohara  Color Key Artist: Azumi Hata  3D Director: Rin Yamamoto  Prop Setting: Hiroshi Karata  Director of Photography: Kōhei Funamoto  Sound Director: Yota Tsuruoka    The film will open in Japan on August 19.    The television anime premiered in Japan on the NHK-General channel in October 2018. Sentai Filmworks licensed the anime and streamed the series on Crunchyroll and HIDIVE (with an English dub) as it aired in Japan. Sentai Filmworks released the anime on home video in January 2020. The release included an original video anime, an unaired 14th episode.    Pony Canyon USA describes the show's story:   The story opens with Minato Narumiya beginning his freshman year at the local Kazemai High School.  Mr. Tommy, advisor to the Japanese archery Club, is keen to recruit Minato, as well as his childhood friends Seiya Takehaya and Ryohei Yamanouchi. Ryohei convinces the reluctant Minato to attend the Club's orientation, where he also meets Kaito Onogi and Nanao Kisaragi. Singling Minato out, Mr. Tommy introduces him as a rare Japanese archery talent and asks him to demonstrate in front of everyone. However, Minato's arrow fails to hit the mark because he is afflicted by a serious condition… Minato, Seiya, Ryohei, Nanao and Kaito. Japanese archery brings them together. What will they attain as they struggle through their beautiful, yet “bitter” youth?   The anime is based on Kotoko Ayano's novel of the same name.

News Tsurune Anime Film Posts 2nd Teaser, Key Visual   posted on 2022-04-15 12:07 UTC-8 by Egan Loo         MoviTicke Cards offered with 'flower visual portraits'    Kyoto Animation posted the second teaser trailer and key visual for the Gekijōban Tsurune: Hajimari no Issha (Tsurune The Movie: The First Arrow) film on Friday. Cast members Yūto Uemura (Minato Narumiya) and Shintarō Asanuma (Masaki Takigawa) narrate the teaser.       Participating theaters and the retail site Major will begin offering the second batch of advance tickets — MoviTicke Cards, each in a bundle with one of five randomly distributed ""flower visual portrait"" illustrated by characer designer  Miku Kadowaki:       Takuya Yamamura is returning to direct the film at Kyoto Animation. Yamamura is also writing the script, with supervision by the television anime's scriptwriter Michiko Yokote. Miku Kadowaki is returning as character designer. Masaru Yokoyama (new Fruits Basket anime, Your Lie in April) is replacing Harumi Fuuki as the composer.    The other staff members include:    Chief Animation Director: Nobuaki Maruki  Art Director: Shōko Ochiai  3D Art: Mutsuo Shinohara  Color Key Artist: Azumi Hata  3D Director: Rin Yamamoto  Prop Setting: Hiroshi Karata  Director of Photography: Kōhei Funamoto  Sound Director: Yota Tsuruoka    The film will open in Japan on August 19.    The television anime premiered in Japan on the NHK-General channel in October 2018. Sentai Filmworks licensed the anime and streamed the series on Crunchyroll and HIDIVE (with an English dub) as it aired in Japan. Sentai Filmworks released the anime on home video in January 2020. The release included an original video anime, an unaired 14th episode.    Pony Canyon USA describes the show's story:   The story opens with Minato Narumiya beginning his freshman year at the local Kazemai High School.  Mr. Tommy, advisor to the Japanese archery Club, is keen to recruit Minato, as well as his childhood friends Seiya Takehaya and Ryohei Yamanouchi. Ryohei convinces the reluctant Minato to attend the Club's orientation, where he also meets Kaito Onogi and Nanao Kisaragi. Singling Minato out, Mr. Tommy introduces him as a rare Japanese archery talent and asks him to demonstrate in front of everyone. However, Minato's arrow fails to hit the mark because he is afflicted by a serious condition… Minato, Seiya, Ryohei, Nanao and Kaito. Japanese archery brings them together. What will they attain as they struggle through their beautiful, yet “bitter” youth?   The anime is based on Kotoko Ayano's novel of the same name.

Participating theaters and the retail site Major will begin offering the second batch of advance tickets — MoviTicke Cards, each in a bundle with one of five randomly distributed ""flower visual portrait"" illustrated by characer designer  Miku Kadowaki:       Takuya Yamamura is returning to direct the film at Kyoto Animation. Yamamura is also writing the script, with supervision by the television anime's scriptwriter Michiko Yokote. Miku Kadowaki is returning as character designer. Masaru Yokoyama (new Fruits Basket anime, Your Lie in April) is replacing Harumi Fuuki as the composer.    The other staff members include:    Chief Animation Director: Nobuaki Maruki  Art Director: Shōko Ochiai  3D Art: Mutsuo Shinohara  Color Key Artist: Azumi Hata  3D Director: Rin Yamamoto  Prop Setting: Hiroshi Karata  Director of Photography: Kōhei Funamoto  Sound Director: Yota Tsuruoka    The film will open in Japan on August 19.    The television anime premiered in Japan on the NHK-General channel in October 2018. Sentai Filmworks licensed the anime and streamed the series on Crunchyroll and HIDIVE (with an English dub) as it aired in Japan. Sentai Filmworks released the anime on home video in January 2020. The release included an original video anime, an unaired 14th episode.    Pony Canyon USA describes the show's story:   The story opens with Minato Narumiya beginning his freshman year at the local Kazemai High School.  Mr. Tommy, advisor to the Japanese archery Club, is keen to recruit Minato, as well as his childhood friends Seiya Takehaya and Ryohei Yamanouchi. Ryohei convinces the reluctant Minato to attend the Club's orientation, where he also meets Kaito Onogi and Nanao Kisaragi. Singling Minato out, Mr. Tommy introduces him as a rare Japanese archery talent and asks him to demonstrate in front of everyone. However, Minato's arrow fails to hit the mark because he is afflicted by a serious condition… Minato, Seiya, Ryohei, Nanao and Kaito. Japanese archery brings them together. What will they attain as they struggle through their beautiful, yet “bitter” youth?   The anime is based on Kotoko Ayano's novel of the same name.

Review:         Description:        A young man named Serge finds his calm village life destroyed when he's warped to an alternate reality: one where he isn't even alive anymore. Soon Serge and a thief named Kid are gathering an unlikely assortment of allies as they hop between dimensions and take on the mysterious figures and ominous forces threatening both worlds.     Review:            The best way to approach Chrono Cross is to forget that it's a sequel to Chrono Trigger. It is, of course, but Chrono Trigger—an inventive, marvelously crafted time-travel romp that's tied with Earthbound as the most beloved RPG in history—is a hard act to follow. Saddled with that sort of legacy, Chrono Cross earned a divisive reception after its release over two decades ago. Square Enix's new Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition remasters the game and bundles it with its direct inspiration, the previously Japan-only 1996 graphic adventure Radical Dreamers. Beneath these new additions, however, the ups and downs of Chrono Cross refuse to change.    Chrono Cross is nothing if not ambitious. Contrasting the time-travel storyline of Chrono Trigger, it presents a tale of alternate dimensions. Our hero is Serge, a seemingly normal kid in a gentle seaside village. As he ponders the future with his equally normal almost-girlfriend Leena on a beach one day, a sudden vortex warps Serge to a different dimension. It's much like his own at a glance, but his fellow villagers take different paths in life, and this new world's version of Leena informs him that the Serge she knew actually drowned when he was a boy. Upon visiting his own grave, Serge meets up with Kid, a spitfire thief with a hybrid British-Australian accent and a grudge against a mysterious figure named Lynx. And so the two of them start a quest that involves travelling between dimensions and trying to resist the pull of fate itself.     There's equal ambition in the cast of Chrono Cross. Rather than building a core cast of under ten characters, players can recruit a total of 45 party members over the initial quest and through replays in New Game+ mode. You'll find conventional RPG characters like the conflicted knight Glenn, the cocksure mage Guile, and Riddel, the gloomy daughter of a military leader, but Chrono Cross doesn't stop there. Also available are a living straw doll, a talking dog, a sentient turnip, a flower creature, a blacksmith, a scientist, a cyborg, a bartender, a struggling artist, a foppish swordsman, a glam rocker, a dancer, a baby dragon, a fairy, a cavegirl, an alien, a mermaid, an elderly gnomish mage, a rowdy seafaring kid and his family, and a skeleton clown who must be gathered and assembled one piece at a time.    All of these characters find their way into the creative battle system of Chrono Cross. Attacks are handled in three tiers, each showing a percentage to gauge the likelihood of a hit landing, and using each move drains a turn gauge while building up a character's ability to use their spells, items, and unique abilities. All of these are assigned to slots, and you're limited in how often your party can employ them in battle. It allows for a lot of customization, and Chrono Cross adds a color-coded element system to both enemies and the playfield. Each fight becomes a balancing act of attacking judiciously, conserving items, and using spells just when the elements favor them.     Chrono Cross also makes combat less intrusive than other RPGs of its era. Enemies are visible on the main screen instead of emerging at random, and a lot of them can be avoided. A similar innovation lets you skip areas on the world map if you've cleared them already, making a smoother experience overall. Still, it's not without some drawbacks. The few exclusive moves that characters possess are disappointing when compared with Chrono Trigger's signature abilities and team-up attacks—which Chrono Cross offers only in a few rare and obscure cases. Having to pick attacks from a menu is also less satisfying than, say, the cruder but invigorating button-mashing of Xenogears (made by much of the same team), and all those percentages clash with the wonderfully organic atmosphere of the game.    And that atmosphere goes a long way in smoothing over the flaws in Chrono Cross. Squaresoft's programmers knew the PlayStation in and out by the end of the 1990s, and Chrono Cross is their most visually impressive work. Everything in the game feels remarkably alive, from the tropical fronds and ocean vistas of Serge's home to the depths of an eerily preserved high-tech base. The use of color and light is remarkable, and the designers' choice of lush islands and colorful cities is still a charming alternative to the more medieval fantasy settings preferred by other games.    It all glides along thanks to a marvelous soundtrack. Composer Yasunori Mitsuda wrung an astonishing variety of sounds from the PlayStation's processors, and his tracks are rarely at a loss for catchy hooks or haunting melodies. The first few hours of the game set a perfect stage of melancholy tones and bright atmosphere, casting players adrift in a strange world while ruminating on how lives can change irrevocably with just one decision.    The music helps Chrono Cross pull off scenes of striking beauty: a sudden trip to a world rendered in children's scrawls and simple tones, a sunset confrontation with a face from Serge's past, and even the first time you take to the sea with a rousing theme perfectly evoking a new sense of exploration.     Yet for all of its spectacular environments, entrancing music, varied paths, and multiple endings, Chrono Cross can't pull it all together. The character lineup is wide and varied, but the majority of them have brief and unsatisfying plot arcs or no plot arcs at all. Serge himself is mostly a blank slate, and Kid, likeable little punk that she is, can only perk things up so much. And for every cool new party member, you'll encounter two who are merely annoying and disposable.    This is exacerbated by the localizers' decision to give party members cartoonish speech patterns, and it's not just Kid's charming Cockney Aussie-isms or Zappa's Scottish tones. You'll get characters ending words with “-om,” squeaking in Widdle Baby talk, and babbling like Jar Jar Binks or Bizarro Superman. It was amusing when Mog said “Thankupo!” in Final Fantasy VI and…well, mostly tolerable when Chu-Chu used “chu” instead of “you” throughout Xenogears, but there's a point where cute becomes insufferable, and Chrono Cross treads too far past it.    There's no denying that Chrono Cross has some brilliant, affecting moments (one of which actually involves time travel), but they're scattered and diluted by the game's lack of focus. It's too caught up in giving the player options in which party members to recruit and which plot variations to pursue (and which characters to inadvertently miss). The central story wrapped around Kid's crazed revenge and Serge's struggle to simply exist, both potentially fascinating ideas, doesn't get the development it needs. The game's biggest secrets are revealed in a flurry of exposition literally right before the final boss, and the ending's attempts at pathos seem hollow despite an amazing closing song. Even separated from its sequel status, Chrono Cross just doesn't satisfy in its storyline.    And how does it fare as a sequel? Discarding Chrono Trigger's uplifting and whimsical tone, Chrono Cross ranges from contemplative to downright grim, alluding to the original game's characters in ways either bluntly tragic or lazily mean-spirited. It's a daring turn for a sequel, yes, but it also reminds us that Chrono Trigger's small cast was more memorable than Chrono Cross' overstuffed lineup of gimmicks and stereotypes and rejected Pokémon designs.     The remastered edition of Chrono Cross looks decent at first, with sharp new character portraits and immediately available options to slow down or speed everything up (both of which were buried secrets in the original game). Yet technical issues are rampant: the frame rate drops at random and makes the game feel choppy, and some background graphics and character models actually look worse than the PlayStation original. The new font is also unattractive, though at least it's legible, unlike some recent Final Fantasy recasts. Perhaps some patches will amend the glitches, but at this writing it must be said that this version of Chrono Cross isn't the definitive release it should have been.    The most interesting new addition for this release is the first official English translation of Radical Dreamers, a 1996 text adventure game originally made for the Satellaview service in Japan. A brief and opaque follow-up to Chrono Trigger, it finds Kid, a laid-back bard version of Serge, and a masked sorcerer named Magil infiltrating Lynx's palace in search of the Frozen Flame. It's the same storyline that Chrono Cross would expand upon, but here it's much tighter in focus and more satisfying in its development. Serge has slightly more personality here, and more chances to interact with his companions.     As an adventure game Radical Dreamers is fairly simple, befitting its origins as a download-only novelty. Lynx's mansion has only two dozen or so rooms, battles are simple, and there's a lot of backtracking.  Yet it's a fascinating bonus for Chrono Trigger fans, and it's impressive that Square finally saw fit to localize it.  In fact, Radical Dreamers doesn't do Chrono Cross any favors in the plot department. Compared to the text adventure's straightforward approach and firm character connections, Chrono Cross seems all the more a missed opportunity.    Despite some problems in the remastering, Chrono Cross remains much the same as it was 22 years ago: spectacular to see and hear, intriguing to explore, and generally disappointing below the surface. Radical Dreamers is a nice addition, however, and it presents an interesting narrative just as Chrono Cross delivers almost everything except that.  And Chrono Cross still stands out, whether players sift the clever ideas from the undernourished ones or just appreciate it as one of the most beautiful games ever made.

Review:         Description:        A young man named Serge finds his calm village life destroyed when he's warped to an alternate reality: one where he isn't even alive anymore. Soon Serge and a thief named Kid are gathering an unlikely assortment of allies as they hop between dimensions and take on the mysterious figures and ominous forces threatening both worlds.     Review:            The best way to approach Chrono Cross is to forget that it's a sequel to Chrono Trigger. It is, of course, but Chrono Trigger—an inventive, marvelously crafted time-travel romp that's tied with Earthbound as the most beloved RPG in history—is a hard act to follow. Saddled with that sort of legacy, Chrono Cross earned a divisive reception after its release over two decades ago. Square Enix's new Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition remasters the game and bundles it with its direct inspiration, the previously Japan-only 1996 graphic adventure Radical Dreamers. Beneath these new additions, however, the ups and downs of Chrono Cross refuse to change.    Chrono Cross is nothing if not ambitious. Contrasting the time-travel storyline of Chrono Trigger, it presents a tale of alternate dimensions. Our hero is Serge, a seemingly normal kid in a gentle seaside village. As he ponders the future with his equally normal almost-girlfriend Leena on a beach one day, a sudden vortex warps Serge to a different dimension. It's much like his own at a glance, but his fellow villagers take different paths in life, and this new world's version of Leena informs him that the Serge she knew actually drowned when he was a boy. Upon visiting his own grave, Serge meets up with Kid, a spitfire thief with a hybrid British-Australian accent and a grudge against a mysterious figure named Lynx. And so the two of them start a quest that involves travelling between dimensions and trying to resist the pull of fate itself.     There's equal ambition in the cast of Chrono Cross. Rather than building a core cast of under ten characters, players can recruit a total of 45 party members over the initial quest and through replays in New Game+ mode. You'll find conventional RPG characters like the conflicted knight Glenn, the cocksure mage Guile, and Riddel, the gloomy daughter of a military leader, but Chrono Cross doesn't stop there. Also available are a living straw doll, a talking dog, a sentient turnip, a flower creature, a blacksmith, a scientist, a cyborg, a bartender, a struggling artist, a foppish swordsman, a glam rocker, a dancer, a baby dragon, a fairy, a cavegirl, an alien, a mermaid, an elderly gnomish mage, a rowdy seafaring kid and his family, and a skeleton clown who must be gathered and assembled one piece at a time.    All of these characters find their way into the creative battle system of Chrono Cross. Attacks are handled in three tiers, each showing a percentage to gauge the likelihood of a hit landing, and using each move drains a turn gauge while building up a character's ability to use their spells, items, and unique abilities. All of these are assigned to slots, and you're limited in how often your party can employ them in battle. It allows for a lot of customization, and Chrono Cross adds a color-coded element system to both enemies and the playfield. Each fight becomes a balancing act of attacking judiciously, conserving items, and using spells just when the elements favor them.     Chrono Cross also makes combat less intrusive than other RPGs of its era. Enemies are visible on the main screen instead of emerging at random, and a lot of them can be avoided. A similar innovation lets you skip areas on the world map if you've cleared them already, making a smoother experience overall. Still, it's not without some drawbacks. The few exclusive moves that characters possess are disappointing when compared with Chrono Trigger's signature abilities and team-up attacks—which Chrono Cross offers only in a few rare and obscure cases. Having to pick attacks from a menu is also less satisfying than, say, the cruder but invigorating button-mashing of Xenogears (made by much of the same team), and all those percentages clash with the wonderfully organic atmosphere of the game.    And that atmosphere goes a long way in smoothing over the flaws in Chrono Cross. Squaresoft's programmers knew the PlayStation in and out by the end of the 1990s, and Chrono Cross is their most visually impressive work. Everything in the game feels remarkably alive, from the tropical fronds and ocean vistas of Serge's home to the depths of an eerily preserved high-tech base. The use of color and light is remarkable, and the designers' choice of lush islands and colorful cities is still a charming alternative to the more medieval fantasy settings preferred by other games.    It all glides along thanks to a marvelous soundtrack. Composer Yasunori Mitsuda wrung an astonishing variety of sounds from the PlayStation's processors, and his tracks are rarely at a loss for catchy hooks or haunting melodies. The first few hours of the game set a perfect stage of melancholy tones and bright atmosphere, casting players adrift in a strange world while ruminating on how lives can change irrevocably with just one decision.    The music helps Chrono Cross pull off scenes of striking beauty: a sudden trip to a world rendered in children's scrawls and simple tones, a sunset confrontation with a face from Serge's past, and even the first time you take to the sea with a rousing theme perfectly evoking a new sense of exploration.     Yet for all of its spectacular environments, entrancing music, varied paths, and multiple endings, Chrono Cross can't pull it all together. The character lineup is wide and varied, but the majority of them have brief and unsatisfying plot arcs or no plot arcs at all. Serge himself is mostly a blank slate, and Kid, likeable little punk that she is, can only perk things up so much. And for every cool new party member, you'll encounter two who are merely annoying and disposable.    This is exacerbated by the localizers' decision to give party members cartoonish speech patterns, and it's not just Kid's charming Cockney Aussie-isms or Zappa's Scottish tones. You'll get characters ending words with “-om,” squeaking in Widdle Baby talk, and babbling like Jar Jar Binks or Bizarro Superman. It was amusing when Mog said “Thankupo!” in Final Fantasy VI and…well, mostly tolerable when Chu-Chu used “chu” instead of “you” throughout Xenogears, but there's a point where cute becomes insufferable, and Chrono Cross treads too far past it.    There's no denying that Chrono Cross has some brilliant, affecting moments (one of which actually involves time travel), but they're scattered and diluted by the game's lack of focus. It's too caught up in giving the player options in which party members to recruit and which plot variations to pursue (and which characters to inadvertently miss). The central story wrapped around Kid's crazed revenge and Serge's struggle to simply exist, both potentially fascinating ideas, doesn't get the development it needs. The game's biggest secrets are revealed in a flurry of exposition literally right before the final boss, and the ending's attempts at pathos seem hollow despite an amazing closing song. Even separated from its sequel status, Chrono Cross just doesn't satisfy in its storyline.    And how does it fare as a sequel? Discarding Chrono Trigger's uplifting and whimsical tone, Chrono Cross ranges from contemplative to downright grim, alluding to the original game's characters in ways either bluntly tragic or lazily mean-spirited. It's a daring turn for a sequel, yes, but it also reminds us that Chrono Trigger's small cast was more memorable than Chrono Cross' overstuffed lineup of gimmicks and stereotypes and rejected Pokémon designs.     The remastered edition of Chrono Cross looks decent at first, with sharp new character portraits and immediately available options to slow down or speed everything up (both of which were buried secrets in the original game). Yet technical issues are rampant: the frame rate drops at random and makes the game feel choppy, and some background graphics and character models actually look worse than the PlayStation original. The new font is also unattractive, though at least it's legible, unlike some recent Final Fantasy recasts. Perhaps some patches will amend the glitches, but at this writing it must be said that this version of Chrono Cross isn't the definitive release it should have been.    The most interesting new addition for this release is the first official English translation of Radical Dreamers, a 1996 text adventure game originally made for the Satellaview service in Japan. A brief and opaque follow-up to Chrono Trigger, it finds Kid, a laid-back bard version of Serge, and a masked sorcerer named Magil infiltrating Lynx's palace in search of the Frozen Flame. It's the same storyline that Chrono Cross would expand upon, but here it's much tighter in focus and more satisfying in its development. Serge has slightly more personality here, and more chances to interact with his companions.     As an adventure game Radical Dreamers is fairly simple, befitting its origins as a download-only novelty. Lynx's mansion has only two dozen or so rooms, battles are simple, and there's a lot of backtracking.  Yet it's a fascinating bonus for Chrono Trigger fans, and it's impressive that Square finally saw fit to localize it.  In fact, Radical Dreamers doesn't do Chrono Cross any favors in the plot department. Compared to the text adventure's straightforward approach and firm character connections, Chrono Cross seems all the more a missed opportunity.    Despite some problems in the remastering, Chrono Cross remains much the same as it was 22 years ago: spectacular to see and hear, intriguing to explore, and generally disappointing below the surface. Radical Dreamers is a nice addition, however, and it presents an interesting narrative just as Chrono Cross delivers almost everything except that.  And Chrono Cross still stands out, whether players sift the clever ideas from the undernourished ones or just appreciate it as one of the most beautiful games ever made.

Review:         Description:        A young man named Serge finds his calm village life destroyed when he's warped to an alternate reality: one where he isn't even alive anymore. Soon Serge and a thief named Kid are gathering an unlikely assortment of allies as they hop between dimensions and take on the mysterious figures and ominous forces threatening both worlds.     Review:            The best way to approach Chrono Cross is to forget that it's a sequel to Chrono Trigger. It is, of course, but Chrono Trigger—an inventive, marvelously crafted time-travel romp that's tied with Earthbound as the most beloved RPG in history—is a hard act to follow. Saddled with that sort of legacy, Chrono Cross earned a divisive reception after its release over two decades ago. Square Enix's new Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition remasters the game and bundles it with its direct inspiration, the previously Japan-only 1996 graphic adventure Radical Dreamers. Beneath these new additions, however, the ups and downs of Chrono Cross refuse to change.    Chrono Cross is nothing if not ambitious. Contrasting the time-travel storyline of Chrono Trigger, it presents a tale of alternate dimensions. Our hero is Serge, a seemingly normal kid in a gentle seaside village. As he ponders the future with his equally normal almost-girlfriend Leena on a beach one day, a sudden vortex warps Serge to a different dimension. It's much like his own at a glance, but his fellow villagers take different paths in life, and this new world's version of Leena informs him that the Serge she knew actually drowned when he was a boy. Upon visiting his own grave, Serge meets up with Kid, a spitfire thief with a hybrid British-Australian accent and a grudge against a mysterious figure named Lynx. And so the two of them start a quest that involves travelling between dimensions and trying to resist the pull of fate itself.     There's equal ambition in the cast of Chrono Cross. Rather than building a core cast of under ten characters, players can recruit a total of 45 party members over the initial quest and through replays in New Game+ mode. You'll find conventional RPG characters like the conflicted knight Glenn, the cocksure mage Guile, and Riddel, the gloomy daughter of a military leader, but Chrono Cross doesn't stop there. Also available are a living straw doll, a talking dog, a sentient turnip, a flower creature, a blacksmith, a scientist, a cyborg, a bartender, a struggling artist, a foppish swordsman, a glam rocker, a dancer, a baby dragon, a fairy, a cavegirl, an alien, a mermaid, an elderly gnomish mage, a rowdy seafaring kid and his family, and a skeleton clown who must be gathered and assembled one piece at a time.    All of these characters find their way into the creative battle system of Chrono Cross. Attacks are handled in three tiers, each showing a percentage to gauge the likelihood of a hit landing, and using each move drains a turn gauge while building up a character's ability to use their spells, items, and unique abilities. All of these are assigned to slots, and you're limited in how often your party can employ them in battle. It allows for a lot of customization, and Chrono Cross adds a color-coded element system to both enemies and the playfield. Each fight becomes a balancing act of attacking judiciously, conserving items, and using spells just when the elements favor them.     Chrono Cross also makes combat less intrusive than other RPGs of its era. Enemies are visible on the main screen instead of emerging at random, and a lot of them can be avoided. A similar innovation lets you skip areas on the world map if you've cleared them already, making a smoother experience overall. Still, it's not without some drawbacks. The few exclusive moves that characters possess are disappointing when compared with Chrono Trigger's signature abilities and team-up attacks—which Chrono Cross offers only in a few rare and obscure cases. Having to pick attacks from a menu is also less satisfying than, say, the cruder but invigorating button-mashing of Xenogears (made by much of the same team), and all those percentages clash with the wonderfully organic atmosphere of the game.    And that atmosphere goes a long way in smoothing over the flaws in Chrono Cross. Squaresoft's programmers knew the PlayStation in and out by the end of the 1990s, and Chrono Cross is their most visually impressive work. Everything in the game feels remarkably alive, from the tropical fronds and ocean vistas of Serge's home to the depths of an eerily preserved high-tech base. The use of color and light is remarkable, and the designers' choice of lush islands and colorful cities is still a charming alternative to the more medieval fantasy settings preferred by other games.    It all glides along thanks to a marvelous soundtrack. Composer Yasunori Mitsuda wrung an astonishing variety of sounds from the PlayStation's processors, and his tracks are rarely at a loss for catchy hooks or haunting melodies. The first few hours of the game set a perfect stage of melancholy tones and bright atmosphere, casting players adrift in a strange world while ruminating on how lives can change irrevocably with just one decision.    The music helps Chrono Cross pull off scenes of striking beauty: a sudden trip to a world rendered in children's scrawls and simple tones, a sunset confrontation with a face from Serge's past, and even the first time you take to the sea with a rousing theme perfectly evoking a new sense of exploration.     Yet for all of its spectacular environments, entrancing music, varied paths, and multiple endings, Chrono Cross can't pull it all together. The character lineup is wide and varied, but the majority of them have brief and unsatisfying plot arcs or no plot arcs at all. Serge himself is mostly a blank slate, and Kid, likeable little punk that she is, can only perk things up so much. And for every cool new party member, you'll encounter two who are merely annoying and disposable.    This is exacerbated by the localizers' decision to give party members cartoonish speech patterns, and it's not just Kid's charming Cockney Aussie-isms or Zappa's Scottish tones. You'll get characters ending words with “-om,” squeaking in Widdle Baby talk, and babbling like Jar Jar Binks or Bizarro Superman. It was amusing when Mog said “Thankupo!” in Final Fantasy VI and…well, mostly tolerable when Chu-Chu used “chu” instead of “you” throughout Xenogears, but there's a point where cute becomes insufferable, and Chrono Cross treads too far past it.    There's no denying that Chrono Cross has some brilliant, affecting moments (one of which actually involves time travel), but they're scattered and diluted by the game's lack of focus. It's too caught up in giving the player options in which party members to recruit and which plot variations to pursue (and which characters to inadvertently miss). The central story wrapped around Kid's crazed revenge and Serge's struggle to simply exist, both potentially fascinating ideas, doesn't get the development it needs. The game's biggest secrets are revealed in a flurry of exposition literally right before the final boss, and the ending's attempts at pathos seem hollow despite an amazing closing song. Even separated from its sequel status, Chrono Cross just doesn't satisfy in its storyline.    And how does it fare as a sequel? Discarding Chrono Trigger's uplifting and whimsical tone, Chrono Cross ranges from contemplative to downright grim, alluding to the original game's characters in ways either bluntly tragic or lazily mean-spirited. It's a daring turn for a sequel, yes, but it also reminds us that Chrono Trigger's small cast was more memorable than Chrono Cross' overstuffed lineup of gimmicks and stereotypes and rejected Pokémon designs.     The remastered edition of Chrono Cross looks decent at first, with sharp new character portraits and immediately available options to slow down or speed everything up (both of which were buried secrets in the original game). Yet technical issues are rampant: the frame rate drops at random and makes the game feel choppy, and some background graphics and character models actually look worse than the PlayStation original. The new font is also unattractive, though at least it's legible, unlike some recent Final Fantasy recasts. Perhaps some patches will amend the glitches, but at this writing it must be said that this version of Chrono Cross isn't the definitive release it should have been.    The most interesting new addition for this release is the first official English translation of Radical Dreamers, a 1996 text adventure game originally made for the Satellaview service in Japan. A brief and opaque follow-up to Chrono Trigger, it finds Kid, a laid-back bard version of Serge, and a masked sorcerer named Magil infiltrating Lynx's palace in search of the Frozen Flame. It's the same storyline that Chrono Cross would expand upon, but here it's much tighter in focus and more satisfying in its development. Serge has slightly more personality here, and more chances to interact with his companions.     As an adventure game Radical Dreamers is fairly simple, befitting its origins as a download-only novelty. Lynx's mansion has only two dozen or so rooms, battles are simple, and there's a lot of backtracking.  Yet it's a fascinating bonus for Chrono Trigger fans, and it's impressive that Square finally saw fit to localize it.  In fact, Radical Dreamers doesn't do Chrono Cross any favors in the plot department. Compared to the text adventure's straightforward approach and firm character connections, Chrono Cross seems all the more a missed opportunity.    Despite some problems in the remastering, Chrono Cross remains much the same as it was 22 years ago: spectacular to see and hear, intriguing to explore, and generally disappointing below the surface. Radical Dreamers is a nice addition, however, and it presents an interesting narrative just as Chrono Cross delivers almost everything except that.  And Chrono Cross still stands out, whether players sift the clever ideas from the undernourished ones or just appreciate it as one of the most beautiful games ever made.

Review:         Description:        A young man named Serge finds his calm village life destroyed when he's warped to an alternate reality: one where he isn't even alive anymore. Soon Serge and a thief named Kid are gathering an unlikely assortment of allies as they hop between dimensions and take on the mysterious figures and ominous forces threatening both worlds.     Review:            The best way to approach Chrono Cross is to forget that it's a sequel to Chrono Trigger. It is, of course, but Chrono Trigger—an inventive, marvelously crafted time-travel romp that's tied with Earthbound as the most beloved RPG in history—is a hard act to follow. Saddled with that sort of legacy, Chrono Cross earned a divisive reception after its release over two decades ago. Square Enix's new Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition remasters the game and bundles it with its direct inspiration, the previously Japan-only 1996 graphic adventure Radical Dreamers. Beneath these new additions, however, the ups and downs of Chrono Cross refuse to change.    Chrono Cross is nothing if not ambitious. Contrasting the time-travel storyline of Chrono Trigger, it presents a tale of alternate dimensions. Our hero is Serge, a seemingly normal kid in a gentle seaside village. As he ponders the future with his equally normal almost-girlfriend Leena on a beach one day, a sudden vortex warps Serge to a different dimension. It's much like his own at a glance, but his fellow villagers take different paths in life, and this new world's version of Leena informs him that the Serge she knew actually drowned when he was a boy. Upon visiting his own grave, Serge meets up with Kid, a spitfire thief with a hybrid British-Australian accent and a grudge against a mysterious figure named Lynx. And so the two of them start a quest that involves travelling between dimensions and trying to resist the pull of fate itself.     There's equal ambition in the cast of Chrono Cross. Rather than building a core cast of under ten characters, players can recruit a total of 45 party members over the initial quest and through replays in New Game+ mode. You'll find conventional RPG characters like the conflicted knight Glenn, the cocksure mage Guile, and Riddel, the gloomy daughter of a military leader, but Chrono Cross doesn't stop there. Also available are a living straw doll, a talking dog, a sentient turnip, a flower creature, a blacksmith, a scientist, a cyborg, a bartender, a struggling artist, a foppish swordsman, a glam rocker, a dancer, a baby dragon, a fairy, a cavegirl, an alien, a mermaid, an elderly gnomish mage, a rowdy seafaring kid and his family, and a skeleton clown who must be gathered and assembled one piece at a time.    All of these characters find their way into the creative battle system of Chrono Cross. Attacks are handled in three tiers, each showing a percentage to gauge the likelihood of a hit landing, and using each move drains a turn gauge while building up a character's ability to use their spells, items, and unique abilities. All of these are assigned to slots, and you're limited in how often your party can employ them in battle. It allows for a lot of customization, and Chrono Cross adds a color-coded element system to both enemies and the playfield. Each fight becomes a balancing act of attacking judiciously, conserving items, and using spells just when the elements favor them.     Chrono Cross also makes combat less intrusive than other RPGs of its era. Enemies are visible on the main screen instead of emerging at random, and a lot of them can be avoided. A similar innovation lets you skip areas on the world map if you've cleared them already, making a smoother experience overall. Still, it's not without some drawbacks. The few exclusive moves that characters possess are disappointing when compared with Chrono Trigger's signature abilities and team-up attacks—which Chrono Cross offers only in a few rare and obscure cases. Having to pick attacks from a menu is also less satisfying than, say, the cruder but invigorating button-mashing of Xenogears (made by much of the same team), and all those percentages clash with the wonderfully organic atmosphere of the game.    And that atmosphere goes a long way in smoothing over the flaws in Chrono Cross. Squaresoft's programmers knew the PlayStation in and out by the end of the 1990s, and Chrono Cross is their most visually impressive work. Everything in the game feels remarkably alive, from the tropical fronds and ocean vistas of Serge's home to the depths of an eerily preserved high-tech base. The use of color and light is remarkable, and the designers' choice of lush islands and colorful cities is still a charming alternative to the more medieval fantasy settings preferred by other games.    It all glides along thanks to a marvelous soundtrack. Composer Yasunori Mitsuda wrung an astonishing variety of sounds from the PlayStation's processors, and his tracks are rarely at a loss for catchy hooks or haunting melodies. The first few hours of the game set a perfect stage of melancholy tones and bright atmosphere, casting players adrift in a strange world while ruminating on how lives can change irrevocably with just one decision.    The music helps Chrono Cross pull off scenes of striking beauty: a sudden trip to a world rendered in children's scrawls and simple tones, a sunset confrontation with a face from Serge's past, and even the first time you take to the sea with a rousing theme perfectly evoking a new sense of exploration.     Yet for all of its spectacular environments, entrancing music, varied paths, and multiple endings, Chrono Cross can't pull it all together. The character lineup is wide and varied, but the majority of them have brief and unsatisfying plot arcs or no plot arcs at all. Serge himself is mostly a blank slate, and Kid, likeable little punk that she is, can only perk things up so much. And for every cool new party member, you'll encounter two who are merely annoying and disposable.    This is exacerbated by the localizers' decision to give party members cartoonish speech patterns, and it's not just Kid's charming Cockney Aussie-isms or Zappa's Scottish tones. You'll get characters ending words with “-om,” squeaking in Widdle Baby talk, and babbling like Jar Jar Binks or Bizarro Superman. It was amusing when Mog said “Thankupo!” in Final Fantasy VI and…well, mostly tolerable when Chu-Chu used “chu” instead of “you” throughout Xenogears, but there's a point where cute becomes insufferable, and Chrono Cross treads too far past it.    There's no denying that Chrono Cross has some brilliant, affecting moments (one of which actually involves time travel), but they're scattered and diluted by the game's lack of focus. It's too caught up in giving the player options in which party members to recruit and which plot variations to pursue (and which characters to inadvertently miss). The central story wrapped around Kid's crazed revenge and Serge's struggle to simply exist, both potentially fascinating ideas, doesn't get the development it needs. The game's biggest secrets are revealed in a flurry of exposition literally right before the final boss, and the ending's attempts at pathos seem hollow despite an amazing closing song. Even separated from its sequel status, Chrono Cross just doesn't satisfy in its storyline.    And how does it fare as a sequel? Discarding Chrono Trigger's uplifting and whimsical tone, Chrono Cross ranges from contemplative to downright grim, alluding to the original game's characters in ways either bluntly tragic or lazily mean-spirited. It's a daring turn for a sequel, yes, but it also reminds us that Chrono Trigger's small cast was more memorable than Chrono Cross' overstuffed lineup of gimmicks and stereotypes and rejected Pokémon designs.     The remastered edition of Chrono Cross looks decent at first, with sharp new character portraits and immediately available options to slow down or speed everything up (both of which were buried secrets in the original game). Yet technical issues are rampant: the frame rate drops at random and makes the game feel choppy, and some background graphics and character models actually look worse than the PlayStation original. The new font is also unattractive, though at least it's legible, unlike some recent Final Fantasy recasts. Perhaps some patches will amend the glitches, but at this writing it must be said that this version of Chrono Cross isn't the definitive release it should have been.    The most interesting new addition for this release is the first official English translation of Radical Dreamers, a 1996 text adventure game originally made for the Satellaview service in Japan. A brief and opaque follow-up to Chrono Trigger, it finds Kid, a laid-back bard version of Serge, and a masked sorcerer named Magil infiltrating Lynx's palace in search of the Frozen Flame. It's the same storyline that Chrono Cross would expand upon, but here it's much tighter in focus and more satisfying in its development. Serge has slightly more personality here, and more chances to interact with his companions.     As an adventure game Radical Dreamers is fairly simple, befitting its origins as a download-only novelty. Lynx's mansion has only two dozen or so rooms, battles are simple, and there's a lot of backtracking.  Yet it's a fascinating bonus for Chrono Trigger fans, and it's impressive that Square finally saw fit to localize it.  In fact, Radical Dreamers doesn't do Chrono Cross any favors in the plot department. Compared to the text adventure's straightforward approach and firm character connections, Chrono Cross seems all the more a missed opportunity.    Despite some problems in the remastering, Chrono Cross remains much the same as it was 22 years ago: spectacular to see and hear, intriguing to explore, and generally disappointing below the surface. Radical Dreamers is a nice addition, however, and it presents an interesting narrative just as Chrono Cross delivers almost everything except that.  And Chrono Cross still stands out, whether players sift the clever ideas from the undernourished ones or just appreciate it as one of the most beautiful games ever made.

I think so - Kiyoka doesn't come off well at first, but he never actually abuses Miyo, unlike her garbage family - and he also figures out that she's been hurt relatively quickly.

I think so - Kiyoka doesn't come off well at first, but he never actually abuses Miyo, unlike her garbage family - and he also figures out that she's been hurt relatively quickly.

When a circumstance makes the emperor call on her, their meeting will change history.    Shirakawa launched the novel series with illustrations by Ayuko (The Earl & the Fairy) in April 2018. The sixth novel volume shipped in August 2021. The seventh volume will ship on April 21.

When a circumstance makes the emperor call on her, their meeting will change history.    Shirakawa launched the novel series with illustrations by Ayuko (The Earl & the Fairy) in April 2018. The sixth novel volume shipped in August 2021. The seventh volume will ship on April 21.

News Kōkyū no Karasu Anime Unveils Cast, Staff, October Premiere   posted on 2022-04-14 21:25 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo          Saku Mizuno, Masaaki Mizunaka, Taku Yashiro, Marika Kōno star in BN Pictures anime    Aniplex unveiled the main cast, main staff, October premiere, and teaser visual for the television anime of Kōko Shirakawa's Kōkyū no Karasu (A Raven in the Harem) novel series on Thursday.       The main cast members are:     Saku Mizuno as Jusetsu Ryō  Masaaki Mizunaka as Kōshun Ka  Taku Yashiro as Eisei  Marika Kōno as Jiujiu   Chizuru Miyawaki (Gintama TV anime, Gintama: The Final) is directing the anime at BN Pictures, and Satomi Ooshima (Fortune Favors Lady Nikuko) is overseeing the series scripts. Shinji Takeuchi (Fairy Tail, Gintama) is adapting Ayuko's original character designs for animation. Asami Tachibana (DARLING in the FRANXX, Haikyu!!, Moriarty the Patriot) is composing the music.    The novels' story centers on Uki, an imperial concubine who has never been called to the emperor's bedchambers, and maintains a singularly unique life within the harem chambers. Seen by some as having the appearance of an old woman, and some others as a young lady, she is knowne to use mysterious magic that helps with everything from finding lost items to inflicting curses. When a circumstance makes the emperor call on her, their meeting will change history.    Shirakawa launched the novel series with illustrations by Ayuko (The Earl & the Fairy) in April 2018. The sixth novel volume shipped in August 2021. The seventh volume will ship on April 21. On the same day at 9:00 p.m. JST, Aniplex's YouTube channel will stream a teaser promotional video for the anime.
