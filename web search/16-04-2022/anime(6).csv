Aharen-san wa Hakarenai Episodes 1-3  by Nicholas Dupree, Apr 16th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Aharen-san wa Hakarenai ?                     Community score: 3.9                    How would you rate episode 2 of Aharen-san wa Hakarenai ?                     Community score: 4.1                    How would you rate episode 3 of Aharen-san wa Hakarenai ?                     Community score: 4.4            A comedic formula that's gotten one hell of a workout the last decade is that of sticking your main character next to the class oddball. Whether their desk neighbor is building Rube Goldberg machines out of school supplies or just constantly falling asleep, it's pretty easy to make gags so long as you can innovate on whatever brand of weirdness your central character exudes. On its surface, Aharen-san definitely seems like another entry in that little comedy subgenre, and in some ways it definitely is. But somewhere in episode two it started to hit me that this wasn't quite the same thing. This wasn't a show about a rational straightman being constantly surprised by how strange the girl next to him is – it's a show about two absolute morons “Yes, and”-ing each other's specific brand of goofiness until the tower of rock-stupid cards they've stacked tumbles down on top of them.    Raido really is the difference-maker here. He could very easily have been your standard straightman character, reacting in bewilderment at every seemingly inexplicable quirk Aharen presents. But instead he may actually be weirder and dumber than his pint-sized partner in comedy. The moment that tipped me off was when, realizing somebody was following him, Raido's first and only thought was that it must be a hitman, leading to him thinking back on all the terrible things he's done in his past (read: accidentally crushing some flowers with a soccer ball and eating his sister's pudding cup) and concluding that he really is a monster. It's a pretty simple joke, but what makes it work is that he's 100% serious and stonefaced through the entire thing, and the contrast between his bizarre imagination and dead serious exterior works to make it hilarious.    That's the secret sauce that really makes these episodes work so far. The best skits tap into the same kind of energy as Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun's famous Tomoda skit where two characters just get on the same wavelength and nobody's around to stop them as they test out weird ideas and half-baked plans with nothing but the most deadpan of expressions. Even when that feedback loop is broken up by our third (and so far only) major character, Raido never becomes a shouting tsukkomi, but just rolls with Oshiro's towering shyness. The show understands that these gags work best on their own without any loud commentary, and that allows it to breeze through a ton of great punchlines while keeping its pace snappy. That's a godsend for a show built around a repetitive setup, and is going to be crucial in keeping this series fresh as it moves forward.    The timing and animation will also be pretty important, though that doesn't mean the show needs to be a nonstop sakuga parade to be funny. Knowing when to time and how to stage each joke is most important, and so far the show has demonstrated a pretty great grasp of both. The only skit that sticks out as lacking in that department is the softball game in episode three, but for the most part the direction has been solid and consistent in letting the inherent humor of its visual gags speak for themselves. Aharen pulls out four-foot long chopsticks to feed Oshiro and nobody bats an eye. I'm only slightly ashamed to admit the myriad ways Aharen covered up Raido's open fly had me dying laughing. And the weird little dance sequences (and the delightful new ED animation) in episode three display that this show can move plenty when it needs to.    This is also still a romantic comedy, and while our central couple aren't going to set anyone's hearts on fire, their comedic chemistry actually does a great job highlighting why they'd actually make a pretty cute couple. These are two weirdos with negative amounts of social grace just trying to fumble their way into friendship, and they always have each other's back no matter what. Even when he doesn't understand what Aharen is doing or thinking, Raido never gets angry or short-tempered with her. Aharen isn't always great (or coherent) at showing it, but she goes out of her way to support Raido as well. That camaraderie makes them just plain fun to follow as they try to whack their collective pair of braincells together each episode. There's certainly humor to be mined from clashing personalities, but these two work best when they're on the same wavelength, and that makes for a pretty pleasant watch.    This is a stacked season for comedies, with or without romance, and while Aharen-san wa Hakarenai probably won't ever compete with Kaguya-sama for popularity, it certainly can carve out its own niche. The cast will all but certainly expand sooner or later, and some tweaks may be needed to keep the humor from getting stale, but right now the series has definitely put its best foot forward.

Aharen-san wa Hakarenai Episodes 1-3  by Nicholas Dupree, Apr 16th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Aharen-san wa Hakarenai ?                     Community score: 3.9                    How would you rate episode 2 of Aharen-san wa Hakarenai ?                     Community score: 4.1                    How would you rate episode 3 of Aharen-san wa Hakarenai ?                     Community score: 4.4            A comedic formula that's gotten one hell of a workout the last decade is that of sticking your main character next to the class oddball. Whether their desk neighbor is building Rube Goldberg machines out of school supplies or just constantly falling asleep, it's pretty easy to make gags so long as you can innovate on whatever brand of weirdness your central character exudes. On its surface, Aharen-san definitely seems like another entry in that little comedy subgenre, and in some ways it definitely is. But somewhere in episode two it started to hit me that this wasn't quite the same thing. This wasn't a show about a rational straightman being constantly surprised by how strange the girl next to him is – it's a show about two absolute morons “Yes, and”-ing each other's specific brand of goofiness until the tower of rock-stupid cards they've stacked tumbles down on top of them.    Raido really is the difference-maker here. He could very easily have been your standard straightman character, reacting in bewilderment at every seemingly inexplicable quirk Aharen presents. But instead he may actually be weirder and dumber than his pint-sized partner in comedy. The moment that tipped me off was when, realizing somebody was following him, Raido's first and only thought was that it must be a hitman, leading to him thinking back on all the terrible things he's done in his past (read: accidentally crushing some flowers with a soccer ball and eating his sister's pudding cup) and concluding that he really is a monster. It's a pretty simple joke, but what makes it work is that he's 100% serious and stonefaced through the entire thing, and the contrast between his bizarre imagination and dead serious exterior works to make it hilarious.    That's the secret sauce that really makes these episodes work so far. The best skits tap into the same kind of energy as Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun's famous Tomoda skit where two characters just get on the same wavelength and nobody's around to stop them as they test out weird ideas and half-baked plans with nothing but the most deadpan of expressions. Even when that feedback loop is broken up by our third (and so far only) major character, Raido never becomes a shouting tsukkomi, but just rolls with Oshiro's towering shyness. The show understands that these gags work best on their own without any loud commentary, and that allows it to breeze through a ton of great punchlines while keeping its pace snappy. That's a godsend for a show built around a repetitive setup, and is going to be crucial in keeping this series fresh as it moves forward.    The timing and animation will also be pretty important, though that doesn't mean the show needs to be a nonstop sakuga parade to be funny. Knowing when to time and how to stage each joke is most important, and so far the show has demonstrated a pretty great grasp of both. The only skit that sticks out as lacking in that department is the softball game in episode three, but for the most part the direction has been solid and consistent in letting the inherent humor of its visual gags speak for themselves. Aharen pulls out four-foot long chopsticks to feed Oshiro and nobody bats an eye. I'm only slightly ashamed to admit the myriad ways Aharen covered up Raido's open fly had me dying laughing. And the weird little dance sequences (and the delightful new ED animation) in episode three display that this show can move plenty when it needs to.    This is also still a romantic comedy, and while our central couple aren't going to set anyone's hearts on fire, their comedic chemistry actually does a great job highlighting why they'd actually make a pretty cute couple. These are two weirdos with negative amounts of social grace just trying to fumble their way into friendship, and they always have each other's back no matter what. Even when he doesn't understand what Aharen is doing or thinking, Raido never gets angry or short-tempered with her. Aharen isn't always great (or coherent) at showing it, but she goes out of her way to support Raido as well. That camaraderie makes them just plain fun to follow as they try to whack their collective pair of braincells together each episode. There's certainly humor to be mined from clashing personalities, but these two work best when they're on the same wavelength, and that makes for a pretty pleasant watch.    This is a stacked season for comedies, with or without romance, and while Aharen-san wa Hakarenai probably won't ever compete with Kaguya-sama for popularity, it certainly can carve out its own niche. The cast will all but certainly expand sooner or later, and some tweaks may be needed to keep the humor from getting stale, but right now the series has definitely put its best foot forward.

Aharen-san wa Hakarenai Episodes 1-3  by Nicholas Dupree, Apr 16th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Aharen-san wa Hakarenai ?                     Community score: 3.9                    How would you rate episode 2 of Aharen-san wa Hakarenai ?                     Community score: 4.1                    How would you rate episode 3 of Aharen-san wa Hakarenai ?                     Community score: 4.4            A comedic formula that's gotten one hell of a workout the last decade is that of sticking your main character next to the class oddball. Whether their desk neighbor is building Rube Goldberg machines out of school supplies or just constantly falling asleep, it's pretty easy to make gags so long as you can innovate on whatever brand of weirdness your central character exudes. On its surface, Aharen-san definitely seems like another entry in that little comedy subgenre, and in some ways it definitely is. But somewhere in episode two it started to hit me that this wasn't quite the same thing. This wasn't a show about a rational straightman being constantly surprised by how strange the girl next to him is – it's a show about two absolute morons “Yes, and”-ing each other's specific brand of goofiness until the tower of rock-stupid cards they've stacked tumbles down on top of them.    Raido really is the difference-maker here. He could very easily have been your standard straightman character, reacting in bewilderment at every seemingly inexplicable quirk Aharen presents. But instead he may actually be weirder and dumber than his pint-sized partner in comedy. The moment that tipped me off was when, realizing somebody was following him, Raido's first and only thought was that it must be a hitman, leading to him thinking back on all the terrible things he's done in his past (read: accidentally crushing some flowers with a soccer ball and eating his sister's pudding cup) and concluding that he really is a monster. It's a pretty simple joke, but what makes it work is that he's 100% serious and stonefaced through the entire thing, and the contrast between his bizarre imagination and dead serious exterior works to make it hilarious.    That's the secret sauce that really makes these episodes work so far. The best skits tap into the same kind of energy as Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun's famous Tomoda skit where two characters just get on the same wavelength and nobody's around to stop them as they test out weird ideas and half-baked plans with nothing but the most deadpan of expressions. Even when that feedback loop is broken up by our third (and so far only) major character, Raido never becomes a shouting tsukkomi, but just rolls with Oshiro's towering shyness. The show understands that these gags work best on their own without any loud commentary, and that allows it to breeze through a ton of great punchlines while keeping its pace snappy. That's a godsend for a show built around a repetitive setup, and is going to be crucial in keeping this series fresh as it moves forward.    The timing and animation will also be pretty important, though that doesn't mean the show needs to be a nonstop sakuga parade to be funny. Knowing when to time and how to stage each joke is most important, and so far the show has demonstrated a pretty great grasp of both. The only skit that sticks out as lacking in that department is the softball game in episode three, but for the most part the direction has been solid and consistent in letting the inherent humor of its visual gags speak for themselves. Aharen pulls out four-foot long chopsticks to feed Oshiro and nobody bats an eye. I'm only slightly ashamed to admit the myriad ways Aharen covered up Raido's open fly had me dying laughing. And the weird little dance sequences (and the delightful new ED animation) in episode three display that this show can move plenty when it needs to.    This is also still a romantic comedy, and while our central couple aren't going to set anyone's hearts on fire, their comedic chemistry actually does a great job highlighting why they'd actually make a pretty cute couple. These are two weirdos with negative amounts of social grace just trying to fumble their way into friendship, and they always have each other's back no matter what. Even when he doesn't understand what Aharen is doing or thinking, Raido never gets angry or short-tempered with her. Aharen isn't always great (or coherent) at showing it, but she goes out of her way to support Raido as well. That camaraderie makes them just plain fun to follow as they try to whack their collective pair of braincells together each episode. There's certainly humor to be mined from clashing personalities, but these two work best when they're on the same wavelength, and that makes for a pretty pleasant watch.    This is a stacked season for comedies, with or without romance, and while Aharen-san wa Hakarenai probably won't ever compete with Kaguya-sama for popularity, it certainly can carve out its own niche. The cast will all but certainly expand sooner or later, and some tweaks may be needed to keep the humor from getting stale, but right now the series has definitely put its best foot forward.

Aharen-san wa Hakarenai Episodes 1-3  by Nicholas Dupree, Apr 16th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Aharen-san wa Hakarenai ?                     Community score: 3.9                    How would you rate episode 2 of Aharen-san wa Hakarenai ?                     Community score: 4.1                    How would you rate episode 3 of Aharen-san wa Hakarenai ?                     Community score: 4.4            A comedic formula that's gotten one hell of a workout the last decade is that of sticking your main character next to the class oddball. Whether their desk neighbor is building Rube Goldberg machines out of school supplies or just constantly falling asleep, it's pretty easy to make gags so long as you can innovate on whatever brand of weirdness your central character exudes. On its surface, Aharen-san definitely seems like another entry in that little comedy subgenre, and in some ways it definitely is. But somewhere in episode two it started to hit me that this wasn't quite the same thing. This wasn't a show about a rational straightman being constantly surprised by how strange the girl next to him is – it's a show about two absolute morons “Yes, and”-ing each other's specific brand of goofiness until the tower of rock-stupid cards they've stacked tumbles down on top of them.    Raido really is the difference-maker here. He could very easily have been your standard straightman character, reacting in bewilderment at every seemingly inexplicable quirk Aharen presents. But instead he may actually be weirder and dumber than his pint-sized partner in comedy. The moment that tipped me off was when, realizing somebody was following him, Raido's first and only thought was that it must be a hitman, leading to him thinking back on all the terrible things he's done in his past (read: accidentally crushing some flowers with a soccer ball and eating his sister's pudding cup) and concluding that he really is a monster. It's a pretty simple joke, but what makes it work is that he's 100% serious and stonefaced through the entire thing, and the contrast between his bizarre imagination and dead serious exterior works to make it hilarious.    That's the secret sauce that really makes these episodes work so far. The best skits tap into the same kind of energy as Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun's famous Tomoda skit where two characters just get on the same wavelength and nobody's around to stop them as they test out weird ideas and half-baked plans with nothing but the most deadpan of expressions. Even when that feedback loop is broken up by our third (and so far only) major character, Raido never becomes a shouting tsukkomi, but just rolls with Oshiro's towering shyness. The show understands that these gags work best on their own without any loud commentary, and that allows it to breeze through a ton of great punchlines while keeping its pace snappy. That's a godsend for a show built around a repetitive setup, and is going to be crucial in keeping this series fresh as it moves forward.    The timing and animation will also be pretty important, though that doesn't mean the show needs to be a nonstop sakuga parade to be funny. Knowing when to time and how to stage each joke is most important, and so far the show has demonstrated a pretty great grasp of both. The only skit that sticks out as lacking in that department is the softball game in episode three, but for the most part the direction has been solid and consistent in letting the inherent humor of its visual gags speak for themselves. Aharen pulls out four-foot long chopsticks to feed Oshiro and nobody bats an eye. I'm only slightly ashamed to admit the myriad ways Aharen covered up Raido's open fly had me dying laughing. And the weird little dance sequences (and the delightful new ED animation) in episode three display that this show can move plenty when it needs to.    This is also still a romantic comedy, and while our central couple aren't going to set anyone's hearts on fire, their comedic chemistry actually does a great job highlighting why they'd actually make a pretty cute couple. These are two weirdos with negative amounts of social grace just trying to fumble their way into friendship, and they always have each other's back no matter what. Even when he doesn't understand what Aharen is doing or thinking, Raido never gets angry or short-tempered with her. Aharen isn't always great (or coherent) at showing it, but she goes out of her way to support Raido as well. That camaraderie makes them just plain fun to follow as they try to whack their collective pair of braincells together each episode. There's certainly humor to be mined from clashing personalities, but these two work best when they're on the same wavelength, and that makes for a pretty pleasant watch.    This is a stacked season for comedies, with or without romance, and while Aharen-san wa Hakarenai probably won't ever compete with Kaguya-sama for popularity, it certainly can carve out its own niche. The cast will all but certainly expand sooner or later, and some tweaks may be needed to keep the humor from getting stale, but right now the series has definitely put its best foot forward.

News In Another World With My Smartphone Anime Gets 2nd Season   posted on 2022-04-15 17:46 UTC-8 by Crystalyn Hodgkins         1st season of anime based on light novel series premiered in 2017    The official website for the television anime of Patora Fuyuhara's In Another World With My Smartphone (Isekai wa Smartphone to Tomo ni.) light novel series announced on Friday that the anime is getting a second season. The website also posted an illustration from light novel illustrator Eiji Usatsuka to commemorate the announcement.     The first season premiered in July 2017 and aired for 12 episodes. Crunchyroll streamed the series in Japanese with English subtitles as it aired in Japan, and Funimation streamed an English dub.    Takeyuki Yanase (Himegoto, Onsen Yōsei Hakone-chan) directed the anime at Production Reed. Natsuko Takahashi (My Love Story!!) supervised and wrote the series scripts. Toshihide Masudate (Papillon Rose), Masahiro Sekiguchi (Rainbow Days chief animation director), and Miyako Nishida (Rainbow Days) were all credited as character designers and chief animation directors.    J-Novel Club is releasing the novel series in English, and it describes the story:   After a freak accident involving some lightning winds up zapping him dead, 15-year-old Mochizuki Touya wakes up to find himself face-to-face with God. “I am afraid to say that I have made a bit of a blunder...” laments the old coot. But all is not lost! God says that he can reincarnate Touya into a world of fantasy, and as a bonus, he gets to bring his smartphone along with! So begins Touya's adventure in a new, anachronistic pseudo-medieval world. Friends! Laughs! Tears! Inexplicable Deus ex Machina! He sets off on a journey full of wonder as he absentmindedly travels from place to place, following whatever goal catches his fancy. The curtains lift on an epic tale of swords, sorcery, and smartphone apps!  Fuyuhara launched the In Another World With My Smartphone series in 2013 on the ""Shōsetsuka ni Narō"" website, and Hobby Japan's Novels label is publishing the novels in print with illustrations by Eiji Usatsuka. Soto launched a manga adaptation in 2016, and Yen Press is releasing the manga in English.

But all is not lost! God says that he can reincarnate Touya into a world of fantasy, and as a bonus, he gets to bring his smartphone along with! So begins Touya's adventure in a new, anachronistic pseudo-medieval world. Friends! Laughs! Tears! Inexplicable Deus ex Machina!

On the other hand, most of Lupin III movies and OVAs (including the Detective Conan crossover movie) were dubbed in México (and an Argentine redub done for Cagliostro). I hope that Part 6 gets dubbed in México so that the actors from the movies can reprise their roles (something which didn't happen with The First), though HiDive/Sentai Filmworks' Neutral Spanish dubs have a bad reputation among dubbing fans, their dubs for anime like DanMachi, Food Wars and Parasyte: the Maxim have a worse reputation than Funimation's My Hero Academia Neutral Spanish dub.

Part 1 also got a new Spanish dub that'll be finishing up on Hidive tomorrow, so this is definitely something that TMS is pushing for more now; I'm sure Part 6 will be using the same main cast as that new Part 1 dub. In fact, Part 6 is also getting a Portuguese dub!

The show is actually available with the old dub in Pluto TV, it's interesting hearing Victor Mares Jr (Marty McFly) as Lupin, or Aramis as how he's named in that dub. I would like hearing Ricardo Tejedo as Lupin, the last time he voiced the character was in the Lupin vs Conan movie which was dubbed in 2016. In Lupin III The First he was voiced by Carlos Ballarta, who is more of a stand-up comedian and doesn't have a lot of voice acting experience, though he voiced Grisha Jaeger in Attack on Titan.

Like I said, the last three episodes of this ""Latin American Spanish"" dub go up onto Hidive tomorrow, as they've been uploading a few episodes at a time every Thursday.   It could just be the old dub, but considering how it wasn't simply uploaded alongside the English dub, like how Part 4 is getting both Japanese & English uploaded together onto Hidive weekly, and there's now a new Spanish dub for Part 6, it could be a new one for Part 1, as well.

How are they mis-selling it?            They probably meant that it was building up a Lupin/Sherlock rivalry that is essentially already over before it starts, because spoiler[it's later revealed Holmes already knows that Lupin didn't kill Watson.]   Just like the Japanese trailers sold it as Holmes having something personal against Lupin and Lupin being a killer.

On the other hand, most of Lupin III movies and OVAs (including the Detective Conan crossover movie) were dubbed in México (and an Argentine redub done for Cagliostro). I hope that Part 6 gets dubbed in México so that the actors from the movies can reprise their roles (something which didn't happen with The First), though HiDive/Sentai Filmworks' Neutral Spanish dubs have a bad reputation among dubbing fans, their dubs for anime like DanMachi, Food Wars and Parasyte: the Maxim have a worse reputation than Funimation's My Hero Academia Neutral Spanish dub.

Part 1 also got a new Spanish dub that'll be finishing up on Hidive tomorrow, so this is definitely something that TMS is pushing for more now; I'm sure Part 6 will be using the same main cast as that new Part 1 dub.

The show is actually available with the old dub in Pluto TV, it's interesting hearing Victor Mares Jr (Marty McFly) as Lupin, or Aramis as how he's named in that dub. I would like hearing Ricardo Tejedo as Lupin, the last time he voiced the character was in the Lupin vs Conan movie which was dubbed in 2016. In Lupin III The First he was voiced by Carlos Ballarta, who is more of a stand-up comedian and doesn't have a lot of voice acting experience, though he voiced Grisha Jaeger in Attack on Titan.

Like I said, the last three episodes of this ""Latin American Spanish"" dub go up onto Hidive tomorrow, as they've been uploading a few episodes at a time every Thursday.   It could just be the old dub, but considering how it wasn't simply uploaded alongside the English dub, like how Part 4 is getting both Japanese & English uploaded together onto Hidive weekly, and there's now a new Spanish dub for Part 6, it could be a new one for Part 1, as well.

They probably meant that it was building up a Lupin/Sherlock rivalry that is essentially already over before it starts, because spoiler[it's later revealed Holmes already knows that Lupin didn't kill Watson.]   Just like the Japanese trailers sold it as Holmes having something personal against Lupin and Lupin being a killer.

On the other hand, most of Lupin III movies and OVAs (including the Detective Conan crossover movie) were dubbed in México (and an Argentine redub done for Cagliostro). I hope that Part 6 gets dubbed in México so that the actors from the movies can reprise their roles (something which didn't happen with The First), though HiDive/Sentai Filmworks' Neutral Spanish dubs have a bad reputation among dubbing fans, their dubs for anime like DanMachi, Food Wars and Parasyte: the Maxim have a worse reputation than Funimation's My Hero Academia Neutral Spanish dub.

Part 1 also got a new Spanish dub that'll be finishing up on Hidive tomorrow, so this is definitely something that TMS is pushing for more now; I'm sure Part 6 will be using the same main cast as that new Part 1 dub.

The show is actually available with the old dub in Pluto TV, it's interesting hearing Victor Mares Jr (Marty McFly) as Lupin, or Aramis as how he's named in that dub. I would like hearing Ricardo Tejedo as Lupin, the last time he voiced the character was in the Lupin vs Conan movie which was dubbed in 2016. In Lupin III The First he was voiced by Carlos Ballarta, who is more of a stand-up comedian and doesn't have a lot of voice acting experience, though he voiced Grisha Jaeger in Attack on Titan.

Like I said, the last three episodes of this ""Latin American Spanish"" dub go up onto Hidive tomorrow, as they've been uploading a few episodes at a time every Thursday.   It could just be the old dub, but considering how it wasn't simply uploaded alongside the English dub, like how Part 4 is getting both Japanese & English uploaded together onto Hidive weekly, and there's now a new Spanish dub for Part 6, it could be a new one for Part 1, as well.

On the other hand, most of Lupin III movies and OVAs (including the Detective Conan crossover movie) were dubbed in México (and an Argentine redub done for Cagliostro). I hope that Part 6 gets dubbed in México so that the actors from the movies can reprise their roles (something which didn't happen with The First), though HiDive/Sentai Filmworks' Neutral Spanish dubs have a bad reputation among dubbing fans, their dubs for anime like DanMachi, Food Wars and Parasyte: the Maxim have a worse reputation than Funimation's My Hero Academia Neutral Spanish dub.

Part 1 also got a new Spanish dub that'll be finishing up on Hidive tomorrow, so this is definitely something that TMS is pushing for more now; I'm sure Part 6 will be using the same main cast as that new Part 1 dub.

The show is actually available with the old dub in Pluto TV, it's interesting hearing Victor Mares Jr (Marty McFly) as Lupin, or Aramis as how he's named in that dub. I would like hearing Ricardo Tejedo as Lupin, the last time he voiced the character was in the Lupin vs Conan movie which was dubbed in 2016. In Lupin III The First he was voiced by Carlos Ballarta, who is more of a stand-up comedian and doesn't have a lot of voice acting experience, though he voiced Grisha Jaeger in Attack on Titan.

The show is actually available with the old dub in Pluto TV, it's interesting hearing Victor Mares Jr (Marty McFly) as Lupin, or Aramis as how he's named in that dub. I would like hearing Ricardo Tejedo as Lupin, the last time he voiced the character was in the Lupin vs Conan movie which was dubbed in 2016. In Lupin III The First he was voiced by Carlos Ballarta, who is more of a stand-up comedian and doesn't have a lot of voice acting experience, though he voiced Grisha Jaeger in Attack on Titan.

Like I said, the last three episodes of this ""Latin American Spanish"" dub go up onto Hidive tomorrow, as they've been uploading a few episodes at a time every Thursday.   It could just be the old dub, but considering how it wasn't simply uploaded alongside the English dub, like how Part 4 is getting both Japanese & English uploaded together onto Hidive weekly, and there's now a new Spanish dub for Part 6, it could be a new one for Part 1, as well.

They probably meant that it was building up a Lupin/Sherlock rivalry that is essentially already over before it starts, because spoiler[it's later revealed Holmes already knows that Lupin didn't kill Watson.]   Just like the Japanese trailers sold it as Holmes having something personal against Lupin and Lupin being a killer.

I hope that Part 6 gets dubbed in México so that the actors from the movies can reprise their roles (something which didn't happen with The First), though HiDive/Sentai Filmworks' Neutral Spanish dubs have a bad reputation among dubbing fans, their dubs for anime like DanMachi, Food Wars and Parasyte: the Maxim have a worse reputation than Funimation's My Hero Academia Neutral Spanish dub.

The show is actually available with the old dub in Pluto TV, it's interesting hearing Victor Mares Jr (Marty McFly) as Lupin, or Aramis as how he's named in that dub. I would like hearing Ricardo Tejedo as Lupin, the last time he voiced the character was in the Lupin vs Conan movie which was dubbed in 2016. In Lupin III The First he was voiced by Carlos Ballarta, who is more of a stand-up comedian and doesn't have a lot of voice acting experience, though he voiced Grisha Jaeger in Attack on Titan.

Like I said, the last three episodes of this ""Latin American Spanish"" dub go up onto Hidive tomorrow, as they've been uploading a few episodes at a time every Thursday.   It could just be the old dub, but considering how it wasn't simply uploaded alongside the English dub, like how Part 4 is getting both Japanese & English uploaded together onto Hidive weekly, and there's now a new Spanish dub for Part 6, it could be a new one for Part 1, as well.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide RPG Real Estate   Apr  7th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of RPG Real Estate ?                     Community score: 3.4              What is this?   Kotone is a mage who ends up working at a real estate agency in a fantasy world. Kotone helps various clients, from a necromancer to a guild receptionist raising a pegasus, find a place to call home.    RPG Real Estate is based on  Chiyo Kenmotsu's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Wednesdays.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis    Rating:                Oh look, a light-hearted anime about cute girls in a fantasy world running a real estate agency. As they eat food, meet people, and go on everyday adventures, the show pokes fun at RPG tropes like adventurers looting people's homes or the prevalence of bikini armor. The first episode even comes with a good moral for those in the service industry: listen to what the client wants, not what you think they'll want based on appearances.    But here's the thing about RPG Real Estate: it's not really a fantasy story despite its outward appearance. Rather, it's a social commentary on modern Japan. With the fantasy aspect stripped away, Kotone is just your average Japanese college graduate. She studied hard, graduated—and then gave up on her dreams and is moving to Tokyo to get a job that has nothing to do with what she studied. Upon arrival, her first challenge is finding an affordable place for an entry level (read: underpaid) worker in the most expensive city in the country.    Of course, all the places she can afford have some sort of terrible downside. One has a shared living space (where people are guaranteed to steal your stuff). Another is an ill-maintained high-rise that lacks an elevator. And, worst of all, the last apartment has *gasp* foreigner neighbors! Oh, you didn't catch that? Yeah, demi-humans are non-Japanese people in this fantasy analogy. They're look different, have “strange” customs, and don't speak the same language, after all.    I've lived in Japan for 17 years now and am on my sixth apartment. I can't count the number of places that wouldn't rent to me because I was a foreigner. (Many rental ads even go so far as to list “no foreigners” right along with “no pets” and “no musical instruments” in their rental requirements.) So I appreciate this anime has the inclusive message that having foreigner neighbors isn't a downside. Rather, the foreigners are seen as kind and welcoming. Heck, the real-estate agency even has a foreigner of their own, Fa, who can breach the language barrier—making RPG Real Estate a company that actively supports the city's foreigner population. (Though the fact that Fa is portrayed as a child due to her not understanding local customs [like the need for clothes] is a whole different can of worms.) But frankly, when it comes to Japan addressing their institutionalized xenophobia and speaking out against it, I'll take what I can get.      Nicholas Dupree    Rating:                Stop me if you've heard this one before: an adaptation of a Manga Time Kirara “Cute Girls” manga, featuring a handful of candy-colored anime girls who are ostensibly teenagers but look no older than 10, where they have low stakes comedic outings and occasionally wind up in fanservicey outfits. But what if I told you this time the cute girls were in a generic RPG fantasy world, and they occasionally made very tired jokes about the kinds of houses you see in fantasy settings? If that sounds like a good time, then you have far more patience than me for RPG Real Estate.    Watching this show felt like trying to eat a bag of dollar-store cotton candy as fast as possible. I feel mean for saying that after loving the equally saccharine Healer Girl and enjoying other low-stakes comedies like Aharen-san this season, but something in the execution here just doesn't work. The characters are too flat (no not like that) and simple to be entertaining in their own right, and the premise of an RPG Real Estate company wears thin surprisingly quickly. By the second house tour of the episode they aren't even really making RPG-specific gags about the houses anymore, and the entire humor of the premise starts feeling like an afterthought.    So okay, then this is maybe meant to be more of a workplace comedy, where the joke is that the girls are basically an adventuring party doing mundane paperwork and real estate things. But that only really works if the characters are funny or have good chemistry, and that's not the case here. Nobody's personality is very strong or memorable, and their conversations are pretty dull. The only one who stands out is Fa, the monster girl who exists somewhere between child and pet, and whose gimmick is she hates wearing clothes and is always trying to strip naked while at work. That's not a great joke, but I unfortunately remember it, and that qualifies her for the funniest thing in this premiere.    So without character-based humor or a unique hook, all that's really left is if you just want to watch these generic girls get shipteased together, and there's certainly plenty of that. Fa and Kotone share a bath together. Rakira gets blushy when Kotone calls her pretty, and her adventuring outfit is a tube top and mini-skirt combo with the show literally calling her an exhibitionist. At the end of the episode Rakira and Rufria sleep in the same bed so the latter can be “comforted” after a rough day at work. It's about as blatant as you can get, but without any personality and with the blobby artstyle, it all comes across like smacking plastic dolls together and making kissy sounds. But honestly even that sounds more engaging than watching another episode of this. I'm not immediately opposed to this style of show, but RPG Real Estate is too vacuous to work.       Rebecca Silverman   Rating:                If you've been waiting for you CGCT show, here it is! RPG Real Estate has all the hallmarks of a genre standby: women who all look impressively young, a bathing scene with soap bubble censorship, an adorable theme, and a little yuri bait. And really, I'm being unkind with the censorship statement, because while the bubbles are strategically placed, the bathing scene isn't meant to be particularly prurient, and it isn't really framed as such – it's really just Fa and Kotone taking a bath.    The concept is probably the best part of the episode. While it's a bit of a stretch that the real estate agency RPG is actually called “Rent Plan Guide Real Estate,” the way it functions is like a much more adorable Dragon Goes House-Hunting. The idea is that fifteen years after, for all intents and purposes, the game ended (i. e. world peace was achieved), the fantasy realm functions an awful lot like our boring old world, and that means that everyone needs a place to live. But there are still entertaining vestiges of the old sword-and-sorcery way of life that pop up, such as a house that's also a dungeon or one that requires you to just let adventurers to come in and riffle through your drawers and take your stuff as “loot.” There are also remnants of how the world used to work in that everyone still has classes that can be used if necessary – Kotone is a wizard, Rufuria is a priest, and Rakira is a warrior. But there are little bits of commentary on those scattered throughout the episode, with the standout moment being when Kotone sees Rakira in her warrior uniform – a bra top and short-shorts – and remarks that it doesn't appear to be quite enough armor to be of any use.    The story itself is mostly in the soothing and sweet vein, which certainly isn't a bad thing. The stakes are low-key, with the main plot of the episode revolving around finding homes for two people, with a little lesson about listening to what the customer actually wants as opposed to what you think they want thrown in. Fa runs the risk of being kind of annoying (although she has a real point about her tail making wearing clothes tailored for humans uncomfortable), but for the greater part this is pleasantly bright and gentle, which is absolutely not a terrible thing if you'd just like to relax with some fantasy.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            column          3 comments       This Week in Games - Let's Talk About Kingdom Hearts   Apr 16, 07:53 3 comments                 games    Heidi speculates on wtf is going on in the new Kingdom Hearts game and holy crap Witch on the Holy Night is getting a Western release?! ― Hi folks.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide RPG Real Estate   Apr  7th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of RPG Real Estate ?                     Community score: 3.4              What is this?   Kotone is a mage who ends up working at a real estate agency in a fantasy world. Kotone helps various clients, from a necromancer to a guild receptionist raising a pegasus, find a place to call home.    RPG Real Estate is based on  Chiyo Kenmotsu's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Wednesdays.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis    Rating:                Oh look, a light-hearted anime about cute girls in a fantasy world running a real estate agency. As they eat food, meet people, and go on everyday adventures, the show pokes fun at RPG tropes like adventurers looting people's homes or the prevalence of bikini armor. The first episode even comes with a good moral for those in the service industry: listen to what the client wants, not what you think they'll want based on appearances.    But here's the thing about RPG Real Estate: it's not really a fantasy story despite its outward appearance. Rather, it's a social commentary on modern Japan. With the fantasy aspect stripped away, Kotone is just your average Japanese college graduate. She studied hard, graduated—and then gave up on her dreams and is moving to Tokyo to get a job that has nothing to do with what she studied. Upon arrival, her first challenge is finding an affordable place for an entry level (read: underpaid) worker in the most expensive city in the country.    Of course, all the places she can afford have some sort of terrible downside. One has a shared living space (where people are guaranteed to steal your stuff). Another is an ill-maintained high-rise that lacks an elevator. And, worst of all, the last apartment has *gasp* foreigner neighbors! Oh, you didn't catch that? Yeah, demi-humans are non-Japanese people in this fantasy analogy. They're look different, have “strange” customs, and don't speak the same language, after all.    I've lived in Japan for 17 years now and am on my sixth apartment. I can't count the number of places that wouldn't rent to me because I was a foreigner. (Many rental ads even go so far as to list “no foreigners” right along with “no pets” and “no musical instruments” in their rental requirements.) So I appreciate this anime has the inclusive message that having foreigner neighbors isn't a downside. Rather, the foreigners are seen as kind and welcoming. Heck, the real-estate agency even has a foreigner of their own, Fa, who can breach the language barrier—making RPG Real Estate a company that actively supports the city's foreigner population. (Though the fact that Fa is portrayed as a child due to her not understanding local customs [like the need for clothes] is a whole different can of worms.) But frankly, when it comes to Japan addressing their institutionalized xenophobia and speaking out against it, I'll take what I can get.      Nicholas Dupree    Rating:                Stop me if you've heard this one before: an adaptation of a Manga Time Kirara “Cute Girls” manga, featuring a handful of candy-colored anime girls who are ostensibly teenagers but look no older than 10, where they have low stakes comedic outings and occasionally wind up in fanservicey outfits. But what if I told you this time the cute girls were in a generic RPG fantasy world, and they occasionally made very tired jokes about the kinds of houses you see in fantasy settings? If that sounds like a good time, then you have far more patience than me for RPG Real Estate.    Watching this show felt like trying to eat a bag of dollar-store cotton candy as fast as possible. I feel mean for saying that after loving the equally saccharine Healer Girl and enjoying other low-stakes comedies like Aharen-san this season, but something in the execution here just doesn't work. The characters are too flat (no not like that) and simple to be entertaining in their own right, and the premise of an RPG Real Estate company wears thin surprisingly quickly. By the second house tour of the episode they aren't even really making RPG-specific gags about the houses anymore, and the entire humor of the premise starts feeling like an afterthought.    So okay, then this is maybe meant to be more of a workplace comedy, where the joke is that the girls are basically an adventuring party doing mundane paperwork and real estate things. But that only really works if the characters are funny or have good chemistry, and that's not the case here. Nobody's personality is very strong or memorable, and their conversations are pretty dull. The only one who stands out is Fa, the monster girl who exists somewhere between child and pet, and whose gimmick is she hates wearing clothes and is always trying to strip naked while at work. That's not a great joke, but I unfortunately remember it, and that qualifies her for the funniest thing in this premiere.    So without character-based humor or a unique hook, all that's really left is if you just want to watch these generic girls get shipteased together, and there's certainly plenty of that. Fa and Kotone share a bath together. Rakira gets blushy when Kotone calls her pretty, and her adventuring outfit is a tube top and mini-skirt combo with the show literally calling her an exhibitionist. At the end of the episode Rakira and Rufria sleep in the same bed so the latter can be “comforted” after a rough day at work. It's about as blatant as you can get, but without any personality and with the blobby artstyle, it all comes across like smacking plastic dolls together and making kissy sounds. But honestly even that sounds more engaging than watching another episode of this. I'm not immediately opposed to this style of show, but RPG Real Estate is too vacuous to work.       Rebecca Silverman   Rating:                If you've been waiting for you CGCT show, here it is! RPG Real Estate has all the hallmarks of a genre standby: women who all look impressively young, a bathing scene with soap bubble censorship, an adorable theme, and a little yuri bait. And really, I'm being unkind with the censorship statement, because while the bubbles are strategically placed, the bathing scene isn't meant to be particularly prurient, and it isn't really framed as such – it's really just Fa and Kotone taking a bath.    The concept is probably the best part of the episode. While it's a bit of a stretch that the real estate agency RPG is actually called “Rent Plan Guide Real Estate,” the way it functions is like a much more adorable Dragon Goes House-Hunting. The idea is that fifteen years after, for all intents and purposes, the game ended (i. e. world peace was achieved), the fantasy realm functions an awful lot like our boring old world, and that means that everyone needs a place to live. But there are still entertaining vestiges of the old sword-and-sorcery way of life that pop up, such as a house that's also a dungeon or one that requires you to just let adventurers to come in and riffle through your drawers and take your stuff as “loot.” There are also remnants of how the world used to work in that everyone still has classes that can be used if necessary – Kotone is a wizard, Rufuria is a priest, and Rakira is a warrior. But there are little bits of commentary on those scattered throughout the episode, with the standout moment being when Kotone sees Rakira in her warrior uniform – a bra top and short-shorts – and remarks that it doesn't appear to be quite enough armor to be of any use.    The story itself is mostly in the soothing and sweet vein, which certainly isn't a bad thing. The stakes are low-key, with the main plot of the episode revolving around finding homes for two people, with a little lesson about listening to what the customer actually wants as opposed to what you think they want thrown in. Fa runs the risk of being kind of annoying (although she has a real point about her tail making wearing clothes tailored for humans uncomfortable), but for the greater part this is pleasantly bright and gentle, which is absolutely not a terrible thing if you'd just like to relax with some fantasy.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            column          3 comments       This Week in Games - Let's Talk About Kingdom Hearts   Apr 16, 07:53 3 comments                 games    Heidi speculates on wtf is going on in the new Kingdom Hearts game and holy crap Witch on the Holy Night is getting a Western release?! ― Hi folks.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide RPG Real Estate   Apr  7th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of RPG Real Estate ?                     Community score: 3.4              What is this?   Kotone is a mage who ends up working at a real estate agency in a fantasy world. Kotone helps various clients, from a necromancer to a guild receptionist raising a pegasus, find a place to call home.    RPG Real Estate is based on  Chiyo Kenmotsu's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Wednesdays.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis    Rating:                Oh look, a light-hearted anime about cute girls in a fantasy world running a real estate agency. As they eat food, meet people, and go on everyday adventures, the show pokes fun at RPG tropes like adventurers looting people's homes or the prevalence of bikini armor. The first episode even comes with a good moral for those in the service industry: listen to what the client wants, not what you think they'll want based on appearances.    But here's the thing about RPG Real Estate: it's not really a fantasy story despite its outward appearance. Rather, it's a social commentary on modern Japan. With the fantasy aspect stripped away, Kotone is just your average Japanese college graduate. She studied hard, graduated—and then gave up on her dreams and is moving to Tokyo to get a job that has nothing to do with what she studied. Upon arrival, her first challenge is finding an affordable place for an entry level (read: underpaid) worker in the most expensive city in the country.    Of course, all the places she can afford have some sort of terrible downside. One has a shared living space (where people are guaranteed to steal your stuff). Another is an ill-maintained high-rise that lacks an elevator. And, worst of all, the last apartment has *gasp* foreigner neighbors! Oh, you didn't catch that? Yeah, demi-humans are non-Japanese people in this fantasy analogy. They're look different, have “strange” customs, and don't speak the same language, after all.    I've lived in Japan for 17 years now and am on my sixth apartment. I can't count the number of places that wouldn't rent to me because I was a foreigner. (Many rental ads even go so far as to list “no foreigners” right along with “no pets” and “no musical instruments” in their rental requirements.) So I appreciate this anime has the inclusive message that having foreigner neighbors isn't a downside. Rather, the foreigners are seen as kind and welcoming. Heck, the real-estate agency even has a foreigner of their own, Fa, who can breach the language barrier—making RPG Real Estate a company that actively supports the city's foreigner population. (Though the fact that Fa is portrayed as a child due to her not understanding local customs [like the need for clothes] is a whole different can of worms.) But frankly, when it comes to Japan addressing their institutionalized xenophobia and speaking out against it, I'll take what I can get.      Nicholas Dupree    Rating:                Stop me if you've heard this one before: an adaptation of a Manga Time Kirara “Cute Girls” manga, featuring a handful of candy-colored anime girls who are ostensibly teenagers but look no older than 10, where they have low stakes comedic outings and occasionally wind up in fanservicey outfits. But what if I told you this time the cute girls were in a generic RPG fantasy world, and they occasionally made very tired jokes about the kinds of houses you see in fantasy settings? If that sounds like a good time, then you have far more patience than me for RPG Real Estate.    Watching this show felt like trying to eat a bag of dollar-store cotton candy as fast as possible. I feel mean for saying that after loving the equally saccharine Healer Girl and enjoying other low-stakes comedies like Aharen-san this season, but something in the execution here just doesn't work. The characters are too flat (no not like that) and simple to be entertaining in their own right, and the premise of an RPG Real Estate company wears thin surprisingly quickly. By the second house tour of the episode they aren't even really making RPG-specific gags about the houses anymore, and the entire humor of the premise starts feeling like an afterthought.    So okay, then this is maybe meant to be more of a workplace comedy, where the joke is that the girls are basically an adventuring party doing mundane paperwork and real estate things. But that only really works if the characters are funny or have good chemistry, and that's not the case here. Nobody's personality is very strong or memorable, and their conversations are pretty dull. The only one who stands out is Fa, the monster girl who exists somewhere between child and pet, and whose gimmick is she hates wearing clothes and is always trying to strip naked while at work. That's not a great joke, but I unfortunately remember it, and that qualifies her for the funniest thing in this premiere.    So without character-based humor or a unique hook, all that's really left is if you just want to watch these generic girls get shipteased together, and there's certainly plenty of that. Fa and Kotone share a bath together. Rakira gets blushy when Kotone calls her pretty, and her adventuring outfit is a tube top and mini-skirt combo with the show literally calling her an exhibitionist. At the end of the episode Rakira and Rufria sleep in the same bed so the latter can be “comforted” after a rough day at work. It's about as blatant as you can get, but without any personality and with the blobby artstyle, it all comes across like smacking plastic dolls together and making kissy sounds. But honestly even that sounds more engaging than watching another episode of this. I'm not immediately opposed to this style of show, but RPG Real Estate is too vacuous to work.       Rebecca Silverman   Rating:                If you've been waiting for you CGCT show, here it is! RPG Real Estate has all the hallmarks of a genre standby: women who all look impressively young, a bathing scene with soap bubble censorship, an adorable theme, and a little yuri bait. And really, I'm being unkind with the censorship statement, because while the bubbles are strategically placed, the bathing scene isn't meant to be particularly prurient, and it isn't really framed as such – it's really just Fa and Kotone taking a bath.    The concept is probably the best part of the episode. While it's a bit of a stretch that the real estate agency RPG is actually called “Rent Plan Guide Real Estate,” the way it functions is like a much more adorable Dragon Goes House-Hunting. The idea is that fifteen years after, for all intents and purposes, the game ended (i. e. world peace was achieved), the fantasy realm functions an awful lot like our boring old world, and that means that everyone needs a place to live. But there are still entertaining vestiges of the old sword-and-sorcery way of life that pop up, such as a house that's also a dungeon or one that requires you to just let adventurers to come in and riffle through your drawers and take your stuff as “loot.” There are also remnants of how the world used to work in that everyone still has classes that can be used if necessary – Kotone is a wizard, Rufuria is a priest, and Rakira is a warrior. But there are little bits of commentary on those scattered throughout the episode, with the standout moment being when Kotone sees Rakira in her warrior uniform – a bra top and short-shorts – and remarks that it doesn't appear to be quite enough armor to be of any use.    The story itself is mostly in the soothing and sweet vein, which certainly isn't a bad thing. The stakes are low-key, with the main plot of the episode revolving around finding homes for two people, with a little lesson about listening to what the customer actually wants as opposed to what you think they want thrown in. Fa runs the risk of being kind of annoying (although she has a real point about her tail making wearing clothes tailored for humans uncomfortable), but for the greater part this is pleasantly bright and gentle, which is absolutely not a terrible thing if you'd just like to relax with some fantasy.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            column          3 comments       This Week in Games - Let's Talk About Kingdom Hearts   Apr 16, 07:53 3 comments                 games    Heidi speculates on wtf is going on in the new Kingdom Hearts game and holy crap Witch on the Holy Night is getting a Western release?! ― Hi folks.

But there are still entertaining vestiges of the old sword-and-sorcery way of life that pop up, such as a house that's also a dungeon or one that requires you to just let adventurers to come in and riffle through your drawers and take your stuff as “loot.” There are also remnants of how the world used to work in that everyone still has classes that can be used if necessary – Kotone is a wizard, Rufuria is a priest, and Rakira is a warrior. But there are little bits of commentary on those scattered throughout the episode, with the standout moment being when Kotone sees Rakira in her warrior uniform – a bra top and short-shorts – and remarks that it doesn't appear to be quite enough armor to be of any use.    The story itself is mostly in the soothing and sweet vein, which certainly isn't a bad thing. The stakes are low-key, with the main plot of the episode revolving around finding homes for two people, with a little lesson about listening to what the customer actually wants as opposed to what you think they want thrown in. Fa runs the risk of being kind of annoying (although she has a real point about her tail making wearing clothes tailored for humans uncomfortable), but for the greater part this is pleasantly bright and gentle, which is absolutely not a terrible thing if you'd just like to relax with some fantasy.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            column          3 comments       This Week in Games - Let's Talk About Kingdom Hearts   Apr 16, 07:53 3 comments                 games    Heidi speculates on wtf is going on in the new Kingdom Hearts game and holy crap Witch on the Holy Night is getting a Western release?! ― Hi folks.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide RPG Real Estate   Apr  7th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of RPG Real Estate ?                     Community score: 3.4              What is this?   Kotone is a mage who ends up working at a real estate agency in a fantasy world. Kotone helps various clients, from a necromancer to a guild receptionist raising a pegasus, find a place to call home.    RPG Real Estate is based on  Chiyo Kenmotsu's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Wednesdays.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis    Rating:                Oh look, a light-hearted anime about cute girls in a fantasy world running a real estate agency. As they eat food, meet people, and go on everyday adventures, the show pokes fun at RPG tropes like adventurers looting people's homes or the prevalence of bikini armor. The first episode even comes with a good moral for those in the service industry: listen to what the client wants, not what you think they'll want based on appearances.    But here's the thing about RPG Real Estate: it's not really a fantasy story despite its outward appearance. Rather, it's a social commentary on modern Japan. With the fantasy aspect stripped away, Kotone is just your average Japanese college graduate. She studied hard, graduated—and then gave up on her dreams and is moving to Tokyo to get a job that has nothing to do with what she studied. Upon arrival, her first challenge is finding an affordable place for an entry level (read: underpaid) worker in the most expensive city in the country.    Of course, all the places she can afford have some sort of terrible downside. One has a shared living space (where people are guaranteed to steal your stuff). Another is an ill-maintained high-rise that lacks an elevator. And, worst of all, the last apartment has *gasp* foreigner neighbors! Oh, you didn't catch that? Yeah, demi-humans are non-Japanese people in this fantasy analogy. They're look different, have “strange” customs, and don't speak the same language, after all.    I've lived in Japan for 17 years now and am on my sixth apartment. I can't count the number of places that wouldn't rent to me because I was a foreigner. (Many rental ads even go so far as to list “no foreigners” right along with “no pets” and “no musical instruments” in their rental requirements.) So I appreciate this anime has the inclusive message that having foreigner neighbors isn't a downside. Rather, the foreigners are seen as kind and welcoming. Heck, the real-estate agency even has a foreigner of their own, Fa, who can breach the language barrier—making RPG Real Estate a company that actively supports the city's foreigner population. (Though the fact that Fa is portrayed as a child due to her not understanding local customs [like the need for clothes] is a whole different can of worms.) But frankly, when it comes to Japan addressing their institutionalized xenophobia and speaking out against it, I'll take what I can get.      Nicholas Dupree    Rating:                Stop me if you've heard this one before: an adaptation of a Manga Time Kirara “Cute Girls” manga, featuring a handful of candy-colored anime girls who are ostensibly teenagers but look no older than 10, where they have low stakes comedic outings and occasionally wind up in fanservicey outfits. But what if I told you this time the cute girls were in a generic RPG fantasy world, and they occasionally made very tired jokes about the kinds of houses you see in fantasy settings? If that sounds like a good time, then you have far more patience than me for RPG Real Estate.    Watching this show felt like trying to eat a bag of dollar-store cotton candy as fast as possible. I feel mean for saying that after loving the equally saccharine Healer Girl and enjoying other low-stakes comedies like Aharen-san this season, but something in the execution here just doesn't work. The characters are too flat (no not like that) and simple to be entertaining in their own right, and the premise of an RPG Real Estate company wears thin surprisingly quickly. By the second house tour of the episode they aren't even really making RPG-specific gags about the houses anymore, and the entire humor of the premise starts feeling like an afterthought.    So okay, then this is maybe meant to be more of a workplace comedy, where the joke is that the girls are basically an adventuring party doing mundane paperwork and real estate things. But that only really works if the characters are funny or have good chemistry, and that's not the case here. Nobody's personality is very strong or memorable, and their conversations are pretty dull. The only one who stands out is Fa, the monster girl who exists somewhere between child and pet, and whose gimmick is she hates wearing clothes and is always trying to strip naked while at work. That's not a great joke, but I unfortunately remember it, and that qualifies her for the funniest thing in this premiere.    So without character-based humor or a unique hook, all that's really left is if you just want to watch these generic girls get shipteased together, and there's certainly plenty of that. Fa and Kotone share a bath together. Rakira gets blushy when Kotone calls her pretty, and her adventuring outfit is a tube top and mini-skirt combo with the show literally calling her an exhibitionist. At the end of the episode Rakira and Rufria sleep in the same bed so the latter can be “comforted” after a rough day at work. It's about as blatant as you can get, but without any personality and with the blobby artstyle, it all comes across like smacking plastic dolls together and making kissy sounds. But honestly even that sounds more engaging than watching another episode of this. I'm not immediately opposed to this style of show, but RPG Real Estate is too vacuous to work.       Rebecca Silverman   Rating:                If you've been waiting for you CGCT show, here it is! RPG Real Estate has all the hallmarks of a genre standby: women who all look impressively young, a bathing scene with soap bubble censorship, an adorable theme, and a little yuri bait. And really, I'm being unkind with the censorship statement, because while the bubbles are strategically placed, the bathing scene isn't meant to be particularly prurient, and it isn't really framed as such – it's really just Fa and Kotone taking a bath.    The concept is probably the best part of the episode. While it's a bit of a stretch that the real estate agency RPG is actually called “Rent Plan Guide Real Estate,” the way it functions is like a much more adorable Dragon Goes House-Hunting.

Community score: 3.4              What is this?   Kotone is a mage who ends up working at a real estate agency in a fantasy world. Kotone helps various clients, from a necromancer to a guild receptionist raising a pegasus, find a place to call home.    RPG Real Estate is based on  Chiyo Kenmotsu's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Wednesdays.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis    Rating:                Oh look, a light-hearted anime about cute girls in a fantasy world running a real estate agency. As they eat food, meet people, and go on everyday adventures, the show pokes fun at RPG tropes like adventurers looting people's homes or the prevalence of bikini armor. The first episode even comes with a good moral for those in the service industry: listen to what the client wants, not what you think they'll want based on appearances.    But here's the thing about RPG Real Estate: it's not really a fantasy story despite its outward appearance. Rather, it's a social commentary on modern Japan. With the fantasy aspect stripped away, Kotone is just your average Japanese college graduate. She studied hard, graduated—and then gave up on her dreams and is moving to Tokyo to get a job that has nothing to do with what she studied. Upon arrival, her first challenge is finding an affordable place for an entry level (read: underpaid) worker in the most expensive city in the country.    Of course, all the places she can afford have some sort of terrible downside. One has a shared living space (where people are guaranteed to steal your stuff). Another is an ill-maintained high-rise that lacks an elevator. And, worst of all, the last apartment has *gasp* foreigner neighbors! Oh, you didn't catch that? Yeah, demi-humans are non-Japanese people in this fantasy analogy. They're look different, have “strange” customs, and don't speak the same language, after all.    I've lived in Japan for 17 years now and am on my sixth apartment. I can't count the number of places that wouldn't rent to me because I was a foreigner. (Many rental ads even go so far as to list “no foreigners” right along with “no pets” and “no musical instruments” in their rental requirements.) So I appreciate this anime has the inclusive message that having foreigner neighbors isn't a downside. Rather, the foreigners are seen as kind and welcoming. Heck, the real-estate agency even has a foreigner of their own, Fa, who can breach the language barrier—making RPG Real Estate a company that actively supports the city's foreigner population. (Though the fact that Fa is portrayed as a child due to her not understanding local customs [like the need for clothes] is a whole different can of worms.) But frankly, when it comes to Japan addressing their institutionalized xenophobia and speaking out against it, I'll take what I can get.      Nicholas Dupree    Rating:                Stop me if you've heard this one before: an adaptation of a Manga Time Kirara “Cute Girls” manga, featuring a handful of candy-colored anime girls who are ostensibly teenagers but look no older than 10, where they have low stakes comedic outings and occasionally wind up in fanservicey outfits. But what if I told you this time the cute girls were in a generic RPG fantasy world, and they occasionally made very tired jokes about the kinds of houses you see in fantasy settings? If that sounds like a good time, then you have far more patience than me for RPG Real Estate.    Watching this show felt like trying to eat a bag of dollar-store cotton candy as fast as possible. I feel mean for saying that after loving the equally saccharine Healer Girl and enjoying other low-stakes comedies like Aharen-san this season, but something in the execution here just doesn't work. The characters are too flat (no not like that) and simple to be entertaining in their own right, and the premise of an RPG Real Estate company wears thin surprisingly quickly. By the second house tour of the episode they aren't even really making RPG-specific gags about the houses anymore, and the entire humor of the premise starts feeling like an afterthought.    So okay, then this is maybe meant to be more of a workplace comedy, where the joke is that the girls are basically an adventuring party doing mundane paperwork and real estate things. But that only really works if the characters are funny or have good chemistry, and that's not the case here. Nobody's personality is very strong or memorable, and their conversations are pretty dull. The only one who stands out is Fa, the monster girl who exists somewhere between child and pet, and whose gimmick is she hates wearing clothes and is always trying to strip naked while at work. That's not a great joke, but I unfortunately remember it, and that qualifies her for the funniest thing in this premiere.    So without character-based humor or a unique hook, all that's really left is if you just want to watch these generic girls get shipteased together, and there's certainly plenty of that. Fa and Kotone share a bath together. Rakira gets blushy when Kotone calls her pretty, and her adventuring outfit is a tube top and mini-skirt combo with the show literally calling her an exhibitionist. At the end of the episode Rakira and Rufria sleep in the same bed so the latter can be “comforted” after a rough day at work. It's about as blatant as you can get, but without any personality and with the blobby artstyle, it all comes across like smacking plastic dolls together and making kissy sounds. But honestly even that sounds more engaging than watching another episode of this. I'm not immediately opposed to this style of show, but RPG Real Estate is too vacuous to work.       Rebecca Silverman   Rating:                If you've been waiting for you CGCT show, here it is! RPG Real Estate has all the hallmarks of a genre standby: women who all look impressively young, a bathing scene with soap bubble censorship, an adorable theme, and a little yuri bait. And really, I'm being unkind with the censorship statement, because while the bubbles are strategically placed, the bathing scene isn't meant to be particularly prurient, and it isn't really framed as such – it's really just Fa and Kotone taking a bath.    The concept is probably the best part of the episode. While it's a bit of a stretch that the real estate agency RPG is actually called “Rent Plan Guide Real Estate,” the way it functions is like a much more adorable Dragon Goes House-Hunting. The idea is that fifteen years after, for all intents and purposes, the game ended (i. e. world peace was achieved), the fantasy realm functions an awful lot like our boring old world, and that means that everyone needs a place to live. But there are still entertaining vestiges of the old sword-and-sorcery way of life that pop up, such as a house that's also a dungeon or one that requires you to just let adventurers to come in and riffle through your drawers and take your stuff as “loot.” There are also remnants of how the world used to work in that everyone still has classes that can be used if necessary – Kotone is a wizard, Rufuria is a priest, and Rakira is a warrior. But there are little bits of commentary on those scattered throughout the episode, with the standout moment being when Kotone sees Rakira in her warrior uniform – a bra top and short-shorts – and remarks that it doesn't appear to be quite enough armor to be of any use.    The story itself is mostly in the soothing and sweet vein, which certainly isn't a bad thing. The stakes are low-key, with the main plot of the episode revolving around finding homes for two people, with a little lesson about listening to what the customer actually wants as opposed to what you think they want thrown in.

By the second house tour of the episode they aren't even really making RPG-specific gags about the houses anymore, and the entire humor of the premise starts feeling like an afterthought.    So okay, then this is maybe meant to be more of a workplace comedy, where the joke is that the girls are basically an adventuring party doing mundane paperwork and real estate things. But that only really works if the characters are funny or have good chemistry, and that's not the case here. Nobody's personality is very strong or memorable, and their conversations are pretty dull. The only one who stands out is Fa, the monster girl who exists somewhere between child and pet, and whose gimmick is she hates wearing clothes and is always trying to strip naked while at work. That's not a great joke, but I unfortunately remember it, and that qualifies her for the funniest thing in this premiere.    So without character-based humor or a unique hook, all that's really left is if you just want to watch these generic girls get shipteased together, and there's certainly plenty of that. Fa and Kotone share a bath together. Rakira gets blushy when Kotone calls her pretty, and her adventuring outfit is a tube top and mini-skirt combo with the show literally calling her an exhibitionist. At the end of the episode Rakira and Rufria sleep in the same bed so the latter can be “comforted” after a rough day at work. It's about as blatant as you can get, but without any personality and with the blobby artstyle, it all comes across like smacking plastic dolls together and making kissy sounds. But honestly even that sounds more engaging than watching another episode of this. I'm not immediately opposed to this style of show, but RPG Real Estate is too vacuous to work.       Rebecca Silverman   Rating:                If you've been waiting for you CGCT show, here it is! RPG Real Estate has all the hallmarks of a genre standby: women who all look impressively young, a bathing scene with soap bubble censorship, an adorable theme, and a little yuri bait. And really, I'm being unkind with the censorship statement, because while the bubbles are strategically placed, the bathing scene isn't meant to be particularly prurient, and it isn't really framed as such – it's really just Fa and Kotone taking a bath.    The concept is probably the best part of the episode. While it's a bit of a stretch that the real estate agency RPG is actually called “Rent Plan Guide Real Estate,” the way it functions is like a much more adorable Dragon Goes House-Hunting. The idea is that fifteen years after, for all intents and purposes, the game ended (i. e. world peace was achieved), the fantasy realm functions an awful lot like our boring old world, and that means that everyone needs a place to live. But there are still entertaining vestiges of the old sword-and-sorcery way of life that pop up, such as a house that's also a dungeon or one that requires you to just let adventurers to come in and riffle through your drawers and take your stuff as “loot.” There are also remnants of how the world used to work in that everyone still has classes that can be used if necessary – Kotone is a wizard, Rufuria is a priest, and Rakira is a warrior. But there are little bits of commentary on those scattered throughout the episode, with the standout moment being when Kotone sees Rakira in her warrior uniform – a bra top and short-shorts – and remarks that it doesn't appear to be quite enough armor to be of any use.    The story itself is mostly in the soothing and sweet vein, which certainly isn't a bad thing. The stakes are low-key, with the main plot of the episode revolving around finding homes for two people, with a little lesson about listening to what the customer actually wants as opposed to what you think they want thrown in. Fa runs the risk of being kind of annoying (although she has a real point about her tail making wearing clothes tailored for humans uncomfortable), but for the greater part this is pleasantly bright and gentle, which is absolutely not a terrible thing if you'd just like to relax with some fantasy.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives   ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 3.4              What is this?   Kotone is a mage who ends up working at a real estate agency in a fantasy world. Kotone helps various clients, from a necromancer to a guild receptionist raising a pegasus, find a place to call home.    RPG Real Estate is based on  Chiyo Kenmotsu's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Wednesdays.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis    Rating:                Oh look, a light-hearted anime about cute girls in a fantasy world running a real estate agency. As they eat food, meet people, and go on everyday adventures, the show pokes fun at RPG tropes like adventurers looting people's homes or the prevalence of bikini armor. The first episode even comes with a good moral for those in the service industry: listen to what the client wants, not what you think they'll want based on appearances.    But here's the thing about RPG Real Estate: it's not really a fantasy story despite its outward appearance. Rather, it's a social commentary on modern Japan. With the fantasy aspect stripped away, Kotone is just your average Japanese college graduate. She studied hard, graduated—and then gave up on her dreams and is moving to Tokyo to get a job that has nothing to do with what she studied. Upon arrival, her first challenge is finding an affordable place for an entry level (read: underpaid) worker in the most expensive city in the country.    Of course, all the places she can afford have some sort of terrible downside. One has a shared living space (where people are guaranteed to steal your stuff). Another is an ill-maintained high-rise that lacks an elevator. And, worst of all, the last apartment has *gasp* foreigner neighbors! Oh, you didn't catch that? Yeah, demi-humans are non-Japanese people in this fantasy analogy. They're look different, have “strange” customs, and don't speak the same language, after all.    I've lived in Japan for 17 years now and am on my sixth apartment. I can't count the number of places that wouldn't rent to me because I was a foreigner. (Many rental ads even go so far as to list “no foreigners” right along with “no pets” and “no musical instruments” in their rental requirements.) So I appreciate this anime has the inclusive message that having foreigner neighbors isn't a downside. Rather, the foreigners are seen as kind and welcoming. Heck, the real-estate agency even has a foreigner of their own, Fa, who can breach the language barrier—making RPG Real Estate a company that actively supports the city's foreigner population. (Though the fact that Fa is portrayed as a child due to her not understanding local customs [like the need for clothes] is a whole different can of worms.) But frankly, when it comes to Japan addressing their institutionalized xenophobia and speaking out against it, I'll take what I can get.      Nicholas Dupree    Rating:                Stop me if you've heard this one before: an adaptation of a Manga Time Kirara “Cute Girls” manga, featuring a handful of candy-colored anime girls who are ostensibly teenagers but look no older than 10, where they have low stakes comedic outings and occasionally wind up in fanservicey outfits. But what if I told you this time the cute girls were in a generic RPG fantasy world, and they occasionally made very tired jokes about the kinds of houses you see in fantasy settings? If that sounds like a good time, then you have far more patience than me for RPG Real Estate.    Watching this show felt like trying to eat a bag of dollar-store cotton candy as fast as possible. I feel mean for saying that after loving the equally saccharine Healer Girl and enjoying other low-stakes comedies like Aharen-san this season, but something in the execution here just doesn't work.

News Live-Action xxxHOLiC Film's Clip Shows Surprisingly Ordinary Spring Day   posted on 2022-04-14 17:36 UTC-8 by Egan Loo         Watanuki, Doumeki, Himawari share bentō lunches in scene from April 29 film    The official website for Shochiku and ASMIK Ace's live-action film of CLAMP's xxxHOLiC manga posted a new clip from the film titled ""Haru no Nakayoshi 3-nin-gumi"" (Three Pals in Spring) on Thursday. The video shows Watanuki — a high school boy who once spent a solitary life because he can see spirits — letting his guard down and spending a surprisingly ordinary spring day with Shizuka Doumeki and Himawari Kunogi (complete with bentō box lunches he made for everyone).       The original xxxHOLiC manga's story follows Yuuko — a witch who grants people's wishes, but in return the person has to give up something precious — and Kimihiro Watanuki, a man who has visions. One day, Watanuki encounters Yuuko and she promises to get rid of the spirits that torment him. In return Watanuki must work in Yuuko's shop and help her grant other people's wishes.    Ryunosuke Kamiki (left in visual right) plays Kimihiro Watanuki, while Kou Shibasaki (right) plays Yuuko Ichihara.    Other cast members include:     Hokuto Matsumura as Shizuka Doumeki   Tina Tamashiro as Himawari Kunogi   Daoko as Marudashi ""Maru""   Serena Motola as Morodashi ""Moro""   Shuri as Misaki   Nanase Nishino as Nekomusume   Sakurako Ōhara as a guest who is possessed by an ayakashi   Tenchim as a customer at Yuuko's shop who wants her wish granted  Ai Hashimoto as a Zashiki-Warashi spirit in love   Riho Yoshioka as Jorо̄gumo  Hayato Isomura as Akagumo, a movie-original character    Mika Ninagawa (live-action Sakuran, Helter Skelter) is directing the film, with a script by Erika Yoshida. Keiichirō Shibuya is composing the musical soundtrack. The band SEKAI NO OWARI performs the theme song ""Habit.""    The film will open in Japan on April 29.    CLAMP serialized the original xxxHOLiC manga in Kodansha's Weekly Young Magazine and Bessatsu Shōnen Magazine from 2003 to 2011, although it was renamed xxxHOLiC: Rō in 2009. xxxHOLiC: Rei is the latest manga, which launched in 2013 (but is currently on hiatus, although CLAMP stated earlier this month that the group is still planning to continue the manga). The franchise spawned an anime film, two television anime seasons, and several original video anime projects.    The manga inspired a stage play adaptation that ran in Tokyo and Kyoto in September and October.

News Live-Action xxxHOLiC Film's Clip Shows Surprisingly Ordinary Spring Day   posted on 2022-04-14 17:36 UTC-8 by Egan Loo         Watanuki, Doumeki, Himawari share bentō lunches in scene from April 29 film    The official website for Shochiku and ASMIK Ace's live-action film of CLAMP's xxxHOLiC manga posted a new clip from the film titled ""Haru no Nakayoshi 3-nin-gumi"" (Three Pals in Spring) on Thursday. The video shows Watanuki — a high school boy who once spent a solitary life because he can see spirits — letting his guard down and spending a surprisingly ordinary spring day with Shizuka Doumeki and Himawari Kunogi (complete with bentō box lunches he made for everyone).       The original xxxHOLiC manga's story follows Yuuko — a witch who grants people's wishes, but in return the person has to give up something precious — and Kimihiro Watanuki, a man who has visions. One day, Watanuki encounters Yuuko and she promises to get rid of the spirits that torment him. In return Watanuki must work in Yuuko's shop and help her grant other people's wishes.    Ryunosuke Kamiki (left in visual right) plays Kimihiro Watanuki, while Kou Shibasaki (right) plays Yuuko Ichihara.    Other cast members include:     Hokuto Matsumura as Shizuka Doumeki   Tina Tamashiro as Himawari Kunogi   Daoko as Marudashi ""Maru""   Serena Motola as Morodashi ""Moro""   Shuri as Misaki   Nanase Nishino as Nekomusume   Sakurako Ōhara as a guest who is possessed by an ayakashi   Tenchim as a customer at Yuuko's shop who wants her wish granted  Ai Hashimoto as a Zashiki-Warashi spirit in love   Riho Yoshioka as Jorо̄gumo  Hayato Isomura as Akagumo, a movie-original character    Mika Ninagawa (live-action Sakuran, Helter Skelter) is directing the film, with a script by Erika Yoshida. Keiichirō Shibuya is composing the musical soundtrack. The band SEKAI NO OWARI performs the theme song ""Habit.""    The film will open in Japan on April 29.    CLAMP serialized the original xxxHOLiC manga in Kodansha's Weekly Young Magazine and Bessatsu Shōnen Magazine from 2003 to 2011, although it was renamed xxxHOLiC: Rō in 2009. xxxHOLiC: Rei is the latest manga, which launched in 2013 (but is currently on hiatus, although CLAMP stated earlier this month that the group is still planning to continue the manga). The franchise spawned an anime film, two television anime seasons, and several original video anime projects.    The manga inspired a stage play adaptation that ran in Tokyo and Kyoto in September and October.

News Live-Action xxxHOLiC Film's Clip Shows Surprisingly Ordinary Spring Day   posted on 2022-04-14 17:36 UTC-8 by Egan Loo         Watanuki, Doumeki, Himawari share bentō lunches in scene from April 29 film    The official website for Shochiku and ASMIK Ace's live-action film of CLAMP's xxxHOLiC manga posted a new clip from the film titled ""Haru no Nakayoshi 3-nin-gumi"" (Three Pals in Spring) on Thursday. The video shows Watanuki — a high school boy who once spent a solitary life because he can see spirits — letting his guard down and spending a surprisingly ordinary spring day with Shizuka Doumeki and Himawari Kunogi (complete with bentō box lunches he made for everyone).       The original xxxHOLiC manga's story follows Yuuko — a witch who grants people's wishes, but in return the person has to give up something precious — and Kimihiro Watanuki, a man who has visions. One day, Watanuki encounters Yuuko and she promises to get rid of the spirits that torment him. In return Watanuki must work in Yuuko's shop and help her grant other people's wishes.    Ryunosuke Kamiki (left in visual right) plays Kimihiro Watanuki, while Kou Shibasaki (right) plays Yuuko Ichihara.    Other cast members include:     Hokuto Matsumura as Shizuka Doumeki   Tina Tamashiro as Himawari Kunogi   Daoko as Marudashi ""Maru""   Serena Motola as Morodashi ""Moro""   Shuri as Misaki   Nanase Nishino as Nekomusume   Sakurako Ōhara as a guest who is possessed by an ayakashi   Tenchim as a customer at Yuuko's shop who wants her wish granted  Ai Hashimoto as a Zashiki-Warashi spirit in love   Riho Yoshioka as Jorо̄gumo  Hayato Isomura as Akagumo, a movie-original character    Mika Ninagawa (live-action Sakuran, Helter Skelter) is directing the film, with a script by Erika Yoshida. Keiichirō Shibuya is composing the musical soundtrack. The band SEKAI NO OWARI performs the theme song ""Habit.""    The film will open in Japan on April 29.    CLAMP serialized the original xxxHOLiC manga in Kodansha's Weekly Young Magazine and Bessatsu Shōnen Magazine from 2003 to 2011, although it was renamed xxxHOLiC: Rō in 2009. xxxHOLiC: Rei is the latest manga, which launched in 2013 (but is currently on hiatus, although CLAMP stated earlier this month that the group is still planning to continue the manga). The franchise spawned an anime film, two television anime seasons, and several original video anime projects.    The manga inspired a stage play adaptation that ran in Tokyo and Kyoto in September and October.

The video shows Watanuki — a high school boy who once spent a solitary life because he can see spirits — letting his guard down and spending a surprisingly ordinary spring day with Shizuka Doumeki and Himawari Kunogi (complete with bentō box lunches he made for everyone).       The original xxxHOLiC manga's story follows Yuuko — a witch who grants people's wishes, but in return the person has to give up something precious — and Kimihiro Watanuki, a man who has visions. One day, Watanuki encounters Yuuko and she promises to get rid of the spirits that torment him. In return Watanuki must work in Yuuko's shop and help her grant other people's wishes.    Ryunosuke Kamiki (left in visual right) plays Kimihiro Watanuki, while Kou Shibasaki (right) plays Yuuko Ichihara.

CLAMP serialized the original xxxHOLiC manga in Kodansha's Weekly Young Magazine and Bessatsu Shōnen Magazine from 2003 to 2011, although it was renamed xxxHOLiC: Rō in 2009. xxxHOLiC: Rei is the latest manga, which launched in 2013 (but is currently on hiatus, although CLAMP stated earlier this month that the group is still planning to continue the manga). The franchise spawned an anime film, two television anime seasons, and several original video anime projects.

The video shows Watanuki — a high school boy who once spent a solitary life because he can see spirits — letting his guard down and spending a surprisingly ordinary spring day with Shizuka Doumeki and Himawari Kunogi (complete with bentō box lunches he made for everyone).       The original xxxHOLiC manga's story follows Yuuko — a witch who grants people's wishes, but in return the person has to give up something precious — and Kimihiro Watanuki, a man who has visions. One day, Watanuki encounters Yuuko and she promises to get rid of the spirits that torment him. In return Watanuki must work in Yuuko's shop and help her grant other people's wishes.    Ryunosuke Kamiki (left in visual right) plays Kimihiro Watanuki, while Kou Shibasaki (right) plays Yuuko Ichihara.

Keiichirō Shibuya is composing the musical soundtrack. The band SEKAI NO OWARI performs the theme song ""Habit.""    The film will open in Japan on April 29.    CLAMP serialized the original xxxHOLiC manga in Kodansha's Weekly Young Magazine and Bessatsu Shōnen Magazine from 2003 to 2011, although it was renamed xxxHOLiC: Rō in 2009. xxxHOLiC: Rei is the latest manga, which launched in 2013 (but is currently on hiatus, although CLAMP stated earlier this month that the group is still planning to continue the manga). The franchise spawned an anime film, two television anime seasons, and several original video anime projects.    The manga inspired a stage play adaptation that ran in Tokyo and Kyoto in September and October.

Interest Crayon Shin-Chan Deodorant Ad Claims To Cure Hiroshi's Smelly Feet   posted on 2022-04-15 21:45 UTC-8 by Kim Morrissy         Perhaps the highest endorsement possible for a hygiene product    A new Crayon Shin-chan animated ad is selling Nivea-Kao's 8x4 Men Deodorant Body Wash with perhaps the highest endorsement possible for a hygiene product: it can even cure Hiroshi's smelly feet.      Shin-chan's father is legendary for his smelly feet, and has even used it as a weapon on occasion, but it is apparently no match against proper men's deodorant. Nivea-Kao Japan began streaming the ad on Thursday, and it will play during the upcoming Shin-chan episode on Saturday.     Additionally, a billboard ad featuring a suave Hiroshi will display at Saitama's Kasukabe station, where the series is set, from April 18 to 24.

Interest Crayon Shin-Chan Deodorant Ad Claims To Cure Hiroshi's Smelly Feet   posted on 2022-04-15 21:45 UTC-8 by Kim Morrissy         Perhaps the highest endorsement possible for a hygiene product    A new Crayon Shin-chan animated ad is selling Nivea-Kao's 8x4 Men Deodorant Body Wash with perhaps the highest endorsement possible for a hygiene product: it can even cure Hiroshi's smelly feet.      Shin-chan's father is legendary for his smelly feet, and has even used it as a weapon on occasion, but it is apparently no match against proper men's deodorant. Nivea-Kao Japan began streaming the ad on Thursday, and it will play during the upcoming Shin-chan episode on Saturday.     Additionally, a billboard ad featuring a suave Hiroshi will display at Saitama's Kasukabe station, where the series is set, from April 18 to 24.

Interest Crayon Shin-Chan Deodorant Ad Claims To Cure Hiroshi's Smelly Feet   posted on 2022-04-15 21:45 UTC-8 by Kim Morrissy         Perhaps the highest endorsement possible for a hygiene product    A new Crayon Shin-chan animated ad is selling Nivea-Kao's 8x4 Men Deodorant Body Wash with perhaps the highest endorsement possible for a hygiene product: it can even cure Hiroshi's smelly feet.      Shin-chan's father is legendary for his smelly feet, and has even used it as a weapon on occasion, but it is apparently no match against proper men's deodorant. Nivea-Kao Japan began streaming the ad on Thursday, and it will play during the upcoming Shin-chan episode on Saturday.     Additionally, a billboard ad featuring a suave Hiroshi will display at Saitama's Kasukabe station, where the series is set, from April 18 to 24.

STEAM® PAGE – LINK LAUNCH TRAILER – LINK  The bundle edition with “Project Winter” (Other Ocean Interactive) is 10% off now. Don't miss this opportunity! *The information is subject to change.  CRIMESIGHT is currently available for SRP $19.99 on Steam®. Players can also purchase a Deluxe Bundle that includes CRIMESIGHT, the original soundtrack and a total of 144 in-game icons for SRP $29.99.

CRIMESIGHT will be available globally and will support 11 languages – Japanese, English, Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional), Korean, French, German, Italian, Russian, Spanish (Spain – Spanish) and Portuguese (Brazil-Portuguese).  About CRIMESIGHT London, 2075. A cutting-edge predictive system called Foresight AI is developed to predict future crimes based on network data. As a result, crime is reduced by 90% worldwide. However, the system soon predicts an unavoidable incident, one that could steer the world on the path to ruin. Fearing the worst, Foresight AI's developers craft a new artificial intelligence that can track down and solve the most heinous of crimes before they occur. They dub this AI ""Sherlock"", after the peerless detective of classic literature. As it works on several cases, Sherlock discovers a harrowing truth: Sitting at the center of these cases like a spider on a web is Moriarty, an AI that rivals Sherlock's capabilities.  CRIMESIGHT pits players against one another as one assumes the role of the ""villain"", who carries out a murder, and another becomes the ""target"", the villain's future victim. The player on the Moriarty side must fulfill objectives to complete their crime, whilst the players on the Sherlock side must prevent it from happening. Over the course of a match, the villain and the target will slowly come to light. Which side will you take?

CRIMESIGHT is currently available for SRP $19.99 on Steam®. Players can also purchase a Deluxe Bundle that includes CRIMESIGHT, the original soundtrack and a total of 144 in-game icons for SRP $29.99.

CRIMESIGHT will be available globally and will support 11 languages – Japanese, English, Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional), Korean, French, German, Italian, Russian, Spanish (Spain – Spanish) and Portuguese (Brazil-Portuguese).  About CRIMESIGHT London, 2075. A cutting-edge predictive system called Foresight AI is developed to predict future crimes based on network data. As a result, crime is reduced by 90% worldwide. However, the system soon predicts an unavoidable incident, one that could steer the world on the path to ruin. Fearing the worst, Foresight AI's developers craft a new artificial intelligence that can track down and solve the most heinous of crimes before they occur. They dub this AI ""Sherlock"", after the peerless detective of classic literature. As it works on several cases, Sherlock discovers a harrowing truth: Sitting at the center of these cases like a spider on a web is Moriarty, an AI that rivals Sherlock's capabilities.  CRIMESIGHT pits players against one another as one assumes the role of the ""villain"", who carries out a murder, and another becomes the ""target"", the villain's future victim. The player on the Moriarty side must fulfill objectives to complete their crime, whilst the players on the Sherlock side must prevent it from happening. Over the course of a match, the villain and the target will slowly come to light. Which side will you take?

CRIMESIGHT is currently available for SRP $19.99 on Steam®. Players can also purchase a Deluxe Bundle that includes CRIMESIGHT, the original soundtrack and a total of 144 in-game icons for SRP $29.99. These bonus items can also be purchased separately as DLC.  CRIMESIGHT will be available globally and will support 11 languages – Japanese, English, Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional), Korean, French, German, Italian, Russian, Spanish (Spain – Spanish) and Portuguese (Brazil-Portuguese).  About CRIMESIGHT London, 2075. A cutting-edge predictive system called Foresight AI is developed to predict future crimes based on network data. As a result, crime is reduced by 90% worldwide. However, the system soon predicts an unavoidable incident, one that could steer the world on the path to ruin. Fearing the worst, Foresight AI's developers craft a new artificial intelligence that can track down and solve the most heinous of crimes before they occur. They dub this AI ""Sherlock"", after the peerless detective of classic literature. As it works on several cases, Sherlock discovers a harrowing truth: Sitting at the center of these cases like a spider on a web is Moriarty, an AI that rivals Sherlock's capabilities.  CRIMESIGHT pits players against one another as one assumes the role of the ""villain"", who carries out a murder, and another becomes the ""target"", the villain's future victim. The player on the Moriarty side must fulfill objectives to complete their crime, whilst the players on the Sherlock side must prevent it from happening. Over the course of a match, the villain and the target will slowly come to light. Which side will you take?
