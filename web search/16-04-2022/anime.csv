With its sparkling gold color, the compact has a high class feel to it, and it’s nicely sized with a diameter of 7 centimeters and thickness of 2.5 centimeters, making it small, low profile, and great for keeping in a pouch on the go. Its design captures all of the main details with a crescent moon on the upper lid and stones based on the five main Pretty Guardians (Sailor Moon, Sailor Mercury, Sailor Mars, Sailor Jupiter, and Sailor Venus).There are four eyeshadow colors carefully chosen in combinations that are great for both everyday use and special occasions. The red pearl color can even be used as blush, giving this single compact a wide variety of uses.The eyeshadows use synthetic mica, allowing it to cover dullness caused by sweat or sebum while adding beautiful color. The powder was made using a wet manufacturing process, so it’s possible to mix it with semi-solid oils, and it will stay firmly on your skin.

Pre-orders opened on on Premium Bandai on Jan. 20 at 1:00 pm. ■ About the EyeshadowThe eyeshadow is based on the Transformation Brooch Sailor Moon uses to transform in the anime Sailor Moon. With its sparkling gold color, the compact has a high class feel to it, and it’s nicely sized with a diameter of 7 centimeters and thickness of 2.5 centimeters, making it small, low profile, and great for keeping in a pouch on the go. Its design captures all of the main details with a crescent moon on the upper lid and stones based on the five main Pretty Guardians (Sailor Moon, Sailor Mercury, Sailor Mars, Sailor Jupiter, and Sailor Venus).There are four eyeshadow colors carefully chosen in combinations that are great for both everyday use and special occasions. The red pearl color can even be used as blush, giving this single compact a wide variety of uses.The eyeshadows use synthetic mica, allowing it to cover dullness caused by sweat or sebum while adding beautiful color. The powder was made using a wet manufacturing process, so it’s possible to mix it with semi-solid oils, and it will stay firmly on your skin. Fruit extract, apricot seed extract, peach leaf extract, and okra extract were also used as moisturizing ingredients.The Miracle Romance Make-Up Flat-Style Eyeshadow is both cute and thoughtfully developed, and in the name of the moon, it’ll let you perform your very own powerful “Make Up!” transformation! ■ Product Details・Name: Miracle Romance Make-Up Flat-Style Eyeshadow・Price: ¥4,212 (tax included, shipping and handling separate)・Target Age: 15 and older・Set Contents: Eyeshadow (4 colors), applicator, loose powder tray・Dimensions (approx.): 70 x 25 mm・Materials:　- Container: ABS, AS, PMMA　- Mirror: Glass　- Applicator: AS, PUR　- Box: Paper　- Loose Powder Tray: PET・Manufacturing Countries:　- Container/Loose Powder Tray/Applicator: China　- Eyeshadow: Japan・Available Through: Premium Bandai, Otona Joshi Biyori shops, and more・Pre-Order Period: Jan. 20 (Fri.) at 1:00 pm while supplies last・Estimated Release: March 2017©Naoko Takeuchi, PNP, Toei Animation©Naoko TakeuchiSource: @Press",positive,,"{'https://otakumode.com/news': 2, 'https://otakumode.com/': 1, 'https://otakumode.com/shop': 1, 'https://otakumode.com/gallery': 1, 'https://otakumode.com/otapedia': 1, 'https://otakumode.com/login?r=/news/588174cf9f56d66052b6979e/Sailor-Moon-Transformation-Brooch-Recreated-as-Eyeshadow-Compact!&via=header': 1, 'https://otakumode.com/signup?r=/news/588174cf9f56d66052b6979e/Sailor-Moon-Transformation-Brooch-Recreated-as-Eyeshadow-Compact!&via=header': 1, 'https://otakumode.com/news/featured': 1, 'https://otakumode.com/news/anime': 1, 'https://otakumode.com/news/manga': 1, 'https://otakumode.com/news/movie': 1, 'https://otakumode.com/news/event': 1, 'https://otakumode.com/news/figure': 1, 'https://otakumode.com/news/art': 1, 'https://otakumode.com/news/cosplay': 1, 'https://otakumode.com/news/japan': 1, 'https://otakumode.com/news/how_to': 1, 'https://otakumode.com/news/fashion': 1, 'https://otakumode.com/news/product': 1, 'https://otakumode.com/news/game': 1, 'https://otakumode.com/news/music': 1, 'https://otakumode.com/news/press_release': 1, 'http://p-bandai.jp/item/item-1000110362/?rt=pr': 2, 'http://p-bandai.jp/?rt=pr': 2, 'https://www.atpress.ne.jp/news/119953': 1, 'https://otakumode.com/fb/8iy': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/tokyootakumode': 1, 'https://twitter.com/TokyoOtakuMode': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/tokyootakumode/': 1, 'https://corporate.otakumode.com/': 1, 'http://myanimelist.net/?_location=tom_footer': 1, 'http://blog.honeyfeed.fm/': 1, 'https://animeanime.global/': 1}"

The ground-breaking, 4-episode Original Video Animation (OVA) struck a chord with audiences worldwide with its blazingly fast dogfighting in detail that had never been seen in anime before. On December 14, “MACROSS” finally comes to U.S. cinemas with, “MACROSS PLUS MOVIE EDITION,” which adds all-new animated scenes never seen in the OVA, streamlines the storyline, and creates a more focused and action-packed viewing experience. In addition to the feature, attendees will view an exclusive special interview with creator/chief director Shoji Kawamori (“Macross,” “Aquarion,” “Escaflowne”).Tickets for “MACROSS PLUS MOVIE EDITION” can be purchased at www.FathomEvents.com or participating theater box offices. For a complete list of theater locations, visit the Fathom Events website (theater locations are subject to change).Combining the intricate designs of Shoji Kawamori, character direction from Shinichiro Watanabe (“Cowboy Bebop”), and the musical stylings of renown composer Yoko Kanno (“Cowboy Bebop,” “Ghost in The Shell: SAC”), “MACROSS PLUS MOVIE EDITION” takes place in the year 2040 A.D., three decades after the glassing of Earth in what has since become known as Space War One. On the colonial planet of Eden, U.N. SPACY is testing transformable variable fighters to counter further alien attacks. Two prototype aircraft piloted by former childhood friends, loose cannon Isamu and the Zentradi mixed alien race Guld, go head-to-head in aerial and robot combat superiority over a lucrative military contract, and the affections of mutual love interest Myung. “We’re excited to partner with BIGWEST to finally bring ‘MACROSS PLUS MOVIE EDITION’ to anime fans nationwide,” said Daren Miller, Fathom Events VP, Programming, Strategy & Business Affairs. “For everyone that thinks ‘Top Gun’ is exciting but would be better with Maverick and Iceman piloting robots, this one is for you.”For artwork/photos related to “MACROSS PLUS MOVIE EDITION” visit the Fathom Events press site.

The ground-breaking, 4-episode Original Video Animation (OVA) struck a chord with audiences worldwide with its blazingly fast dogfighting in detail that had never been seen in anime before. On December 14, “MACROSS” finally comes to U.S. cinemas with, “MACROSS PLUS MOVIE EDITION,” which adds all-new animated scenes never seen in the OVA, streamlines the storyline, and creates a more focused and action-packed viewing experience. In addition to the feature, attendees will view an exclusive special interview with creator/chief director Shoji Kawamori (“Macross,” “Aquarion,” “Escaflowne”).Tickets for “MACROSS PLUS MOVIE EDITION” can be purchased at www.FathomEvents.com or participating theater box offices. For a complete list of theater locations, visit the Fathom Events website (theater locations are subject to change).Combining the intricate designs of Shoji Kawamori, character direction from Shinichiro Watanabe (“Cowboy Bebop”), and the musical stylings of renown composer Yoko Kanno (“Cowboy Bebop,” “Ghost in The Shell: SAC”), “MACROSS PLUS MOVIE EDITION” takes place in the year 2040 A.D., three decades after the glassing of Earth in what has since become known as Space War One. On the colonial planet of Eden, U.N. SPACY is testing transformable variable fighters to counter further alien attacks. Two prototype aircraft piloted by former childhood friends, loose cannon Isamu and the Zentradi mixed alien race Guld, go head-to-head in aerial and robot combat superiority over a lucrative military contract, and the affections of mutual love interest Myung. “We’re excited to partner with BIGWEST to finally bring ‘MACROSS PLUS MOVIE EDITION’ to anime fans nationwide,” said Daren Miller, Fathom Events VP, Programming, Strategy & Business Affairs. “For everyone that thinks ‘Top Gun’ is exciting but would be better with Maverick and Iceman piloting robots, this one is for you.”For artwork/photos related to “MACROSS PLUS MOVIE EDITION” visit the Fathom Events press site.
