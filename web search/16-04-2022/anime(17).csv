News Crunchyroll Streams Aharen-san wa Hakarenai Romantic Comedy Anime's English Dub on April 15   posted on 2022-04-15 01:19 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo          Ben Balmaceda, Dani Chambers star    Crunchyroll will begin streaming an English dub for the television anime of  Asato Mizu's Aharen-san wa Hakarenai (Aharen Is Indecipherable) romantic comedy manga series on Friday at 4:00 p.m. EDT.    The English cast includes:    Ben Balmaceda as Raido   Dani Chambers as Aharen   Kristen McGuire as Ooshiro   Jalitza Delgado as Raido's Sister   Tia Ballard as Miyahira    Emily Fajardo is directing the English dub. Jamal Roberson is the lead ADR engineer, and Xavier Earl and Noah Whitehead are the assistant engineers. Madeleine Morris is writing the script with Bonny Clinkenbeard as supervisor. Brandon Peters is in charge of ADR prep.    The anime premiered in the Animeism block on April 1. Crunchyroll is streaming the anime as it airs in Japan.    The teen romantic comedy follows the ""indecipherable"" daily life of short, quiet Reina Aharen and Raidō who sits next to her in class. Aharen is not so good at gauging the distance between people (or personal boundaries), and Raidō initially sensed some distance between the two of them. Then one day, when Raidō picked up the eraser that Aharen had dropped, the distance between them suddenly became uncomfortably close.    From ""way too distant"" to ""way too close"" ... Aharen is simply unpredictable.      Yasutaka Yamamoto (Servant × Service, Valkyria Chronicles) is serving as chief director, and Tomoe Makino (Woodpecker Detective's Office) is directing the anime at Felix Film. Takao Yoshioka (High School DxD, I'm Standing on 1,000,000 Lives., Sekirei, WATAMOTE) is in charge of the series scripts, and is also writing them with Ayumu Hisao and Kotsukotsu. Yūko Yahiro (Diabolik Lovers, Kaguya-sama: Love is War, Katana Maidens: Toji no Miko) is designing the characters.    Yahiro, Tomoko Iwasa, Chie Mishima, and Yūki Fukuchi are serving as the chief animation directors. Satoru Kousaki (BEASTARS, Lucky Star, Oreimo) and monaca (My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU, Servant × Service, Wagnaria!!) are composing the music. The Chinese streaming service bilibili is presenting the project.      The unit TrySail performs the opening theme song ""Hanarenai Kyori"" (Inseparable Distance), while the unit HaKoniwalily performs the ending theme song ""Kyori-Kan"" (A Sense of Distance).    Mizu launched the manga on Shonen Jump+ in January 2017, and Shueisha published the 13th compiled book volume on April 4.

News Crunchyroll Streams Aharen-san wa Hakarenai Romantic Comedy Anime's English Dub on April 15   posted on 2022-04-15 01:19 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo          Ben Balmaceda, Dani Chambers star    Crunchyroll will begin streaming an English dub for the television anime of  Asato Mizu's Aharen-san wa Hakarenai (Aharen Is Indecipherable) romantic comedy manga series on Friday at 4:00 p.m. EDT.    The English cast includes:    Ben Balmaceda as Raido   Dani Chambers as Aharen   Kristen McGuire as Ooshiro   Jalitza Delgado as Raido's Sister   Tia Ballard as Miyahira    Emily Fajardo is directing the English dub. Jamal Roberson is the lead ADR engineer, and Xavier Earl and Noah Whitehead are the assistant engineers. Madeleine Morris is writing the script with Bonny Clinkenbeard as supervisor. Brandon Peters is in charge of ADR prep.    The anime premiered in the Animeism block on April 1. Crunchyroll is streaming the anime as it airs in Japan.    The teen romantic comedy follows the ""indecipherable"" daily life of short, quiet Reina Aharen and Raidō who sits next to her in class. Aharen is not so good at gauging the distance between people (or personal boundaries), and Raidō initially sensed some distance between the two of them. Then one day, when Raidō picked up the eraser that Aharen had dropped, the distance between them suddenly became uncomfortably close.    From ""way too distant"" to ""way too close"" ... Aharen is simply unpredictable.      Yasutaka Yamamoto (Servant × Service, Valkyria Chronicles) is serving as chief director, and Tomoe Makino (Woodpecker Detective's Office) is directing the anime at Felix Film. Takao Yoshioka (High School DxD, I'm Standing on 1,000,000 Lives., Sekirei, WATAMOTE) is in charge of the series scripts, and is also writing them with Ayumu Hisao and Kotsukotsu. Yūko Yahiro (Diabolik Lovers, Kaguya-sama: Love is War, Katana Maidens: Toji no Miko) is designing the characters.    Yahiro, Tomoko Iwasa, Chie Mishima, and Yūki Fukuchi are serving as the chief animation directors. Satoru Kousaki (BEASTARS, Lucky Star, Oreimo) and monaca (My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU, Servant × Service, Wagnaria!!) are composing the music. The Chinese streaming service bilibili is presenting the project.      The unit TrySail performs the opening theme song ""Hanarenai Kyori"" (Inseparable Distance), while the unit HaKoniwalily performs the ending theme song ""Kyori-Kan"" (A Sense of Distance).    Mizu launched the manga on Shonen Jump+ in January 2017, and Shueisha published the 13th compiled book volume on April 4.

News Crunchyroll Streams Aharen-san wa Hakarenai Romantic Comedy Anime's English Dub on April 15   posted on 2022-04-15 01:19 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo          Ben Balmaceda, Dani Chambers star    Crunchyroll will begin streaming an English dub for the television anime of  Asato Mizu's Aharen-san wa Hakarenai (Aharen Is Indecipherable) romantic comedy manga series on Friday at 4:00 p.m. EDT.    The English cast includes:    Ben Balmaceda as Raido   Dani Chambers as Aharen   Kristen McGuire as Ooshiro   Jalitza Delgado as Raido's Sister   Tia Ballard as Miyahira    Emily Fajardo is directing the English dub. Jamal Roberson is the lead ADR engineer, and Xavier Earl and Noah Whitehead are the assistant engineers. Madeleine Morris is writing the script with Bonny Clinkenbeard as supervisor. Brandon Peters is in charge of ADR prep.    The anime premiered in the Animeism block on April 1. Crunchyroll is streaming the anime as it airs in Japan.    The teen romantic comedy follows the ""indecipherable"" daily life of short, quiet Reina Aharen and Raidō who sits next to her in class. Aharen is not so good at gauging the distance between people (or personal boundaries), and Raidō initially sensed some distance between the two of them. Then one day, when Raidō picked up the eraser that Aharen had dropped, the distance between them suddenly became uncomfortably close.    From ""way too distant"" to ""way too close"" ... Aharen is simply unpredictable.      Yasutaka Yamamoto (Servant × Service, Valkyria Chronicles) is serving as chief director, and Tomoe Makino (Woodpecker Detective's Office) is directing the anime at Felix Film. Takao Yoshioka (High School DxD, I'm Standing on 1,000,000 Lives., Sekirei, WATAMOTE) is in charge of the series scripts, and is also writing them with Ayumu Hisao and Kotsukotsu. Yūko Yahiro (Diabolik Lovers, Kaguya-sama: Love is War, Katana Maidens: Toji no Miko) is designing the characters.    Yahiro, Tomoko Iwasa, Chie Mishima, and Yūki Fukuchi are serving as the chief animation directors. Satoru Kousaki (BEASTARS, Lucky Star, Oreimo) and monaca (My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU, Servant × Service, Wagnaria!!) are composing the music. The Chinese streaming service bilibili is presenting the project.      The unit TrySail performs the opening theme song ""Hanarenai Kyori"" (Inseparable Distance), while the unit HaKoniwalily performs the ending theme song ""Kyori-Kan"" (A Sense of Distance).    Mizu launched the manga on Shonen Jump+ in January 2017, and Shueisha published the 13th compiled book volume on April 4.

The English cast includes:    Ben Balmaceda as Raido   Dani Chambers as Aharen   Kristen McGuire as Ooshiro   Jalitza Delgado as Raido's Sister   Tia Ballard as Miyahira    Emily Fajardo is directing the English dub. Jamal Roberson is the lead ADR engineer, and Xavier Earl and Noah Whitehead are the assistant engineers. Madeleine Morris is writing the script with Bonny Clinkenbeard as supervisor. Brandon Peters is in charge of ADR prep.    The anime premiered in the Animeism block on April 1. Crunchyroll is streaming the anime as it airs in Japan.    The teen romantic comedy follows the ""indecipherable"" daily life of short, quiet Reina Aharen and Raidō who sits next to her in class. Aharen is not so good at gauging the distance between people (or personal boundaries), and Raidō initially sensed some distance between the two of them. Then one day, when Raidō picked up the eraser that Aharen had dropped, the distance between them suddenly became uncomfortably close.    From ""way too distant"" to ""way too close"" ... Aharen is simply unpredictable.      Yasutaka Yamamoto (Servant × Service, Valkyria Chronicles) is serving as chief director, and Tomoe Makino (Woodpecker Detective's Office) is directing the anime at Felix Film. Takao Yoshioka (High School DxD, I'm Standing on 1,000,000 Lives., Sekirei, WATAMOTE) is in charge of the series scripts, and is also writing them with Ayumu Hisao and Kotsukotsu. Yūko Yahiro (Diabolik Lovers, Kaguya-sama: Love is War, Katana Maidens: Toji no Miko) is designing the characters.    Yahiro, Tomoko Iwasa, Chie Mishima, and Yūki Fukuchi are serving as the chief animation directors. Satoru Kousaki (BEASTARS, Lucky Star, Oreimo) and monaca (My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU, Servant × Service, Wagnaria!!) are composing the music.

VCRX 2020: We Translate Your Anime & More Panel Report   by Callum May, Sep  8th 2020          There's been a lot of discussion lately regarding conditions for localization workers within anime and manga. Despite them being essential to the popularity of anime in the west, they are often paid unlivable rates and go uncredited. Crunchyroll is just one of the companies where both of these issues persist.    The panel appears to somewhat lampshade these issues, opening with a clip of the Dark Souls bonfire while a voice-over states, “If you're looking for internet drama or trouble, sorry friend. You won't find it here. If that upsets you, then I suggest you just move on to the next panel.” If this is the panel's attempt at dismissing labor issues, that's disappointing, but it's kept vague enough to ensure plausible deniability for this Crunchyroll industry panel.    The panel itself is hosted by Bryan Ingram, the senior director of production at Crunchyroll. Ingram's been with MX Media (now owned by Crunchyroll) since the start and served as “right-hand man” to its founder Ken Hoinsky. Ingram serves as an entertaining and competent host of the panel, but his position makes the dynamic somewhat awkward. Questions regarding the “hustle” of trying to survive as an independent contractor hit differently when those questions are being asked by your boss.    But if you can put the cynicism aside, this is genuinely a great panel and an annual opportunity for Crunchyroll translators to discuss their work. And while the opening's flippancy is disheartening, it's not the panellist's responsibility to address the accusations levelled at the company. At the same time, they do address the realities of working in the industry as both translators and independent contractors.    Featured translators Rei Miyasaka (top-left), Michelle Tymon (top-right), Adam Lensenmayer (bottom-left), and Sriram Gurunathan (bottom-right). Senior director of production Bryan Ingram appeared in voice-only.   The first topic was the obvious one: COVID-19. While anime fans have been disappointed by all the delays, the effect on translators was disastrous. Adam Lensenmayer mentioned that last season, he was working on fewer shows than he has in his entire 12-year career. Lensenmayer works with several anime streaming companies but doesn't depend on translation for his regular income. He said that if he was relying on anime translation, he'd probably have left the industry. Likewise, Gurunathan was also looking into other jobs, and regarded last season as a famine. Thankfully the number of shows have recovered in this fall season.    To describe the panel in one word, it would be: sobering. The translators made no effort to romanticize their anime work and spoke to their efforts in getting enough work to put food on the table. Each translator had a different experience with this, with Miyasaka advertising, Gurunathan cold-calling, Tymon received offers, and Lensenmayer took every available job, even the low-paying ones, in the hopes of finding a better one.    Lensenmayer's philosophy of taking every job also applies to the anime industry. He states that, “with any single client, you're very much subject to things outside of your control.” There's always shake ups within the anime licensing industry, and decisions from executives can leave translators without work. “If you are only attached to that one licensor,” he said, “it will have a very negative effect on your income.” So to keep his overall earnings up, Lensenmayer opted to work with as many licensors as possible.    This seems to be the key to a lot of translation work in the anime-games space. It's important not to rely too much on it. A lot of translators will supplement their income with business or research translation, or even just have a regular 9-5 job. When asked how they get more money out of translation, the panellists seemed to be generally unconcerned. Miyasaka mentioned that there are issues with translation work going down in price due to the increase in available translators and more companies relying on machine translation. Tymon noted that she was offered more from long-time clients over time.      The translators are introduced with their credits and original illustrations of them (except Gurunathan)   Translators are usually paid based on the length of an episode, but the value of that can be hilariously inconsistent. Each translator was asked what their quickest and longest translation was, and while Tymon stated an average of 3-4 hours, she noted that this time could easily double if extra research is necessary. “As a translator, you usually become a mini-expert in something pretty quickly so research is really important,” she stated. On the most extreme end of this spectrum is Gurunathan who spoke about having to spend three days on just the first half of Episode 269 of Gintama. The episode features Gintoki teaching a child history through the use of Japanese mnemonics. Gurunathan would then have to find a way of expressing these in English. As Gurunathan put it, “Translation is 20% actual translating and 80% problem-solving.”    And because of this, the shows that don't involve complex dialogue can be translated surprisingly quickly. Tymon noted that for an action-heavy show, she might only take 1.5-2 hours to translate the episode. Lensenmayer even recalled a time when he managed to translate three episodes of Casshern Sins within an hour. Since the show had such little dialogue, he'd just have all the episodes on his screen playing at the same time. Whenever a character talked, he'd pause them and translate the line. It's clear that this tactic wouldn't work for most shows, though.    While translators generally wouldn't employ Lensenmayer's strategy, most of the panellists did note some form of time-saving technique. Sometimes this involves asking other translators for help and sometimes it just involves creating a library of different software to speed up the process. Miyasaka created a service that compiles multiple English-Japanese dictionaries amusingly titled HugeDict. Each of the dictionaries offers different information and usages for unfamiliar words. He noted that this is most useful for cooking shows. In fact, the panellists generally agreed that cooking shows were annoyingly complex, especially for those who don't regularly cook themselves. Tymon noted that she'd sometimes watch YouTube videos to learn how to describe these unfamiliar topics in English.     Miyasaka shows off his HugeDict   This prompted a brief conversation on the evolution of the Japanese language. They all noted that a lot of anime have gotten simpler, with the technobabble and complex sci-fi going out of fashion. Gurunathan also noted that a lot of memes and phrases have evolved over time, something he'd noted from watching VTubers. The panel discussed the evolution of the phrase “笑う” (to laugh), how it turned into “www”, the Japanese equivalent of “lol”, and how the appearance of those letters eventually became summarised as “草” (grass), which is now used as a shorthand for “lol”.    The panel closed out with Ingram asking what sort of media the translators would like to work on in the future. Gurunathan, as a fan of Japanese pro-wrestling, said that he'd like to work on subtitling wrestling streams. Tymon mentioned that she'd like to get involved with translating more voice actor events and concerts. She's already done a few of these in the past for Crunchyroll, including some for CRX itself. Lensenmayer noted that he's already done about 2,500 episodes of anime in his career, and would like to do more video game translation. In the past, he's translated Steins;Gate Zero, Chaos;Child, Punch Line and a couple of undisclosed major mobile game releases. Miyasaka also noted that he wanted to translate video games, but instead wanted to translate western games into Japanese, noting Firewatch as a hopeful example.    Unfortunately, the VOD for the panel was only available over the CRX weekend, but for those that managed to catch it in time, it was an enlightening and detailed look at translating anime. For those that aren't able to make it to San Jose, this was their first opportunity to watch the annual panel, so it would be good if more recordings were available in the future. Translators within anime/manga/games are frequently devalued not only by the fans but also by the large entertainment companies that seek to exploit them. Panels like these are valuable, not just because they make for an interesting watch, but also because they build more much-needed respect for these essential workers.     discuss this in the forum (4 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Convention homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            column          4 comments       This Week in Games - Let's Talk About Kingdom Hearts   Apr 16, 07:53 4 comments                 games    Heidi speculates on wtf is going on in the new Kingdom Hearts game and holy crap Witch on the Holy Night is getting a Western release?! ― Hi folks.

VCRX 2020: We Translate Your Anime & More Panel Report   by Callum May, Sep  8th 2020          There's been a lot of discussion lately regarding conditions for localization workers within anime and manga. Despite them being essential to the popularity of anime in the west, they are often paid unlivable rates and go uncredited. Crunchyroll is just one of the companies where both of these issues persist.    The panel appears to somewhat lampshade these issues, opening with a clip of the Dark Souls bonfire while a voice-over states, “If you're looking for internet drama or trouble, sorry friend. You won't find it here. If that upsets you, then I suggest you just move on to the next panel.” If this is the panel's attempt at dismissing labor issues, that's disappointing, but it's kept vague enough to ensure plausible deniability for this Crunchyroll industry panel.    The panel itself is hosted by Bryan Ingram, the senior director of production at Crunchyroll. Ingram's been with MX Media (now owned by Crunchyroll) since the start and served as “right-hand man” to its founder Ken Hoinsky. Ingram serves as an entertaining and competent host of the panel, but his position makes the dynamic somewhat awkward. Questions regarding the “hustle” of trying to survive as an independent contractor hit differently when those questions are being asked by your boss.    But if you can put the cynicism aside, this is genuinely a great panel and an annual opportunity for Crunchyroll translators to discuss their work. And while the opening's flippancy is disheartening, it's not the panellist's responsibility to address the accusations levelled at the company. At the same time, they do address the realities of working in the industry as both translators and independent contractors.    Featured translators Rei Miyasaka (top-left), Michelle Tymon (top-right), Adam Lensenmayer (bottom-left), and Sriram Gurunathan (bottom-right). Senior director of production Bryan Ingram appeared in voice-only.   The first topic was the obvious one: COVID-19. While anime fans have been disappointed by all the delays, the effect on translators was disastrous. Adam Lensenmayer mentioned that last season, he was working on fewer shows than he has in his entire 12-year career. Lensenmayer works with several anime streaming companies but doesn't depend on translation for his regular income. He said that if he was relying on anime translation, he'd probably have left the industry. Likewise, Gurunathan was also looking into other jobs, and regarded last season as a famine. Thankfully the number of shows have recovered in this fall season.    To describe the panel in one word, it would be: sobering. The translators made no effort to romanticize their anime work and spoke to their efforts in getting enough work to put food on the table. Each translator had a different experience with this, with Miyasaka advertising, Gurunathan cold-calling, Tymon received offers, and Lensenmayer took every available job, even the low-paying ones, in the hopes of finding a better one.    Lensenmayer's philosophy of taking every job also applies to the anime industry. He states that, “with any single client, you're very much subject to things outside of your control.” There's always shake ups within the anime licensing industry, and decisions from executives can leave translators without work. “If you are only attached to that one licensor,” he said, “it will have a very negative effect on your income.” So to keep his overall earnings up, Lensenmayer opted to work with as many licensors as possible.    This seems to be the key to a lot of translation work in the anime-games space. It's important not to rely too much on it. A lot of translators will supplement their income with business or research translation, or even just have a regular 9-5 job. When asked how they get more money out of translation, the panellists seemed to be generally unconcerned. Miyasaka mentioned that there are issues with translation work going down in price due to the increase in available translators and more companies relying on machine translation. Tymon noted that she was offered more from long-time clients over time.      The translators are introduced with their credits and original illustrations of them (except Gurunathan)   Translators are usually paid based on the length of an episode, but the value of that can be hilariously inconsistent. Each translator was asked what their quickest and longest translation was, and while Tymon stated an average of 3-4 hours, she noted that this time could easily double if extra research is necessary. “As a translator, you usually become a mini-expert in something pretty quickly so research is really important,” she stated. On the most extreme end of this spectrum is Gurunathan who spoke about having to spend three days on just the first half of Episode 269 of Gintama. The episode features Gintoki teaching a child history through the use of Japanese mnemonics. Gurunathan would then have to find a way of expressing these in English. As Gurunathan put it, “Translation is 20% actual translating and 80% problem-solving.”    And because of this, the shows that don't involve complex dialogue can be translated surprisingly quickly. Tymon noted that for an action-heavy show, she might only take 1.5-2 hours to translate the episode. Lensenmayer even recalled a time when he managed to translate three episodes of Casshern Sins within an hour. Since the show had such little dialogue, he'd just have all the episodes on his screen playing at the same time. Whenever a character talked, he'd pause them and translate the line. It's clear that this tactic wouldn't work for most shows, though.    While translators generally wouldn't employ Lensenmayer's strategy, most of the panellists did note some form of time-saving technique. Sometimes this involves asking other translators for help and sometimes it just involves creating a library of different software to speed up the process. Miyasaka created a service that compiles multiple English-Japanese dictionaries amusingly titled HugeDict. Each of the dictionaries offers different information and usages for unfamiliar words. He noted that this is most useful for cooking shows. In fact, the panellists generally agreed that cooking shows were annoyingly complex, especially for those who don't regularly cook themselves. Tymon noted that she'd sometimes watch YouTube videos to learn how to describe these unfamiliar topics in English.     Miyasaka shows off his HugeDict   This prompted a brief conversation on the evolution of the Japanese language. They all noted that a lot of anime have gotten simpler, with the technobabble and complex sci-fi going out of fashion. Gurunathan also noted that a lot of memes and phrases have evolved over time, something he'd noted from watching VTubers. The panel discussed the evolution of the phrase “笑う” (to laugh), how it turned into “www”, the Japanese equivalent of “lol”, and how the appearance of those letters eventually became summarised as “草” (grass), which is now used as a shorthand for “lol”.    The panel closed out with Ingram asking what sort of media the translators would like to work on in the future. Gurunathan, as a fan of Japanese pro-wrestling, said that he'd like to work on subtitling wrestling streams. Tymon mentioned that she'd like to get involved with translating more voice actor events and concerts. She's already done a few of these in the past for Crunchyroll, including some for CRX itself. Lensenmayer noted that he's already done about 2,500 episodes of anime in his career, and would like to do more video game translation. In the past, he's translated Steins;Gate Zero, Chaos;Child, Punch Line and a couple of undisclosed major mobile game releases. Miyasaka also noted that he wanted to translate video games, but instead wanted to translate western games into Japanese, noting Firewatch as a hopeful example.    Unfortunately, the VOD for the panel was only available over the CRX weekend, but for those that managed to catch it in time, it was an enlightening and detailed look at translating anime. For those that aren't able to make it to San Jose, this was their first opportunity to watch the annual panel, so it would be good if more recordings were available in the future. Translators within anime/manga/games are frequently devalued not only by the fans but also by the large entertainment companies that seek to exploit them. Panels like these are valuable, not just because they make for an interesting watch, but also because they build more much-needed respect for these essential workers.     discuss this in the forum (4 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Convention homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            column          4 comments       This Week in Games - Let's Talk About Kingdom Hearts   Apr 16, 07:53 4 comments                 games    Heidi speculates on wtf is going on in the new Kingdom Hearts game and holy crap Witch on the Holy Night is getting a Western release?! ― Hi folks.

VCRX 2020: We Translate Your Anime & More Panel Report   by Callum May, Sep  8th 2020          There's been a lot of discussion lately regarding conditions for localization workers within anime and manga. Despite them being essential to the popularity of anime in the west, they are often paid unlivable rates and go uncredited. Crunchyroll is just one of the companies where both of these issues persist.    The panel appears to somewhat lampshade these issues, opening with a clip of the Dark Souls bonfire while a voice-over states, “If you're looking for internet drama or trouble, sorry friend. You won't find it here. If that upsets you, then I suggest you just move on to the next panel.” If this is the panel's attempt at dismissing labor issues, that's disappointing, but it's kept vague enough to ensure plausible deniability for this Crunchyroll industry panel.    The panel itself is hosted by Bryan Ingram, the senior director of production at Crunchyroll. Ingram's been with MX Media (now owned by Crunchyroll) since the start and served as “right-hand man” to its founder Ken Hoinsky. Ingram serves as an entertaining and competent host of the panel, but his position makes the dynamic somewhat awkward. Questions regarding the “hustle” of trying to survive as an independent contractor hit differently when those questions are being asked by your boss.    But if you can put the cynicism aside, this is genuinely a great panel and an annual opportunity for Crunchyroll translators to discuss their work. And while the opening's flippancy is disheartening, it's not the panellist's responsibility to address the accusations levelled at the company. At the same time, they do address the realities of working in the industry as both translators and independent contractors.    Featured translators Rei Miyasaka (top-left), Michelle Tymon (top-right), Adam Lensenmayer (bottom-left), and Sriram Gurunathan (bottom-right). Senior director of production Bryan Ingram appeared in voice-only.   The first topic was the obvious one: COVID-19. While anime fans have been disappointed by all the delays, the effect on translators was disastrous. Adam Lensenmayer mentioned that last season, he was working on fewer shows than he has in his entire 12-year career. Lensenmayer works with several anime streaming companies but doesn't depend on translation for his regular income. He said that if he was relying on anime translation, he'd probably have left the industry. Likewise, Gurunathan was also looking into other jobs, and regarded last season as a famine. Thankfully the number of shows have recovered in this fall season.    To describe the panel in one word, it would be: sobering. The translators made no effort to romanticize their anime work and spoke to their efforts in getting enough work to put food on the table. Each translator had a different experience with this, with Miyasaka advertising, Gurunathan cold-calling, Tymon received offers, and Lensenmayer took every available job, even the low-paying ones, in the hopes of finding a better one.    Lensenmayer's philosophy of taking every job also applies to the anime industry. He states that, “with any single client, you're very much subject to things outside of your control.” There's always shake ups within the anime licensing industry, and decisions from executives can leave translators without work. “If you are only attached to that one licensor,” he said, “it will have a very negative effect on your income.” So to keep his overall earnings up, Lensenmayer opted to work with as many licensors as possible.    This seems to be the key to a lot of translation work in the anime-games space. It's important not to rely too much on it. A lot of translators will supplement their income with business or research translation, or even just have a regular 9-5 job. When asked how they get more money out of translation, the panellists seemed to be generally unconcerned. Miyasaka mentioned that there are issues with translation work going down in price due to the increase in available translators and more companies relying on machine translation. Tymon noted that she was offered more from long-time clients over time.      The translators are introduced with their credits and original illustrations of them (except Gurunathan)   Translators are usually paid based on the length of an episode, but the value of that can be hilariously inconsistent. Each translator was asked what their quickest and longest translation was, and while Tymon stated an average of 3-4 hours, she noted that this time could easily double if extra research is necessary. “As a translator, you usually become a mini-expert in something pretty quickly so research is really important,” she stated. On the most extreme end of this spectrum is Gurunathan who spoke about having to spend three days on just the first half of Episode 269 of Gintama. The episode features Gintoki teaching a child history through the use of Japanese mnemonics. Gurunathan would then have to find a way of expressing these in English. As Gurunathan put it, “Translation is 20% actual translating and 80% problem-solving.”    And because of this, the shows that don't involve complex dialogue can be translated surprisingly quickly. Tymon noted that for an action-heavy show, she might only take 1.5-2 hours to translate the episode. Lensenmayer even recalled a time when he managed to translate three episodes of Casshern Sins within an hour. Since the show had such little dialogue, he'd just have all the episodes on his screen playing at the same time. Whenever a character talked, he'd pause them and translate the line. It's clear that this tactic wouldn't work for most shows, though.    While translators generally wouldn't employ Lensenmayer's strategy, most of the panellists did note some form of time-saving technique. Sometimes this involves asking other translators for help and sometimes it just involves creating a library of different software to speed up the process. Miyasaka created a service that compiles multiple English-Japanese dictionaries amusingly titled HugeDict. Each of the dictionaries offers different information and usages for unfamiliar words. He noted that this is most useful for cooking shows. In fact, the panellists generally agreed that cooking shows were annoyingly complex, especially for those who don't regularly cook themselves. Tymon noted that she'd sometimes watch YouTube videos to learn how to describe these unfamiliar topics in English.     Miyasaka shows off his HugeDict   This prompted a brief conversation on the evolution of the Japanese language. They all noted that a lot of anime have gotten simpler, with the technobabble and complex sci-fi going out of fashion. Gurunathan also noted that a lot of memes and phrases have evolved over time, something he'd noted from watching VTubers. The panel discussed the evolution of the phrase “笑う” (to laugh), how it turned into “www”, the Japanese equivalent of “lol”, and how the appearance of those letters eventually became summarised as “草” (grass), which is now used as a shorthand for “lol”.    The panel closed out with Ingram asking what sort of media the translators would like to work on in the future. Gurunathan, as a fan of Japanese pro-wrestling, said that he'd like to work on subtitling wrestling streams. Tymon mentioned that she'd like to get involved with translating more voice actor events and concerts. She's already done a few of these in the past for Crunchyroll, including some for CRX itself. Lensenmayer noted that he's already done about 2,500 episodes of anime in his career, and would like to do more video game translation. In the past, he's translated Steins;Gate Zero, Chaos;Child, Punch Line and a couple of undisclosed major mobile game releases. Miyasaka also noted that he wanted to translate video games, but instead wanted to translate western games into Japanese, noting Firewatch as a hopeful example.    Unfortunately, the VOD for the panel was only available over the CRX weekend, but for those that managed to catch it in time, it was an enlightening and detailed look at translating anime. For those that aren't able to make it to San Jose, this was their first opportunity to watch the annual panel, so it would be good if more recordings were available in the future. Translators within anime/manga/games are frequently devalued not only by the fans but also by the large entertainment companies that seek to exploit them. Panels like these are valuable, not just because they make for an interesting watch, but also because they build more much-needed respect for these essential workers.     discuss this in the forum (4 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Convention homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            column          4 comments       This Week in Games - Let's Talk About Kingdom Hearts   Apr 16, 07:53 4 comments                 games    Heidi speculates on wtf is going on in the new Kingdom Hearts game and holy crap Witch on the Holy Night is getting a Western release?! ― Hi folks.

In the past, he's translated Steins;Gate Zero, Chaos;Child, Punch Line and a couple of undisclosed major mobile game releases. Miyasaka also noted that he wanted to translate video games, but instead wanted to translate western games into Japanese, noting Firewatch as a hopeful example.    Unfortunately, the VOD for the panel was only available over the CRX weekend, but for those that managed to catch it in time, it was an enlightening and detailed look at translating anime. For those that aren't able to make it to San Jose, this was their first opportunity to watch the annual panel, so it would be good if more recordings were available in the future. Translators within anime/manga/games are frequently devalued not only by the fans but also by the large entertainment companies that seek to exploit them. Panels like these are valuable, not just because they make for an interesting watch, but also because they build more much-needed respect for these essential workers.     discuss this in the forum (4 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Convention homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            column          4 comments       This Week in Games - Let's Talk About Kingdom Hearts   Apr 16, 07:53 4 comments                 games    Heidi speculates on wtf is going on in the new Kingdom Hearts game and holy crap Witch on the Holy Night is getting a Western release?! ― Hi folks.

VCRX 2020: We Translate Your Anime & More Panel Report   by Callum May, Sep  8th 2020          There's been a lot of discussion lately regarding conditions for localization workers within anime and manga. Despite them being essential to the popularity of anime in the west, they are often paid unlivable rates and go uncredited. Crunchyroll is just one of the companies where both of these issues persist.    The panel appears to somewhat lampshade these issues, opening with a clip of the Dark Souls bonfire while a voice-over states, “If you're looking for internet drama or trouble, sorry friend. You won't find it here. If that upsets you, then I suggest you just move on to the next panel.” If this is the panel's attempt at dismissing labor issues, that's disappointing, but it's kept vague enough to ensure plausible deniability for this Crunchyroll industry panel.    The panel itself is hosted by Bryan Ingram, the senior director of production at Crunchyroll. Ingram's been with MX Media (now owned by Crunchyroll) since the start and served as “right-hand man” to its founder Ken Hoinsky. Ingram serves as an entertaining and competent host of the panel, but his position makes the dynamic somewhat awkward. Questions regarding the “hustle” of trying to survive as an independent contractor hit differently when those questions are being asked by your boss.    But if you can put the cynicism aside, this is genuinely a great panel and an annual opportunity for Crunchyroll translators to discuss their work. And while the opening's flippancy is disheartening, it's not the panellist's responsibility to address the accusations levelled at the company. At the same time, they do address the realities of working in the industry as both translators and independent contractors.    Featured translators Rei Miyasaka (top-left), Michelle Tymon (top-right), Adam Lensenmayer (bottom-left), and Sriram Gurunathan (bottom-right). Senior director of production Bryan Ingram appeared in voice-only.   The first topic was the obvious one: COVID-19. While anime fans have been disappointed by all the delays, the effect on translators was disastrous. Adam Lensenmayer mentioned that last season, he was working on fewer shows than he has in his entire 12-year career. Lensenmayer works with several anime streaming companies but doesn't depend on translation for his regular income. He said that if he was relying on anime translation, he'd probably have left the industry. Likewise, Gurunathan was also looking into other jobs, and regarded last season as a famine. Thankfully the number of shows have recovered in this fall season.    To describe the panel in one word, it would be: sobering. The translators made no effort to romanticize their anime work and spoke to their efforts in getting enough work to put food on the table. Each translator had a different experience with this, with Miyasaka advertising, Gurunathan cold-calling, Tymon received offers, and Lensenmayer took every available job, even the low-paying ones, in the hopes of finding a better one.    Lensenmayer's philosophy of taking every job also applies to the anime industry. He states that, “with any single client, you're very much subject to things outside of your control.” There's always shake ups within the anime licensing industry, and decisions from executives can leave translators without work. “If you are only attached to that one licensor,” he said, “it will have a very negative effect on your income.” So to keep his overall earnings up, Lensenmayer opted to work with as many licensors as possible.    This seems to be the key to a lot of translation work in the anime-games space. It's important not to rely too much on it. A lot of translators will supplement their income with business or research translation, or even just have a regular 9-5 job. When asked how they get more money out of translation, the panellists seemed to be generally unconcerned. Miyasaka mentioned that there are issues with translation work going down in price due to the increase in available translators and more companies relying on machine translation. Tymon noted that she was offered more from long-time clients over time.      The translators are introduced with their credits and original illustrations of them (except Gurunathan)   Translators are usually paid based on the length of an episode, but the value of that can be hilariously inconsistent. Each translator was asked what their quickest and longest translation was, and while Tymon stated an average of 3-4 hours, she noted that this time could easily double if extra research is necessary. “As a translator, you usually become a mini-expert in something pretty quickly so research is really important,” she stated. On the most extreme end of this spectrum is Gurunathan who spoke about having to spend three days on just the first half of Episode 269 of Gintama. The episode features Gintoki teaching a child history through the use of Japanese mnemonics. Gurunathan would then have to find a way of expressing these in English. As Gurunathan put it, “Translation is 20% actual translating and 80% problem-solving.”    And because of this, the shows that don't involve complex dialogue can be translated surprisingly quickly. Tymon noted that for an action-heavy show, she might only take 1.5-2 hours to translate the episode. Lensenmayer even recalled a time when he managed to translate three episodes of Casshern Sins within an hour. Since the show had such little dialogue, he'd just have all the episodes on his screen playing at the same time. Whenever a character talked, he'd pause them and translate the line. It's clear that this tactic wouldn't work for most shows, though.    While translators generally wouldn't employ Lensenmayer's strategy, most of the panellists did note some form of time-saving technique. Sometimes this involves asking other translators for help and sometimes it just involves creating a library of different software to speed up the process. Miyasaka created a service that compiles multiple English-Japanese dictionaries amusingly titled HugeDict. Each of the dictionaries offers different information and usages for unfamiliar words. He noted that this is most useful for cooking shows. In fact, the panellists generally agreed that cooking shows were annoyingly complex, especially for those who don't regularly cook themselves. Tymon noted that she'd sometimes watch YouTube videos to learn how to describe these unfamiliar topics in English.     Miyasaka shows off his HugeDict   This prompted a brief conversation on the evolution of the Japanese language. They all noted that a lot of anime have gotten simpler, with the technobabble and complex sci-fi going out of fashion. Gurunathan also noted that a lot of memes and phrases have evolved over time, something he'd noted from watching VTubers. The panel discussed the evolution of the phrase “笑う” (to laugh), how it turned into “www”, the Japanese equivalent of “lol”, and how the appearance of those letters eventually became summarised as “草” (grass), which is now used as a shorthand for “lol”.    The panel closed out with Ingram asking what sort of media the translators would like to work on in the future. Gurunathan, as a fan of Japanese pro-wrestling, said that he'd like to work on subtitling wrestling streams. Tymon mentioned that she'd like to get involved with translating more voice actor events and concerts. She's already done a few of these in the past for Crunchyroll, including some for CRX itself. Lensenmayer noted that he's already done about 2,500 episodes of anime in his career, and would like to do more video game translation. In the past, he's translated Steins;Gate Zero, Chaos;Child, Punch Line and a couple of undisclosed major mobile game releases.

Panels like these are valuable, not just because they make for an interesting watch, but also because they build more much-needed respect for these essential workers.     discuss this in the forum (4 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Convention homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More     ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4, 'https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryan-ingram-73542921/': 1}"

Despite them being essential to the popularity of anime in the west, they are often paid unlivable rates and go uncredited. Crunchyroll is just one of the companies where both of these issues persist.    The panel appears to somewhat lampshade these issues, opening with a clip of the Dark Souls bonfire while a voice-over states, “If you're looking for internet drama or trouble, sorry friend. You won't find it here. If that upsets you, then I suggest you just move on to the next panel.” If this is the panel's attempt at dismissing labor issues, that's disappointing, but it's kept vague enough to ensure plausible deniability for this Crunchyroll industry panel.    The panel itself is hosted by Bryan Ingram, the senior director of production at Crunchyroll. Ingram's been with MX Media (now owned by Crunchyroll) since the start and served as “right-hand man” to its founder Ken Hoinsky. Ingram serves as an entertaining and competent host of the panel, but his position makes the dynamic somewhat awkward. Questions regarding the “hustle” of trying to survive as an independent contractor hit differently when those questions are being asked by your boss.    But if you can put the cynicism aside, this is genuinely a great panel and an annual opportunity for Crunchyroll translators to discuss their work. And while the opening's flippancy is disheartening, it's not the panellist's responsibility to address the accusations levelled at the company. At the same time, they do address the realities of working in the industry as both translators and independent contractors.    Featured translators Rei Miyasaka (top-left), Michelle Tymon (top-right), Adam Lensenmayer (bottom-left), and Sriram Gurunathan (bottom-right). Senior director of production Bryan Ingram appeared in voice-only.   The first topic was the obvious one: COVID-19. While anime fans have been disappointed by all the delays, the effect on translators was disastrous. Adam Lensenmayer mentioned that last season, he was working on fewer shows than he has in his entire 12-year career. Lensenmayer works with several anime streaming companies but doesn't depend on translation for his regular income. He said that if he was relying on anime translation, he'd probably have left the industry. Likewise, Gurunathan was also looking into other jobs, and regarded last season as a famine. Thankfully the number of shows have recovered in this fall season.    To describe the panel in one word, it would be: sobering. The translators made no effort to romanticize their anime work and spoke to their efforts in getting enough work to put food on the table. Each translator had a different experience with this, with Miyasaka advertising, Gurunathan cold-calling, Tymon received offers, and Lensenmayer took every available job, even the low-paying ones, in the hopes of finding a better one.    Lensenmayer's philosophy of taking every job also applies to the anime industry. He states that, “with any single client, you're very much subject to things outside of your control.” There's always shake ups within the anime licensing industry, and decisions from executives can leave translators without work. “If you are only attached to that one licensor,” he said, “it will have a very negative effect on your income.” So to keep his overall earnings up, Lensenmayer opted to work with as many licensors as possible.    This seems to be the key to a lot of translation work in the anime-games space. It's important not to rely too much on it. A lot of translators will supplement their income with business or research translation, or even just have a regular 9-5 job. When asked how they get more money out of translation, the panellists seemed to be generally unconcerned. Miyasaka mentioned that there are issues with translation work going down in price due to the increase in available translators and more companies relying on machine translation. Tymon noted that she was offered more from long-time clients over time.      The translators are introduced with their credits and original illustrations of them (except Gurunathan)   Translators are usually paid based on the length of an episode, but the value of that can be hilariously inconsistent. Each translator was asked what their quickest and longest translation was, and while Tymon stated an average of 3-4 hours, she noted that this time could easily double if extra research is necessary. “As a translator, you usually become a mini-expert in something pretty quickly so research is really important,” she stated. On the most extreme end of this spectrum is Gurunathan who spoke about having to spend three days on just the first half of Episode 269 of Gintama. The episode features Gintoki teaching a child history through the use of Japanese mnemonics. Gurunathan would then have to find a way of expressing these in English. As Gurunathan put it, “Translation is 20% actual translating and 80% problem-solving.”    And because of this, the shows that don't involve complex dialogue can be translated surprisingly quickly. Tymon noted that for an action-heavy show, she might only take 1.5-2 hours to translate the episode. Lensenmayer even recalled a time when he managed to translate three episodes of Casshern Sins within an hour. Since the show had such little dialogue, he'd just have all the episodes on his screen playing at the same time. Whenever a character talked, he'd pause them and translate the line. It's clear that this tactic wouldn't work for most shows, though.    While translators generally wouldn't employ Lensenmayer's strategy, most of the panellists did note some form of time-saving technique. Sometimes this involves asking other translators for help and sometimes it just involves creating a library of different software to speed up the process. Miyasaka created a service that compiles multiple English-Japanese dictionaries amusingly titled HugeDict. Each of the dictionaries offers different information and usages for unfamiliar words. He noted that this is most useful for cooking shows. In fact, the panellists generally agreed that cooking shows were annoyingly complex, especially for those who don't regularly cook themselves. Tymon noted that she'd sometimes watch YouTube videos to learn how to describe these unfamiliar topics in English.     Miyasaka shows off his HugeDict   This prompted a brief conversation on the evolution of the Japanese language. They all noted that a lot of anime have gotten simpler, with the technobabble and complex sci-fi going out of fashion. Gurunathan also noted that a lot of memes and phrases have evolved over time, something he'd noted from watching VTubers. The panel discussed the evolution of the phrase “笑う” (to laugh), how it turned into “www”, the Japanese equivalent of “lol”, and how the appearance of those letters eventually became summarised as “草” (grass), which is now used as a shorthand for “lol”.    The panel closed out with Ingram asking what sort of media the translators would like to work on in the future. Gurunathan, as a fan of Japanese pro-wrestling, said that he'd like to work on subtitling wrestling streams. Tymon mentioned that she'd like to get involved with translating more voice actor events and concerts. She's already done a few of these in the past for Crunchyroll, including some for CRX itself. Lensenmayer noted that he's already done about 2,500 episodes of anime in his career, and would like to do more video game translation. In the past, he's translated Steins;Gate Zero, Chaos;Child, Punch Line and a couple of undisclosed major mobile game releases. Miyasaka also noted that he wanted to translate video games, but instead wanted to translate western games into Japanese, noting Firewatch as a hopeful example.    Unfortunately, the VOD for the panel was only available over the CRX weekend, but for those that managed to catch it in time, it was an enlightening and detailed look at translating anime.

The translators are introduced with their credits and original illustrations of them (except Gurunathan)   Translators are usually paid based on the length of an episode, but the value of that can be hilariously inconsistent. Each translator was asked what their quickest and longest translation was, and while Tymon stated an average of 3-4 hours, she noted that this time could easily double if extra research is necessary. “As a translator, you usually become a mini-expert in something pretty quickly so research is really important,” she stated. On the most extreme end of this spectrum is Gurunathan who spoke about having to spend three days on just the first half of Episode 269 of Gintama. The episode features Gintoki teaching a child history through the use of Japanese mnemonics. Gurunathan would then have to find a way of expressing these in English. As Gurunathan put it, “Translation is 20% actual translating and 80% problem-solving.”    And because of this, the shows that don't involve complex dialogue can be translated surprisingly quickly. Tymon noted that for an action-heavy show, she might only take 1.5-2 hours to translate the episode. Lensenmayer even recalled a time when he managed to translate three episodes of Casshern Sins within an hour. Since the show had such little dialogue, he'd just have all the episodes on his screen playing at the same time. Whenever a character talked, he'd pause them and translate the line. It's clear that this tactic wouldn't work for most shows, though.    While translators generally wouldn't employ Lensenmayer's strategy, most of the panellists did note some form of time-saving technique. Sometimes this involves asking other translators for help and sometimes it just involves creating a library of different software to speed up the process. Miyasaka created a service that compiles multiple English-Japanese dictionaries amusingly titled HugeDict. Each of the dictionaries offers different information and usages for unfamiliar words. He noted that this is most useful for cooking shows. In fact, the panellists generally agreed that cooking shows were annoyingly complex, especially for those who don't regularly cook themselves. Tymon noted that she'd sometimes watch YouTube videos to learn how to describe these unfamiliar topics in English.     Miyasaka shows off his HugeDict   This prompted a brief conversation on the evolution of the Japanese language. They all noted that a lot of anime have gotten simpler, with the technobabble and complex sci-fi going out of fashion. Gurunathan also noted that a lot of memes and phrases have evolved over time, something he'd noted from watching VTubers. The panel discussed the evolution of the phrase “笑う” (to laugh), how it turned into “www”, the Japanese equivalent of “lol”, and how the appearance of those letters eventually became summarised as “草” (grass), which is now used as a shorthand for “lol”.    The panel closed out with Ingram asking what sort of media the translators would like to work on in the future. Gurunathan, as a fan of Japanese pro-wrestling, said that he'd like to work on subtitling wrestling streams. Tymon mentioned that she'd like to get involved with translating more voice actor events and concerts. She's already done a few of these in the past for Crunchyroll, including some for CRX itself. Lensenmayer noted that he's already done about 2,500 episodes of anime in his career, and would like to do more video game translation. In the past, he's translated Steins;Gate Zero, Chaos;Child, Punch Line and a couple of undisclosed major mobile game releases. Miyasaka also noted that he wanted to translate video games, but instead wanted to translate western games into Japanese, noting Firewatch as a hopeful example.    Unfortunately, the VOD for the panel was only available over the CRX weekend, but for those that managed to catch it in time, it was an enlightening and detailed look at translating anime. For those that aren't able to make it to San Jose, this was their first opportunity to watch the annual panel, so it would be good if more recordings were available in the future. Translators within anime/manga/games are frequently devalued not only by the fans but also by the large entertainment companies that seek to exploit them.

Despite them being essential to the popularity of anime in the west, they are often paid unlivable rates and go uncredited. Crunchyroll is just one of the companies where both of these issues persist.    The panel appears to somewhat lampshade these issues, opening with a clip of the Dark Souls bonfire while a voice-over states, “If you're looking for internet drama or trouble, sorry friend. You won't find it here. If that upsets you, then I suggest you just move on to the next panel.” If this is the panel's attempt at dismissing labor issues, that's disappointing, but it's kept vague enough to ensure plausible deniability for this Crunchyroll industry panel.    The panel itself is hosted by Bryan Ingram, the senior director of production at Crunchyroll. Ingram's been with MX Media (now owned by Crunchyroll) since the start and served as “right-hand man” to its founder Ken Hoinsky. Ingram serves as an entertaining and competent host of the panel, but his position makes the dynamic somewhat awkward. Questions regarding the “hustle” of trying to survive as an independent contractor hit differently when those questions are being asked by your boss.    But if you can put the cynicism aside, this is genuinely a great panel and an annual opportunity for Crunchyroll translators to discuss their work. And while the opening's flippancy is disheartening, it's not the panellist's responsibility to address the accusations levelled at the company. At the same time, they do address the realities of working in the industry as both translators and independent contractors.    Featured translators Rei Miyasaka (top-left), Michelle Tymon (top-right), Adam Lensenmayer (bottom-left), and Sriram Gurunathan (bottom-right). Senior director of production Bryan Ingram appeared in voice-only.   The first topic was the obvious one: COVID-19. While anime fans have been disappointed by all the delays, the effect on translators was disastrous. Adam Lensenmayer mentioned that last season, he was working on fewer shows than he has in his entire 12-year career. Lensenmayer works with several anime streaming companies but doesn't depend on translation for his regular income. He said that if he was relying on anime translation, he'd probably have left the industry. Likewise, Gurunathan was also looking into other jobs, and regarded last season as a famine. Thankfully the number of shows have recovered in this fall season.    To describe the panel in one word, it would be: sobering. The translators made no effort to romanticize their anime work and spoke to their efforts in getting enough work to put food on the table. Each translator had a different experience with this, with Miyasaka advertising, Gurunathan cold-calling, Tymon received offers, and Lensenmayer took every available job, even the low-paying ones, in the hopes of finding a better one.    Lensenmayer's philosophy of taking every job also applies to the anime industry. He states that, “with any single client, you're very much subject to things outside of your control.” There's always shake ups within the anime licensing industry, and decisions from executives can leave translators without work. “If you are only attached to that one licensor,” he said, “it will have a very negative effect on your income.” So to keep his overall earnings up, Lensenmayer opted to work with as many licensors as possible.    This seems to be the key to a lot of translation work in the anime-games space. It's important not to rely too much on it. A lot of translators will supplement their income with business or research translation, or even just have a regular 9-5 job. When asked how they get more money out of translation, the panellists seemed to be generally unconcerned. Miyasaka mentioned that there are issues with translation work going down in price due to the increase in available translators and more companies relying on machine translation. Tymon noted that she was offered more from long-time clients over time.      The translators are introduced with their credits and original illustrations of them (except Gurunathan)   Translators are usually paid based on the length of an episode, but the value of that can be hilariously inconsistent. Each translator was asked what their quickest and longest translation was, and while Tymon stated an average of 3-4 hours, she noted that this time could easily double if extra research is necessary. “As a translator, you usually become a mini-expert in something pretty quickly so research is really important,” she stated. On the most extreme end of this spectrum is Gurunathan who spoke about having to spend three days on just the first half of Episode 269 of Gintama. The episode features Gintoki teaching a child history through the use of Japanese mnemonics. Gurunathan would then have to find a way of expressing these in English.

News My Dress-Up Darling Manga Adds 2.5 Million Copies in Circulation Since Anime's Premiere   posted on 2022-04-15 17:29 UTC-8 by Crystalyn Hodgkins         Manga now has 6 million copies in circulation    This year's ninth issue of Square Enix's Young Gangan magazine announced on Friday that Shinichi Fukuda's My Dress-Up Darling (Sono Bisque Doll wa Koi wo Suru) manga has 6 million copies in circulation. The manga has 2.5 million more copies in circulation compared to the start of the year, before the manga's television anime premiered on January 8.    The manga had 5 million copies in circulation in February and 5.5 million copies in circulation in March.    The numbers above are not sales statistics. The manga has released 2.5 million more copies since the anime premiered, but all 2.5 million copies have not yet sold.    Square Enix Manga & Books publishes the manga in English, and it describes the story:    Traumatized by a childhood incident with a friend who took exception to his love of traditional dolls, doll-artisan hopeful Wakana Gojō passes his days as a loner, finding solace in the home ec room at his high school. To Wakana, people like beautiful Marin Kitagawa, a trendy girl who's always surrounded by a throng of friends, is practically an alien from another world. But when cheerful Marin--never one to be shy--spots Wakana sewing away one day after school, she barges in with the aim of roping her quiet classmate into her secret hobby: cosplay.   The manga launched in Square Enix's Young Gangan magazine in January 2018. Square Enix published the manga's ninth volume on March 25. Square Enix Manga & Books will publish the fifth volume in English on April 26.    Funimation streamed the anime as it aired in Japan, and also streamed an English dub. Crunchyroll also streamed the English dub.

News My Dress-Up Darling Manga Adds 2.5 Million Copies in Circulation Since Anime's Premiere   posted on 2022-04-15 17:29 UTC-8 by Crystalyn Hodgkins         Manga now has 6 million copies in circulation    This year's ninth issue of Square Enix's Young Gangan magazine announced on Friday that Shinichi Fukuda's My Dress-Up Darling (Sono Bisque Doll wa Koi wo Suru) manga has 6 million copies in circulation. The manga has 2.5 million more copies in circulation compared to the start of the year, before the manga's television anime premiered on January 8.    The manga had 5 million copies in circulation in February and 5.5 million copies in circulation in March.    The numbers above are not sales statistics. The manga has released 2.5 million more copies since the anime premiered, but all 2.5 million copies have not yet sold.    Square Enix Manga & Books publishes the manga in English, and it describes the story:    Traumatized by a childhood incident with a friend who took exception to his love of traditional dolls, doll-artisan hopeful Wakana Gojō passes his days as a loner, finding solace in the home ec room at his high school. To Wakana, people like beautiful Marin Kitagawa, a trendy girl who's always surrounded by a throng of friends, is practically an alien from another world. But when cheerful Marin--never one to be shy--spots Wakana sewing away one day after school, she barges in with the aim of roping her quiet classmate into her secret hobby: cosplay.   The manga launched in Square Enix's Young Gangan magazine in January 2018. Square Enix published the manga's ninth volume on March 25. Square Enix Manga & Books will publish the fifth volume in English on April 26.    Funimation streamed the anime as it aired in Japan, and also streamed an English dub. Crunchyroll also streamed the English dub.

News My Dress-Up Darling Manga Adds 2.5 Million Copies in Circulation Since Anime's Premiere   posted on 2022-04-15 17:29 UTC-8 by Crystalyn Hodgkins         Manga now has 6 million copies in circulation    This year's ninth issue of Square Enix's Young Gangan magazine announced on Friday that Shinichi Fukuda's My Dress-Up Darling (Sono Bisque Doll wa Koi wo Suru) manga has 6 million copies in circulation. The manga has 2.5 million more copies in circulation compared to the start of the year, before the manga's television anime premiered on January 8.    The manga had 5 million copies in circulation in February and 5.5 million copies in circulation in March.    The numbers above are not sales statistics. The manga has released 2.5 million more copies since the anime premiered, but all 2.5 million copies have not yet sold.    Square Enix Manga & Books publishes the manga in English, and it describes the story:    Traumatized by a childhood incident with a friend who took exception to his love of traditional dolls, doll-artisan hopeful Wakana Gojō passes his days as a loner, finding solace in the home ec room at his high school. To Wakana, people like beautiful Marin Kitagawa, a trendy girl who's always surrounded by a throng of friends, is practically an alien from another world. But when cheerful Marin--never one to be shy--spots Wakana sewing away one day after school, she barges in with the aim of roping her quiet classmate into her secret hobby: cosplay.   The manga launched in Square Enix's Young Gangan magazine in January 2018. Square Enix published the manga's ninth volume on March 25. Square Enix Manga & Books will publish the fifth volume in English on April 26.    Funimation streamed the anime as it aired in Japan, and also streamed an English dub. Crunchyroll also streamed the English dub.

The manga has 2.5 million more copies in circulation compared to the start of the year, before the manga's television anime premiered on January 8.    The manga had 5 million copies in circulation in February and 5.5 million copies in circulation in March.    The numbers above are not sales statistics. The manga has released 2.5 million more copies since the anime premiered, but all 2.5 million copies have not yet sold.    Square Enix Manga & Books publishes the manga in English, and it describes the story:    Traumatized by a childhood incident with a friend who took exception to his love of traditional dolls, doll-artisan hopeful Wakana Gojō passes his days as a loner, finding solace in the home ec room at his high school. To Wakana, people like beautiful Marin Kitagawa, a trendy girl who's always surrounded by a throng of friends, is practically an alien from another world. But when cheerful Marin--never one to be shy--spots Wakana sewing away one day after school, she barges in with the aim of roping her quiet classmate into her secret hobby: cosplay.   The manga launched in Square Enix's Young Gangan magazine in January 2018. Square Enix published the manga's ninth volume on March 25. Square Enix Manga & Books will publish the fifth volume in English on April 26.    Funimation streamed the anime as it aired in Japan, and also streamed an English dub. Crunchyroll also streamed the English dub.

Interest Pompo: The Cinéphile Anime Film Director Comments on Nathalie's Fortnite Dance   posted on 2022-04-14 03:45 UTC-8 by Kim Morrissy          Takayuki Hirao's inspiration was DA PUMP's “U.S.A."" dance, which was huge in Japan    Pompo: The Cinéphile anime film director Takayuki Hirao participated in an Ask Me Anything (AMA) on the r/anime subreddit on Tuesday ahead of the film's U.S. release on April 29. Hirao took questions from fans about the film—including one amusing question highlighting Nathalie's dance sequence. The brief clip became a meme in the English-speaking community because the dance is featured as an emote in the popular Fortnite survival game.    In his response (quoted below), Hirao explained his reasoning for including it in the film and his Japanese inspiration:   I'm surprised that this dance is a popular meme in America! In Japan, it's called the iine—or “thumbs up” dance. Two years ago a band called DA PUMP released a song called “U.S.A."" and everyone was doing the dance in Japan. Nathalie tends to express her emotions with her body. So when she's confused or nervous, she dances. And because the song is called “U.S.A.” and there are a lot of U.S. references in the film, we thought it would be perfect. So it would be an homage!  avex released DA PUMP's music video in 2018. American rapper BloBoy JB displayed the original dance move in his ""Shoot"" music video in 2017.    Hirao also shared his favorite film directors, his techniques for representing live-action camerawork in anime, and his experiences working at ufotable and with the legendary director Satoshi Kon.    GKIDS will begin screening the  anime film of Shogo Sugitani's Pompo: The Cinéphile (Eiga Daisuki Pompo-san) manga in the U.S. on April 29 in select theaters, with a special fan preview screening on April 27-28. The movie will screen in Japanese with English subtitles and an English dub. Tickets are currently on sale.    Preview screenings will feature an introduction from Hirao.    NYICFF describes the film:  If you're reading this, chances are you like movies. You'll feel right at home with Pompo, the talented and gutsy producer whose love of cinema is unflinching and unapologetic. One day, Pompo turns her uncanny eye for talent to her movie-loving but apprehensive assistant Gene, selecting him to make his directorial debut with her latest script. But Gene has his work cut out for him with a young starlet looking for her first big break and a legendary, aging, Brando-like superstar in front of the camera. It's not an action movie, but Pompo's breakneck pace combined with the high stakes of creative fulfillment pack in as much excitement as standard superhero fare. Add to that a slew of insider movie references and countless winks and nods to the filmmaking process, this hilarious and heartful dramedy has what it takes to fulfill even your wildest celluloid dreams.  Takayuki Hirao (The Garden of Sinners movie 5, God Eater) directed the film at CLAP. Shingo Adachi (Sword Art Online, Wagnaria!!) designed the characters. Ryoichiro Matsuo (In This Corner of the World) served as producer. Vocaloid producer Iori Kanzaki composed three vocal songs for the film. Virtual singer Kaf performed one insert song ""Tatoeba"" (For Example), and DUSTCELL vocalist EMA performed the film's other insert song ""Hangyakusha no Bokura"" (We the Rebels). In addition, Seiko Niizuma performed the film's opening number ""Dance on Fire."" Rookie female singer CIEL performed the film's theme song ""Mado wo Akete"" (Open a Window).    The anime film premiered in North America at Montreal's 25th Fantasia International Film Festival in August.

Interest Pompo: The Cinéphile Anime Film Director Comments on Nathalie's Fortnite Dance   posted on 2022-04-14 03:45 UTC-8 by Kim Morrissy          Takayuki Hirao's inspiration was DA PUMP's “U.S.A."" dance, which was huge in Japan    Pompo: The Cinéphile anime film director Takayuki Hirao participated in an Ask Me Anything (AMA) on the r/anime subreddit on Tuesday ahead of the film's U.S. release on April 29. Hirao took questions from fans about the film—including one amusing question highlighting Nathalie's dance sequence. The brief clip became a meme in the English-speaking community because the dance is featured as an emote in the popular Fortnite survival game.    In his response (quoted below), Hirao explained his reasoning for including it in the film and his Japanese inspiration:   I'm surprised that this dance is a popular meme in America! In Japan, it's called the iine—or “thumbs up” dance. Two years ago a band called DA PUMP released a song called “U.S.A."" and everyone was doing the dance in Japan. Nathalie tends to express her emotions with her body. So when she's confused or nervous, she dances. And because the song is called “U.S.A.” and there are a lot of U.S. references in the film, we thought it would be perfect. So it would be an homage!  avex released DA PUMP's music video in 2018. American rapper BloBoy JB displayed the original dance move in his ""Shoot"" music video in 2017.    Hirao also shared his favorite film directors, his techniques for representing live-action camerawork in anime, and his experiences working at ufotable and with the legendary director Satoshi Kon.    GKIDS will begin screening the  anime film of Shogo Sugitani's Pompo: The Cinéphile (Eiga Daisuki Pompo-san) manga in the U.S. on April 29 in select theaters, with a special fan preview screening on April 27-28. The movie will screen in Japanese with English subtitles and an English dub. Tickets are currently on sale.    Preview screenings will feature an introduction from Hirao.    NYICFF describes the film:  If you're reading this, chances are you like movies. You'll feel right at home with Pompo, the talented and gutsy producer whose love of cinema is unflinching and unapologetic. One day, Pompo turns her uncanny eye for talent to her movie-loving but apprehensive assistant Gene, selecting him to make his directorial debut with her latest script. But Gene has his work cut out for him with a young starlet looking for her first big break and a legendary, aging, Brando-like superstar in front of the camera. It's not an action movie, but Pompo's breakneck pace combined with the high stakes of creative fulfillment pack in as much excitement as standard superhero fare. Add to that a slew of insider movie references and countless winks and nods to the filmmaking process, this hilarious and heartful dramedy has what it takes to fulfill even your wildest celluloid dreams.  Takayuki Hirao (The Garden of Sinners movie 5, God Eater) directed the film at CLAP. Shingo Adachi (Sword Art Online, Wagnaria!!) designed the characters. Ryoichiro Matsuo (In This Corner of the World) served as producer. Vocaloid producer Iori Kanzaki composed three vocal songs for the film. Virtual singer Kaf performed one insert song ""Tatoeba"" (For Example), and DUSTCELL vocalist EMA performed the film's other insert song ""Hangyakusha no Bokura"" (We the Rebels). In addition, Seiko Niizuma performed the film's opening number ""Dance on Fire."" Rookie female singer CIEL performed the film's theme song ""Mado wo Akete"" (Open a Window).    The anime film premiered in North America at Montreal's 25th Fantasia International Film Festival in August.

Interest Pompo: The Cinéphile Anime Film Director Comments on Nathalie's Fortnite Dance   posted on 2022-04-14 03:45 UTC-8 by Kim Morrissy          Takayuki Hirao's inspiration was DA PUMP's “U.S.A."" dance, which was huge in Japan    Pompo: The Cinéphile anime film director Takayuki Hirao participated in an Ask Me Anything (AMA) on the r/anime subreddit on Tuesday ahead of the film's U.S. release on April 29. Hirao took questions from fans about the film—including one amusing question highlighting Nathalie's dance sequence. The brief clip became a meme in the English-speaking community because the dance is featured as an emote in the popular Fortnite survival game.    In his response (quoted below), Hirao explained his reasoning for including it in the film and his Japanese inspiration:   I'm surprised that this dance is a popular meme in America! In Japan, it's called the iine—or “thumbs up” dance. Two years ago a band called DA PUMP released a song called “U.S.A."" and everyone was doing the dance in Japan. Nathalie tends to express her emotions with her body. So when she's confused or nervous, she dances. And because the song is called “U.S.A.” and there are a lot of U.S. references in the film, we thought it would be perfect. So it would be an homage!  avex released DA PUMP's music video in 2018. American rapper BloBoy JB displayed the original dance move in his ""Shoot"" music video in 2017.    Hirao also shared his favorite film directors, his techniques for representing live-action camerawork in anime, and his experiences working at ufotable and with the legendary director Satoshi Kon.    GKIDS will begin screening the  anime film of Shogo Sugitani's Pompo: The Cinéphile (Eiga Daisuki Pompo-san) manga in the U.S. on April 29 in select theaters, with a special fan preview screening on April 27-28. The movie will screen in Japanese with English subtitles and an English dub. Tickets are currently on sale.    Preview screenings will feature an introduction from Hirao.    NYICFF describes the film:  If you're reading this, chances are you like movies. You'll feel right at home with Pompo, the talented and gutsy producer whose love of cinema is unflinching and unapologetic. One day, Pompo turns her uncanny eye for talent to her movie-loving but apprehensive assistant Gene, selecting him to make his directorial debut with her latest script. But Gene has his work cut out for him with a young starlet looking for her first big break and a legendary, aging, Brando-like superstar in front of the camera. It's not an action movie, but Pompo's breakneck pace combined with the high stakes of creative fulfillment pack in as much excitement as standard superhero fare. Add to that a slew of insider movie references and countless winks and nods to the filmmaking process, this hilarious and heartful dramedy has what it takes to fulfill even your wildest celluloid dreams.  Takayuki Hirao (The Garden of Sinners movie 5, God Eater) directed the film at CLAP. Shingo Adachi (Sword Art Online, Wagnaria!!) designed the characters. Ryoichiro Matsuo (In This Corner of the World) served as producer. Vocaloid producer Iori Kanzaki composed three vocal songs for the film. Virtual singer Kaf performed one insert song ""Tatoeba"" (For Example), and DUSTCELL vocalist EMA performed the film's other insert song ""Hangyakusha no Bokura"" (We the Rebels). In addition, Seiko Niizuma performed the film's opening number ""Dance on Fire."" Rookie female singer CIEL performed the film's theme song ""Mado wo Akete"" (Open a Window).    The anime film premiered in North America at Montreal's 25th Fantasia International Film Festival in August.

Interest Pompo: The Cinéphile Anime Film Director Comments on Nathalie's Fortnite Dance   posted on 2022-04-14 03:45 UTC-8 by Kim Morrissy          Takayuki Hirao's inspiration was DA PUMP's “U.S.A."" dance, which was huge in Japan    Pompo: The Cinéphile anime film director Takayuki Hirao participated in an Ask Me Anything (AMA) on the r/anime subreddit on Tuesday ahead of the film's U.S. release on April 29. Hirao took questions from fans about the film—including one amusing question highlighting Nathalie's dance sequence. The brief clip became a meme in the English-speaking community because the dance is featured as an emote in the popular Fortnite survival game.    In his response (quoted below), Hirao explained his reasoning for including it in the film and his Japanese inspiration:   I'm surprised that this dance is a popular meme in America! In Japan, it's called the iine—or “thumbs up” dance. Two years ago a band called DA PUMP released a song called “U.S.A."" and everyone was doing the dance in Japan. Nathalie tends to express her emotions with her body. So when she's confused or nervous, she dances. And because the song is called “U.S.A.” and there are a lot of U.S. references in the film, we thought it would be perfect. So it would be an homage!  avex released DA PUMP's music video in 2018. American rapper BloBoy JB displayed the original dance move in his ""Shoot"" music video in 2017.    Hirao also shared his favorite film directors, his techniques for representing live-action camerawork in anime, and his experiences working at ufotable and with the legendary director Satoshi Kon.    GKIDS will begin screening the  anime film of Shogo Sugitani's Pompo: The Cinéphile (Eiga Daisuki Pompo-san) manga in the U.S. on April 29 in select theaters, with a special fan preview screening on April 27-28. The movie will screen in Japanese with English subtitles and an English dub. Tickets are currently on sale.    Preview screenings will feature an introduction from Hirao.    NYICFF describes the film:  If you're reading this, chances are you like movies. You'll feel right at home with Pompo, the talented and gutsy producer whose love of cinema is unflinching and unapologetic. One day, Pompo turns her uncanny eye for talent to her movie-loving but apprehensive assistant Gene, selecting him to make his directorial debut with her latest script. But Gene has his work cut out for him with a young starlet looking for her first big break and a legendary, aging, Brando-like superstar in front of the camera. It's not an action movie, but Pompo's breakneck pace combined with the high stakes of creative fulfillment pack in as much excitement as standard superhero fare. Add to that a slew of insider movie references and countless winks and nods to the filmmaking process, this hilarious and heartful dramedy has what it takes to fulfill even your wildest celluloid dreams.  Takayuki Hirao (The Garden of Sinners movie 5, God Eater) directed the film at CLAP. Shingo Adachi (Sword Art Online, Wagnaria!!) designed the characters. Ryoichiro Matsuo (In This Corner of the World) served as producer. Vocaloid producer Iori Kanzaki composed three vocal songs for the film. Virtual singer Kaf performed one insert song ""Tatoeba"" (For Example), and DUSTCELL vocalist EMA performed the film's other insert song ""Hangyakusha no Bokura"" (We the Rebels). In addition, Seiko Niizuma performed the film's opening number ""Dance on Fire."" Rookie female singer CIEL performed the film's theme song ""Mado wo Akete"" (Open a Window).

Hirao took questions from fans about the film—including one amusing question highlighting Nathalie's dance sequence. The brief clip became a meme in the English-speaking community because the dance is featured as an emote in the popular Fortnite survival game.    In his response (quoted below), Hirao explained his reasoning for including it in the film and his Japanese inspiration:   I'm surprised that this dance is a popular meme in America! In Japan, it's called the iine—or “thumbs up” dance. Two years ago a band called DA PUMP released a song called “U.S.A."" and everyone was doing the dance in Japan. Nathalie tends to express her emotions with her body. So when she's confused or nervous, she dances. And because the song is called “U.S.A.” and there are a lot of U.S. references in the film, we thought it would be perfect. So it would be an homage!  avex released DA PUMP's music video in 2018. American rapper BloBoy JB displayed the original dance move in his ""Shoot"" music video in 2017.    Hirao also shared his favorite film directors, his techniques for representing live-action camerawork in anime, and his experiences working at ufotable and with the legendary director Satoshi Kon.    GKIDS will begin screening the  anime film of Shogo Sugitani's Pompo: The Cinéphile (Eiga Daisuki Pompo-san) manga in the U.S. on April 29 in select theaters, with a special fan preview screening on April 27-28. The movie will screen in Japanese with English subtitles and an English dub. Tickets are currently on sale.    Preview screenings will feature an introduction from Hirao.    NYICFF describes the film:  If you're reading this, chances are you like movies. You'll feel right at home with Pompo, the talented and gutsy producer whose love of cinema is unflinching and unapologetic. One day, Pompo turns her uncanny eye for talent to her movie-loving but apprehensive assistant Gene, selecting him to make his directorial debut with her latest script. But Gene has his work cut out for him with a young starlet looking for her first big break and a legendary, aging, Brando-like superstar in front of the camera. It's not an action movie, but Pompo's breakneck pace combined with the high stakes of creative fulfillment pack in as much excitement as standard superhero fare. Add to that a slew of insider movie references and countless winks and nods to the filmmaking process, this hilarious and heartful dramedy has what it takes to fulfill even your wildest celluloid dreams.  Takayuki Hirao (The Garden of Sinners movie 5, God Eater) directed the film at CLAP. Shingo Adachi (Sword Art Online, Wagnaria!!) designed the characters. Ryoichiro Matsuo (In This Corner of the World) served as producer. Vocaloid producer Iori Kanzaki composed three vocal songs for the film. Virtual singer Kaf performed one insert song ""Tatoeba"" (For Example), and DUSTCELL vocalist EMA performed the film's other insert song ""Hangyakusha no Bokura"" (We the Rebels). In addition, Seiko Niizuma performed the film's opening number ""Dance on Fire."" Rookie female singer CIEL performed the film's theme song ""Mado wo Akete"" (Open a Window).

The company stated Ize Press is a collaboration with REDICE Studio and RIVERSE to release content in print starting this fall. Ize Press revealed nine launch titles, including HYBE and BTS' 7Fates: Chakho, HYBE and ENHYPEN's Dark Moon, and HYBE and TOMORROW X TOGETHER's The Star Seekers.

One thousand years ago, Leonis Death Magnus, undead sorcerer and the greatest of the Dark Lords, entered magical stasis during a climactic battle. When he awakens, he finds a beautiful silver-haired young woman named Riselia standing before him. More shockingly, Leonis has been transformed into a ten-year-old boy! Now he'll have to adapt to this strange era and deal with the twisted monsters called Voids—all while keeping his true powers a secret from his lovely new guardian.    Title: Arya Sometimes Hides Her Feelings in Russian (Tokidoki Bosotto Russia-go de Dereru Tonari no Arya-san) (light novel) Author(s): Sunsunsun (story), Momoco (art) Summary: A romantic comedy perfect for fans of Chitose Is in the Ramune Bottle and The Girl I Saved on the Train Turned Out to Be My Childhood Friend.

Title: Gods' Games We Play (Kami wa Game ni Ueteiru) (light novel) Author(s): Kei Sazane (story), Toiro Tomose (art) Summary: An epic fantasy soon to be an anime! When the gods grow bored, they decide to spice up their eternal existence by challenging all takers in an ultimate battle of wits!

Even so, things are bound to get interesting when a former goddess and a genius human boy team up in a bid to win the game to end all games!    Title: Apparently, Disillusioned Adventurers Will Save the World (Ningen Fushin no Bōkensha-tachi ga Sekai o Sukuu Yō Desu) (light novel) Author(s): Shinta Fuji (story), Susumu Kuroi (art) Summary: A playful take on isekai tropes that will be a good fit for readers of Banished from the Hero's Party, I Decided to Live a Quiet Life in the Countryside.

Getting accused of embezzlement and kicked out by the leader he respected. Before long, he finds a few other jaded adventurers and kindred spirits, and together, they form their own unstoppable party!    Title: King's Proposal (Ōsama no Propose) (light novel) Author(s): Koushi Tachibana (story), Tsunako (art) Summary: A new light novel series from the creative team behind the legendary Date A Live. Saika Kuozaki is an all-powerful witch with looks to die for. She's also the only woman who can thwart the mysterious entities attempting to destroy the world once every 300 hours. When Saika is mortally wounded, however, she bequeaths both her powers and body to the normal high school boy who happens upon her, Mushiki Kuga. But just because Mushiki has her abilities doesn't mean he can control them. To stand a chance of saving the world, he'll have to attend an academy for mages as Saika—all while keeping his identity under wraps!    Title: Touring After the Apocalypse (Shūmatsu Touring) (manga) Author(s): Sakae Saito Summary: With a surprisingly upbeat tone, readers of Girls' Last Tour will enjoy this trip through apocalyptic Japan.

Even when the world ends, their journey goes on.    Title: The Gay Who Turned Kaiju (Kaijū ni Natta Gay) Author(s): Kazuki Minamoto Summary: Bullied for being gay, teenager Takashi Arashiro wishes he could just be somebody else—but who could predict he'd morph into a giant-headed sci-fi creature?!

Community score: 3.9              What is this?   In exchange for the fulfillment of a wish, Magical Girls keep fighting, unbeknownst to the rest of the world. But Iroha Tamaki can't seem to remember her wish. There is a gaping hole in her life. Something important has been lost. But she continues to fight every day, without even knowing why. Then, a rumor begins to spread among Magical Girls. Magical Girls can be saved if they go to Kamihama City, the city where Magical Girls and Uwasa are gathering.    Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story is based on a spinoff game of the Puella Magi Madoka Magica anime and streams on Crunchyroll and Funimation.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                I'm just going to get the full title out of the way up top, since it tells you everything you need to know about the show. This is Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story Final Season -The Dawn of the Ephemeral Dream-, a four-episode mini-season that is meant to conclude the nearly three-year-long odyssey of this messy but ambitious Madoka Magica spinoff. It seems odd to call this a “preview"" since in just this one episode we're covering a full quarter of this long-awaited conclusion, but thems the breaks, I suppose.    Going into -The Dawn of the Ephemeral Dream-, the main question on everyone's mind, including mine, is going to be whether or not a mere four-episode arc will be enough to draw the story of Magia Record to a satisfying conclusion. The thing about “We Failed” is that it's a flashback episode, devoted entirely to explaining the origins of the antagonist cadre of Magical Girls known as the Wings of Magius, so we don't get much in the way of narrative progression here. The good news is that, so far as infodump episodes go, “We Failed” is a doozy, answering many of the long-standing mysteries that Magia Record has been dangling over its viewers' heads for the past few years.    Granted, none of these answers are necessarily revelatory; given everything we learned about Ui, Nemu, and Touka last season, it was easy enough to figure out the broad strokes of this backstory ahead of time. Still, seeing everything laid out in a more traditional narrative fashion sure is satisfying for longtime viewers of the series, and it helps to contextualize a lot of elements of the series as we head into Magia Record's final act. The full scope of Ui's disappearance from the world is explained, we understand how all three of the Hospital Gang ended up as Magical Girls in the first place, and how Touka became the Uwasa creating villain that she was in the first two seasons of the show. We even finally get an explanation for Baby Kyubey, and it's a lot more reasonable than I was expecting!    The second season of the show was also notable for its extreme highs and lows in production quality. A few of its episodes ranked among the best spectacle that the franchise has ever delivered, and at the same time, the final entries of the season were stretched so thin that you could practically see the bubblegum and duct tape that the artists at Studio Shaft were using to hold the production together. “We Failed” is by no means the prettiest episode of Madoka Magica ever produced, but it looks solid, and my biggest hope for this extra-short final season is that the overall aesthetic of the franchise isn't compromised because of scheduling and production errors. Lord knows that the poor crew deserves one hell of a vacation at this point.    All that said, do I think that Magia Record's final season will end up doing the spinoff justice? It's tough to say. I've always had a mixed relationship with Magia Record; at its best, it feels like a genuine and compelling expansion of the entire Madoka Magica universe, but at its worst, it becomes borderline incomprehensible. I think the good of the series generally outweighs the bad, though, and if you're at all a fan of the Madoka Magica franchise, I believe (and I hope) that you'll have a mostly good time with Magia Record. Just, you know, make sure to watch the other two seasons first if you're new to the series.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               This episode might as well have been called “30 Minutes of Answers.” In one self-contained flashback, it lays out every major remaining mystery in the series and thoroughly unravels them. However, the way it does this feels completely natural through yet another story of Madoka Magica-themed suffering.    As it goes with most of these stories, it begins with Kyubey preying on Iroha's fears for Ui and tricking her into becoming a magical girl. What's interesting here is that Ui, Nemu, and Touka are able to see through Kyubey's half-truths and uncover what is really going on. And like Madoka in the main series, the three sickly girls figure out the bunny-cat's biggest weakness: he has to grant wishes. He literally can't stop himself.    This, of course, kicks off their search for the perfect wish—or rather, set of wishes—to break Kyubey's system and allow the remaining magical girls to live normally even after all witches are exterminated. Their solution is basically to become Kyubey themselves—feeding the collected energy back into the magical girls rather than keeping it for themselves. The problem is that they never considered what would happen to the one taking in all the negative magical girl emotions—i.e., that they'd become a witch in seconds.    Basically, this episode is a tragedy centered around hubris. The three girls think that after a bit of research they can game the system and save the world. But instead, they arguably make things worse, leading to almost all of the tragedy we've seen in the series so far.    What's truly heartbreaking, though, is the effect that comes from isolating Ui's fractured soul inside of Kyubey. Like with Madoka at the end of the main series, this places her outside of reality—as if she never existed in the first place. This drastically changes the personalities of those closest to her (namely, Touka) and makes the previous seasons gain yet another layer of tragedy in retrospect. All in all, it's a fantastic amalgamation of lore and character building that has me pumped to see where things will go in our final three episodes.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            column          4 comments       This Week in Games - Let's Talk About Kingdom Hearts   Apr 16, 07:53 4 comments                 games    Heidi speculates on wtf is going on in the new Kingdom Hearts game and holy crap Witch on the Holy Night is getting a Western release?! ― Hi folks.

Community score: 3.9              What is this?   In exchange for the fulfillment of a wish, Magical Girls keep fighting, unbeknownst to the rest of the world. But Iroha Tamaki can't seem to remember her wish. There is a gaping hole in her life. Something important has been lost. But she continues to fight every day, without even knowing why. Then, a rumor begins to spread among Magical Girls. Magical Girls can be saved if they go to Kamihama City, the city where Magical Girls and Uwasa are gathering.    Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story is based on a spinoff game of the Puella Magi Madoka Magica anime and streams on Crunchyroll and Funimation.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                I'm just going to get the full title out of the way up top, since it tells you everything you need to know about the show. This is Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story Final Season -The Dawn of the Ephemeral Dream-, a four-episode mini-season that is meant to conclude the nearly three-year-long odyssey of this messy but ambitious Madoka Magica spinoff. It seems odd to call this a “preview"" since in just this one episode we're covering a full quarter of this long-awaited conclusion, but thems the breaks, I suppose.    Going into -The Dawn of the Ephemeral Dream-, the main question on everyone's mind, including mine, is going to be whether or not a mere four-episode arc will be enough to draw the story of Magia Record to a satisfying conclusion. The thing about “We Failed” is that it's a flashback episode, devoted entirely to explaining the origins of the antagonist cadre of Magical Girls known as the Wings of Magius, so we don't get much in the way of narrative progression here. The good news is that, so far as infodump episodes go, “We Failed” is a doozy, answering many of the long-standing mysteries that Magia Record has been dangling over its viewers' heads for the past few years.    Granted, none of these answers are necessarily revelatory; given everything we learned about Ui, Nemu, and Touka last season, it was easy enough to figure out the broad strokes of this backstory ahead of time. Still, seeing everything laid out in a more traditional narrative fashion sure is satisfying for longtime viewers of the series, and it helps to contextualize a lot of elements of the series as we head into Magia Record's final act. The full scope of Ui's disappearance from the world is explained, we understand how all three of the Hospital Gang ended up as Magical Girls in the first place, and how Touka became the Uwasa creating villain that she was in the first two seasons of the show. We even finally get an explanation for Baby Kyubey, and it's a lot more reasonable than I was expecting!    The second season of the show was also notable for its extreme highs and lows in production quality. A few of its episodes ranked among the best spectacle that the franchise has ever delivered, and at the same time, the final entries of the season were stretched so thin that you could practically see the bubblegum and duct tape that the artists at Studio Shaft were using to hold the production together. “We Failed” is by no means the prettiest episode of Madoka Magica ever produced, but it looks solid, and my biggest hope for this extra-short final season is that the overall aesthetic of the franchise isn't compromised because of scheduling and production errors. Lord knows that the poor crew deserves one hell of a vacation at this point.    All that said, do I think that Magia Record's final season will end up doing the spinoff justice? It's tough to say. I've always had a mixed relationship with Magia Record; at its best, it feels like a genuine and compelling expansion of the entire Madoka Magica universe, but at its worst, it becomes borderline incomprehensible. I think the good of the series generally outweighs the bad, though, and if you're at all a fan of the Madoka Magica franchise, I believe (and I hope) that you'll have a mostly good time with Magia Record. Just, you know, make sure to watch the other two seasons first if you're new to the series.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               This episode might as well have been called “30 Minutes of Answers.” In one self-contained flashback, it lays out every major remaining mystery in the series and thoroughly unravels them. However, the way it does this feels completely natural through yet another story of Madoka Magica-themed suffering.    As it goes with most of these stories, it begins with Kyubey preying on Iroha's fears for Ui and tricking her into becoming a magical girl. What's interesting here is that Ui, Nemu, and Touka are able to see through Kyubey's half-truths and uncover what is really going on. And like Madoka in the main series, the three sickly girls figure out the bunny-cat's biggest weakness: he has to grant wishes. He literally can't stop himself.    This, of course, kicks off their search for the perfect wish—or rather, set of wishes—to break Kyubey's system and allow the remaining magical girls to live normally even after all witches are exterminated. Their solution is basically to become Kyubey themselves—feeding the collected energy back into the magical girls rather than keeping it for themselves. The problem is that they never considered what would happen to the one taking in all the negative magical girl emotions—i.e., that they'd become a witch in seconds.    Basically, this episode is a tragedy centered around hubris. The three girls think that after a bit of research they can game the system and save the world. But instead, they arguably make things worse, leading to almost all of the tragedy we've seen in the series so far.    What's truly heartbreaking, though, is the effect that comes from isolating Ui's fractured soul inside of Kyubey. Like with Madoka at the end of the main series, this places her outside of reality—as if she never existed in the first place. This drastically changes the personalities of those closest to her (namely, Touka) and makes the previous seasons gain yet another layer of tragedy in retrospect. All in all, it's a fantastic amalgamation of lore and character building that has me pumped to see where things will go in our final three episodes.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            column          4 comments       This Week in Games - Let's Talk About Kingdom Hearts   Apr 16, 07:53 4 comments                 games    Heidi speculates on wtf is going on in the new Kingdom Hearts game and holy crap Witch on the Holy Night is getting a Western release?! ― Hi folks.

Community score: 3.9              What is this?   In exchange for the fulfillment of a wish, Magical Girls keep fighting, unbeknownst to the rest of the world. But Iroha Tamaki can't seem to remember her wish. There is a gaping hole in her life. Something important has been lost. But she continues to fight every day, without even knowing why. Then, a rumor begins to spread among Magical Girls. Magical Girls can be saved if they go to Kamihama City, the city where Magical Girls and Uwasa are gathering.    Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story is based on a spinoff game of the Puella Magi Madoka Magica anime and streams on Crunchyroll and Funimation.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                I'm just going to get the full title out of the way up top, since it tells you everything you need to know about the show. This is Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story Final Season -The Dawn of the Ephemeral Dream-, a four-episode mini-season that is meant to conclude the nearly three-year-long odyssey of this messy but ambitious Madoka Magica spinoff. It seems odd to call this a “preview"" since in just this one episode we're covering a full quarter of this long-awaited conclusion, but thems the breaks, I suppose.    Going into -The Dawn of the Ephemeral Dream-, the main question on everyone's mind, including mine, is going to be whether or not a mere four-episode arc will be enough to draw the story of Magia Record to a satisfying conclusion. The thing about “We Failed” is that it's a flashback episode, devoted entirely to explaining the origins of the antagonist cadre of Magical Girls known as the Wings of Magius, so we don't get much in the way of narrative progression here. The good news is that, so far as infodump episodes go, “We Failed” is a doozy, answering many of the long-standing mysteries that Magia Record has been dangling over its viewers' heads for the past few years.    Granted, none of these answers are necessarily revelatory; given everything we learned about Ui, Nemu, and Touka last season, it was easy enough to figure out the broad strokes of this backstory ahead of time. Still, seeing everything laid out in a more traditional narrative fashion sure is satisfying for longtime viewers of the series, and it helps to contextualize a lot of elements of the series as we head into Magia Record's final act. The full scope of Ui's disappearance from the world is explained, we understand how all three of the Hospital Gang ended up as Magical Girls in the first place, and how Touka became the Uwasa creating villain that she was in the first two seasons of the show. We even finally get an explanation for Baby Kyubey, and it's a lot more reasonable than I was expecting!    The second season of the show was also notable for its extreme highs and lows in production quality. A few of its episodes ranked among the best spectacle that the franchise has ever delivered, and at the same time, the final entries of the season were stretched so thin that you could practically see the bubblegum and duct tape that the artists at Studio Shaft were using to hold the production together. “We Failed” is by no means the prettiest episode of Madoka Magica ever produced, but it looks solid, and my biggest hope for this extra-short final season is that the overall aesthetic of the franchise isn't compromised because of scheduling and production errors. Lord knows that the poor crew deserves one hell of a vacation at this point.    All that said, do I think that Magia Record's final season will end up doing the spinoff justice? It's tough to say. I've always had a mixed relationship with Magia Record; at its best, it feels like a genuine and compelling expansion of the entire Madoka Magica universe, but at its worst, it becomes borderline incomprehensible. I think the good of the series generally outweighs the bad, though, and if you're at all a fan of the Madoka Magica franchise, I believe (and I hope) that you'll have a mostly good time with Magia Record. Just, you know, make sure to watch the other two seasons first if you're new to the series.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               This episode might as well have been called “30 Minutes of Answers.” In one self-contained flashback, it lays out every major remaining mystery in the series and thoroughly unravels them. However, the way it does this feels completely natural through yet another story of Madoka Magica-themed suffering.    As it goes with most of these stories, it begins with Kyubey preying on Iroha's fears for Ui and tricking her into becoming a magical girl. What's interesting here is that Ui, Nemu, and Touka are able to see through Kyubey's half-truths and uncover what is really going on. And like Madoka in the main series, the three sickly girls figure out the bunny-cat's biggest weakness: he has to grant wishes. He literally can't stop himself.    This, of course, kicks off their search for the perfect wish—or rather, set of wishes—to break Kyubey's system and allow the remaining magical girls to live normally even after all witches are exterminated. Their solution is basically to become Kyubey themselves—feeding the collected energy back into the magical girls rather than keeping it for themselves. The problem is that they never considered what would happen to the one taking in all the negative magical girl emotions—i.e., that they'd become a witch in seconds.    Basically, this episode is a tragedy centered around hubris. The three girls think that after a bit of research they can game the system and save the world. But instead, they arguably make things worse, leading to almost all of the tragedy we've seen in the series so far.    What's truly heartbreaking, though, is the effect that comes from isolating Ui's fractured soul inside of Kyubey. Like with Madoka at the end of the main series, this places her outside of reality—as if she never existed in the first place. This drastically changes the personalities of those closest to her (namely, Touka) and makes the previous seasons gain yet another layer of tragedy in retrospect. All in all, it's a fantastic amalgamation of lore and character building that has me pumped to see where things will go in our final three episodes.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            column          4 comments       This Week in Games - Let's Talk About Kingdom Hearts   Apr 16, 07:53 4 comments                 games    Heidi speculates on wtf is going on in the new Kingdom Hearts game and holy crap Witch on the Holy Night is getting a Western release?! ― Hi folks.

Community score: 4.0                  How would you rate episode 12 of Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story (TV 3) ?                     Community score: 3.9              What is this?   In exchange for the fulfillment of a wish, Magical Girls keep fighting, unbeknownst to the rest of the world. But Iroha Tamaki can't seem to remember her wish. There is a gaping hole in her life. Something important has been lost. But she continues to fight every day, without even knowing why. Then, a rumor begins to spread among Magical Girls. Magical Girls can be saved if they go to Kamihama City, the city where Magical Girls and Uwasa are gathering.    Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story is based on a spinoff game of the Puella Magi Madoka Magica anime and streams on Crunchyroll and Funimation.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                I'm just going to get the full title out of the way up top, since it tells you everything you need to know about the show. This is Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story Final Season -The Dawn of the Ephemeral Dream-, a four-episode mini-season that is meant to conclude the nearly three-year-long odyssey of this messy but ambitious Madoka Magica spinoff. It seems odd to call this a “preview"" since in just this one episode we're covering a full quarter of this long-awaited conclusion, but thems the breaks, I suppose.    Going into -The Dawn of the Ephemeral Dream-, the main question on everyone's mind, including mine, is going to be whether or not a mere four-episode arc will be enough to draw the story of Magia Record to a satisfying conclusion. The thing about “We Failed” is that it's a flashback episode, devoted entirely to explaining the origins of the antagonist cadre of Magical Girls known as the Wings of Magius, so we don't get much in the way of narrative progression here. The good news is that, so far as infodump episodes go, “We Failed” is a doozy, answering many of the long-standing mysteries that Magia Record has been dangling over its viewers' heads for the past few years.    Granted, none of these answers are necessarily revelatory; given everything we learned about Ui, Nemu, and Touka last season, it was easy enough to figure out the broad strokes of this backstory ahead of time. Still, seeing everything laid out in a more traditional narrative fashion sure is satisfying for longtime viewers of the series, and it helps to contextualize a lot of elements of the series as we head into Magia Record's final act. The full scope of Ui's disappearance from the world is explained, we understand how all three of the Hospital Gang ended up as Magical Girls in the first place, and how Touka became the Uwasa creating villain that she was in the first two seasons of the show. We even finally get an explanation for Baby Kyubey, and it's a lot more reasonable than I was expecting!    The second season of the show was also notable for its extreme highs and lows in production quality. A few of its episodes ranked among the best spectacle that the franchise has ever delivered, and at the same time, the final entries of the season were stretched so thin that you could practically see the bubblegum and duct tape that the artists at Studio Shaft were using to hold the production together. “We Failed” is by no means the prettiest episode of Madoka Magica ever produced, but it looks solid, and my biggest hope for this extra-short final season is that the overall aesthetic of the franchise isn't compromised because of scheduling and production errors. Lord knows that the poor crew deserves one hell of a vacation at this point.    All that said, do I think that Magia Record's final season will end up doing the spinoff justice? It's tough to say. I've always had a mixed relationship with Magia Record; at its best, it feels like a genuine and compelling expansion of the entire Madoka Magica universe, but at its worst, it becomes borderline incomprehensible. I think the good of the series generally outweighs the bad, though, and if you're at all a fan of the Madoka Magica franchise, I believe (and I hope) that you'll have a mostly good time with Magia Record. Just, you know, make sure to watch the other two seasons first if you're new to the series.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               This episode might as well have been called “30 Minutes of Answers.” In one self-contained flashback, it lays out every major remaining mystery in the series and thoroughly unravels them. However, the way it does this feels completely natural through yet another story of Madoka Magica-themed suffering.    As it goes with most of these stories, it begins with Kyubey preying on Iroha's fears for Ui and tricking her into becoming a magical girl. What's interesting here is that Ui, Nemu, and Touka are able to see through Kyubey's half-truths and uncover what is really going on. And like Madoka in the main series, the three sickly girls figure out the bunny-cat's biggest weakness: he has to grant wishes. He literally can't stop himself.    This, of course, kicks off their search for the perfect wish—or rather, set of wishes—to break Kyubey's system and allow the remaining magical girls to live normally even after all witches are exterminated. Their solution is basically to become Kyubey themselves—feeding the collected energy back into the magical girls rather than keeping it for themselves. The problem is that they never considered what would happen to the one taking in all the negative magical girl emotions—i.e., that they'd become a witch in seconds.    Basically, this episode is a tragedy centered around hubris. The three girls think that after a bit of research they can game the system and save the world. But instead, they arguably make things worse, leading to almost all of the tragedy we've seen in the series so far.    What's truly heartbreaking, though, is the effect that comes from isolating Ui's fractured soul inside of Kyubey. Like with Madoka at the end of the main series, this places her outside of reality—as if she never existed in the first place. This drastically changes the personalities of those closest to her (namely, Touka) and makes the previous seasons gain yet another layer of tragedy in retrospect. All in all, it's a fantastic amalgamation of lore and character building that has me pumped to see where things will go in our final three episodes.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            column          4 comments       This Week in Games - Let's Talk About Kingdom Hearts   Apr 16, 07:53 4 comments                 games    Heidi speculates on wtf is going on in the new Kingdom Hearts game and holy crap Witch on the Holy Night is getting a Western release?! ― Hi folks.

The good news is that, so far as infodump episodes go, “We Failed” is a doozy, answering many of the long-standing mysteries that Magia Record has been dangling over its viewers' heads for the past few years.    Granted, none of these answers are necessarily revelatory; given everything we learned about Ui, Nemu, and Touka last season, it was easy enough to figure out the broad strokes of this backstory ahead of time. Still, seeing everything laid out in a more traditional narrative fashion sure is satisfying for longtime viewers of the series, and it helps to contextualize a lot of elements of the series as we head into Magia Record's final act. The full scope of Ui's disappearance from the world is explained, we understand how all three of the Hospital Gang ended up as Magical Girls in the first place, and how Touka became the Uwasa creating villain that she was in the first two seasons of the show. We even finally get an explanation for Baby Kyubey, and it's a lot more reasonable than I was expecting!    The second season of the show was also notable for its extreme highs and lows in production quality. A few of its episodes ranked among the best spectacle that the franchise has ever delivered, and at the same time, the final entries of the season were stretched so thin that you could practically see the bubblegum and duct tape that the artists at Studio Shaft were using to hold the production together. “We Failed” is by no means the prettiest episode of Madoka Magica ever produced, but it looks solid, and my biggest hope for this extra-short final season is that the overall aesthetic of the franchise isn't compromised because of scheduling and production errors. Lord knows that the poor crew deserves one hell of a vacation at this point.    All that said, do I think that Magia Record's final season will end up doing the spinoff justice? It's tough to say. I've always had a mixed relationship with Magia Record; at its best, it feels like a genuine and compelling expansion of the entire Madoka Magica universe, but at its worst, it becomes borderline incomprehensible. I think the good of the series generally outweighs the bad, though, and if you're at all a fan of the Madoka Magica franchise, I believe (and I hope) that you'll have a mostly good time with Magia Record. Just, you know, make sure to watch the other two seasons first if you're new to the series.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               This episode might as well have been called “30 Minutes of Answers.” In one self-contained flashback, it lays out every major remaining mystery in the series and thoroughly unravels them. However, the way it does this feels completely natural through yet another story of Madoka Magica-themed suffering.    As it goes with most of these stories, it begins with Kyubey preying on Iroha's fears for Ui and tricking her into becoming a magical girl. What's interesting here is that Ui, Nemu, and Touka are able to see through Kyubey's half-truths and uncover what is really going on. And like Madoka in the main series, the three sickly girls figure out the bunny-cat's biggest weakness: he has to grant wishes. He literally can't stop himself.    This, of course, kicks off their search for the perfect wish—or rather, set of wishes—to break Kyubey's system and allow the remaining magical girls to live normally even after all witches are exterminated. Their solution is basically to become Kyubey themselves—feeding the collected energy back into the magical girls rather than keeping it for themselves. The problem is that they never considered what would happen to the one taking in all the negative magical girl emotions—i.e., that they'd become a witch in seconds.    Basically, this episode is a tragedy centered around hubris. The three girls think that after a bit of research they can game the system and save the world. But instead, they arguably make things worse, leading to almost all of the tragedy we've seen in the series so far.    What's truly heartbreaking, though, is the effect that comes from isolating Ui's fractured soul inside of Kyubey. Like with Madoka at the end of the main series, this places her outside of reality—as if she never existed in the first place. This drastically changes the personalities of those closest to her (namely, Touka) and makes the previous seasons gain yet another layer of tragedy in retrospect. All in all, it's a fantastic amalgamation of lore and character building that has me pumped to see where things will go in our final three episodes.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story is based on a spinoff game of the Puella Magi Madoka Magica anime and streams on Crunchyroll and Funimation.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                I'm just going to get the full title out of the way up top, since it tells you everything you need to know about the show. This is Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story Final Season -The Dawn of the Ephemeral Dream-, a four-episode mini-season that is meant to conclude the nearly three-year-long odyssey of this messy but ambitious Madoka Magica spinoff. It seems odd to call this a “preview"" since in just this one episode we're covering a full quarter of this long-awaited conclusion, but thems the breaks, I suppose.    Going into -The Dawn of the Ephemeral Dream-, the main question on everyone's mind, including mine, is going to be whether or not a mere four-episode arc will be enough to draw the story of Magia Record to a satisfying conclusion. The thing about “We Failed” is that it's a flashback episode, devoted entirely to explaining the origins of the antagonist cadre of Magical Girls known as the Wings of Magius, so we don't get much in the way of narrative progression here. The good news is that, so far as infodump episodes go, “We Failed” is a doozy, answering many of the long-standing mysteries that Magia Record has been dangling over its viewers' heads for the past few years.    Granted, none of these answers are necessarily revelatory; given everything we learned about Ui, Nemu, and Touka last season, it was easy enough to figure out the broad strokes of this backstory ahead of time. Still, seeing everything laid out in a more traditional narrative fashion sure is satisfying for longtime viewers of the series, and it helps to contextualize a lot of elements of the series as we head into Magia Record's final act. The full scope of Ui's disappearance from the world is explained, we understand how all three of the Hospital Gang ended up as Magical Girls in the first place, and how Touka became the Uwasa creating villain that she was in the first two seasons of the show. We even finally get an explanation for Baby Kyubey, and it's a lot more reasonable than I was expecting!    The second season of the show was also notable for its extreme highs and lows in production quality. A few of its episodes ranked among the best spectacle that the franchise has ever delivered, and at the same time, the final entries of the season were stretched so thin that you could practically see the bubblegum and duct tape that the artists at Studio Shaft were using to hold the production together. “We Failed” is by no means the prettiest episode of Madoka Magica ever produced, but it looks solid, and my biggest hope for this extra-short final season is that the overall aesthetic of the franchise isn't compromised because of scheduling and production errors. Lord knows that the poor crew deserves one hell of a vacation at this point.    All that said, do I think that Magia Record's final season will end up doing the spinoff justice? It's tough to say. I've always had a mixed relationship with Magia Record; at its best, it feels like a genuine and compelling expansion of the entire Madoka Magica universe, but at its worst, it becomes borderline incomprehensible. I think the good of the series generally outweighs the bad, though, and if you're at all a fan of the Madoka Magica franchise, I believe (and I hope) that you'll have a mostly good time with Magia Record. Just, you know, make sure to watch the other two seasons first if you're new to the series.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               This episode might as well have been called “30 Minutes of Answers.” In one self-contained flashback, it lays out every major remaining mystery in the series and thoroughly unravels them. However, the way it does this feels completely natural through yet another story of Madoka Magica-themed suffering.    As it goes with most of these stories, it begins with Kyubey preying on Iroha's fears for Ui and tricking her into becoming a magical girl. What's interesting here is that Ui, Nemu, and Touka are able to see through Kyubey's half-truths and uncover what is really going on. And like Madoka in the main series, the three sickly girls figure out the bunny-cat's biggest weakness: he has to grant wishes. He literally can't stop himself.    This, of course, kicks off their search for the perfect wish—or rather, set of wishes—to break Kyubey's system and allow the remaining magical girls to live normally even after all witches are exterminated. Their solution is basically to become Kyubey themselves—feeding the collected energy back into the magical girls rather than keeping it for themselves. The problem is that they never considered what would happen to the one taking in all the negative magical girl emotions—i.e., that they'd become a witch in seconds.    Basically, this episode is a tragedy centered around hubris. The three girls think that after a bit of research they can game the system and save the world. But instead, they arguably make things worse, leading to almost all of the tragedy we've seen in the series so far.    What's truly heartbreaking, though, is the effect that comes from isolating Ui's fractured soul inside of Kyubey. Like with Madoka at the end of the main series, this places her outside of reality—as if she never existed in the first place. This drastically changes the personalities of those closest to her (namely, Touka) and makes the previous seasons gain yet another layer of tragedy in retrospect.

But instead, they arguably make things worse, leading to almost all of the tragedy we've seen in the series so far.    What's truly heartbreaking, though, is the effect that comes from isolating Ui's fractured soul inside of Kyubey. Like with Madoka at the end of the main series, this places her outside of reality—as if she never existed in the first place. This drastically changes the personalities of those closest to her (namely, Touka) and makes the previous seasons gain yet another layer of tragedy in retrospect. All in all, it's a fantastic amalgamation of lore and character building that has me pumped to see where things will go in our final three episodes.

Community score: 3.7              What is this?   Aoi Ashito is a third year middle school student from Ehime. Behind his raw game hides his immense talent but Ashito suffers a huge setback because of his overly straightforward personality. The youth team manager of J1 club Tokyo City Esperion, Fukuda Tetsuya, appears in front of Ashito. Fukuda sees Ashito's limitless potential and invites him to take part in his team's tryouts in Tokyo. The story of the boy who will revolutionize football in Japan rapidly begins to unfold. (from manga)   Aoashi is based on Yūgo Kobayashi's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Aoashi is the fourth sports anime to debut this season, and fortuitously enough, its arrival divides them into perfect even groups. Birdie Wing and Fanfare of Adolescence are anime-ass anime, cheerfully over the top and full of pretty people doing ridiculous things. Love All Play and Aoashi are on the more grounded end of the spectrum, focusing on promising young men with capabilities well within the range of real humans, recruited for their talents to join top teams in high school.    If you were to choose just one sports anime, I'd say go with Birdie Wing all the way. And then if you said, “No, that series is too goofy, give me something more realistic,” I'd say something mildly insulting about your taste because who doesn't want a clandestine mini-golf match where the opponent is wearing a clown mask? And then you'd say, “That's unnecessary and rude, Caitlin, because taste is subjective,” and you know what? You'd be right. So I'd say between Love All Play and Aoashi, the latter is certainly the more promising of the two, largely because Ashito is the more interesting of the two protagonists.    He's cut from a similar cloth to a lot of other sports protagonists: a big fish in a small pond, gifted but raw, and arrogant. Oh, and yelly. I think about half of his lines are screaming. He could easily have become obnoxious and unpleasant to watch, but he's also unusually self-aware, and thrives because he has teammates who aren't put off by his over-the-top confidence and instead work to support him. He's the second son of a single mother, who he loves dearly. It's the foundation of a decently compelling, flawed protagonist if he doesn't rub you the wrong way, but rest assured, he will rub some people the wrong way, both within the story and among the audience.    There's not a whole lot of actual soccer this episode, though. Ashito gets kicked out of his match at the start of the episode pretty quickly, and he spends the rest of the runtime practicing a particular technique solo on the beach. There's some talk of strategy and technique, but to be honest, as a non-sports watcher, it pretty much flew over my head. Or maybe I just wasn't interested enough to try to understand, but when it comes to entertainment value, those are effectively the same thing.    As was the case with its cohort, Aoashi's premiere is all table setting for the actual plot to get going. It's a perfectly acceptable start to a series I'm not particularly interested in.       James Beckett  Rating:               What a pleasant surprise this was! I love it when a sports anime can dish up satisfying drama off the field as well as on, and while it took me a while to warm up to Aoashi, I eventually found myself intrigued by Ashito Aoi's story. I imagine that this is a show that will play even better to folks that have an appreciation for the ins and outs of soccer, but if a total neophyte like me can get something out of Aoashi, then it must be doing something right.    At first, I was as little annoyed with Ashito, and I didn't expect to have much love for him as a protagonist. He's cocky, overbearing, and unapologetically self-centered in a way that is maybe too accurate to some of the teens I deal with in the real world on an everyday basis. Thankfully, though, Aoashi leans into Ashito's personality in a way that takes advantage of his flaws and strengths in an interesting way. Sure, he's got an ego the size of a Goodyear blimp, but he also has the skills to back it up, and his impromptu training session with Tatsuya later in the episode reveals that he isn't at all ungrateful or ignorant of his teammates' skills and efforts. He demands attention and priority on the field mostly because he knows he can play circles around anybody else, but his love for the sport itself seems very pure. This gives the kid a lot of room to grow over the course of the story, which bodes well for the future.    It also helps that the episode goes on to make Ashito much more sympathetic than he might seem at first glance, and all of the side-characters around him are well-developed enough to complement his story. When Ashito ruins the game (and his chances of getting recruited to a popular high school), it seems like he is doing the usual thing where he lets some bully's taunts about his skills get the better of him. It isn't until later that the bully, genuinely full of remorse, confesses that Ashito lashed out because he was defending his mother, who herself is a well-drawn character, a stern but obviously loving single parent who struggles to make ends meet in the backwater town that her family is stuck in. Outside of Tatsuya and Ashito, none of the other kids or adults have anything revolutionary going on, but it's clear that every person in this story has their own goals and dreams; they all feel very human.    I'll admit that, when the show gets way into the weeds with the soccer mechanics and whatnot, I found myself a little lost, but to Aoashi's credit, the training scenes and play-by-play recaps were at least comprehensible to me, despite the fact that I haven't played a game of soccer since the fourth grade. Besides, when the episode ended, I was honestly excited to see whether or not Ashito would succeed in the Tokyo tryouts and make it into Tatsuya's junior league team – which is a pretty high mark of excellence for a story like this, since we all know that Ashito has to succeed in some way or another for the plot to move forward. In short, Aoashi is a sports anime that can take well-worn tropes and archetypes and spin them into a product that still has heart, and that counts for a lot. Enough for me to give it a hearty recommendation, at least.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               On one level, Aoashi is very much like your run-of-the-mill sports anime. We have a naturally-talented protagonist in Ashito who believes if he tries hard enough, he can overcome anything. This, of course, has made him arrogant and self-centered—proudly proclaiming his skills to anyone who will listen. He's very much the biggest fish in a very small pond.    Luckily, that's not all there is to Ashito, and almost the entirety of this first episode is dedicated to demonstrating that. Despite his oversized ego, his time on his middle school team has taught him the importance of teamwork. He is well aware that the only reason he is able to make the plays he does is because everyone is working together to give him the openings he needs. And while he does have skills, he lacks training; one night with a high-level coach is enough to improve his game drastically, and he is driven enough to put the hard work in when challenged. But, as we discover, his true talent lies in his spatial awareness—an oft-overlooked but incredibly valuable skill in any team sport. Ashito knows not only exactly where his teammates are but where members of the opposing team are positioned as well. He is in the right place at the right time so often not due to luck, but because he makes sure he is there when the opening comes.    But, despite his love of soccer, Ashito has a shadow looming over his life: he's poor. Even though they are living out in the country, his single mother and older brother can barely provide for him on a daily basis. His ragged shoes are the perfect indicator of this. And its the fact that the opposing goalie bad- mouths his mother and their financial situation that causes him to lose his cool. A personal attack on him or even his team he can stand. One on the woman who is struggling to keep a roof over his head and food on the table? That's his breaking point.    It's not hard to feel for him when, even though he is actively being scouted to tryout for a team in Tokyo, he knows it is impossible. His mom explodes at him for even considering the idea, but it's clear that her anger isn't directed at him, but rather at her own perceived failure of not being able to follow up on the opportunities he has earned. It's heartbreaking. No good parent wants to see their child miss out on a chance like that, and while we know that he'll obviously get his shot and make the team (there wouldn't be much of an anime if he didn't), that doesn't make the drama any less effective or well-executed. If sports anime are your thing, you should probably give this one a try.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                It's tempting to simply slot Aoashi protagonist Ashito into the same slot as characters like Sakaki from Futsal Boys!!!!! and Kageyama from Haikyu!! – the guy who doesn't think that there are any other players on the team, and if there are, well, they're just around to make him shine brighter. And really, that's what most people seem to have thought about him from the get-go; he's got a reputation as a ball hog and, if that jerk kid on the other team is to be believed, that rep has gotten him booted off plenty of soccer teams in the past. We start to get a hint that such is not the case when he headbutts the jerk after what we're allowed to assume are imprecations against Ashito's current teammates, because if the other boys are just props for his glory, then why would he bother to defend them? But it turns out that that's misdirection as well, and the result is a first episode that manages to go just enough above and beyond to hook viewers to make it stand out among the other three sports shows (four, if you count Dance Dance Danseur, which is likely to run similarly to a sports show) airing this season.    Lest you think Aoashi is reinventing the wheel, it really isn't. It's still a story about a kid who loves his sport, is good at it, and dreams of playing on much larger stages. Mostly it's just got a bit more turmoil for its protagonist, which doesn't feel as manufactured as, say, Love All Play's drama. The two biggest barriers to Ashito's success are people's misconceptions about his playstyle and that his family simply doesn't have the money to fund his dreams. It's the latter actually sets him off – the jerk kid doesn't stop with insulting his teammates, he moves on to a particularly cruel blow about how poor the Aoi family is while making unkind insinuations about Ashito's mom. Ashito knows that he needs backing from someone else to be able to play at the level he wants to, and there's a sense that his devotion to the game is both from his love for it and because he has to get really, really good if he wants to attract the assistance he needs. And maybe there's a bit of an escape from his mother in there, too – she's clearly worn out and stressed, which comes across as mean, with older brother Shun stepping in to be the supportive figure in Ashito's life. But really, can you blame their mom for worrying?    I'm not thrilled with the way that the episode relies more on still shots than animated soccer action, but I think the story may make this worth following. It's varied the usual sports flavor just enough to make it stand out a bit, and while I don't care much about soccer, I am interested in seeing where Ashito's story takes him.     Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                It's Sports O'Clock again, and we're back at it with another show about young athletes following their dreams. This has been an inconsistent season for sports premieres, with Birdie Wing delivering some goofy fun and Love All Play not delivering much of anything. This soccer show, meanwhile, lands somewhere in the middle of those extremes. It's much more conventional (and less entertaining) than the underground golf clowns, but it's a heck of a lot more competent than the badminton boys.    Whether or not you enjoy this one is gonna come down to how much you like Ashito, our central, shouty soccer boy. I like to think I have a pretty high tolerance for loud-mouth shonen heroes who act before they think, but even I found myself getting annoyed by his constant yelling. Maybe it's just that his voice actor sounds really close to Natsuki Hanae's Tanjiro voice in Demon Slayer, and I'm just sick of that particular cadence. Either way, I found the circumstances around him a lot more engaging than the boy himself. It's interesting that he comes from a single-parent home, one that's struggling financially, and that does tangibly effect him. He's defensive of his mother and the (implied to be disreputable) work she does to feed him and his brother, and their financial situation means it's a lot harder for him to follow his big shonen dreams of soccer stardom. That's some good, solid drama that could help the show standout against countless other soccer shows.    And that's important, because basically everything else in this premiere is by-the-book sports anime material. You've got the unconventional coach with a tragic pro-sports backstory who happens upon our diamond in the rough main character. You've got Ashito doing an all-night training session in order to pass the arbitrary test said-coach assigned him. Really the only tweak to the formula is the reveal that Ashito is more aware and intelligent on the field than his seemingly spontaneous playstyle would suggest, and that'll only become important once he actually joins the Youth team in the coming episodes. We only get a few minutes of actual soccer being played, but it looks pretty solid – certainly better than Farewell, My Dear Cramer ever did – so that low bar has been cleared.    Overall, while there's some intriguing twists to Ashito's character, the rest of this feels like your standard sports fodder without a whole lot to draw you in. It's competent, successful even, but it doesn't inspire the same kind of excitement you can get from the best of these shows. If you have a love of soccer and a tolerance for loud anime boys, it may be worth your time.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            column          4 comments       This Week in Games - Let's Talk About Kingdom Hearts   Apr 16, 07:53 4 comments                 games    Heidi speculates on wtf is going on in the new Kingdom Hearts game and holy crap Witch on the Holy Night is getting a Western release?! ― Hi folks.

Community score: 3.7              What is this?   Aoi Ashito is a third year middle school student from Ehime. Behind his raw game hides his immense talent but Ashito suffers a huge setback because of his overly straightforward personality. The youth team manager of J1 club Tokyo City Esperion, Fukuda Tetsuya, appears in front of Ashito. Fukuda sees Ashito's limitless potential and invites him to take part in his team's tryouts in Tokyo. The story of the boy who will revolutionize football in Japan rapidly begins to unfold. (from manga)   Aoashi is based on Yūgo Kobayashi's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Aoashi is the fourth sports anime to debut this season, and fortuitously enough, its arrival divides them into perfect even groups. Birdie Wing and Fanfare of Adolescence are anime-ass anime, cheerfully over the top and full of pretty people doing ridiculous things. Love All Play and Aoashi are on the more grounded end of the spectrum, focusing on promising young men with capabilities well within the range of real humans, recruited for their talents to join top teams in high school.    If you were to choose just one sports anime, I'd say go with Birdie Wing all the way. And then if you said, “No, that series is too goofy, give me something more realistic,” I'd say something mildly insulting about your taste because who doesn't want a clandestine mini-golf match where the opponent is wearing a clown mask? And then you'd say, “That's unnecessary and rude, Caitlin, because taste is subjective,” and you know what? You'd be right. So I'd say between Love All Play and Aoashi, the latter is certainly the more promising of the two, largely because Ashito is the more interesting of the two protagonists.    He's cut from a similar cloth to a lot of other sports protagonists: a big fish in a small pond, gifted but raw, and arrogant. Oh, and yelly. I think about half of his lines are screaming. He could easily have become obnoxious and unpleasant to watch, but he's also unusually self-aware, and thrives because he has teammates who aren't put off by his over-the-top confidence and instead work to support him. He's the second son of a single mother, who he loves dearly. It's the foundation of a decently compelling, flawed protagonist if he doesn't rub you the wrong way, but rest assured, he will rub some people the wrong way, both within the story and among the audience.    There's not a whole lot of actual soccer this episode, though. Ashito gets kicked out of his match at the start of the episode pretty quickly, and he spends the rest of the runtime practicing a particular technique solo on the beach. There's some talk of strategy and technique, but to be honest, as a non-sports watcher, it pretty much flew over my head. Or maybe I just wasn't interested enough to try to understand, but when it comes to entertainment value, those are effectively the same thing.    As was the case with its cohort, Aoashi's premiere is all table setting for the actual plot to get going. It's a perfectly acceptable start to a series I'm not particularly interested in.       James Beckett  Rating:               What a pleasant surprise this was! I love it when a sports anime can dish up satisfying drama off the field as well as on, and while it took me a while to warm up to Aoashi, I eventually found myself intrigued by Ashito Aoi's story. I imagine that this is a show that will play even better to folks that have an appreciation for the ins and outs of soccer, but if a total neophyte like me can get something out of Aoashi, then it must be doing something right.    At first, I was as little annoyed with Ashito, and I didn't expect to have much love for him as a protagonist. He's cocky, overbearing, and unapologetically self-centered in a way that is maybe too accurate to some of the teens I deal with in the real world on an everyday basis. Thankfully, though, Aoashi leans into Ashito's personality in a way that takes advantage of his flaws and strengths in an interesting way. Sure, he's got an ego the size of a Goodyear blimp, but he also has the skills to back it up, and his impromptu training session with Tatsuya later in the episode reveals that he isn't at all ungrateful or ignorant of his teammates' skills and efforts. He demands attention and priority on the field mostly because he knows he can play circles around anybody else, but his love for the sport itself seems very pure. This gives the kid a lot of room to grow over the course of the story, which bodes well for the future.    It also helps that the episode goes on to make Ashito much more sympathetic than he might seem at first glance, and all of the side-characters around him are well-developed enough to complement his story. When Ashito ruins the game (and his chances of getting recruited to a popular high school), it seems like he is doing the usual thing where he lets some bully's taunts about his skills get the better of him. It isn't until later that the bully, genuinely full of remorse, confesses that Ashito lashed out because he was defending his mother, who herself is a well-drawn character, a stern but obviously loving single parent who struggles to make ends meet in the backwater town that her family is stuck in. Outside of Tatsuya and Ashito, none of the other kids or adults have anything revolutionary going on, but it's clear that every person in this story has their own goals and dreams; they all feel very human.    I'll admit that, when the show gets way into the weeds with the soccer mechanics and whatnot, I found myself a little lost, but to Aoashi's credit, the training scenes and play-by-play recaps were at least comprehensible to me, despite the fact that I haven't played a game of soccer since the fourth grade. Besides, when the episode ended, I was honestly excited to see whether or not Ashito would succeed in the Tokyo tryouts and make it into Tatsuya's junior league team – which is a pretty high mark of excellence for a story like this, since we all know that Ashito has to succeed in some way or another for the plot to move forward. In short, Aoashi is a sports anime that can take well-worn tropes and archetypes and spin them into a product that still has heart, and that counts for a lot. Enough for me to give it a hearty recommendation, at least.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               On one level, Aoashi is very much like your run-of-the-mill sports anime. We have a naturally-talented protagonist in Ashito who believes if he tries hard enough, he can overcome anything. This, of course, has made him arrogant and self-centered—proudly proclaiming his skills to anyone who will listen. He's very much the biggest fish in a very small pond.    Luckily, that's not all there is to Ashito, and almost the entirety of this first episode is dedicated to demonstrating that. Despite his oversized ego, his time on his middle school team has taught him the importance of teamwork. He is well aware that the only reason he is able to make the plays he does is because everyone is working together to give him the openings he needs. And while he does have skills, he lacks training; one night with a high-level coach is enough to improve his game drastically, and he is driven enough to put the hard work in when challenged. But, as we discover, his true talent lies in his spatial awareness—an oft-overlooked but incredibly valuable skill in any team sport. Ashito knows not only exactly where his teammates are but where members of the opposing team are positioned as well. He is in the right place at the right time so often not due to luck, but because he makes sure he is there when the opening comes.    But, despite his love of soccer, Ashito has a shadow looming over his life: he's poor. Even though they are living out in the country, his single mother and older brother can barely provide for him on a daily basis. His ragged shoes are the perfect indicator of this. And its the fact that the opposing goalie bad- mouths his mother and their financial situation that causes him to lose his cool. A personal attack on him or even his team he can stand. One on the woman who is struggling to keep a roof over his head and food on the table? That's his breaking point.    It's not hard to feel for him when, even though he is actively being scouted to tryout for a team in Tokyo, he knows it is impossible. His mom explodes at him for even considering the idea, but it's clear that her anger isn't directed at him, but rather at her own perceived failure of not being able to follow up on the opportunities he has earned. It's heartbreaking. No good parent wants to see their child miss out on a chance like that, and while we know that he'll obviously get his shot and make the team (there wouldn't be much of an anime if he didn't), that doesn't make the drama any less effective or well-executed. If sports anime are your thing, you should probably give this one a try.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                It's tempting to simply slot Aoashi protagonist Ashito into the same slot as characters like Sakaki from Futsal Boys!!!!! and Kageyama from Haikyu!! – the guy who doesn't think that there are any other players on the team, and if there are, well, they're just around to make him shine brighter. And really, that's what most people seem to have thought about him from the get-go; he's got a reputation as a ball hog and, if that jerk kid on the other team is to be believed, that rep has gotten him booted off plenty of soccer teams in the past. We start to get a hint that such is not the case when he headbutts the jerk after what we're allowed to assume are imprecations against Ashito's current teammates, because if the other boys are just props for his glory, then why would he bother to defend them? But it turns out that that's misdirection as well, and the result is a first episode that manages to go just enough above and beyond to hook viewers to make it stand out among the other three sports shows (four, if you count Dance Dance Danseur, which is likely to run similarly to a sports show) airing this season.    Lest you think Aoashi is reinventing the wheel, it really isn't. It's still a story about a kid who loves his sport, is good at it, and dreams of playing on much larger stages. Mostly it's just got a bit more turmoil for its protagonist, which doesn't feel as manufactured as, say, Love All Play's drama. The two biggest barriers to Ashito's success are people's misconceptions about his playstyle and that his family simply doesn't have the money to fund his dreams. It's the latter actually sets him off – the jerk kid doesn't stop with insulting his teammates, he moves on to a particularly cruel blow about how poor the Aoi family is while making unkind insinuations about Ashito's mom. Ashito knows that he needs backing from someone else to be able to play at the level he wants to, and there's a sense that his devotion to the game is both from his love for it and because he has to get really, really good if he wants to attract the assistance he needs. And maybe there's a bit of an escape from his mother in there, too – she's clearly worn out and stressed, which comes across as mean, with older brother Shun stepping in to be the supportive figure in Ashito's life. But really, can you blame their mom for worrying?    I'm not thrilled with the way that the episode relies more on still shots than animated soccer action, but I think the story may make this worth following. It's varied the usual sports flavor just enough to make it stand out a bit, and while I don't care much about soccer, I am interested in seeing where Ashito's story takes him.     Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                It's Sports O'Clock again, and we're back at it with another show about young athletes following their dreams. This has been an inconsistent season for sports premieres, with Birdie Wing delivering some goofy fun and Love All Play not delivering much of anything. This soccer show, meanwhile, lands somewhere in the middle of those extremes. It's much more conventional (and less entertaining) than the underground golf clowns, but it's a heck of a lot more competent than the badminton boys.    Whether or not you enjoy this one is gonna come down to how much you like Ashito, our central, shouty soccer boy. I like to think I have a pretty high tolerance for loud-mouth shonen heroes who act before they think, but even I found myself getting annoyed by his constant yelling. Maybe it's just that his voice actor sounds really close to Natsuki Hanae's Tanjiro voice in Demon Slayer, and I'm just sick of that particular cadence. Either way, I found the circumstances around him a lot more engaging than the boy himself. It's interesting that he comes from a single-parent home, one that's struggling financially, and that does tangibly effect him. He's defensive of his mother and the (implied to be disreputable) work she does to feed him and his brother, and their financial situation means it's a lot harder for him to follow his big shonen dreams of soccer stardom. That's some good, solid drama that could help the show standout against countless other soccer shows.    And that's important, because basically everything else in this premiere is by-the-book sports anime material. You've got the unconventional coach with a tragic pro-sports backstory who happens upon our diamond in the rough main character. You've got Ashito doing an all-night training session in order to pass the arbitrary test said-coach assigned him. Really the only tweak to the formula is the reveal that Ashito is more aware and intelligent on the field than his seemingly spontaneous playstyle would suggest, and that'll only become important once he actually joins the Youth team in the coming episodes. We only get a few minutes of actual soccer being played, but it looks pretty solid – certainly better than Farewell, My Dear Cramer ever did – so that low bar has been cleared.    Overall, while there's some intriguing twists to Ashito's character, the rest of this feels like your standard sports fodder without a whole lot to draw you in. It's competent, successful even, but it doesn't inspire the same kind of excitement you can get from the best of these shows. If you have a love of soccer and a tolerance for loud anime boys, it may be worth your time.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            column          4 comments       This Week in Games - Let's Talk About Kingdom Hearts   Apr 16, 07:53 4 comments                 games    Heidi speculates on wtf is going on in the new Kingdom Hearts game and holy crap Witch on the Holy Night is getting a Western release?! ― Hi folks.

Community score: 3.7              What is this?   Aoi Ashito is a third year middle school student from Ehime. Behind his raw game hides his immense talent but Ashito suffers a huge setback because of his overly straightforward personality. The youth team manager of J1 club Tokyo City Esperion, Fukuda Tetsuya, appears in front of Ashito. Fukuda sees Ashito's limitless potential and invites him to take part in his team's tryouts in Tokyo. The story of the boy who will revolutionize football in Japan rapidly begins to unfold. (from manga)   Aoashi is based on Yūgo Kobayashi's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Aoashi is the fourth sports anime to debut this season, and fortuitously enough, its arrival divides them into perfect even groups. Birdie Wing and Fanfare of Adolescence are anime-ass anime, cheerfully over the top and full of pretty people doing ridiculous things. Love All Play and Aoashi are on the more grounded end of the spectrum, focusing on promising young men with capabilities well within the range of real humans, recruited for their talents to join top teams in high school.    If you were to choose just one sports anime, I'd say go with Birdie Wing all the way. And then if you said, “No, that series is too goofy, give me something more realistic,” I'd say something mildly insulting about your taste because who doesn't want a clandestine mini-golf match where the opponent is wearing a clown mask? And then you'd say, “That's unnecessary and rude, Caitlin, because taste is subjective,” and you know what? You'd be right. So I'd say between Love All Play and Aoashi, the latter is certainly the more promising of the two, largely because Ashito is the more interesting of the two protagonists.    He's cut from a similar cloth to a lot of other sports protagonists: a big fish in a small pond, gifted but raw, and arrogant. Oh, and yelly. I think about half of his lines are screaming. He could easily have become obnoxious and unpleasant to watch, but he's also unusually self-aware, and thrives because he has teammates who aren't put off by his over-the-top confidence and instead work to support him. He's the second son of a single mother, who he loves dearly. It's the foundation of a decently compelling, flawed protagonist if he doesn't rub you the wrong way, but rest assured, he will rub some people the wrong way, both within the story and among the audience.    There's not a whole lot of actual soccer this episode, though. Ashito gets kicked out of his match at the start of the episode pretty quickly, and he spends the rest of the runtime practicing a particular technique solo on the beach. There's some talk of strategy and technique, but to be honest, as a non-sports watcher, it pretty much flew over my head. Or maybe I just wasn't interested enough to try to understand, but when it comes to entertainment value, those are effectively the same thing.    As was the case with its cohort, Aoashi's premiere is all table setting for the actual plot to get going. It's a perfectly acceptable start to a series I'm not particularly interested in.       James Beckett  Rating:               What a pleasant surprise this was! I love it when a sports anime can dish up satisfying drama off the field as well as on, and while it took me a while to warm up to Aoashi, I eventually found myself intrigued by Ashito Aoi's story. I imagine that this is a show that will play even better to folks that have an appreciation for the ins and outs of soccer, but if a total neophyte like me can get something out of Aoashi, then it must be doing something right.    At first, I was as little annoyed with Ashito, and I didn't expect to have much love for him as a protagonist. He's cocky, overbearing, and unapologetically self-centered in a way that is maybe too accurate to some of the teens I deal with in the real world on an everyday basis. Thankfully, though, Aoashi leans into Ashito's personality in a way that takes advantage of his flaws and strengths in an interesting way. Sure, he's got an ego the size of a Goodyear blimp, but he also has the skills to back it up, and his impromptu training session with Tatsuya later in the episode reveals that he isn't at all ungrateful or ignorant of his teammates' skills and efforts. He demands attention and priority on the field mostly because he knows he can play circles around anybody else, but his love for the sport itself seems very pure. This gives the kid a lot of room to grow over the course of the story, which bodes well for the future.    It also helps that the episode goes on to make Ashito much more sympathetic than he might seem at first glance, and all of the side-characters around him are well-developed enough to complement his story. When Ashito ruins the game (and his chances of getting recruited to a popular high school), it seems like he is doing the usual thing where he lets some bully's taunts about his skills get the better of him. It isn't until later that the bully, genuinely full of remorse, confesses that Ashito lashed out because he was defending his mother, who herself is a well-drawn character, a stern but obviously loving single parent who struggles to make ends meet in the backwater town that her family is stuck in. Outside of Tatsuya and Ashito, none of the other kids or adults have anything revolutionary going on, but it's clear that every person in this story has their own goals and dreams; they all feel very human.    I'll admit that, when the show gets way into the weeds with the soccer mechanics and whatnot, I found myself a little lost, but to Aoashi's credit, the training scenes and play-by-play recaps were at least comprehensible to me, despite the fact that I haven't played a game of soccer since the fourth grade. Besides, when the episode ended, I was honestly excited to see whether or not Ashito would succeed in the Tokyo tryouts and make it into Tatsuya's junior league team – which is a pretty high mark of excellence for a story like this, since we all know that Ashito has to succeed in some way or another for the plot to move forward. In short, Aoashi is a sports anime that can take well-worn tropes and archetypes and spin them into a product that still has heart, and that counts for a lot. Enough for me to give it a hearty recommendation, at least.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               On one level, Aoashi is very much like your run-of-the-mill sports anime. We have a naturally-talented protagonist in Ashito who believes if he tries hard enough, he can overcome anything. This, of course, has made him arrogant and self-centered—proudly proclaiming his skills to anyone who will listen. He's very much the biggest fish in a very small pond.    Luckily, that's not all there is to Ashito, and almost the entirety of this first episode is dedicated to demonstrating that. Despite his oversized ego, his time on his middle school team has taught him the importance of teamwork. He is well aware that the only reason he is able to make the plays he does is because everyone is working together to give him the openings he needs. And while he does have skills, he lacks training; one night with a high-level coach is enough to improve his game drastically, and he is driven enough to put the hard work in when challenged. But, as we discover, his true talent lies in his spatial awareness—an oft-overlooked but incredibly valuable skill in any team sport. Ashito knows not only exactly where his teammates are but where members of the opposing team are positioned as well. He is in the right place at the right time so often not due to luck, but because he makes sure he is there when the opening comes.    But, despite his love of soccer, Ashito has a shadow looming over his life: he's poor. Even though they are living out in the country, his single mother and older brother can barely provide for him on a daily basis. His ragged shoes are the perfect indicator of this. And its the fact that the opposing goalie bad- mouths his mother and their financial situation that causes him to lose his cool. A personal attack on him or even his team he can stand. One on the woman who is struggling to keep a roof over his head and food on the table? That's his breaking point.    It's not hard to feel for him when, even though he is actively being scouted to tryout for a team in Tokyo, he knows it is impossible. His mom explodes at him for even considering the idea, but it's clear that her anger isn't directed at him, but rather at her own perceived failure of not being able to follow up on the opportunities he has earned. It's heartbreaking. No good parent wants to see their child miss out on a chance like that, and while we know that he'll obviously get his shot and make the team (there wouldn't be much of an anime if he didn't), that doesn't make the drama any less effective or well-executed. If sports anime are your thing, you should probably give this one a try.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                It's tempting to simply slot Aoashi protagonist Ashito into the same slot as characters like Sakaki from Futsal Boys!!!!! and Kageyama from Haikyu!! – the guy who doesn't think that there are any other players on the team, and if there are, well, they're just around to make him shine brighter. And really, that's what most people seem to have thought about him from the get-go; he's got a reputation as a ball hog and, if that jerk kid on the other team is to be believed, that rep has gotten him booted off plenty of soccer teams in the past. We start to get a hint that such is not the case when he headbutts the jerk after what we're allowed to assume are imprecations against Ashito's current teammates, because if the other boys are just props for his glory, then why would he bother to defend them? But it turns out that that's misdirection as well, and the result is a first episode that manages to go just enough above and beyond to hook viewers to make it stand out among the other three sports shows (four, if you count Dance Dance Danseur, which is likely to run similarly to a sports show) airing this season.    Lest you think Aoashi is reinventing the wheel, it really isn't. It's still a story about a kid who loves his sport, is good at it, and dreams of playing on much larger stages. Mostly it's just got a bit more turmoil for its protagonist, which doesn't feel as manufactured as, say, Love All Play's drama. The two biggest barriers to Ashito's success are people's misconceptions about his playstyle and that his family simply doesn't have the money to fund his dreams. It's the latter actually sets him off – the jerk kid doesn't stop with insulting his teammates, he moves on to a particularly cruel blow about how poor the Aoi family is while making unkind insinuations about Ashito's mom. Ashito knows that he needs backing from someone else to be able to play at the level he wants to, and there's a sense that his devotion to the game is both from his love for it and because he has to get really, really good if he wants to attract the assistance he needs. And maybe there's a bit of an escape from his mother in there, too – she's clearly worn out and stressed, which comes across as mean, with older brother Shun stepping in to be the supportive figure in Ashito's life. But really, can you blame their mom for worrying?    I'm not thrilled with the way that the episode relies more on still shots than animated soccer action, but I think the story may make this worth following. It's varied the usual sports flavor just enough to make it stand out a bit, and while I don't care much about soccer, I am interested in seeing where Ashito's story takes him.     Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                It's Sports O'Clock again, and we're back at it with another show about young athletes following their dreams. This has been an inconsistent season for sports premieres, with Birdie Wing delivering some goofy fun and Love All Play not delivering much of anything. This soccer show, meanwhile, lands somewhere in the middle of those extremes. It's much more conventional (and less entertaining) than the underground golf clowns, but it's a heck of a lot more competent than the badminton boys.    Whether or not you enjoy this one is gonna come down to how much you like Ashito, our central, shouty soccer boy. I like to think I have a pretty high tolerance for loud-mouth shonen heroes who act before they think, but even I found myself getting annoyed by his constant yelling. Maybe it's just that his voice actor sounds really close to Natsuki Hanae's Tanjiro voice in Demon Slayer, and I'm just sick of that particular cadence. Either way, I found the circumstances around him a lot more engaging than the boy himself. It's interesting that he comes from a single-parent home, one that's struggling financially, and that does tangibly effect him. He's defensive of his mother and the (implied to be disreputable) work she does to feed him and his brother, and their financial situation means it's a lot harder for him to follow his big shonen dreams of soccer stardom. That's some good, solid drama that could help the show standout against countless other soccer shows.    And that's important, because basically everything else in this premiere is by-the-book sports anime material. You've got the unconventional coach with a tragic pro-sports backstory who happens upon our diamond in the rough main character. You've got Ashito doing an all-night training session in order to pass the arbitrary test said-coach assigned him. Really the only tweak to the formula is the reveal that Ashito is more aware and intelligent on the field than his seemingly spontaneous playstyle would suggest, and that'll only become important once he actually joins the Youth team in the coming episodes. We only get a few minutes of actual soccer being played, but it looks pretty solid – certainly better than Farewell, My Dear Cramer ever did – so that low bar has been cleared.    Overall, while there's some intriguing twists to Ashito's character, the rest of this feels like your standard sports fodder without a whole lot to draw you in. It's competent, successful even, but it doesn't inspire the same kind of excitement you can get from the best of these shows. If you have a love of soccer and a tolerance for loud anime boys, it may be worth your time.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            column          4 comments       This Week in Games - Let's Talk About Kingdom Hearts   Apr 16, 07:53 4 comments                 games    Heidi speculates on wtf is going on in the new Kingdom Hearts game and holy crap Witch on the Holy Night is getting a Western release?! ― Hi folks.

Community score: 3.7              What is this?   Aoi Ashito is a third year middle school student from Ehime. Behind his raw game hides his immense talent but Ashito suffers a huge setback because of his overly straightforward personality. The youth team manager of J1 club Tokyo City Esperion, Fukuda Tetsuya, appears in front of Ashito. Fukuda sees Ashito's limitless potential and invites him to take part in his team's tryouts in Tokyo. The story of the boy who will revolutionize football in Japan rapidly begins to unfold. (from manga)   Aoashi is based on Yūgo Kobayashi's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Aoashi is the fourth sports anime to debut this season, and fortuitously enough, its arrival divides them into perfect even groups. Birdie Wing and Fanfare of Adolescence are anime-ass anime, cheerfully over the top and full of pretty people doing ridiculous things. Love All Play and Aoashi are on the more grounded end of the spectrum, focusing on promising young men with capabilities well within the range of real humans, recruited for their talents to join top teams in high school.    If you were to choose just one sports anime, I'd say go with Birdie Wing all the way. And then if you said, “No, that series is too goofy, give me something more realistic,” I'd say something mildly insulting about your taste because who doesn't want a clandestine mini-golf match where the opponent is wearing a clown mask? And then you'd say, “That's unnecessary and rude, Caitlin, because taste is subjective,” and you know what? You'd be right. So I'd say between Love All Play and Aoashi, the latter is certainly the more promising of the two, largely because Ashito is the more interesting of the two protagonists.    He's cut from a similar cloth to a lot of other sports protagonists: a big fish in a small pond, gifted but raw, and arrogant. Oh, and yelly. I think about half of his lines are screaming. He could easily have become obnoxious and unpleasant to watch, but he's also unusually self-aware, and thrives because he has teammates who aren't put off by his over-the-top confidence and instead work to support him. He's the second son of a single mother, who he loves dearly. It's the foundation of a decently compelling, flawed protagonist if he doesn't rub you the wrong way, but rest assured, he will rub some people the wrong way, both within the story and among the audience.    There's not a whole lot of actual soccer this episode, though. Ashito gets kicked out of his match at the start of the episode pretty quickly, and he spends the rest of the runtime practicing a particular technique solo on the beach. There's some talk of strategy and technique, but to be honest, as a non-sports watcher, it pretty much flew over my head. Or maybe I just wasn't interested enough to try to understand, but when it comes to entertainment value, those are effectively the same thing.    As was the case with its cohort, Aoashi's premiere is all table setting for the actual plot to get going. It's a perfectly acceptable start to a series I'm not particularly interested in.       James Beckett  Rating:               What a pleasant surprise this was! I love it when a sports anime can dish up satisfying drama off the field as well as on, and while it took me a while to warm up to Aoashi, I eventually found myself intrigued by Ashito Aoi's story. I imagine that this is a show that will play even better to folks that have an appreciation for the ins and outs of soccer, but if a total neophyte like me can get something out of Aoashi, then it must be doing something right.    At first, I was as little annoyed with Ashito, and I didn't expect to have much love for him as a protagonist. He's cocky, overbearing, and unapologetically self-centered in a way that is maybe too accurate to some of the teens I deal with in the real world on an everyday basis. Thankfully, though, Aoashi leans into Ashito's personality in a way that takes advantage of his flaws and strengths in an interesting way. Sure, he's got an ego the size of a Goodyear blimp, but he also has the skills to back it up, and his impromptu training session with Tatsuya later in the episode reveals that he isn't at all ungrateful or ignorant of his teammates' skills and efforts. He demands attention and priority on the field mostly because he knows he can play circles around anybody else, but his love for the sport itself seems very pure. This gives the kid a lot of room to grow over the course of the story, which bodes well for the future.    It also helps that the episode goes on to make Ashito much more sympathetic than he might seem at first glance, and all of the side-characters around him are well-developed enough to complement his story. When Ashito ruins the game (and his chances of getting recruited to a popular high school), it seems like he is doing the usual thing where he lets some bully's taunts about his skills get the better of him. It isn't until later that the bully, genuinely full of remorse, confesses that Ashito lashed out because he was defending his mother, who herself is a well-drawn character, a stern but obviously loving single parent who struggles to make ends meet in the backwater town that her family is stuck in. Outside of Tatsuya and Ashito, none of the other kids or adults have anything revolutionary going on, but it's clear that every person in this story has their own goals and dreams; they all feel very human.    I'll admit that, when the show gets way into the weeds with the soccer mechanics and whatnot, I found myself a little lost, but to Aoashi's credit, the training scenes and play-by-play recaps were at least comprehensible to me, despite the fact that I haven't played a game of soccer since the fourth grade. Besides, when the episode ended, I was honestly excited to see whether or not Ashito would succeed in the Tokyo tryouts and make it into Tatsuya's junior league team – which is a pretty high mark of excellence for a story like this, since we all know that Ashito has to succeed in some way or another for the plot to move forward. In short, Aoashi is a sports anime that can take well-worn tropes and archetypes and spin them into a product that still has heart, and that counts for a lot. Enough for me to give it a hearty recommendation, at least.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               On one level, Aoashi is very much like your run-of-the-mill sports anime. We have a naturally-talented protagonist in Ashito who believes if he tries hard enough, he can overcome anything. This, of course, has made him arrogant and self-centered—proudly proclaiming his skills to anyone who will listen. He's very much the biggest fish in a very small pond.    Luckily, that's not all there is to Ashito, and almost the entirety of this first episode is dedicated to demonstrating that. Despite his oversized ego, his time on his middle school team has taught him the importance of teamwork. He is well aware that the only reason he is able to make the plays he does is because everyone is working together to give him the openings he needs. And while he does have skills, he lacks training; one night with a high-level coach is enough to improve his game drastically, and he is driven enough to put the hard work in when challenged. But, as we discover, his true talent lies in his spatial awareness—an oft-overlooked but incredibly valuable skill in any team sport. Ashito knows not only exactly where his teammates are but where members of the opposing team are positioned as well. He is in the right place at the right time so often not due to luck, but because he makes sure he is there when the opening comes.    But, despite his love of soccer, Ashito has a shadow looming over his life: he's poor. Even though they are living out in the country, his single mother and older brother can barely provide for him on a daily basis. His ragged shoes are the perfect indicator of this. And its the fact that the opposing goalie bad- mouths his mother and their financial situation that causes him to lose his cool. A personal attack on him or even his team he can stand. One on the woman who is struggling to keep a roof over his head and food on the table? That's his breaking point.    It's not hard to feel for him when, even though he is actively being scouted to tryout for a team in Tokyo, he knows it is impossible. His mom explodes at him for even considering the idea, but it's clear that her anger isn't directed at him, but rather at her own perceived failure of not being able to follow up on the opportunities he has earned. It's heartbreaking. No good parent wants to see their child miss out on a chance like that, and while we know that he'll obviously get his shot and make the team (there wouldn't be much of an anime if he didn't), that doesn't make the drama any less effective or well-executed. If sports anime are your thing, you should probably give this one a try.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                It's tempting to simply slot Aoashi protagonist Ashito into the same slot as characters like Sakaki from Futsal Boys!!!!! and Kageyama from Haikyu!! – the guy who doesn't think that there are any other players on the team, and if there are, well, they're just around to make him shine brighter. And really, that's what most people seem to have thought about him from the get-go; he's got a reputation as a ball hog and, if that jerk kid on the other team is to be believed, that rep has gotten him booted off plenty of soccer teams in the past. We start to get a hint that such is not the case when he headbutts the jerk after what we're allowed to assume are imprecations against Ashito's current teammates, because if the other boys are just props for his glory, then why would he bother to defend them? But it turns out that that's misdirection as well, and the result is a first episode that manages to go just enough above and beyond to hook viewers to make it stand out among the other three sports shows (four, if you count Dance Dance Danseur, which is likely to run similarly to a sports show) airing this season.    Lest you think Aoashi is reinventing the wheel, it really isn't. It's still a story about a kid who loves his sport, is good at it, and dreams of playing on much larger stages. Mostly it's just got a bit more turmoil for its protagonist, which doesn't feel as manufactured as, say, Love All Play's drama. The two biggest barriers to Ashito's success are people's misconceptions about his playstyle and that his family simply doesn't have the money to fund his dreams. It's the latter actually sets him off – the jerk kid doesn't stop with insulting his teammates, he moves on to a particularly cruel blow about how poor the Aoi family is while making unkind insinuations about Ashito's mom. Ashito knows that he needs backing from someone else to be able to play at the level he wants to, and there's a sense that his devotion to the game is both from his love for it and because he has to get really, really good if he wants to attract the assistance he needs. And maybe there's a bit of an escape from his mother in there, too – she's clearly worn out and stressed, which comes across as mean, with older brother Shun stepping in to be the supportive figure in Ashito's life. But really, can you blame their mom for worrying?    I'm not thrilled with the way that the episode relies more on still shots than animated soccer action, but I think the story may make this worth following. It's varied the usual sports flavor just enough to make it stand out a bit, and while I don't care much about soccer, I am interested in seeing where Ashito's story takes him.     Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                It's Sports O'Clock again, and we're back at it with another show about young athletes following their dreams. This has been an inconsistent season for sports premieres, with Birdie Wing delivering some goofy fun and Love All Play not delivering much of anything. This soccer show, meanwhile, lands somewhere in the middle of those extremes. It's much more conventional (and less entertaining) than the underground golf clowns, but it's a heck of a lot more competent than the badminton boys.    Whether or not you enjoy this one is gonna come down to how much you like Ashito, our central, shouty soccer boy. I like to think I have a pretty high tolerance for loud-mouth shonen heroes who act before they think, but even I found myself getting annoyed by his constant yelling. Maybe it's just that his voice actor sounds really close to Natsuki Hanae's Tanjiro voice in Demon Slayer, and I'm just sick of that particular cadence. Either way, I found the circumstances around him a lot more engaging than the boy himself. It's interesting that he comes from a single-parent home, one that's struggling financially, and that does tangibly effect him. He's defensive of his mother and the (implied to be disreputable) work she does to feed him and his brother, and their financial situation means it's a lot harder for him to follow his big shonen dreams of soccer stardom. That's some good, solid drama that could help the show standout against countless other soccer shows.    And that's important, because basically everything else in this premiere is by-the-book sports anime material. You've got the unconventional coach with a tragic pro-sports backstory who happens upon our diamond in the rough main character. You've got Ashito doing an all-night training session in order to pass the arbitrary test said-coach assigned him. Really the only tweak to the formula is the reveal that Ashito is more aware and intelligent on the field than his seemingly spontaneous playstyle would suggest, and that'll only become important once he actually joins the Youth team in the coming episodes. We only get a few minutes of actual soccer being played, but it looks pretty solid – certainly better than Farewell, My Dear Cramer ever did – so that low bar has been cleared.    Overall, while there's some intriguing twists to Ashito's character, the rest of this feels like your standard sports fodder without a whole lot to draw you in. It's competent, successful even, but it doesn't inspire the same kind of excitement you can get from the best of these shows. If you have a love of soccer and a tolerance for loud anime boys, it may be worth your time.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            column          4 comments       This Week in Games - Let's Talk About Kingdom Hearts   Apr 16, 07:53 4 comments                 games    Heidi speculates on wtf is going on in the new Kingdom Hearts game and holy crap Witch on the Holy Night is getting a Western release?! ― Hi folks.

Community score: 3.7              What is this?   Aoi Ashito is a third year middle school student from Ehime. Behind his raw game hides his immense talent but Ashito suffers a huge setback because of his overly straightforward personality. The youth team manager of J1 club Tokyo City Esperion, Fukuda Tetsuya, appears in front of Ashito. Fukuda sees Ashito's limitless potential and invites him to take part in his team's tryouts in Tokyo. The story of the boy who will revolutionize football in Japan rapidly begins to unfold. (from manga)   Aoashi is based on Yūgo Kobayashi's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Aoashi is the fourth sports anime to debut this season, and fortuitously enough, its arrival divides them into perfect even groups. Birdie Wing and Fanfare of Adolescence are anime-ass anime, cheerfully over the top and full of pretty people doing ridiculous things. Love All Play and Aoashi are on the more grounded end of the spectrum, focusing on promising young men with capabilities well within the range of real humans, recruited for their talents to join top teams in high school.    If you were to choose just one sports anime, I'd say go with Birdie Wing all the way. And then if you said, “No, that series is too goofy, give me something more realistic,” I'd say something mildly insulting about your taste because who doesn't want a clandestine mini-golf match where the opponent is wearing a clown mask? And then you'd say, “That's unnecessary and rude, Caitlin, because taste is subjective,” and you know what? You'd be right. So I'd say between Love All Play and Aoashi, the latter is certainly the more promising of the two, largely because Ashito is the more interesting of the two protagonists.    He's cut from a similar cloth to a lot of other sports protagonists: a big fish in a small pond, gifted but raw, and arrogant. Oh, and yelly. I think about half of his lines are screaming. He could easily have become obnoxious and unpleasant to watch, but he's also unusually self-aware, and thrives because he has teammates who aren't put off by his over-the-top confidence and instead work to support him. He's the second son of a single mother, who he loves dearly. It's the foundation of a decently compelling, flawed protagonist if he doesn't rub you the wrong way, but rest assured, he will rub some people the wrong way, both within the story and among the audience.    There's not a whole lot of actual soccer this episode, though. Ashito gets kicked out of his match at the start of the episode pretty quickly, and he spends the rest of the runtime practicing a particular technique solo on the beach. There's some talk of strategy and technique, but to be honest, as a non-sports watcher, it pretty much flew over my head. Or maybe I just wasn't interested enough to try to understand, but when it comes to entertainment value, those are effectively the same thing.    As was the case with its cohort, Aoashi's premiere is all table setting for the actual plot to get going. It's a perfectly acceptable start to a series I'm not particularly interested in.       James Beckett  Rating:               What a pleasant surprise this was! I love it when a sports anime can dish up satisfying drama off the field as well as on, and while it took me a while to warm up to Aoashi, I eventually found myself intrigued by Ashito Aoi's story. I imagine that this is a show that will play even better to folks that have an appreciation for the ins and outs of soccer, but if a total neophyte like me can get something out of Aoashi, then it must be doing something right.    At first, I was as little annoyed with Ashito, and I didn't expect to have much love for him as a protagonist. He's cocky, overbearing, and unapologetically self-centered in a way that is maybe too accurate to some of the teens I deal with in the real world on an everyday basis. Thankfully, though, Aoashi leans into Ashito's personality in a way that takes advantage of his flaws and strengths in an interesting way. Sure, he's got an ego the size of a Goodyear blimp, but he also has the skills to back it up, and his impromptu training session with Tatsuya later in the episode reveals that he isn't at all ungrateful or ignorant of his teammates' skills and efforts. He demands attention and priority on the field mostly because he knows he can play circles around anybody else, but his love for the sport itself seems very pure. This gives the kid a lot of room to grow over the course of the story, which bodes well for the future.    It also helps that the episode goes on to make Ashito much more sympathetic than he might seem at first glance, and all of the side-characters around him are well-developed enough to complement his story. When Ashito ruins the game (and his chances of getting recruited to a popular high school), it seems like he is doing the usual thing where he lets some bully's taunts about his skills get the better of him. It isn't until later that the bully, genuinely full of remorse, confesses that Ashito lashed out because he was defending his mother, who herself is a well-drawn character, a stern but obviously loving single parent who struggles to make ends meet in the backwater town that her family is stuck in. Outside of Tatsuya and Ashito, none of the other kids or adults have anything revolutionary going on, but it's clear that every person in this story has their own goals and dreams; they all feel very human.    I'll admit that, when the show gets way into the weeds with the soccer mechanics and whatnot, I found myself a little lost, but to Aoashi's credit, the training scenes and play-by-play recaps were at least comprehensible to me, despite the fact that I haven't played a game of soccer since the fourth grade. Besides, when the episode ended, I was honestly excited to see whether or not Ashito would succeed in the Tokyo tryouts and make it into Tatsuya's junior league team – which is a pretty high mark of excellence for a story like this, since we all know that Ashito has to succeed in some way or another for the plot to move forward. In short, Aoashi is a sports anime that can take well-worn tropes and archetypes and spin them into a product that still has heart, and that counts for a lot. Enough for me to give it a hearty recommendation, at least.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               On one level, Aoashi is very much like your run-of-the-mill sports anime. We have a naturally-talented protagonist in Ashito who believes if he tries hard enough, he can overcome anything. This, of course, has made him arrogant and self-centered—proudly proclaiming his skills to anyone who will listen. He's very much the biggest fish in a very small pond.    Luckily, that's not all there is to Ashito, and almost the entirety of this first episode is dedicated to demonstrating that. Despite his oversized ego, his time on his middle school team has taught him the importance of teamwork. He is well aware that the only reason he is able to make the plays he does is because everyone is working together to give him the openings he needs. And while he does have skills, he lacks training; one night with a high-level coach is enough to improve his game drastically, and he is driven enough to put the hard work in when challenged. But, as we discover, his true talent lies in his spatial awareness—an oft-overlooked but incredibly valuable skill in any team sport. Ashito knows not only exactly where his teammates are but where members of the opposing team are positioned as well. He is in the right place at the right time so often not due to luck, but because he makes sure he is there when the opening comes.    But, despite his love of soccer, Ashito has a shadow looming over his life: he's poor. Even though they are living out in the country, his single mother and older brother can barely provide for him on a daily basis. His ragged shoes are the perfect indicator of this. And its the fact that the opposing goalie bad- mouths his mother and their financial situation that causes him to lose his cool. A personal attack on him or even his team he can stand. One on the woman who is struggling to keep a roof over his head and food on the table? That's his breaking point.    It's not hard to feel for him when, even though he is actively being scouted to tryout for a team in Tokyo, he knows it is impossible. His mom explodes at him for even considering the idea, but it's clear that her anger isn't directed at him, but rather at her own perceived failure of not being able to follow up on the opportunities he has earned. It's heartbreaking. No good parent wants to see their child miss out on a chance like that, and while we know that he'll obviously get his shot and make the team (there wouldn't be much of an anime if he didn't), that doesn't make the drama any less effective or well-executed. If sports anime are your thing, you should probably give this one a try.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                It's tempting to simply slot Aoashi protagonist Ashito into the same slot as characters like Sakaki from Futsal Boys!!!!! and Kageyama from Haikyu!! – the guy who doesn't think that there are any other players on the team, and if there are, well, they're just around to make him shine brighter. And really, that's what most people seem to have thought about him from the get-go; he's got a reputation as a ball hog and, if that jerk kid on the other team is to be believed, that rep has gotten him booted off plenty of soccer teams in the past. We start to get a hint that such is not the case when he headbutts the jerk after what we're allowed to assume are imprecations against Ashito's current teammates, because if the other boys are just props for his glory, then why would he bother to defend them? But it turns out that that's misdirection as well, and the result is a first episode that manages to go just enough above and beyond to hook viewers to make it stand out among the other three sports shows (four, if you count Dance Dance Danseur, which is likely to run similarly to a sports show) airing this season.    Lest you think Aoashi is reinventing the wheel, it really isn't. It's still a story about a kid who loves his sport, is good at it, and dreams of playing on much larger stages. Mostly it's just got a bit more turmoil for its protagonist, which doesn't feel as manufactured as, say, Love All Play's drama. The two biggest barriers to Ashito's success are people's misconceptions about his playstyle and that his family simply doesn't have the money to fund his dreams. It's the latter actually sets him off – the jerk kid doesn't stop with insulting his teammates, he moves on to a particularly cruel blow about how poor the Aoi family is while making unkind insinuations about Ashito's mom. Ashito knows that he needs backing from someone else to be able to play at the level he wants to, and there's a sense that his devotion to the game is both from his love for it and because he has to get really, really good if he wants to attract the assistance he needs. And maybe there's a bit of an escape from his mother in there, too – she's clearly worn out and stressed, which comes across as mean, with older brother Shun stepping in to be the supportive figure in Ashito's life. But really, can you blame their mom for worrying?    I'm not thrilled with the way that the episode relies more on still shots than animated soccer action, but I think the story may make this worth following. It's varied the usual sports flavor just enough to make it stand out a bit, and while I don't care much about soccer, I am interested in seeing where Ashito's story takes him.     Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                It's Sports O'Clock again, and we're back at it with another show about young athletes following their dreams. This has been an inconsistent season for sports premieres, with Birdie Wing delivering some goofy fun and Love All Play not delivering much of anything. This soccer show, meanwhile, lands somewhere in the middle of those extremes. It's much more conventional (and less entertaining) than the underground golf clowns, but it's a heck of a lot more competent than the badminton boys.    Whether or not you enjoy this one is gonna come down to how much you like Ashito, our central, shouty soccer boy. I like to think I have a pretty high tolerance for loud-mouth shonen heroes who act before they think, but even I found myself getting annoyed by his constant yelling. Maybe it's just that his voice actor sounds really close to Natsuki Hanae's Tanjiro voice in Demon Slayer, and I'm just sick of that particular cadence. Either way, I found the circumstances around him a lot more engaging than the boy himself. It's interesting that he comes from a single-parent home, one that's struggling financially, and that does tangibly effect him. He's defensive of his mother and the (implied to be disreputable) work she does to feed him and his brother, and their financial situation means it's a lot harder for him to follow his big shonen dreams of soccer stardom. That's some good, solid drama that could help the show standout against countless other soccer shows.    And that's important, because basically everything else in this premiere is by-the-book sports anime material. You've got the unconventional coach with a tragic pro-sports backstory who happens upon our diamond in the rough main character. You've got Ashito doing an all-night training session in order to pass the arbitrary test said-coach assigned him. Really the only tweak to the formula is the reveal that Ashito is more aware and intelligent on the field than his seemingly spontaneous playstyle would suggest, and that'll only become important once he actually joins the Youth team in the coming episodes. We only get a few minutes of actual soccer being played, but it looks pretty solid – certainly better than Farewell, My Dear Cramer ever did – so that low bar has been cleared.    Overall, while there's some intriguing twists to Ashito's character, the rest of this feels like your standard sports fodder without a whole lot to draw you in. It's competent, successful even, but it doesn't inspire the same kind of excitement you can get from the best of these shows. If you have a love of soccer and a tolerance for loud anime boys, it may be worth your time.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

16-04-2022,anime,7,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/preview-guide/2022/spring/aoashi/.183645,Aoashi - The Spring 2022 Preview Guide - Anime News Network:SEA,"    The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Aoashi   Apr 10th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Aoashi ?                     Community score: 3.7              What is this?   Aoi Ashito is a third year middle school student from Ehime. Behind his raw game hides his immense talent but Ashito suffers a huge setback because of his overly straightforward personality. The youth team manager of J1 club Tokyo City Esperion, Fukuda Tetsuya, appears in front of Ashito. Fukuda sees Ashito's limitless potential and invites him to take part in his team's tryouts in Tokyo. The story of the boy who will revolutionize football in Japan rapidly begins to unfold. (from manga)   Aoashi is based on Yūgo Kobayashi's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Aoashi is the fourth sports anime to debut this season, and fortuitously enough, its arrival divides them into perfect even groups. Birdie Wing and Fanfare of Adolescence are anime-ass anime, cheerfully over the top and full of pretty people doing ridiculous things. Love All Play and Aoashi are on the more grounded end of the spectrum, focusing on promising young men with capabilities well within the range of real humans, recruited for their talents to join top teams in high school.    If you were to choose just one sports anime, I'd say go with Birdie Wing all the way. And then if you said, “No, that series is too goofy, give me something more realistic,” I'd say something mildly insulting about your taste because who doesn't want a clandestine mini-golf match where the opponent is wearing a clown mask? And then you'd say, “That's unnecessary and rude, Caitlin, because taste is subjective,” and you know what? You'd be right. So I'd say between Love All Play and Aoashi, the latter is certainly the more promising of the two, largely because Ashito is the more interesting of the two protagonists.    He's cut from a similar cloth to a lot of other sports protagonists: a big fish in a small pond, gifted but raw, and arrogant. Oh, and yelly. I think about half of his lines are screaming. He could easily have become obnoxious and unpleasant to watch, but he's also unusually self-aware, and thrives because he has teammates who aren't put off by his over-the-top confidence and instead work to support him. He's the second son of a single mother, who he loves dearly. It's the foundation of a decently compelling, flawed protagonist if he doesn't rub you the wrong way, but rest assured, he will rub some people the wrong way, both within the story and among the audience.    There's not a whole lot of actual soccer this episode, though. Ashito gets kicked out of his match at the start of the episode pretty quickly, and he spends the rest of the runtime practicing a particular technique solo on the beach. There's some talk of strategy and technique, but to be honest, as a non-sports watcher, it pretty much flew over my head. Or maybe I just wasn't interested enough to try to understand, but when it comes to entertainment value, those are effectively the same thing.    As was the case with its cohort, Aoashi's premiere is all table setting for the actual plot to get going. It's a perfectly acceptable start to a series I'm not particularly interested in.       James Beckett  Rating:               What a pleasant surprise this was! I love it when a sports anime can dish up satisfying drama off the field as well as on, and while it took me a while to warm up to Aoashi, I eventually found myself intrigued by Ashito Aoi's story. I imagine that this is a show that will play even better to folks that have an appreciation for the ins and outs of soccer, but if a total neophyte like me can get something out of Aoashi, then it must be doing something right.    At first, I was as little annoyed with Ashito, and I didn't expect to have much love for him as a protagonist. He's cocky, overbearing, and unapologetically self-centered in a way that is maybe too accurate to some of the teens I deal with in the real world on an everyday basis. Thankfully, though, Aoashi leans into Ashito's personality in a way that takes advantage of his flaws and strengths in an interesting way. Sure, he's got an ego the size of a Goodyear blimp, but he also has the skills to back it up, and his impromptu training session with Tatsuya later in the episode reveals that he isn't at all ungrateful or ignorant of his teammates' skills and efforts. He demands attention and priority on the field mostly because he knows he can play circles around anybody else, but his love for the sport itself seems very pure. This gives the kid a lot of room to grow over the course of the story, which bodes well for the future.    It also helps that the episode goes on to make Ashito much more sympathetic than he might seem at first glance, and all of the side-characters around him are well-developed enough to complement his story. When Ashito ruins the game (and his chances of getting recruited to a popular high school), it seems like he is doing the usual thing where he lets some bully's taunts about his skills get the better of him. It isn't until later that the bully, genuinely full of remorse, confesses that Ashito lashed out because he was defending his mother, who herself is a well-drawn character, a stern but obviously loving single parent who struggles to make ends meet in the backwater town that her family is stuck in. Outside of Tatsuya and Ashito, none of the other kids or adults have anything revolutionary going on, but it's clear that every person in this story has their own goals and dreams; they all feel very human.    I'll admit that, when the show gets way into the weeds with the soccer mechanics and whatnot, I found myself a little lost, but to Aoashi's credit, the training scenes and play-by-play recaps were at least comprehensible to me, despite the fact that I haven't played a game of soccer since the fourth grade. Besides, when the episode ended, I was honestly excited to see whether or not Ashito would succeed in the Tokyo tryouts and make it into Tatsuya's junior league team – which is a pretty high mark of excellence for a story like this, since we all know that Ashito has to succeed in some way or another for the plot to move forward. In short, Aoashi is a sports anime that can take well-worn tropes and archetypes and spin them into a product that still has heart, and that counts for a lot. Enough for me to give it a hearty recommendation, at least.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               On one level, Aoashi is very much like your run-of-the-mill sports anime. We have a naturally-talented protagonist in Ashito who believes if he tries hard enough, he can overcome anything. This, of course, has made him arrogant and self-centered—proudly proclaiming his skills to anyone who will listen. He's very much the biggest fish in a very small pond.    Luckily, that's not all there is to Ashito, and almost the entirety of this first episode is dedicated to demonstrating that. Despite his oversized ego, his time on his middle school team has taught him the importance of teamwork. He is well aware that the only reason he is able to make the plays he does is because everyone is working together to give him the openings he needs. And while he does have skills, he lacks training; one night with a high-level coach is enough to improve his game drastically, and he is driven enough to put the hard work in when challenged. But, as we discover, his true talent lies in his spatial awareness—an oft-overlooked but incredibly valuable skill in any team sport. Ashito knows not only exactly where his teammates are but where members of the opposing team are positioned as well. He is in the right place at the right time so often not due to luck, but because he makes sure he is there when the opening comes.    But, despite his love of soccer, Ashito has a shadow looming over his life: he's poor. Even though they are living out in the country, his single mother and older brother can barely provide for him on a daily basis. His ragged shoes are the perfect indicator of this. And its the fact that the opposing goalie bad- mouths his mother and their financial situation that causes him to lose his cool. A personal attack on him or even his team he can stand. One on the woman who is struggling to keep a roof over his head and food on the table? That's his breaking point.    It's not hard to feel for him when, even though he is actively being scouted to tryout for a team in Tokyo, he knows it is impossible. His mom explodes at him for even considering the idea, but it's clear that her anger isn't directed at him, but rather at her own perceived failure of not being able to follow up on the opportunities he has earned. It's heartbreaking. No good parent wants to see their child miss out on a chance like that, and while we know that he'll obviously get his shot and make the team (there wouldn't be much of an anime if he didn't), that doesn't make the drama any less effective or well-executed. If sports anime are your thing, you should probably give this one a try.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                It's tempting to simply slot Aoashi protagonist Ashito into the same slot as characters like Sakaki from Futsal Boys!!!!! and Kageyama from Haikyu!! – the guy who doesn't think that there are any other players on the team, and if there are, well, they're just around to make him shine brighter. And really, that's what most people seem to have thought about him from the get-go; he's got a reputation as a ball hog and, if that jerk kid on the other team is to be believed, that rep has gotten him booted off plenty of soccer teams in the past. We start to get a hint that such is not the case when he headbutts the jerk after what we're allowed to assume are imprecations against Ashito's current teammates, because if the other boys are just props for his glory, then why would he bother to defend them? But it turns out that that's misdirection as well, and the result is a first episode that manages to go just enough above and beyond to hook viewers to make it stand out among the other three sports shows (four, if you count Dance Dance Danseur, which is likely to run similarly to a sports show) airing this season.    Lest you think Aoashi is reinventing the wheel, it really isn't. It's still a story about a kid who loves his sport, is good at it, and dreams of playing on much larger stages. Mostly it's just got a bit more turmoil for its protagonist, which doesn't feel as manufactured as, say, Love All Play's drama. The two biggest barriers to Ashito's success are people's misconceptions about his playstyle and that his family simply doesn't have the money to fund his dreams. It's the latter actually sets him off – the jerk kid doesn't stop with insulting his teammates, he moves on to a particularly cruel blow about how poor the Aoi family is while making unkind insinuations about Ashito's mom. Ashito knows that he needs backing from someone else to be able to play at the level he wants to, and there's a sense that his devotion to the game is both from his love for it and because he has to get really, really good if he wants to attract the assistance he needs. And maybe there's a bit of an escape from his mother in there, too – she's clearly worn out and stressed, which comes across as mean, with older brother Shun stepping in to be the supportive figure in Ashito's life. But really, can you blame their mom for worrying?    I'm not thrilled with the way that the episode relies more on still shots than animated soccer action, but I think the story may make this worth following. It's varied the usual sports flavor just enough to make it stand out a bit, and while I don't care much about soccer, I am interested in seeing where Ashito's story takes him.     Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                It's Sports O'Clock again, and we're back at it with another show about young athletes following their dreams. This has been an inconsistent season for sports premieres, with Birdie Wing delivering some goofy fun and Love All Play not delivering much of anything. This soccer show, meanwhile, lands somewhere in the middle of those extremes. It's much more conventional (and less entertaining) than the underground golf clowns, but it's a heck of a lot more competent than the badminton boys.    Whether or not you enjoy this one is gonna come down to how much you like Ashito, our central, shouty soccer boy. I like to think I have a pretty high tolerance for loud-mouth shonen heroes who act before they think, but even I found myself getting annoyed by his constant yelling. Maybe it's just that his voice actor sounds really close to Natsuki Hanae's Tanjiro voice in Demon Slayer, and I'm just sick of that particular cadence. Either way, I found the circumstances around him a lot more engaging than the boy himself. It's interesting that he comes from a single-parent home, one that's struggling financially, and that does tangibly effect him. He's defensive of his mother and the (implied to be disreputable) work she does to feed him and his brother, and their financial situation means it's a lot harder for him to follow his big shonen dreams of soccer stardom. That's some good, solid drama that could help the show standout against countless other soccer shows.    And that's important, because basically everything else in this premiere is by-the-book sports anime material. You've got the unconventional coach with a tragic pro-sports backstory who happens upon our diamond in the rough main character. You've got Ashito doing an all-night training session in order to pass the arbitrary test said-coach assigned him. Really the only tweak to the formula is the reveal that Ashito is more aware and intelligent on the field than his seemingly spontaneous playstyle would suggest, and that'll only become important once he actually joins the Youth team in the coming episodes. We only get a few minutes of actual soccer being played, but it looks pretty solid – certainly better than Farewell, My Dear Cramer ever did – so that low bar has been cleared.    Overall, while there's some intriguing twists to Ashito's character, the rest of this feels like your standard sports fodder without a whole lot to draw you in. It's competent, successful even, but it doesn't inspire the same kind of excitement you can get from the best of these shows.

The youth team manager of J1 club Tokyo City Esperion, Fukuda Tetsuya, appears in front of Ashito. Fukuda sees Ashito's limitless potential and invites him to take part in his team's tryouts in Tokyo. The story of the boy who will revolutionize football in Japan rapidly begins to unfold. (from manga)   Aoashi is based on Yūgo Kobayashi's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Aoashi is the fourth sports anime to debut this season, and fortuitously enough, its arrival divides them into perfect even groups. Birdie Wing and Fanfare of Adolescence are anime-ass anime, cheerfully over the top and full of pretty people doing ridiculous things. Love All Play and Aoashi are on the more grounded end of the spectrum, focusing on promising young men with capabilities well within the range of real humans, recruited for their talents to join top teams in high school.    If you were to choose just one sports anime, I'd say go with Birdie Wing all the way. And then if you said, “No, that series is too goofy, give me something more realistic,” I'd say something mildly insulting about your taste because who doesn't want a clandestine mini-golf match where the opponent is wearing a clown mask? And then you'd say, “That's unnecessary and rude, Caitlin, because taste is subjective,” and you know what? You'd be right. So I'd say between Love All Play and Aoashi, the latter is certainly the more promising of the two, largely because Ashito is the more interesting of the two protagonists.    He's cut from a similar cloth to a lot of other sports protagonists: a big fish in a small pond, gifted but raw, and arrogant. Oh, and yelly. I think about half of his lines are screaming. He could easily have become obnoxious and unpleasant to watch, but he's also unusually self-aware, and thrives because he has teammates who aren't put off by his over-the-top confidence and instead work to support him. He's the second son of a single mother, who he loves dearly. It's the foundation of a decently compelling, flawed protagonist if he doesn't rub you the wrong way, but rest assured, he will rub some people the wrong way, both within the story and among the audience.    There's not a whole lot of actual soccer this episode, though. Ashito gets kicked out of his match at the start of the episode pretty quickly, and he spends the rest of the runtime practicing a particular technique solo on the beach. There's some talk of strategy and technique, but to be honest, as a non-sports watcher, it pretty much flew over my head. Or maybe I just wasn't interested enough to try to understand, but when it comes to entertainment value, those are effectively the same thing.    As was the case with its cohort, Aoashi's premiere is all table setting for the actual plot to get going. It's a perfectly acceptable start to a series I'm not particularly interested in.       James Beckett  Rating:               What a pleasant surprise this was! I love it when a sports anime can dish up satisfying drama off the field as well as on, and while it took me a while to warm up to Aoashi, I eventually found myself intrigued by Ashito Aoi's story. I imagine that this is a show that will play even better to folks that have an appreciation for the ins and outs of soccer, but if a total neophyte like me can get something out of Aoashi, then it must be doing something right.    At first, I was as little annoyed with Ashito, and I didn't expect to have much love for him as a protagonist. He's cocky, overbearing, and unapologetically self-centered in a way that is maybe too accurate to some of the teens I deal with in the real world on an everyday basis. Thankfully, though, Aoashi leans into Ashito's personality in a way that takes advantage of his flaws and strengths in an interesting way. Sure, he's got an ego the size of a Goodyear blimp, but he also has the skills to back it up, and his impromptu training session with Tatsuya later in the episode reveals that he isn't at all ungrateful or ignorant of his teammates' skills and efforts. He demands attention and priority on the field mostly because he knows he can play circles around anybody else, but his love for the sport itself seems very pure. This gives the kid a lot of room to grow over the course of the story, which bodes well for the future.    It also helps that the episode goes on to make Ashito much more sympathetic than he might seem at first glance, and all of the side-characters around him are well-developed enough to complement his story. When Ashito ruins the game (and his chances of getting recruited to a popular high school), it seems like he is doing the usual thing where he lets some bully's taunts about his skills get the better of him. It isn't until later that the bully, genuinely full of remorse, confesses that Ashito lashed out because he was defending his mother, who herself is a well-drawn character, a stern but obviously loving single parent who struggles to make ends meet in the backwater town that her family is stuck in. Outside of Tatsuya and Ashito, none of the other kids or adults have anything revolutionary going on, but it's clear that every person in this story has their own goals and dreams; they all feel very human.    I'll admit that, when the show gets way into the weeds with the soccer mechanics and whatnot, I found myself a little lost, but to Aoashi's credit, the training scenes and play-by-play recaps were at least comprehensible to me, despite the fact that I haven't played a game of soccer since the fourth grade. Besides, when the episode ended, I was honestly excited to see whether or not Ashito would succeed in the Tokyo tryouts and make it into Tatsuya's junior league team – which is a pretty high mark of excellence for a story like this, since we all know that Ashito has to succeed in some way or another for the plot to move forward. In short, Aoashi is a sports anime that can take well-worn tropes and archetypes and spin them into a product that still has heart, and that counts for a lot. Enough for me to give it a hearty recommendation, at least.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               On one level, Aoashi is very much like your run-of-the-mill sports anime. We have a naturally-talented protagonist in Ashito who believes if he tries hard enough, he can overcome anything. This, of course, has made him arrogant and self-centered—proudly proclaiming his skills to anyone who will listen. He's very much the biggest fish in a very small pond.    Luckily, that's not all there is to Ashito, and almost the entirety of this first episode is dedicated to demonstrating that. Despite his oversized ego, his time on his middle school team has taught him the importance of teamwork. He is well aware that the only reason he is able to make the plays he does is because everyone is working together to give him the openings he needs. And while he does have skills, he lacks training; one night with a high-level coach is enough to improve his game drastically, and he is driven enough to put the hard work in when challenged. But, as we discover, his true talent lies in his spatial awareness—an oft-overlooked but incredibly valuable skill in any team sport. Ashito knows not only exactly where his teammates are but where members of the opposing team are positioned as well. He is in the right place at the right time so often not due to luck, but because he makes sure he is there when the opening comes.    But, despite his love of soccer, Ashito has a shadow looming over his life: he's poor. Even though they are living out in the country, his single mother and older brother can barely provide for him on a daily basis. His ragged shoes are the perfect indicator of this. And its the fact that the opposing goalie bad- mouths his mother and their financial situation that causes him to lose his cool. A personal attack on him or even his team he can stand. One on the woman who is struggling to keep a roof over his head and food on the table? That's his breaking point.    It's not hard to feel for him when, even though he is actively being scouted to tryout for a team in Tokyo, he knows it is impossible. His mom explodes at him for even considering the idea, but it's clear that her anger isn't directed at him, but rather at her own perceived failure of not being able to follow up on the opportunities he has earned. It's heartbreaking. No good parent wants to see their child miss out on a chance like that, and while we know that he'll obviously get his shot and make the team (there wouldn't be much of an anime if he didn't), that doesn't make the drama any less effective or well-executed. If sports anime are your thing, you should probably give this one a try.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                It's tempting to simply slot Aoashi protagonist Ashito into the same slot as characters like Sakaki from Futsal Boys!!!!! and Kageyama from Haikyu!! – the guy who doesn't think that there are any other players on the team, and if there are, well, they're just around to make him shine brighter. And really, that's what most people seem to have thought about him from the get-go; he's got a reputation as a ball hog and, if that jerk kid on the other team is to be believed, that rep has gotten him booted off plenty of soccer teams in the past. We start to get a hint that such is not the case when he headbutts the jerk after what we're allowed to assume are imprecations against Ashito's current teammates, because if the other boys are just props for his glory, then why would he bother to defend them? But it turns out that that's misdirection as well, and the result is a first episode that manages to go just enough above and beyond to hook viewers to make it stand out among the other three sports shows (four, if you count Dance Dance Danseur, which is likely to run similarly to a sports show) airing this season.    Lest you think Aoashi is reinventing the wheel, it really isn't. It's still a story about a kid who loves his sport, is good at it, and dreams of playing on much larger stages. Mostly it's just got a bit more turmoil for its protagonist, which doesn't feel as manufactured as, say, Love All Play's drama. The two biggest barriers to Ashito's success are people's misconceptions about his playstyle and that his family simply doesn't have the money to fund his dreams. It's the latter actually sets him off – the jerk kid doesn't stop with insulting his teammates, he moves on to a particularly cruel blow about how poor the Aoi family is while making unkind insinuations about Ashito's mom. Ashito knows that he needs backing from someone else to be able to play at the level he wants to, and there's a sense that his devotion to the game is both from his love for it and because he has to get really, really good if he wants to attract the assistance he needs. And maybe there's a bit of an escape from his mother in there, too – she's clearly worn out and stressed, which comes across as mean, with older brother Shun stepping in to be the supportive figure in Ashito's life. But really, can you blame their mom for worrying?    I'm not thrilled with the way that the episode relies more on still shots than animated soccer action, but I think the story may make this worth following. It's varied the usual sports flavor just enough to make it stand out a bit, and while I don't care much about soccer, I am interested in seeing where Ashito's story takes him.     Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                It's Sports O'Clock again, and we're back at it with another show about young athletes following their dreams. This has been an inconsistent season for sports premieres, with Birdie Wing delivering some goofy fun and Love All Play not delivering much of anything. This soccer show, meanwhile, lands somewhere in the middle of those extremes. It's much more conventional (and less entertaining) than the underground golf clowns, but it's a heck of a lot more competent than the badminton boys.    Whether or not you enjoy this one is gonna come down to how much you like Ashito, our central, shouty soccer boy. I like to think I have a pretty high tolerance for loud-mouth shonen heroes who act before they think, but even I found myself getting annoyed by his constant yelling. Maybe it's just that his voice actor sounds really close to Natsuki Hanae's Tanjiro voice in Demon Slayer, and I'm just sick of that particular cadence. Either way, I found the circumstances around him a lot more engaging than the boy himself. It's interesting that he comes from a single-parent home, one that's struggling financially, and that does tangibly effect him. He's defensive of his mother and the (implied to be disreputable) work she does to feed him and his brother, and their financial situation means it's a lot harder for him to follow his big shonen dreams of soccer stardom. That's some good, solid drama that could help the show standout against countless other soccer shows.    And that's important, because basically everything else in this premiere is by-the-book sports anime material. You've got the unconventional coach with a tragic pro-sports backstory who happens upon our diamond in the rough main character. You've got Ashito doing an all-night training session in order to pass the arbitrary test said-coach assigned him. Really the only tweak to the formula is the reveal that Ashito is more aware and intelligent on the field than his seemingly spontaneous playstyle would suggest, and that'll only become important once he actually joins the Youth team in the coming episodes. We only get a few minutes of actual soccer being played, but it looks pretty solid – certainly better than Farewell, My Dear Cramer ever did – so that low bar has been cleared.    Overall, while there's some intriguing twists to Ashito's character, the rest of this feels like your standard sports fodder without a whole lot to draw you in. It's competent, successful even, but it doesn't inspire the same kind of excitement you can get from the best of these shows. If you have a love of soccer and a tolerance for loud anime boys, it may be worth your time.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives    ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

He could easily have become obnoxious and unpleasant to watch, but he's also unusually self-aware, and thrives because he has teammates who aren't put off by his over-the-top confidence and instead work to support him. He's the second son of a single mother, who he loves dearly. It's the foundation of a decently compelling, flawed protagonist if he doesn't rub you the wrong way, but rest assured, he will rub some people the wrong way, both within the story and among the audience.    There's not a whole lot of actual soccer this episode, though. Ashito gets kicked out of his match at the start of the episode pretty quickly, and he spends the rest of the runtime practicing a particular technique solo on the beach. There's some talk of strategy and technique, but to be honest, as a non-sports watcher, it pretty much flew over my head. Or maybe I just wasn't interested enough to try to understand, but when it comes to entertainment value, those are effectively the same thing.    As was the case with its cohort, Aoashi's premiere is all table setting for the actual plot to get going. It's a perfectly acceptable start to a series I'm not particularly interested in.       James Beckett  Rating:               What a pleasant surprise this was! I love it when a sports anime can dish up satisfying drama off the field as well as on, and while it took me a while to warm up to Aoashi, I eventually found myself intrigued by Ashito Aoi's story. I imagine that this is a show that will play even better to folks that have an appreciation for the ins and outs of soccer, but if a total neophyte like me can get something out of Aoashi, then it must be doing something right.    At first, I was as little annoyed with Ashito, and I didn't expect to have much love for him as a protagonist. He's cocky, overbearing, and unapologetically self-centered in a way that is maybe too accurate to some of the teens I deal with in the real world on an everyday basis. Thankfully, though, Aoashi leans into Ashito's personality in a way that takes advantage of his flaws and strengths in an interesting way. Sure, he's got an ego the size of a Goodyear blimp, but he also has the skills to back it up, and his impromptu training session with Tatsuya later in the episode reveals that he isn't at all ungrateful or ignorant of his teammates' skills and efforts. He demands attention and priority on the field mostly because he knows he can play circles around anybody else, but his love for the sport itself seems very pure. This gives the kid a lot of room to grow over the course of the story, which bodes well for the future.    It also helps that the episode goes on to make Ashito much more sympathetic than he might seem at first glance, and all of the side-characters around him are well-developed enough to complement his story. When Ashito ruins the game (and his chances of getting recruited to a popular high school), it seems like he is doing the usual thing where he lets some bully's taunts about his skills get the better of him. It isn't until later that the bully, genuinely full of remorse, confesses that Ashito lashed out because he was defending his mother, who herself is a well-drawn character, a stern but obviously loving single parent who struggles to make ends meet in the backwater town that her family is stuck in. Outside of Tatsuya and Ashito, none of the other kids or adults have anything revolutionary going on, but it's clear that every person in this story has their own goals and dreams; they all feel very human.    I'll admit that, when the show gets way into the weeds with the soccer mechanics and whatnot, I found myself a little lost, but to Aoashi's credit, the training scenes and play-by-play recaps were at least comprehensible to me, despite the fact that I haven't played a game of soccer since the fourth grade. Besides, when the episode ended, I was honestly excited to see whether or not Ashito would succeed in the Tokyo tryouts and make it into Tatsuya's junior league team – which is a pretty high mark of excellence for a story like this, since we all know that Ashito has to succeed in some way or another for the plot to move forward. In short, Aoashi is a sports anime that can take well-worn tropes and archetypes and spin them into a product that still has heart, and that counts for a lot. Enough for me to give it a hearty recommendation, at least.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               On one level, Aoashi is very much like your run-of-the-mill sports anime. We have a naturally-talented protagonist in Ashito who believes if he tries hard enough, he can overcome anything. This, of course, has made him arrogant and self-centered—proudly proclaiming his skills to anyone who will listen. He's very much the biggest fish in a very small pond.    Luckily, that's not all there is to Ashito, and almost the entirety of this first episode is dedicated to demonstrating that. Despite his oversized ego, his time on his middle school team has taught him the importance of teamwork. He is well aware that the only reason he is able to make the plays he does is because everyone is working together to give him the openings he needs. And while he does have skills, he lacks training; one night with a high-level coach is enough to improve his game drastically, and he is driven enough to put the hard work in when challenged. But, as we discover, his true talent lies in his spatial awareness—an oft-overlooked but incredibly valuable skill in any team sport. Ashito knows not only exactly where his teammates are but where members of the opposing team are positioned as well. He is in the right place at the right time so often not due to luck, but because he makes sure he is there when the opening comes.    But, despite his love of soccer, Ashito has a shadow looming over his life: he's poor. Even though they are living out in the country, his single mother and older brother can barely provide for him on a daily basis. His ragged shoes are the perfect indicator of this. And its the fact that the opposing goalie bad- mouths his mother and their financial situation that causes him to lose his cool. A personal attack on him or even his team he can stand. One on the woman who is struggling to keep a roof over his head and food on the table? That's his breaking point.    It's not hard to feel for him when, even though he is actively being scouted to tryout for a team in Tokyo, he knows it is impossible. His mom explodes at him for even considering the idea, but it's clear that her anger isn't directed at him, but rather at her own perceived failure of not being able to follow up on the opportunities he has earned. It's heartbreaking. No good parent wants to see their child miss out on a chance like that, and while we know that he'll obviously get his shot and make the team (there wouldn't be much of an anime if he didn't), that doesn't make the drama any less effective or well-executed. If sports anime are your thing, you should probably give this one a try.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                It's tempting to simply slot Aoashi protagonist Ashito into the same slot as characters like Sakaki from Futsal Boys!!!!! and Kageyama from Haikyu!! – the guy who doesn't think that there are any other players on the team, and if there are, well, they're just around to make him shine brighter. And really, that's what most people seem to have thought about him from the get-go; he's got a reputation as a ball hog and, if that jerk kid on the other team is to be believed, that rep has gotten him booted off plenty of soccer teams in the past. We start to get a hint that such is not the case when he headbutts the jerk after what we're allowed to assume are imprecations against Ashito's current teammates, because if the other boys are just props for his glory, then why would he bother to defend them? But it turns out that that's misdirection as well, and the result is a first episode that manages to go just enough above and beyond to hook viewers to make it stand out among the other three sports shows (four, if you count Dance Dance Danseur, which is likely to run similarly to a sports show) airing this season.    Lest you think Aoashi is reinventing the wheel, it really isn't. It's still a story about a kid who loves his sport, is good at it, and dreams of playing on much larger stages. Mostly it's just got a bit more turmoil for its protagonist, which doesn't feel as manufactured as, say, Love All Play's drama. The two biggest barriers to Ashito's success are people's misconceptions about his playstyle and that his family simply doesn't have the money to fund his dreams. It's the latter actually sets him off – the jerk kid doesn't stop with insulting his teammates, he moves on to a particularly cruel blow about how poor the Aoi family is while making unkind insinuations about Ashito's mom. Ashito knows that he needs backing from someone else to be able to play at the level he wants to, and there's a sense that his devotion to the game is both from his love for it and because he has to get really, really good if he wants to attract the assistance he needs. And maybe there's a bit of an escape from his mother in there, too – she's clearly worn out and stressed, which comes across as mean, with older brother Shun stepping in to be the supportive figure in Ashito's life. But really, can you blame their mom for worrying?    I'm not thrilled with the way that the episode relies more on still shots than animated soccer action, but I think the story may make this worth following. It's varied the usual sports flavor just enough to make it stand out a bit, and while I don't care much about soccer, I am interested in seeing where Ashito's story takes him.     Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                It's Sports O'Clock again, and we're back at it with another show about young athletes following their dreams. This has been an inconsistent season for sports premieres, with Birdie Wing delivering some goofy fun and Love All Play not delivering much of anything. This soccer show, meanwhile, lands somewhere in the middle of those extremes. It's much more conventional (and less entertaining) than the underground golf clowns, but it's a heck of a lot more competent than the badminton boys.    Whether or not you enjoy this one is gonna come down to how much you like Ashito, our central, shouty soccer boy. I like to think I have a pretty high tolerance for loud-mouth shonen heroes who act before they think, but even I found myself getting annoyed by his constant yelling. Maybe it's just that his voice actor sounds really close to Natsuki Hanae's Tanjiro voice in Demon Slayer, and I'm just sick of that particular cadence. Either way, I found the circumstances around him a lot more engaging than the boy himself. It's interesting that he comes from a single-parent home, one that's struggling financially, and that does tangibly effect him. He's defensive of his mother and the (implied to be disreputable) work she does to feed him and his brother, and their financial situation means it's a lot harder for him to follow his big shonen dreams of soccer stardom. That's some good, solid drama that could help the show standout against countless other soccer shows.    And that's important, because basically everything else in this premiere is by-the-book sports anime material. You've got the unconventional coach with a tragic pro-sports backstory who happens upon our diamond in the rough main character. You've got Ashito doing an all-night training session in order to pass the arbitrary test said-coach assigned him. Really the only tweak to the formula is the reveal that Ashito is more aware and intelligent on the field than his seemingly spontaneous playstyle would suggest, and that'll only become important once he actually joins the Youth team in the coming episodes. We only get a few minutes of actual soccer being played, but it looks pretty solid – certainly better than Farewell, My Dear Cramer ever did – so that low bar has been cleared.    Overall, while there's some intriguing twists to Ashito's character, the rest of this feels like your standard sports fodder without a whole lot to draw you in. It's competent, successful even, but it doesn't inspire the same kind of excitement you can get from the best of these shows. If you have a love of soccer and a tolerance for loud anime boys, it may be worth your time.

16-04-2022,anime,7,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/preview-guide/2022/spring/aoashi/.183645,Aoashi - The Spring 2022 Preview Guide - Anime News Network:SEA,"            How would you rate episode 1 of Aoashi ?                     Community score: 3.7              What is this?   Aoi Ashito is a third year middle school student from Ehime. Behind his raw game hides his immense talent but Ashito suffers a huge setback because of his overly straightforward personality. The youth team manager of J1 club Tokyo City Esperion, Fukuda Tetsuya, appears in front of Ashito. Fukuda sees Ashito's limitless potential and invites him to take part in his team's tryouts in Tokyo. The story of the boy who will revolutionize football in Japan rapidly begins to unfold. (from manga)   Aoashi is based on Yūgo Kobayashi's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Aoashi is the fourth sports anime to debut this season, and fortuitously enough, its arrival divides them into perfect even groups. Birdie Wing and Fanfare of Adolescence are anime-ass anime, cheerfully over the top and full of pretty people doing ridiculous things. Love All Play and Aoashi are on the more grounded end of the spectrum, focusing on promising young men with capabilities well within the range of real humans, recruited for their talents to join top teams in high school.    If you were to choose just one sports anime, I'd say go with Birdie Wing all the way. And then if you said, “No, that series is too goofy, give me something more realistic,” I'd say something mildly insulting about your taste because who doesn't want a clandestine mini-golf match where the opponent is wearing a clown mask? And then you'd say, “That's unnecessary and rude, Caitlin, because taste is subjective,” and you know what? You'd be right. So I'd say between Love All Play and Aoashi, the latter is certainly the more promising of the two, largely because Ashito is the more interesting of the two protagonists.    He's cut from a similar cloth to a lot of other sports protagonists: a big fish in a small pond, gifted but raw, and arrogant. Oh, and yelly. I think about half of his lines are screaming.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie   Apr 10th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie ?                     Community score: 3.9              What is this?   Shikimori seems like the perfect girlfriend: cute, fun to be around, sweet when she wants to be, but she has a cool dark side that comes out under the right circumstances. And her boyfriend Izumi loves to be around when that happens.    Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie is based on Keigo Maki's romantic comedy manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                I read the first volume of Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie for an ANN manga preview guide some time ago. I enjoyed it, but it was one of those single joke premises and I didn't really like it enough to spend actual money on it, so I set it aside. Then Doga Kobo announced they'd be producing an anime, and I figured I'd finally get the rest of the story.    Doga Kobo has produced some fantastic comedy adaptations, even with ones that seem like their single joke couldn't possibly stretch to full-length episodes, such as Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun and Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle, so I had high hopes for Shikimori. And the first few minutes of the episode, wherein the titular Shikimori rescues her hapless boyfriend Izumi from getting hit by a truck and looks impossibly cool doing it, I thought I was going to be in for a good time. Since it is impossible for a critic to be wholly objective, I will reveal one of my biases: I have a huge weakness for gender-reversed tough girl/soft boy romances. Probably my favorite kind of heterosexuals. And Shikimori pinning Izumi against the wall and gently chastising him? That's some good fucking food, right there.    Alas, as the episode wore on, I realized it was more of an excellent amuse-bouche preceding a middling meal than a feast. The comic timing is piss-poor, causing things to drag the entire runtime. The episode is divided roughly into three segments, and each one gets maybe one or two jokes while the rest is paced like a slice-of-life series but without the necessary level of personality. Oh, there were still parts I liked, such as Shikimori choosing to discard her friend's advice to lose on purpose because fake incompetence is cute. I could go into full feminist rage mode about gender roles and it irritated me that Shikimori even entertained the idea, but the important thing is she decided to be her amazing self and bowl a perfect game, and Izumi loved it. Girls, get yourself a boy who doesn't want you to cut off bits of yourself to make them feel better, but instead adores everything awesome you are.    Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie gets three stars for having a good core concept and some good moments, but otherwise kind of boring. The adorable rhythm game ending gets it another star. I wonder what Mitsue Yamazaki is working on these days…       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               One thing I've always hated about romantic comedies is how 90% of them end with the couple finally getting together. Admitting you like each other is the first step of a relationship, not the last. I've always found the rare story about a couple dealing with the problems that come up over the course of a relationship to be far more heartfelt and interesting—which brings us to Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie. This episode doesn't even bother to tell us how the two got together—it's that unimportant. What matters is that they are together and are trying to make things work.    Of course, each of the pair has their issues. Shikimori wants to be seen as cute by her boyfriend—so much so that she is embarrassed by the badass athletic powerhouse side of herself. Meanwhile, Izumi hates that he is getting someone he loves caught up in his perpetual bad luck.    But what's great about the two is that they are working on their communication skills—something more than a bit difficult in a couple's first relationship. The last thing Izumi wants is for Shikimori to lessen herself to appease him. He wants her as she is—both her cute side and her badass side. So he makes sure to cheer her on and verbally support her at being the very best she can be.    On the other side of things, Shikimori is not bothered by Izumi's curse. She simply sees it as the price of entry for having such a kindhearted guy in her life. If she has to block the occasional flying newspaper or jump-kick a falling sign to protect the man she loves, so be it. And the fact that she tells him this is what makes them a couple with true lasting power. It's great to see such a healthy relationship in anime.    And while I've been gushing at the way the anime handles its romance, I'd be amiss if I didn't bring up the visuals. Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie is a master class on how changing one single visual detail can completely change a character's impression on the audience. When Shikimori does something awesome, all that changes is the shape of her eyes, turning into something resembling the eyes of a villainess—or of Goku whenever he gets serious in Dragon Ball Z, if you prefer. It's a fantastic shift that I find myself waiting for with bated breath in each scene.    All in all, if you're tired of will-they-won't-they romances and want a light-hearted story about two good people growing up into even better people thanks to their relationship with each other, don't miss out on this one.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Man, of all the shows this season to wind up a big disappointment, I didn't expect it to be this one. Granted, the premise isn't exactly comedic gold, but it was at least a novel dynamic for a romcom anime, and I was hoping that with Doga Kobo's A-team in charge this could be a fun complement to the other romances this season. Instead, I got 20 minutes of dull characters delivering jokes that are conceptually funny, but get totally smothered by lifeless pacing and timing.    There really is just...something missing here. Maybe it's the languid pacing of every scene, where characters seem to need a moment to start up before they start moving and talking. Maybe it's the strangely lifeless use of music that only ever serves to undercut jokes rather than punctuate them. Either way, despite being the world's biggest mark for even the dumbest romcom anime, I sat through this episode stonefaced. I could tell when jokes were happening, and I understood the punchline, could even imagine a version of it where it made me grin, and yet that never happened. It just wasn't funny, which destroys half of the romantic comedy moniker and left this episode a chore to get through.    More than that though, it also undercuts the romance angle of this whole endeavor. Especially poor Izumi, whose whole gimmick is he's got cosmically bad luck that results in pratfalls and comedic accidents for his dashing girlfriend to save him from. So when those jokes fall flat, it leaves him a boring blank slate who mostly exists to tell us how cute and/or cool Shikimori is. That's on top of the friend character who just states the point of any given scene out loud, proclaiming “It seems we're going to become better friends” when they all go out bowling. Shikimori herself is easily the most interesting character, both because she's the most active, and that she obviously has a secret side she's trying to hide from her boyfriend. The closest this episode comes to compelling is when she wholeheartedly reassures her hapless bae that he doesn't need to worry about being worthy of her – she likes him and wants to stay by his side, and that's all that matters. That's a nice sentiment, but it also gives half our central couple permission to not be interesting, and that hinders any chance of the romance being engaging.    That could maybe work if we got more of a look at “Cool” Shikimori, or if the jokes landed with anything besides a deafening thud. But as-is, this is easily the least entertaining romcom of the season. Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is similarly low-key, but its jokes are built for that delivery. Love After World Domination has a way stronger premise with a more active central couple. And even with a great production this show is not going to out-direct Kaguya-sama. In a weaker season I might continue with this one, but there's way too much competition to bother with a disappointing also-ran.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               This is a bit of a tricky one for me to (p)review, because I know that the story gets so much better from here. Not that this is bad, mind you – Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie is, even in this first episode, about the absolute cutest couple in all of anime, and while it does have a bit of a lather-rinse-repeat feel, once the characters become more than their stock selves as the plot develops, it simply becomes more – and this is coming from someone who felt that the first volume of the manga was intensely boring. The problem is, knowing what I know about later events, I'm not sure if I'm more kindly disposed to the anime's first episode than I otherwise would have been.    But my own probable bias aside, this is still pretty darn cute. Izumi and Shikimori are already a couple when we meet them, and very much an established one. It's nice that their initial meeting and going out were omitted from the episode, because we don't necessarily need to know how this whole thing started – what's important is that they clearly care a lot about each other. And believe me, Izumi needs someone who loves him as much as Shikimori around, because he's a danger magnet the likes of which cannot be overstated. If not for her quick actions this could have devolved into an isekai (thanks to a run-in with everyone's favorite motor vehicle on their walk to school) to say nothing of him taking a chalkboard eraser to the face and getting strangled by a stray page of a wind-borne newspaper. Essentially Izumi is the damsel in distress to Shikimori's prince charming, something that she's at times a little bit uncomfortable with.    Not that she has any intention of stopping. Izumi's continued presence in her life appears to be something she's willing to do anything to protect, as we see demonstrated over the course of the episode; it's just that she also wants him to think that she's “cute.” Fortunately she's not so foolish as to take her friend Neko's advice to fake being bad at bowling, because I think a piece of her does realize that Izumi likes her no matter whether she's “cute” or “cool.” The opening theme implies that she has a past that makes her worry more about it than she needs to, but it also makes her a bit more human – she's not a superhero, just someone with less of a danger magnet and with better motor coordination than Izumi.    Although the almost aggressively pastel colors can feel a little too precious at times, this is basically just a nice episode. Izumi and Shikimori aren't joined at the hip despite their mutual adoration and maintain friendships with other people, the story is gentle, and the ending theme, with Shikimori trying to protect Izumi is framed as an obstacle game, is a great way to sum things up. It's not exciting, but it is sweet, and it should only get more so from here.       James Beckett  Rating:               The blurb on Crunchyroll described our boy Izumi as “naturally unlucky”, but that's underselling it a bit. This poor kid is straight up cursed by the universe itself; his entire life is like if the Grim Reaper from Final Destination made it his life's purpose to dunk on a sweet-natured Japanese boy for years on end, and the boy just kind of learned to deal with how reality itself will seemingly warp and defy all logic or reason simply to embarrass him in front of every human on earth. Thankfully for us, this is the kind of comedy cliché that really never gets old. Charlie Chaplin was making bank off of the same material a hundred years ago, and now Izumi's casual suffering can provide us oodles of comic joy here in the second round of the Roaring 20s.    That's not the whole shtick of Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie, though, and it's the title character that transforms the anime from a solid premise to a bonafide hit. Izumi's too meek and resigned to mind his cruel fate, but the show would honestly lose a lot of its charm if it was nothing but watching this nice kid have a bad day, every day, for a whole season. That's where Shikimori comes in. You see, Izumi may be a living punchline to the universe's running joke, but his consolation prize is that he has literally the coolest girlfriend in all of anime. That isn't me just being hyperbolic, either; that's canon. Shikimori is the kind of idealized cartoon love interest that actually works because she still feels like a real person, despite being gifted superhuman reflexes and genuinely terrifying levels of charm and charisma (not to mention some wicked bowling skills). This girl loves her boyfriend so freaking much, and since Izumi also feels like a genuine character instead of a bland self-insert, their relationship is as wholesome as it is amusing.    Seriously, who among us hasn't dreamed of having a partner who kicks ass, is hot as hell, has a sweet side that melts your heart whenever it comes out, and is yet still vulnerable and empathetic enough to make her love for you apparant in every way she possibly can? I mean, I already found that—my wife is literally the coolest woman alive, after all, and I may have to investigate Keigo Maki for ripping off her life's story—but that means that everyone else on Earth could only imagine how awesome it is to have a Shikimori for a girlfriend. Until now, that is!    The Spring of 2022 seems to be the Season of Rom-Coms, as our collective cup runneth over with the likes of Kaguya-sama, Love After World Domination, and now we have Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie to add to the roster. Drink deep from the well of “Dawwwwwws”, my friends, and revel in the cuteness of it all.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie   Apr 10th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie ?                     Community score: 3.9              What is this?   Shikimori seems like the perfect girlfriend: cute, fun to be around, sweet when she wants to be, but she has a cool dark side that comes out under the right circumstances. And her boyfriend Izumi loves to be around when that happens.    Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie is based on Keigo Maki's romantic comedy manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                I read the first volume of Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie for an ANN manga preview guide some time ago. I enjoyed it, but it was one of those single joke premises and I didn't really like it enough to spend actual money on it, so I set it aside. Then Doga Kobo announced they'd be producing an anime, and I figured I'd finally get the rest of the story.    Doga Kobo has produced some fantastic comedy adaptations, even with ones that seem like their single joke couldn't possibly stretch to full-length episodes, such as Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun and Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle, so I had high hopes for Shikimori. And the first few minutes of the episode, wherein the titular Shikimori rescues her hapless boyfriend Izumi from getting hit by a truck and looks impossibly cool doing it, I thought I was going to be in for a good time. Since it is impossible for a critic to be wholly objective, I will reveal one of my biases: I have a huge weakness for gender-reversed tough girl/soft boy romances. Probably my favorite kind of heterosexuals. And Shikimori pinning Izumi against the wall and gently chastising him? That's some good fucking food, right there.    Alas, as the episode wore on, I realized it was more of an excellent amuse-bouche preceding a middling meal than a feast. The comic timing is piss-poor, causing things to drag the entire runtime. The episode is divided roughly into three segments, and each one gets maybe one or two jokes while the rest is paced like a slice-of-life series but without the necessary level of personality. Oh, there were still parts I liked, such as Shikimori choosing to discard her friend's advice to lose on purpose because fake incompetence is cute. I could go into full feminist rage mode about gender roles and it irritated me that Shikimori even entertained the idea, but the important thing is she decided to be her amazing self and bowl a perfect game, and Izumi loved it. Girls, get yourself a boy who doesn't want you to cut off bits of yourself to make them feel better, but instead adores everything awesome you are.    Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie gets three stars for having a good core concept and some good moments, but otherwise kind of boring. The adorable rhythm game ending gets it another star. I wonder what Mitsue Yamazaki is working on these days…       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               One thing I've always hated about romantic comedies is how 90% of them end with the couple finally getting together. Admitting you like each other is the first step of a relationship, not the last. I've always found the rare story about a couple dealing with the problems that come up over the course of a relationship to be far more heartfelt and interesting—which brings us to Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie. This episode doesn't even bother to tell us how the two got together—it's that unimportant. What matters is that they are together and are trying to make things work.    Of course, each of the pair has their issues. Shikimori wants to be seen as cute by her boyfriend—so much so that she is embarrassed by the badass athletic powerhouse side of herself. Meanwhile, Izumi hates that he is getting someone he loves caught up in his perpetual bad luck.    But what's great about the two is that they are working on their communication skills—something more than a bit difficult in a couple's first relationship. The last thing Izumi wants is for Shikimori to lessen herself to appease him. He wants her as she is—both her cute side and her badass side. So he makes sure to cheer her on and verbally support her at being the very best she can be.    On the other side of things, Shikimori is not bothered by Izumi's curse. She simply sees it as the price of entry for having such a kindhearted guy in her life. If she has to block the occasional flying newspaper or jump-kick a falling sign to protect the man she loves, so be it. And the fact that she tells him this is what makes them a couple with true lasting power. It's great to see such a healthy relationship in anime.    And while I've been gushing at the way the anime handles its romance, I'd be amiss if I didn't bring up the visuals. Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie is a master class on how changing one single visual detail can completely change a character's impression on the audience. When Shikimori does something awesome, all that changes is the shape of her eyes, turning into something resembling the eyes of a villainess—or of Goku whenever he gets serious in Dragon Ball Z, if you prefer. It's a fantastic shift that I find myself waiting for with bated breath in each scene.    All in all, if you're tired of will-they-won't-they romances and want a light-hearted story about two good people growing up into even better people thanks to their relationship with each other, don't miss out on this one.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Man, of all the shows this season to wind up a big disappointment, I didn't expect it to be this one. Granted, the premise isn't exactly comedic gold, but it was at least a novel dynamic for a romcom anime, and I was hoping that with Doga Kobo's A-team in charge this could be a fun complement to the other romances this season. Instead, I got 20 minutes of dull characters delivering jokes that are conceptually funny, but get totally smothered by lifeless pacing and timing.    There really is just...something missing here. Maybe it's the languid pacing of every scene, where characters seem to need a moment to start up before they start moving and talking. Maybe it's the strangely lifeless use of music that only ever serves to undercut jokes rather than punctuate them. Either way, despite being the world's biggest mark for even the dumbest romcom anime, I sat through this episode stonefaced. I could tell when jokes were happening, and I understood the punchline, could even imagine a version of it where it made me grin, and yet that never happened. It just wasn't funny, which destroys half of the romantic comedy moniker and left this episode a chore to get through.    More than that though, it also undercuts the romance angle of this whole endeavor. Especially poor Izumi, whose whole gimmick is he's got cosmically bad luck that results in pratfalls and comedic accidents for his dashing girlfriend to save him from. So when those jokes fall flat, it leaves him a boring blank slate who mostly exists to tell us how cute and/or cool Shikimori is. That's on top of the friend character who just states the point of any given scene out loud, proclaiming “It seems we're going to become better friends” when they all go out bowling. Shikimori herself is easily the most interesting character, both because she's the most active, and that she obviously has a secret side she's trying to hide from her boyfriend. The closest this episode comes to compelling is when she wholeheartedly reassures her hapless bae that he doesn't need to worry about being worthy of her – she likes him and wants to stay by his side, and that's all that matters. That's a nice sentiment, but it also gives half our central couple permission to not be interesting, and that hinders any chance of the romance being engaging.    That could maybe work if we got more of a look at “Cool” Shikimori, or if the jokes landed with anything besides a deafening thud. But as-is, this is easily the least entertaining romcom of the season. Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is similarly low-key, but its jokes are built for that delivery. Love After World Domination has a way stronger premise with a more active central couple. And even with a great production this show is not going to out-direct Kaguya-sama. In a weaker season I might continue with this one, but there's way too much competition to bother with a disappointing also-ran.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               This is a bit of a tricky one for me to (p)review, because I know that the story gets so much better from here. Not that this is bad, mind you – Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie is, even in this first episode, about the absolute cutest couple in all of anime, and while it does have a bit of a lather-rinse-repeat feel, once the characters become more than their stock selves as the plot develops, it simply becomes more – and this is coming from someone who felt that the first volume of the manga was intensely boring. The problem is, knowing what I know about later events, I'm not sure if I'm more kindly disposed to the anime's first episode than I otherwise would have been.    But my own probable bias aside, this is still pretty darn cute. Izumi and Shikimori are already a couple when we meet them, and very much an established one. It's nice that their initial meeting and going out were omitted from the episode, because we don't necessarily need to know how this whole thing started – what's important is that they clearly care a lot about each other. And believe me, Izumi needs someone who loves him as much as Shikimori around, because he's a danger magnet the likes of which cannot be overstated. If not for her quick actions this could have devolved into an isekai (thanks to a run-in with everyone's favorite motor vehicle on their walk to school) to say nothing of him taking a chalkboard eraser to the face and getting strangled by a stray page of a wind-borne newspaper. Essentially Izumi is the damsel in distress to Shikimori's prince charming, something that she's at times a little bit uncomfortable with.    Not that she has any intention of stopping. Izumi's continued presence in her life appears to be something she's willing to do anything to protect, as we see demonstrated over the course of the episode; it's just that she also wants him to think that she's “cute.” Fortunately she's not so foolish as to take her friend Neko's advice to fake being bad at bowling, because I think a piece of her does realize that Izumi likes her no matter whether she's “cute” or “cool.” The opening theme implies that she has a past that makes her worry more about it than she needs to, but it also makes her a bit more human – she's not a superhero, just someone with less of a danger magnet and with better motor coordination than Izumi.    Although the almost aggressively pastel colors can feel a little too precious at times, this is basically just a nice episode. Izumi and Shikimori aren't joined at the hip despite their mutual adoration and maintain friendships with other people, the story is gentle, and the ending theme, with Shikimori trying to protect Izumi is framed as an obstacle game, is a great way to sum things up. It's not exciting, but it is sweet, and it should only get more so from here.       James Beckett  Rating:               The blurb on Crunchyroll described our boy Izumi as “naturally unlucky”, but that's underselling it a bit. This poor kid is straight up cursed by the universe itself; his entire life is like if the Grim Reaper from Final Destination made it his life's purpose to dunk on a sweet-natured Japanese boy for years on end, and the boy just kind of learned to deal with how reality itself will seemingly warp and defy all logic or reason simply to embarrass him in front of every human on earth. Thankfully for us, this is the kind of comedy cliché that really never gets old. Charlie Chaplin was making bank off of the same material a hundred years ago, and now Izumi's casual suffering can provide us oodles of comic joy here in the second round of the Roaring 20s.    That's not the whole shtick of Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie, though, and it's the title character that transforms the anime from a solid premise to a bonafide hit. Izumi's too meek and resigned to mind his cruel fate, but the show would honestly lose a lot of its charm if it was nothing but watching this nice kid have a bad day, every day, for a whole season. That's where Shikimori comes in. You see, Izumi may be a living punchline to the universe's running joke, but his consolation prize is that he has literally the coolest girlfriend in all of anime. That isn't me just being hyperbolic, either; that's canon. Shikimori is the kind of idealized cartoon love interest that actually works because she still feels like a real person, despite being gifted superhuman reflexes and genuinely terrifying levels of charm and charisma (not to mention some wicked bowling skills). This girl loves her boyfriend so freaking much, and since Izumi also feels like a genuine character instead of a bland self-insert, their relationship is as wholesome as it is amusing.    Seriously, who among us hasn't dreamed of having a partner who kicks ass, is hot as hell, has a sweet side that melts your heart whenever it comes out, and is yet still vulnerable and empathetic enough to make her love for you apparant in every way she possibly can? I mean, I already found that—my wife is literally the coolest woman alive, after all, and I may have to investigate Keigo Maki for ripping off her life's story—but that means that everyone else on Earth could only imagine how awesome it is to have a Shikimori for a girlfriend. Until now, that is!    The Spring of 2022 seems to be the Season of Rom-Coms, as our collective cup runneth over with the likes of Kaguya-sama, Love After World Domination, and now we have Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie to add to the roster. Drink deep from the well of “Dawwwwwws”, my friends, and revel in the cuteness of it all.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie   Apr 10th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie ?                     Community score: 3.9              What is this?   Shikimori seems like the perfect girlfriend: cute, fun to be around, sweet when she wants to be, but she has a cool dark side that comes out under the right circumstances. And her boyfriend Izumi loves to be around when that happens.    Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie is based on Keigo Maki's romantic comedy manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                I read the first volume of Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie for an ANN manga preview guide some time ago. I enjoyed it, but it was one of those single joke premises and I didn't really like it enough to spend actual money on it, so I set it aside. Then Doga Kobo announced they'd be producing an anime, and I figured I'd finally get the rest of the story.    Doga Kobo has produced some fantastic comedy adaptations, even with ones that seem like their single joke couldn't possibly stretch to full-length episodes, such as Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun and Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle, so I had high hopes for Shikimori. And the first few minutes of the episode, wherein the titular Shikimori rescues her hapless boyfriend Izumi from getting hit by a truck and looks impossibly cool doing it, I thought I was going to be in for a good time. Since it is impossible for a critic to be wholly objective, I will reveal one of my biases: I have a huge weakness for gender-reversed tough girl/soft boy romances. Probably my favorite kind of heterosexuals. And Shikimori pinning Izumi against the wall and gently chastising him? That's some good fucking food, right there.    Alas, as the episode wore on, I realized it was more of an excellent amuse-bouche preceding a middling meal than a feast. The comic timing is piss-poor, causing things to drag the entire runtime. The episode is divided roughly into three segments, and each one gets maybe one or two jokes while the rest is paced like a slice-of-life series but without the necessary level of personality. Oh, there were still parts I liked, such as Shikimori choosing to discard her friend's advice to lose on purpose because fake incompetence is cute. I could go into full feminist rage mode about gender roles and it irritated me that Shikimori even entertained the idea, but the important thing is she decided to be her amazing self and bowl a perfect game, and Izumi loved it. Girls, get yourself a boy who doesn't want you to cut off bits of yourself to make them feel better, but instead adores everything awesome you are.    Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie gets three stars for having a good core concept and some good moments, but otherwise kind of boring. The adorable rhythm game ending gets it another star. I wonder what Mitsue Yamazaki is working on these days…       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               One thing I've always hated about romantic comedies is how 90% of them end with the couple finally getting together. Admitting you like each other is the first step of a relationship, not the last. I've always found the rare story about a couple dealing with the problems that come up over the course of a relationship to be far more heartfelt and interesting—which brings us to Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie. This episode doesn't even bother to tell us how the two got together—it's that unimportant. What matters is that they are together and are trying to make things work.    Of course, each of the pair has their issues. Shikimori wants to be seen as cute by her boyfriend—so much so that she is embarrassed by the badass athletic powerhouse side of herself. Meanwhile, Izumi hates that he is getting someone he loves caught up in his perpetual bad luck.    But what's great about the two is that they are working on their communication skills—something more than a bit difficult in a couple's first relationship. The last thing Izumi wants is for Shikimori to lessen herself to appease him. He wants her as she is—both her cute side and her badass side. So he makes sure to cheer her on and verbally support her at being the very best she can be.    On the other side of things, Shikimori is not bothered by Izumi's curse. She simply sees it as the price of entry for having such a kindhearted guy in her life. If she has to block the occasional flying newspaper or jump-kick a falling sign to protect the man she loves, so be it. And the fact that she tells him this is what makes them a couple with true lasting power. It's great to see such a healthy relationship in anime.    And while I've been gushing at the way the anime handles its romance, I'd be amiss if I didn't bring up the visuals. Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie is a master class on how changing one single visual detail can completely change a character's impression on the audience. When Shikimori does something awesome, all that changes is the shape of her eyes, turning into something resembling the eyes of a villainess—or of Goku whenever he gets serious in Dragon Ball Z, if you prefer. It's a fantastic shift that I find myself waiting for with bated breath in each scene.    All in all, if you're tired of will-they-won't-they romances and want a light-hearted story about two good people growing up into even better people thanks to their relationship with each other, don't miss out on this one.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Man, of all the shows this season to wind up a big disappointment, I didn't expect it to be this one. Granted, the premise isn't exactly comedic gold, but it was at least a novel dynamic for a romcom anime, and I was hoping that with Doga Kobo's A-team in charge this could be a fun complement to the other romances this season. Instead, I got 20 minutes of dull characters delivering jokes that are conceptually funny, but get totally smothered by lifeless pacing and timing.    There really is just...something missing here. Maybe it's the languid pacing of every scene, where characters seem to need a moment to start up before they start moving and talking. Maybe it's the strangely lifeless use of music that only ever serves to undercut jokes rather than punctuate them. Either way, despite being the world's biggest mark for even the dumbest romcom anime, I sat through this episode stonefaced. I could tell when jokes were happening, and I understood the punchline, could even imagine a version of it where it made me grin, and yet that never happened. It just wasn't funny, which destroys half of the romantic comedy moniker and left this episode a chore to get through.    More than that though, it also undercuts the romance angle of this whole endeavor. Especially poor Izumi, whose whole gimmick is he's got cosmically bad luck that results in pratfalls and comedic accidents for his dashing girlfriend to save him from. So when those jokes fall flat, it leaves him a boring blank slate who mostly exists to tell us how cute and/or cool Shikimori is. That's on top of the friend character who just states the point of any given scene out loud, proclaiming “It seems we're going to become better friends” when they all go out bowling. Shikimori herself is easily the most interesting character, both because she's the most active, and that she obviously has a secret side she's trying to hide from her boyfriend. The closest this episode comes to compelling is when she wholeheartedly reassures her hapless bae that he doesn't need to worry about being worthy of her – she likes him and wants to stay by his side, and that's all that matters. That's a nice sentiment, but it also gives half our central couple permission to not be interesting, and that hinders any chance of the romance being engaging.    That could maybe work if we got more of a look at “Cool” Shikimori, or if the jokes landed with anything besides a deafening thud. But as-is, this is easily the least entertaining romcom of the season. Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is similarly low-key, but its jokes are built for that delivery. Love After World Domination has a way stronger premise with a more active central couple. And even with a great production this show is not going to out-direct Kaguya-sama. In a weaker season I might continue with this one, but there's way too much competition to bother with a disappointing also-ran.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               This is a bit of a tricky one for me to (p)review, because I know that the story gets so much better from here. Not that this is bad, mind you – Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie is, even in this first episode, about the absolute cutest couple in all of anime, and while it does have a bit of a lather-rinse-repeat feel, once the characters become more than their stock selves as the plot develops, it simply becomes more – and this is coming from someone who felt that the first volume of the manga was intensely boring. The problem is, knowing what I know about later events, I'm not sure if I'm more kindly disposed to the anime's first episode than I otherwise would have been.    But my own probable bias aside, this is still pretty darn cute. Izumi and Shikimori are already a couple when we meet them, and very much an established one. It's nice that their initial meeting and going out were omitted from the episode, because we don't necessarily need to know how this whole thing started – what's important is that they clearly care a lot about each other. And believe me, Izumi needs someone who loves him as much as Shikimori around, because he's a danger magnet the likes of which cannot be overstated. If not for her quick actions this could have devolved into an isekai (thanks to a run-in with everyone's favorite motor vehicle on their walk to school) to say nothing of him taking a chalkboard eraser to the face and getting strangled by a stray page of a wind-borne newspaper. Essentially Izumi is the damsel in distress to Shikimori's prince charming, something that she's at times a little bit uncomfortable with.    Not that she has any intention of stopping. Izumi's continued presence in her life appears to be something she's willing to do anything to protect, as we see demonstrated over the course of the episode; it's just that she also wants him to think that she's “cute.” Fortunately she's not so foolish as to take her friend Neko's advice to fake being bad at bowling, because I think a piece of her does realize that Izumi likes her no matter whether she's “cute” or “cool.” The opening theme implies that she has a past that makes her worry more about it than she needs to, but it also makes her a bit more human – she's not a superhero, just someone with less of a danger magnet and with better motor coordination than Izumi.    Although the almost aggressively pastel colors can feel a little too precious at times, this is basically just a nice episode. Izumi and Shikimori aren't joined at the hip despite their mutual adoration and maintain friendships with other people, the story is gentle, and the ending theme, with Shikimori trying to protect Izumi is framed as an obstacle game, is a great way to sum things up. It's not exciting, but it is sweet, and it should only get more so from here.       James Beckett  Rating:               The blurb on Crunchyroll described our boy Izumi as “naturally unlucky”, but that's underselling it a bit. This poor kid is straight up cursed by the universe itself; his entire life is like if the Grim Reaper from Final Destination made it his life's purpose to dunk on a sweet-natured Japanese boy for years on end, and the boy just kind of learned to deal with how reality itself will seemingly warp and defy all logic or reason simply to embarrass him in front of every human on earth. Thankfully for us, this is the kind of comedy cliché that really never gets old. Charlie Chaplin was making bank off of the same material a hundred years ago, and now Izumi's casual suffering can provide us oodles of comic joy here in the second round of the Roaring 20s.    That's not the whole shtick of Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie, though, and it's the title character that transforms the anime from a solid premise to a bonafide hit. Izumi's too meek and resigned to mind his cruel fate, but the show would honestly lose a lot of its charm if it was nothing but watching this nice kid have a bad day, every day, for a whole season. That's where Shikimori comes in. You see, Izumi may be a living punchline to the universe's running joke, but his consolation prize is that he has literally the coolest girlfriend in all of anime. That isn't me just being hyperbolic, either; that's canon. Shikimori is the kind of idealized cartoon love interest that actually works because she still feels like a real person, despite being gifted superhuman reflexes and genuinely terrifying levels of charm and charisma (not to mention some wicked bowling skills). This girl loves her boyfriend so freaking much, and since Izumi also feels like a genuine character instead of a bland self-insert, their relationship is as wholesome as it is amusing.    Seriously, who among us hasn't dreamed of having a partner who kicks ass, is hot as hell, has a sweet side that melts your heart whenever it comes out, and is yet still vulnerable and empathetic enough to make her love for you apparant in every way she possibly can? I mean, I already found that—my wife is literally the coolest woman alive, after all, and I may have to investigate Keigo Maki for ripping off her life's story—but that means that everyone else on Earth could only imagine how awesome it is to have a Shikimori for a girlfriend. Until now, that is!    The Spring of 2022 seems to be the Season of Rom-Coms, as our collective cup runneth over with the likes of Kaguya-sama, Love After World Domination, and now we have Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie to add to the roster. Drink deep from the well of “Dawwwwwws”, my friends, and revel in the cuteness of it all. This show looks like another keeper, indeed.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            column          4 comments       This Week in Games - Let's Talk About Kingdom Hearts   Apr 16, 07:53 4 comments                 games    Heidi speculates on wtf is going on in the new Kingdom Hearts game and holy crap Witch on the Holy Night is getting a Western release?! ― Hi folks.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie   Apr 10th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie ?                     Community score: 3.9              What is this?   Shikimori seems like the perfect girlfriend: cute, fun to be around, sweet when she wants to be, but she has a cool dark side that comes out under the right circumstances. And her boyfriend Izumi loves to be around when that happens.    Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie is based on Keigo Maki's romantic comedy manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                I read the first volume of Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie for an ANN manga preview guide some time ago. I enjoyed it, but it was one of those single joke premises and I didn't really like it enough to spend actual money on it, so I set it aside. Then Doga Kobo announced they'd be producing an anime, and I figured I'd finally get the rest of the story.    Doga Kobo has produced some fantastic comedy adaptations, even with ones that seem like their single joke couldn't possibly stretch to full-length episodes, such as Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun and Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle, so I had high hopes for Shikimori. And the first few minutes of the episode, wherein the titular Shikimori rescues her hapless boyfriend Izumi from getting hit by a truck and looks impossibly cool doing it, I thought I was going to be in for a good time. Since it is impossible for a critic to be wholly objective, I will reveal one of my biases: I have a huge weakness for gender-reversed tough girl/soft boy romances. Probably my favorite kind of heterosexuals. And Shikimori pinning Izumi against the wall and gently chastising him? That's some good fucking food, right there.    Alas, as the episode wore on, I realized it was more of an excellent amuse-bouche preceding a middling meal than a feast. The comic timing is piss-poor, causing things to drag the entire runtime. The episode is divided roughly into three segments, and each one gets maybe one or two jokes while the rest is paced like a slice-of-life series but without the necessary level of personality. Oh, there were still parts I liked, such as Shikimori choosing to discard her friend's advice to lose on purpose because fake incompetence is cute. I could go into full feminist rage mode about gender roles and it irritated me that Shikimori even entertained the idea, but the important thing is she decided to be her amazing self and bowl a perfect game, and Izumi loved it. Girls, get yourself a boy who doesn't want you to cut off bits of yourself to make them feel better, but instead adores everything awesome you are.    Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie gets three stars for having a good core concept and some good moments, but otherwise kind of boring. The adorable rhythm game ending gets it another star. I wonder what Mitsue Yamazaki is working on these days…       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               One thing I've always hated about romantic comedies is how 90% of them end with the couple finally getting together. Admitting you like each other is the first step of a relationship, not the last. I've always found the rare story about a couple dealing with the problems that come up over the course of a relationship to be far more heartfelt and interesting—which brings us to Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie. This episode doesn't even bother to tell us how the two got together—it's that unimportant. What matters is that they are together and are trying to make things work.    Of course, each of the pair has their issues. Shikimori wants to be seen as cute by her boyfriend—so much so that she is embarrassed by the badass athletic powerhouse side of herself. Meanwhile, Izumi hates that he is getting someone he loves caught up in his perpetual bad luck.    But what's great about the two is that they are working on their communication skills—something more than a bit difficult in a couple's first relationship. The last thing Izumi wants is for Shikimori to lessen herself to appease him. He wants her as she is—both her cute side and her badass side. So he makes sure to cheer her on and verbally support her at being the very best she can be.    On the other side of things, Shikimori is not bothered by Izumi's curse. She simply sees it as the price of entry for having such a kindhearted guy in her life. If she has to block the occasional flying newspaper or jump-kick a falling sign to protect the man she loves, so be it. And the fact that she tells him this is what makes them a couple with true lasting power. It's great to see such a healthy relationship in anime.    And while I've been gushing at the way the anime handles its romance, I'd be amiss if I didn't bring up the visuals. Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie is a master class on how changing one single visual detail can completely change a character's impression on the audience. When Shikimori does something awesome, all that changes is the shape of her eyes, turning into something resembling the eyes of a villainess—or of Goku whenever he gets serious in Dragon Ball Z, if you prefer. It's a fantastic shift that I find myself waiting for with bated breath in each scene.    All in all, if you're tired of will-they-won't-they romances and want a light-hearted story about two good people growing up into even better people thanks to their relationship with each other, don't miss out on this one.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Man, of all the shows this season to wind up a big disappointment, I didn't expect it to be this one. Granted, the premise isn't exactly comedic gold, but it was at least a novel dynamic for a romcom anime, and I was hoping that with Doga Kobo's A-team in charge this could be a fun complement to the other romances this season. Instead, I got 20 minutes of dull characters delivering jokes that are conceptually funny, but get totally smothered by lifeless pacing and timing.    There really is just...something missing here. Maybe it's the languid pacing of every scene, where characters seem to need a moment to start up before they start moving and talking. Maybe it's the strangely lifeless use of music that only ever serves to undercut jokes rather than punctuate them. Either way, despite being the world's biggest mark for even the dumbest romcom anime, I sat through this episode stonefaced. I could tell when jokes were happening, and I understood the punchline, could even imagine a version of it where it made me grin, and yet that never happened. It just wasn't funny, which destroys half of the romantic comedy moniker and left this episode a chore to get through.    More than that though, it also undercuts the romance angle of this whole endeavor. Especially poor Izumi, whose whole gimmick is he's got cosmically bad luck that results in pratfalls and comedic accidents for his dashing girlfriend to save him from. So when those jokes fall flat, it leaves him a boring blank slate who mostly exists to tell us how cute and/or cool Shikimori is. That's on top of the friend character who just states the point of any given scene out loud, proclaiming “It seems we're going to become better friends” when they all go out bowling. Shikimori herself is easily the most interesting character, both because she's the most active, and that she obviously has a secret side she's trying to hide from her boyfriend. The closest this episode comes to compelling is when she wholeheartedly reassures her hapless bae that he doesn't need to worry about being worthy of her – she likes him and wants to stay by his side, and that's all that matters. That's a nice sentiment, but it also gives half our central couple permission to not be interesting, and that hinders any chance of the romance being engaging.    That could maybe work if we got more of a look at “Cool” Shikimori, or if the jokes landed with anything besides a deafening thud. But as-is, this is easily the least entertaining romcom of the season. Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is similarly low-key, but its jokes are built for that delivery. Love After World Domination has a way stronger premise with a more active central couple. And even with a great production this show is not going to out-direct Kaguya-sama. In a weaker season I might continue with this one, but there's way too much competition to bother with a disappointing also-ran.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               This is a bit of a tricky one for me to (p)review, because I know that the story gets so much better from here. Not that this is bad, mind you – Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie is, even in this first episode, about the absolute cutest couple in all of anime, and while it does have a bit of a lather-rinse-repeat feel, once the characters become more than their stock selves as the plot develops, it simply becomes more – and this is coming from someone who felt that the first volume of the manga was intensely boring. The problem is, knowing what I know about later events, I'm not sure if I'm more kindly disposed to the anime's first episode than I otherwise would have been.    But my own probable bias aside, this is still pretty darn cute. Izumi and Shikimori are already a couple when we meet them, and very much an established one. It's nice that their initial meeting and going out were omitted from the episode, because we don't necessarily need to know how this whole thing started – what's important is that they clearly care a lot about each other. And believe me, Izumi needs someone who loves him as much as Shikimori around, because he's a danger magnet the likes of which cannot be overstated. If not for her quick actions this could have devolved into an isekai (thanks to a run-in with everyone's favorite motor vehicle on their walk to school) to say nothing of him taking a chalkboard eraser to the face and getting strangled by a stray page of a wind-borne newspaper. Essentially Izumi is the damsel in distress to Shikimori's prince charming, something that she's at times a little bit uncomfortable with.    Not that she has any intention of stopping. Izumi's continued presence in her life appears to be something she's willing to do anything to protect, as we see demonstrated over the course of the episode; it's just that she also wants him to think that she's “cute.” Fortunately she's not so foolish as to take her friend Neko's advice to fake being bad at bowling, because I think a piece of her does realize that Izumi likes her no matter whether she's “cute” or “cool.” The opening theme implies that she has a past that makes her worry more about it than she needs to, but it also makes her a bit more human – she's not a superhero, just someone with less of a danger magnet and with better motor coordination than Izumi.    Although the almost aggressively pastel colors can feel a little too precious at times, this is basically just a nice episode. Izumi and Shikimori aren't joined at the hip despite their mutual adoration and maintain friendships with other people, the story is gentle, and the ending theme, with Shikimori trying to protect Izumi is framed as an obstacle game, is a great way to sum things up. It's not exciting, but it is sweet, and it should only get more so from here.       James Beckett  Rating:               The blurb on Crunchyroll described our boy Izumi as “naturally unlucky”, but that's underselling it a bit. This poor kid is straight up cursed by the universe itself; his entire life is like if the Grim Reaper from Final Destination made it his life's purpose to dunk on a sweet-natured Japanese boy for years on end, and the boy just kind of learned to deal with how reality itself will seemingly warp and defy all logic or reason simply to embarrass him in front of every human on earth. Thankfully for us, this is the kind of comedy cliché that really never gets old. Charlie Chaplin was making bank off of the same material a hundred years ago, and now Izumi's casual suffering can provide us oodles of comic joy here in the second round of the Roaring 20s.    That's not the whole shtick of Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie, though, and it's the title character that transforms the anime from a solid premise to a bonafide hit. Izumi's too meek and resigned to mind his cruel fate, but the show would honestly lose a lot of its charm if it was nothing but watching this nice kid have a bad day, every day, for a whole season. That's where Shikimori comes in. You see, Izumi may be a living punchline to the universe's running joke, but his consolation prize is that he has literally the coolest girlfriend in all of anime. That isn't me just being hyperbolic, either; that's canon. Shikimori is the kind of idealized cartoon love interest that actually works because she still feels like a real person, despite being gifted superhuman reflexes and genuinely terrifying levels of charm and charisma (not to mention some wicked bowling skills). This girl loves her boyfriend so freaking much, and since Izumi also feels like a genuine character instead of a bland self-insert, their relationship is as wholesome as it is amusing.    Seriously, who among us hasn't dreamed of having a partner who kicks ass, is hot as hell, has a sweet side that melts your heart whenever it comes out, and is yet still vulnerable and empathetic enough to make her love for you apparant in every way she possibly can? I mean, I already found that—my wife is literally the coolest woman alive, after all, and I may have to investigate Keigo Maki for ripping off her life's story—but that means that everyone else on Earth could only imagine how awesome it is to have a Shikimori for a girlfriend. Until now, that is!    The Spring of 2022 seems to be the Season of Rom-Coms, as our collective cup runneth over with the likes of Kaguya-sama, Love After World Domination, and now we have Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie to add to the roster. Drink deep from the well of “Dawwwwwws”, my friends, and revel in the cuteness of it all.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie   Apr 10th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie ?                     Community score: 3.9              What is this?   Shikimori seems like the perfect girlfriend: cute, fun to be around, sweet when she wants to be, but she has a cool dark side that comes out under the right circumstances. And her boyfriend Izumi loves to be around when that happens.    Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie is based on Keigo Maki's romantic comedy manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                I read the first volume of Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie for an ANN manga preview guide some time ago. I enjoyed it, but it was one of those single joke premises and I didn't really like it enough to spend actual money on it, so I set it aside. Then Doga Kobo announced they'd be producing an anime, and I figured I'd finally get the rest of the story.    Doga Kobo has produced some fantastic comedy adaptations, even with ones that seem like their single joke couldn't possibly stretch to full-length episodes, such as Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun and Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle, so I had high hopes for Shikimori. And the first few minutes of the episode, wherein the titular Shikimori rescues her hapless boyfriend Izumi from getting hit by a truck and looks impossibly cool doing it, I thought I was going to be in for a good time. Since it is impossible for a critic to be wholly objective, I will reveal one of my biases: I have a huge weakness for gender-reversed tough girl/soft boy romances. Probably my favorite kind of heterosexuals. And Shikimori pinning Izumi against the wall and gently chastising him? That's some good fucking food, right there.    Alas, as the episode wore on, I realized it was more of an excellent amuse-bouche preceding a middling meal than a feast. The comic timing is piss-poor, causing things to drag the entire runtime. The episode is divided roughly into three segments, and each one gets maybe one or two jokes while the rest is paced like a slice-of-life series but without the necessary level of personality. Oh, there were still parts I liked, such as Shikimori choosing to discard her friend's advice to lose on purpose because fake incompetence is cute. I could go into full feminist rage mode about gender roles and it irritated me that Shikimori even entertained the idea, but the important thing is she decided to be her amazing self and bowl a perfect game, and Izumi loved it. Girls, get yourself a boy who doesn't want you to cut off bits of yourself to make them feel better, but instead adores everything awesome you are.    Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie gets three stars for having a good core concept and some good moments, but otherwise kind of boring. The adorable rhythm game ending gets it another star. I wonder what Mitsue Yamazaki is working on these days…       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               One thing I've always hated about romantic comedies is how 90% of them end with the couple finally getting together. Admitting you like each other is the first step of a relationship, not the last. I've always found the rare story about a couple dealing with the problems that come up over the course of a relationship to be far more heartfelt and interesting—which brings us to Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie. This episode doesn't even bother to tell us how the two got together—it's that unimportant. What matters is that they are together and are trying to make things work.    Of course, each of the pair has their issues. Shikimori wants to be seen as cute by her boyfriend—so much so that she is embarrassed by the badass athletic powerhouse side of herself. Meanwhile, Izumi hates that he is getting someone he loves caught up in his perpetual bad luck.    But what's great about the two is that they are working on their communication skills—something more than a bit difficult in a couple's first relationship. The last thing Izumi wants is for Shikimori to lessen herself to appease him. He wants her as she is—both her cute side and her badass side. So he makes sure to cheer her on and verbally support her at being the very best she can be.    On the other side of things, Shikimori is not bothered by Izumi's curse. She simply sees it as the price of entry for having such a kindhearted guy in her life. If she has to block the occasional flying newspaper or jump-kick a falling sign to protect the man she loves, so be it. And the fact that she tells him this is what makes them a couple with true lasting power. It's great to see such a healthy relationship in anime.    And while I've been gushing at the way the anime handles its romance, I'd be amiss if I didn't bring up the visuals. Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie is a master class on how changing one single visual detail can completely change a character's impression on the audience. When Shikimori does something awesome, all that changes is the shape of her eyes, turning into something resembling the eyes of a villainess—or of Goku whenever he gets serious in Dragon Ball Z, if you prefer. It's a fantastic shift that I find myself waiting for with bated breath in each scene.    All in all, if you're tired of will-they-won't-they romances and want a light-hearted story about two good people growing up into even better people thanks to their relationship with each other, don't miss out on this one.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Man, of all the shows this season to wind up a big disappointment, I didn't expect it to be this one. Granted, the premise isn't exactly comedic gold, but it was at least a novel dynamic for a romcom anime, and I was hoping that with Doga Kobo's A-team in charge this could be a fun complement to the other romances this season. Instead, I got 20 minutes of dull characters delivering jokes that are conceptually funny, but get totally smothered by lifeless pacing and timing.    There really is just...something missing here. Maybe it's the languid pacing of every scene, where characters seem to need a moment to start up before they start moving and talking. Maybe it's the strangely lifeless use of music that only ever serves to undercut jokes rather than punctuate them. Either way, despite being the world's biggest mark for even the dumbest romcom anime, I sat through this episode stonefaced. I could tell when jokes were happening, and I understood the punchline, could even imagine a version of it where it made me grin, and yet that never happened. It just wasn't funny, which destroys half of the romantic comedy moniker and left this episode a chore to get through.    More than that though, it also undercuts the romance angle of this whole endeavor. Especially poor Izumi, whose whole gimmick is he's got cosmically bad luck that results in pratfalls and comedic accidents for his dashing girlfriend to save him from. So when those jokes fall flat, it leaves him a boring blank slate who mostly exists to tell us how cute and/or cool Shikimori is. That's on top of the friend character who just states the point of any given scene out loud, proclaiming “It seems we're going to become better friends” when they all go out bowling. Shikimori herself is easily the most interesting character, both because she's the most active, and that she obviously has a secret side she's trying to hide from her boyfriend. The closest this episode comes to compelling is when she wholeheartedly reassures her hapless bae that he doesn't need to worry about being worthy of her – she likes him and wants to stay by his side, and that's all that matters. That's a nice sentiment, but it also gives half our central couple permission to not be interesting, and that hinders any chance of the romance being engaging.    That could maybe work if we got more of a look at “Cool” Shikimori, or if the jokes landed with anything besides a deafening thud. But as-is, this is easily the least entertaining romcom of the season. Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is similarly low-key, but its jokes are built for that delivery. Love After World Domination has a way stronger premise with a more active central couple. And even with a great production this show is not going to out-direct Kaguya-sama. In a weaker season I might continue with this one, but there's way too much competition to bother with a disappointing also-ran.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               This is a bit of a tricky one for me to (p)review, because I know that the story gets so much better from here. Not that this is bad, mind you – Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie is, even in this first episode, about the absolute cutest couple in all of anime, and while it does have a bit of a lather-rinse-repeat feel, once the characters become more than their stock selves as the plot develops, it simply becomes more – and this is coming from someone who felt that the first volume of the manga was intensely boring. The problem is, knowing what I know about later events, I'm not sure if I'm more kindly disposed to the anime's first episode than I otherwise would have been.    But my own probable bias aside, this is still pretty darn cute. Izumi and Shikimori are already a couple when we meet them, and very much an established one. It's nice that their initial meeting and going out were omitted from the episode, because we don't necessarily need to know how this whole thing started – what's important is that they clearly care a lot about each other. And believe me, Izumi needs someone who loves him as much as Shikimori around, because he's a danger magnet the likes of which cannot be overstated. If not for her quick actions this could have devolved into an isekai (thanks to a run-in with everyone's favorite motor vehicle on their walk to school) to say nothing of him taking a chalkboard eraser to the face and getting strangled by a stray page of a wind-borne newspaper. Essentially Izumi is the damsel in distress to Shikimori's prince charming, something that she's at times a little bit uncomfortable with.    Not that she has any intention of stopping. Izumi's continued presence in her life appears to be something she's willing to do anything to protect, as we see demonstrated over the course of the episode; it's just that she also wants him to think that she's “cute.” Fortunately she's not so foolish as to take her friend Neko's advice to fake being bad at bowling, because I think a piece of her does realize that Izumi likes her no matter whether she's “cute” or “cool.” The opening theme implies that she has a past that makes her worry more about it than she needs to, but it also makes her a bit more human – she's not a superhero, just someone with less of a danger magnet and with better motor coordination than Izumi.    Although the almost aggressively pastel colors can feel a little too precious at times, this is basically just a nice episode. Izumi and Shikimori aren't joined at the hip despite their mutual adoration and maintain friendships with other people, the story is gentle, and the ending theme, with Shikimori trying to protect Izumi is framed as an obstacle game, is a great way to sum things up. It's not exciting, but it is sweet, and it should only get more so from here.       James Beckett  Rating:               The blurb on Crunchyroll described our boy Izumi as “naturally unlucky”, but that's underselling it a bit. This poor kid is straight up cursed by the universe itself; his entire life is like if the Grim Reaper from Final Destination made it his life's purpose to dunk on a sweet-natured Japanese boy for years on end, and the boy just kind of learned to deal with how reality itself will seemingly warp and defy all logic or reason simply to embarrass him in front of every human on earth. Thankfully for us, this is the kind of comedy cliché that really never gets old. Charlie Chaplin was making bank off of the same material a hundred years ago, and now Izumi's casual suffering can provide us oodles of comic joy here in the second round of the Roaring 20s.    That's not the whole shtick of Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie, though, and it's the title character that transforms the anime from a solid premise to a bonafide hit. Izumi's too meek and resigned to mind his cruel fate, but the show would honestly lose a lot of its charm if it was nothing but watching this nice kid have a bad day, every day, for a whole season. That's where Shikimori comes in. You see, Izumi may be a living punchline to the universe's running joke, but his consolation prize is that he has literally the coolest girlfriend in all of anime. That isn't me just being hyperbolic, either; that's canon. Shikimori is the kind of idealized cartoon love interest that actually works because she still feels like a real person, despite being gifted superhuman reflexes and genuinely terrifying levels of charm and charisma (not to mention some wicked bowling skills). This girl loves her boyfriend so freaking much, and since Izumi also feels like a genuine character instead of a bland self-insert, their relationship is as wholesome as it is amusing.    Seriously, who among us hasn't dreamed of having a partner who kicks ass, is hot as hell, has a sweet side that melts your heart whenever it comes out, and is yet still vulnerable and empathetic enough to make her love for you apparant in every way she possibly can? I mean, I already found that—my wife is literally the coolest woman alive, after all, and I may have to investigate Keigo Maki for ripping off her life's story—but that means that everyone else on Earth could only imagine how awesome it is to have a Shikimori for a girlfriend. Until now, that is!    The Spring of 2022 seems to be the Season of Rom-Coms, as our collective cup runneth over with the likes of Kaguya-sama, Love After World Domination, and now we have Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie to add to the roster. Drink deep from the well of “Dawwwwwws”, my friends, and revel in the cuteness of it all. This show looks like another keeper, indeed.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

16-04-2022,anime,2,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/preview-guide/2022/spring/shikimori-not-just-a-cutie/.183648,Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie - The Spring 2022 Preview Guide - Anime News Network:SEA,"    The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie   Apr 10th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie ?                     Community score: 3.9              What is this?   Shikimori seems like the perfect girlfriend: cute, fun to be around, sweet when she wants to be, but she has a cool dark side that comes out under the right circumstances. And her boyfriend Izumi loves to be around when that happens.    Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie is based on Keigo Maki's romantic comedy manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                I read the first volume of Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie for an ANN manga preview guide some time ago. I enjoyed it, but it was one of those single joke premises and I didn't really like it enough to spend actual money on it, so I set it aside. Then Doga Kobo announced they'd be producing an anime, and I figured I'd finally get the rest of the story.    Doga Kobo has produced some fantastic comedy adaptations, even with ones that seem like their single joke couldn't possibly stretch to full-length episodes, such as Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun and Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle, so I had high hopes for Shikimori. And the first few minutes of the episode, wherein the titular Shikimori rescues her hapless boyfriend Izumi from getting hit by a truck and looks impossibly cool doing it, I thought I was going to be in for a good time. Since it is impossible for a critic to be wholly objective, I will reveal one of my biases: I have a huge weakness for gender-reversed tough girl/soft boy romances. Probably my favorite kind of heterosexuals. And Shikimori pinning Izumi against the wall and gently chastising him? That's some good fucking food, right there.    Alas, as the episode wore on, I realized it was more of an excellent amuse-bouche preceding a middling meal than a feast. The comic timing is piss-poor, causing things to drag the entire runtime. The episode is divided roughly into three segments, and each one gets maybe one or two jokes while the rest is paced like a slice-of-life series but without the necessary level of personality. Oh, there were still parts I liked, such as Shikimori choosing to discard her friend's advice to lose on purpose because fake incompetence is cute. I could go into full feminist rage mode about gender roles and it irritated me that Shikimori even entertained the idea, but the important thing is she decided to be her amazing self and bowl a perfect game, and Izumi loved it. Girls, get yourself a boy who doesn't want you to cut off bits of yourself to make them feel better, but instead adores everything awesome you are.    Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie gets three stars for having a good core concept and some good moments, but otherwise kind of boring. The adorable rhythm game ending gets it another star. I wonder what Mitsue Yamazaki is working on these days…       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               One thing I've always hated about romantic comedies is how 90% of them end with the couple finally getting together. Admitting you like each other is the first step of a relationship, not the last. I've always found the rare story about a couple dealing with the problems that come up over the course of a relationship to be far more heartfelt and interesting—which brings us to Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie. This episode doesn't even bother to tell us how the two got together—it's that unimportant. What matters is that they are together and are trying to make things work.    Of course, each of the pair has their issues. Shikimori wants to be seen as cute by her boyfriend—so much so that she is embarrassed by the badass athletic powerhouse side of herself. Meanwhile, Izumi hates that he is getting someone he loves caught up in his perpetual bad luck.    But what's great about the two is that they are working on their communication skills—something more than a bit difficult in a couple's first relationship. The last thing Izumi wants is for Shikimori to lessen herself to appease him. He wants her as she is—both her cute side and her badass side. So he makes sure to cheer her on and verbally support her at being the very best she can be.    On the other side of things, Shikimori is not bothered by Izumi's curse. She simply sees it as the price of entry for having such a kindhearted guy in her life. If she has to block the occasional flying newspaper or jump-kick a falling sign to protect the man she loves, so be it. And the fact that she tells him this is what makes them a couple with true lasting power. It's great to see such a healthy relationship in anime.    And while I've been gushing at the way the anime handles its romance, I'd be amiss if I didn't bring up the visuals. Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie is a master class on how changing one single visual detail can completely change a character's impression on the audience. When Shikimori does something awesome, all that changes is the shape of her eyes, turning into something resembling the eyes of a villainess—or of Goku whenever he gets serious in Dragon Ball Z, if you prefer. It's a fantastic shift that I find myself waiting for with bated breath in each scene.    All in all, if you're tired of will-they-won't-they romances and want a light-hearted story about two good people growing up into even better people thanks to their relationship with each other, don't miss out on this one.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Man, of all the shows this season to wind up a big disappointment, I didn't expect it to be this one. Granted, the premise isn't exactly comedic gold, but it was at least a novel dynamic for a romcom anime, and I was hoping that with Doga Kobo's A-team in charge this could be a fun complement to the other romances this season. Instead, I got 20 minutes of dull characters delivering jokes that are conceptually funny, but get totally smothered by lifeless pacing and timing.    There really is just...something missing here. Maybe it's the languid pacing of every scene, where characters seem to need a moment to start up before they start moving and talking. Maybe it's the strangely lifeless use of music that only ever serves to undercut jokes rather than punctuate them. Either way, despite being the world's biggest mark for even the dumbest romcom anime, I sat through this episode stonefaced. I could tell when jokes were happening, and I understood the punchline, could even imagine a version of it where it made me grin, and yet that never happened. It just wasn't funny, which destroys half of the romantic comedy moniker and left this episode a chore to get through.    More than that though, it also undercuts the romance angle of this whole endeavor. Especially poor Izumi, whose whole gimmick is he's got cosmically bad luck that results in pratfalls and comedic accidents for his dashing girlfriend to save him from. So when those jokes fall flat, it leaves him a boring blank slate who mostly exists to tell us how cute and/or cool Shikimori is. That's on top of the friend character who just states the point of any given scene out loud, proclaiming “It seems we're going to become better friends” when they all go out bowling. Shikimori herself is easily the most interesting character, both because she's the most active, and that she obviously has a secret side she's trying to hide from her boyfriend. The closest this episode comes to compelling is when she wholeheartedly reassures her hapless bae that he doesn't need to worry about being worthy of her – she likes him and wants to stay by his side, and that's all that matters. That's a nice sentiment, but it also gives half our central couple permission to not be interesting, and that hinders any chance of the romance being engaging.    That could maybe work if we got more of a look at “Cool” Shikimori, or if the jokes landed with anything besides a deafening thud. But as-is, this is easily the least entertaining romcom of the season. Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is similarly low-key, but its jokes are built for that delivery. Love After World Domination has a way stronger premise with a more active central couple. And even with a great production this show is not going to out-direct Kaguya-sama. In a weaker season I might continue with this one, but there's way too much competition to bother with a disappointing also-ran.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               This is a bit of a tricky one for me to (p)review, because I know that the story gets so much better from here. Not that this is bad, mind you – Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie is, even in this first episode, about the absolute cutest couple in all of anime, and while it does have a bit of a lather-rinse-repeat feel, once the characters become more than their stock selves as the plot develops, it simply becomes more – and this is coming from someone who felt that the first volume of the manga was intensely boring. The problem is, knowing what I know about later events, I'm not sure if I'm more kindly disposed to the anime's first episode than I otherwise would have been.    But my own probable bias aside, this is still pretty darn cute. Izumi and Shikimori are already a couple when we meet them, and very much an established one. It's nice that their initial meeting and going out were omitted from the episode, because we don't necessarily need to know how this whole thing started – what's important is that they clearly care a lot about each other. And believe me, Izumi needs someone who loves him as much as Shikimori around, because he's a danger magnet the likes of which cannot be overstated. If not for her quick actions this could have devolved into an isekai (thanks to a run-in with everyone's favorite motor vehicle on their walk to school) to say nothing of him taking a chalkboard eraser to the face and getting strangled by a stray page of a wind-borne newspaper. Essentially Izumi is the damsel in distress to Shikimori's prince charming, something that she's at times a little bit uncomfortable with.    Not that she has any intention of stopping. Izumi's continued presence in her life appears to be something she's willing to do anything to protect, as we see demonstrated over the course of the episode; it's just that she also wants him to think that she's “cute.” Fortunately she's not so foolish as to take her friend Neko's advice to fake being bad at bowling, because I think a piece of her does realize that Izumi likes her no matter whether she's “cute” or “cool.” The opening theme implies that she has a past that makes her worry more about it than she needs to, but it also makes her a bit more human – she's not a superhero, just someone with less of a danger magnet and with better motor coordination than Izumi.    Although the almost aggressively pastel colors can feel a little too precious at times, this is basically just a nice episode. Izumi and Shikimori aren't joined at the hip despite their mutual adoration and maintain friendships with other people, the story is gentle, and the ending theme, with Shikimori trying to protect Izumi is framed as an obstacle game, is a great way to sum things up. It's not exciting, but it is sweet, and it should only get more so from here.       James Beckett  Rating:               The blurb on Crunchyroll described our boy Izumi as “naturally unlucky”, but that's underselling it a bit. This poor kid is straight up cursed by the universe itself; his entire life is like if the Grim Reaper from Final Destination made it his life's purpose to dunk on a sweet-natured Japanese boy for years on end, and the boy just kind of learned to deal with how reality itself will seemingly warp and defy all logic or reason simply to embarrass him in front of every human on earth. Thankfully for us, this is the kind of comedy cliché that really never gets old. Charlie Chaplin was making bank off of the same material a hundred years ago, and now Izumi's casual suffering can provide us oodles of comic joy here in the second round of the Roaring 20s.    That's not the whole shtick of Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie, though, and it's the title character that transforms the anime from a solid premise to a bonafide hit. Izumi's too meek and resigned to mind his cruel fate, but the show would honestly lose a lot of its charm if it was nothing but watching this nice kid have a bad day, every day, for a whole season. That's where Shikimori comes in. You see, Izumi may be a living punchline to the universe's running joke, but his consolation prize is that he has literally the coolest girlfriend in all of anime. That isn't me just being hyperbolic, either; that's canon. Shikimori is the kind of idealized cartoon love interest that actually works because she still feels like a real person, despite being gifted superhuman reflexes and genuinely terrifying levels of charm and charisma (not to mention some wicked bowling skills). This girl loves her boyfriend so freaking much, and since Izumi also feels like a genuine character instead of a bland self-insert, their relationship is as wholesome as it is amusing.    Seriously, who among us hasn't dreamed of having a partner who kicks ass, is hot as hell, has a sweet side that melts your heart whenever it comes out, and is yet still vulnerable and empathetic enough to make her love for you apparant in every way she possibly can? I mean, I already found that—my wife is literally the coolest woman alive, after all, and I may have to investigate Keigo Maki for ripping off her life's story—but that means that everyone else on Earth could only imagine how awesome it is to have a Shikimori for a girlfriend. Until now, that is!    The Spring of 2022 seems to be the Season of Rom-Coms, as our collective cup runneth over with the likes of Kaguya-sama, Love After World Domination, and now we have Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie to add to the roster.

Then Doga Kobo announced they'd be producing an anime, and I figured I'd finally get the rest of the story.    Doga Kobo has produced some fantastic comedy adaptations, even with ones that seem like their single joke couldn't possibly stretch to full-length episodes, such as Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun and Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle, so I had high hopes for Shikimori. And the first few minutes of the episode, wherein the titular Shikimori rescues her hapless boyfriend Izumi from getting hit by a truck and looks impossibly cool doing it, I thought I was going to be in for a good time. Since it is impossible for a critic to be wholly objective, I will reveal one of my biases: I have a huge weakness for gender-reversed tough girl/soft boy romances. Probably my favorite kind of heterosexuals. And Shikimori pinning Izumi against the wall and gently chastising him? That's some good fucking food, right there.    Alas, as the episode wore on, I realized it was more of an excellent amuse-bouche preceding a middling meal than a feast. The comic timing is piss-poor, causing things to drag the entire runtime. The episode is divided roughly into three segments, and each one gets maybe one or two jokes while the rest is paced like a slice-of-life series but without the necessary level of personality. Oh, there were still parts I liked, such as Shikimori choosing to discard her friend's advice to lose on purpose because fake incompetence is cute. I could go into full feminist rage mode about gender roles and it irritated me that Shikimori even entertained the idea, but the important thing is she decided to be her amazing self and bowl a perfect game, and Izumi loved it. Girls, get yourself a boy who doesn't want you to cut off bits of yourself to make them feel better, but instead adores everything awesome you are.    Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie gets three stars for having a good core concept and some good moments, but otherwise kind of boring. The adorable rhythm game ending gets it another star. I wonder what Mitsue Yamazaki is working on these days…       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               One thing I've always hated about romantic comedies is how 90% of them end with the couple finally getting together. Admitting you like each other is the first step of a relationship, not the last. I've always found the rare story about a couple dealing with the problems that come up over the course of a relationship to be far more heartfelt and interesting—which brings us to Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie. This episode doesn't even bother to tell us how the two got together—it's that unimportant. What matters is that they are together and are trying to make things work.    Of course, each of the pair has their issues. Shikimori wants to be seen as cute by her boyfriend—so much so that she is embarrassed by the badass athletic powerhouse side of herself. Meanwhile, Izumi hates that he is getting someone he loves caught up in his perpetual bad luck.    But what's great about the two is that they are working on their communication skills—something more than a bit difficult in a couple's first relationship. The last thing Izumi wants is for Shikimori to lessen herself to appease him. He wants her as she is—both her cute side and her badass side. So he makes sure to cheer her on and verbally support her at being the very best she can be.    On the other side of things, Shikimori is not bothered by Izumi's curse. She simply sees it as the price of entry for having such a kindhearted guy in her life. If she has to block the occasional flying newspaper or jump-kick a falling sign to protect the man she loves, so be it. And the fact that she tells him this is what makes them a couple with true lasting power. It's great to see such a healthy relationship in anime.    And while I've been gushing at the way the anime handles its romance, I'd be amiss if I didn't bring up the visuals. Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie is a master class on how changing one single visual detail can completely change a character's impression on the audience. When Shikimori does something awesome, all that changes is the shape of her eyes, turning into something resembling the eyes of a villainess—or of Goku whenever he gets serious in Dragon Ball Z, if you prefer. It's a fantastic shift that I find myself waiting for with bated breath in each scene.    All in all, if you're tired of will-they-won't-they romances and want a light-hearted story about two good people growing up into even better people thanks to their relationship with each other, don't miss out on this one.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Man, of all the shows this season to wind up a big disappointment, I didn't expect it to be this one. Granted, the premise isn't exactly comedic gold, but it was at least a novel dynamic for a romcom anime, and I was hoping that with Doga Kobo's A-team in charge this could be a fun complement to the other romances this season. Instead, I got 20 minutes of dull characters delivering jokes that are conceptually funny, but get totally smothered by lifeless pacing and timing.    There really is just...something missing here. Maybe it's the languid pacing of every scene, where characters seem to need a moment to start up before they start moving and talking. Maybe it's the strangely lifeless use of music that only ever serves to undercut jokes rather than punctuate them. Either way, despite being the world's biggest mark for even the dumbest romcom anime, I sat through this episode stonefaced. I could tell when jokes were happening, and I understood the punchline, could even imagine a version of it where it made me grin, and yet that never happened. It just wasn't funny, which destroys half of the romantic comedy moniker and left this episode a chore to get through.    More than that though, it also undercuts the romance angle of this whole endeavor. Especially poor Izumi, whose whole gimmick is he's got cosmically bad luck that results in pratfalls and comedic accidents for his dashing girlfriend to save him from. So when those jokes fall flat, it leaves him a boring blank slate who mostly exists to tell us how cute and/or cool Shikimori is. That's on top of the friend character who just states the point of any given scene out loud, proclaiming “It seems we're going to become better friends” when they all go out bowling. Shikimori herself is easily the most interesting character, both because she's the most active, and that she obviously has a secret side she's trying to hide from her boyfriend. The closest this episode comes to compelling is when she wholeheartedly reassures her hapless bae that he doesn't need to worry about being worthy of her – she likes him and wants to stay by his side, and that's all that matters. That's a nice sentiment, but it also gives half our central couple permission to not be interesting, and that hinders any chance of the romance being engaging.    That could maybe work if we got more of a look at “Cool” Shikimori, or if the jokes landed with anything besides a deafening thud. But as-is, this is easily the least entertaining romcom of the season. Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is similarly low-key, but its jokes are built for that delivery. Love After World Domination has a way stronger premise with a more active central couple. And even with a great production this show is not going to out-direct Kaguya-sama. In a weaker season I might continue with this one, but there's way too much competition to bother with a disappointing also-ran.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               This is a bit of a tricky one for me to (p)review, because I know that the story gets so much better from here. Not that this is bad, mind you – Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie is, even in this first episode, about the absolute cutest couple in all of anime, and while it does have a bit of a lather-rinse-repeat feel, once the characters become more than their stock selves as the plot develops, it simply becomes more – and this is coming from someone who felt that the first volume of the manga was intensely boring. The problem is, knowing what I know about later events, I'm not sure if I'm more kindly disposed to the anime's first episode than I otherwise would have been.    But my own probable bias aside, this is still pretty darn cute. Izumi and Shikimori are already a couple when we meet them, and very much an established one. It's nice that their initial meeting and going out were omitted from the episode, because we don't necessarily need to know how this whole thing started – what's important is that they clearly care a lot about each other. And believe me, Izumi needs someone who loves him as much as Shikimori around, because he's a danger magnet the likes of which cannot be overstated. If not for her quick actions this could have devolved into an isekai (thanks to a run-in with everyone's favorite motor vehicle on their walk to school) to say nothing of him taking a chalkboard eraser to the face and getting strangled by a stray page of a wind-borne newspaper. Essentially Izumi is the damsel in distress to Shikimori's prince charming, something that she's at times a little bit uncomfortable with.    Not that she has any intention of stopping. Izumi's continued presence in her life appears to be something she's willing to do anything to protect, as we see demonstrated over the course of the episode; it's just that she also wants him to think that she's “cute.” Fortunately she's not so foolish as to take her friend Neko's advice to fake being bad at bowling, because I think a piece of her does realize that Izumi likes her no matter whether she's “cute” or “cool.” The opening theme implies that she has a past that makes her worry more about it than she needs to, but it also makes her a bit more human – she's not a superhero, just someone with less of a danger magnet and with better motor coordination than Izumi.    Although the almost aggressively pastel colors can feel a little too precious at times, this is basically just a nice episode. Izumi and Shikimori aren't joined at the hip despite their mutual adoration and maintain friendships with other people, the story is gentle, and the ending theme, with Shikimori trying to protect Izumi is framed as an obstacle game, is a great way to sum things up. It's not exciting, but it is sweet, and it should only get more so from here.       James Beckett  Rating:               The blurb on Crunchyroll described our boy Izumi as “naturally unlucky”, but that's underselling it a bit. This poor kid is straight up cursed by the universe itself; his entire life is like if the Grim Reaper from Final Destination made it his life's purpose to dunk on a sweet-natured Japanese boy for years on end, and the boy just kind of learned to deal with how reality itself will seemingly warp and defy all logic or reason simply to embarrass him in front of every human on earth. Thankfully for us, this is the kind of comedy cliché that really never gets old. Charlie Chaplin was making bank off of the same material a hundred years ago, and now Izumi's casual suffering can provide us oodles of comic joy here in the second round of the Roaring 20s.    That's not the whole shtick of Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie, though, and it's the title character that transforms the anime from a solid premise to a bonafide hit. Izumi's too meek and resigned to mind his cruel fate, but the show would honestly lose a lot of its charm if it was nothing but watching this nice kid have a bad day, every day, for a whole season. That's where Shikimori comes in. You see, Izumi may be a living punchline to the universe's running joke, but his consolation prize is that he has literally the coolest girlfriend in all of anime. That isn't me just being hyperbolic, either; that's canon. Shikimori is the kind of idealized cartoon love interest that actually works because she still feels like a real person, despite being gifted superhuman reflexes and genuinely terrifying levels of charm and charisma (not to mention some wicked bowling skills). This girl loves her boyfriend so freaking much, and since Izumi also feels like a genuine character instead of a bland self-insert, their relationship is as wholesome as it is amusing.    Seriously, who among us hasn't dreamed of having a partner who kicks ass, is hot as hell, has a sweet side that melts your heart whenever it comes out, and is yet still vulnerable and empathetic enough to make her love for you apparant in every way she possibly can? I mean, I already found that—my wife is literally the coolest woman alive, after all, and I may have to investigate Keigo Maki for ripping off her life's story—but that means that everyone else on Earth could only imagine how awesome it is to have a Shikimori for a girlfriend. Until now, that is!    The Spring of 2022 seems to be the Season of Rom-Coms, as our collective cup runneth over with the likes of Kaguya-sama, Love After World Domination, and now we have Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie to add to the roster. Drink deep from the well of “Dawwwwwws”, my friends, and revel in the cuteness of it all.

I've always found the rare story about a couple dealing with the problems that come up over the course of a relationship to be far more heartfelt and interesting—which brings us to Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie. This episode doesn't even bother to tell us how the two got together—it's that unimportant. What matters is that they are together and are trying to make things work.    Of course, each of the pair has their issues. Shikimori wants to be seen as cute by her boyfriend—so much so that she is embarrassed by the badass athletic powerhouse side of herself. Meanwhile, Izumi hates that he is getting someone he loves caught up in his perpetual bad luck.    But what's great about the two is that they are working on their communication skills—something more than a bit difficult in a couple's first relationship. The last thing Izumi wants is for Shikimori to lessen herself to appease him. He wants her as she is—both her cute side and her badass side. So he makes sure to cheer her on and verbally support her at being the very best she can be.    On the other side of things, Shikimori is not bothered by Izumi's curse. She simply sees it as the price of entry for having such a kindhearted guy in her life. If she has to block the occasional flying newspaper or jump-kick a falling sign to protect the man she loves, so be it. And the fact that she tells him this is what makes them a couple with true lasting power. It's great to see such a healthy relationship in anime.    And while I've been gushing at the way the anime handles its romance, I'd be amiss if I didn't bring up the visuals. Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie is a master class on how changing one single visual detail can completely change a character's impression on the audience. When Shikimori does something awesome, all that changes is the shape of her eyes, turning into something resembling the eyes of a villainess—or of Goku whenever he gets serious in Dragon Ball Z, if you prefer. It's a fantastic shift that I find myself waiting for with bated breath in each scene.    All in all, if you're tired of will-they-won't-they romances and want a light-hearted story about two good people growing up into even better people thanks to their relationship with each other, don't miss out on this one.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Man, of all the shows this season to wind up a big disappointment, I didn't expect it to be this one. Granted, the premise isn't exactly comedic gold, but it was at least a novel dynamic for a romcom anime, and I was hoping that with Doga Kobo's A-team in charge this could be a fun complement to the other romances this season. Instead, I got 20 minutes of dull characters delivering jokes that are conceptually funny, but get totally smothered by lifeless pacing and timing.    There really is just...something missing here. Maybe it's the languid pacing of every scene, where characters seem to need a moment to start up before they start moving and talking. Maybe it's the strangely lifeless use of music that only ever serves to undercut jokes rather than punctuate them. Either way, despite being the world's biggest mark for even the dumbest romcom anime, I sat through this episode stonefaced. I could tell when jokes were happening, and I understood the punchline, could even imagine a version of it where it made me grin, and yet that never happened. It just wasn't funny, which destroys half of the romantic comedy moniker and left this episode a chore to get through.    More than that though, it also undercuts the romance angle of this whole endeavor. Especially poor Izumi, whose whole gimmick is he's got cosmically bad luck that results in pratfalls and comedic accidents for his dashing girlfriend to save him from. So when those jokes fall flat, it leaves him a boring blank slate who mostly exists to tell us how cute and/or cool Shikimori is. That's on top of the friend character who just states the point of any given scene out loud, proclaiming “It seems we're going to become better friends” when they all go out bowling. Shikimori herself is easily the most interesting character, both because she's the most active, and that she obviously has a secret side she's trying to hide from her boyfriend. The closest this episode comes to compelling is when she wholeheartedly reassures her hapless bae that he doesn't need to worry about being worthy of her – she likes him and wants to stay by his side, and that's all that matters. That's a nice sentiment, but it also gives half our central couple permission to not be interesting, and that hinders any chance of the romance being engaging.    That could maybe work if we got more of a look at “Cool” Shikimori, or if the jokes landed with anything besides a deafening thud. But as-is, this is easily the least entertaining romcom of the season. Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is similarly low-key, but its jokes are built for that delivery. Love After World Domination has a way stronger premise with a more active central couple. And even with a great production this show is not going to out-direct Kaguya-sama. In a weaker season I might continue with this one, but there's way too much competition to bother with a disappointing also-ran.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               This is a bit of a tricky one for me to (p)review, because I know that the story gets so much better from here. Not that this is bad, mind you – Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie is, even in this first episode, about the absolute cutest couple in all of anime, and while it does have a bit of a lather-rinse-repeat feel, once the characters become more than their stock selves as the plot develops, it simply becomes more – and this is coming from someone who felt that the first volume of the manga was intensely boring. The problem is, knowing what I know about later events, I'm not sure if I'm more kindly disposed to the anime's first episode than I otherwise would have been.    But my own probable bias aside, this is still pretty darn cute. Izumi and Shikimori are already a couple when we meet them, and very much an established one. It's nice that their initial meeting and going out were omitted from the episode, because we don't necessarily need to know how this whole thing started – what's important is that they clearly care a lot about each other. And believe me, Izumi needs someone who loves him as much as Shikimori around, because he's a danger magnet the likes of which cannot be overstated. If not for her quick actions this could have devolved into an isekai (thanks to a run-in with everyone's favorite motor vehicle on their walk to school) to say nothing of him taking a chalkboard eraser to the face and getting strangled by a stray page of a wind-borne newspaper. Essentially Izumi is the damsel in distress to Shikimori's prince charming, something that she's at times a little bit uncomfortable with.    Not that she has any intention of stopping. Izumi's continued presence in her life appears to be something she's willing to do anything to protect, as we see demonstrated over the course of the episode; it's just that she also wants him to think that she's “cute.” Fortunately she's not so foolish as to take her friend Neko's advice to fake being bad at bowling, because I think a piece of her does realize that Izumi likes her no matter whether she's “cute” or “cool.” The opening theme implies that she has a past that makes her worry more about it than she needs to, but it also makes her a bit more human – she's not a superhero, just someone with less of a danger magnet and with better motor coordination than Izumi.    Although the almost aggressively pastel colors can feel a little too precious at times, this is basically just a nice episode. Izumi and Shikimori aren't joined at the hip despite their mutual adoration and maintain friendships with other people, the story is gentle, and the ending theme, with Shikimori trying to protect Izumi is framed as an obstacle game, is a great way to sum things up. It's not exciting, but it is sweet, and it should only get more so from here.       James Beckett  Rating:               The blurb on Crunchyroll described our boy Izumi as “naturally unlucky”, but that's underselling it a bit. This poor kid is straight up cursed by the universe itself; his entire life is like if the Grim Reaper from Final Destination made it his life's purpose to dunk on a sweet-natured Japanese boy for years on end, and the boy just kind of learned to deal with how reality itself will seemingly warp and defy all logic or reason simply to embarrass him in front of every human on earth. Thankfully for us, this is the kind of comedy cliché that really never gets old. Charlie Chaplin was making bank off of the same material a hundred years ago, and now Izumi's casual suffering can provide us oodles of comic joy here in the second round of the Roaring 20s.    That's not the whole shtick of Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie, though, and it's the title character that transforms the anime from a solid premise to a bonafide hit. Izumi's too meek and resigned to mind his cruel fate, but the show would honestly lose a lot of its charm if it was nothing but watching this nice kid have a bad day, every day, for a whole season. That's where Shikimori comes in. You see, Izumi may be a living punchline to the universe's running joke, but his consolation prize is that he has literally the coolest girlfriend in all of anime. That isn't me just being hyperbolic, either; that's canon. Shikimori is the kind of idealized cartoon love interest that actually works because she still feels like a real person, despite being gifted superhuman reflexes and genuinely terrifying levels of charm and charisma (not to mention some wicked bowling skills). This girl loves her boyfriend so freaking much, and since Izumi also feels like a genuine character instead of a bland self-insert, their relationship is as wholesome as it is amusing.    Seriously, who among us hasn't dreamed of having a partner who kicks ass, is hot as hell, has a sweet side that melts your heart whenever it comes out, and is yet still vulnerable and empathetic enough to make her love for you apparant in every way she possibly can? I mean, I already found that—my wife is literally the coolest woman alive, after all, and I may have to investigate Keigo Maki for ripping off her life's story—but that means that everyone else on Earth could only imagine how awesome it is to have a Shikimori for a girlfriend. Until now, that is!    The Spring of 2022 seems to be the Season of Rom-Coms, as our collective cup runneth over with the likes of Kaguya-sama, Love After World Domination, and now we have Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie to add to the roster. Drink deep from the well of “Dawwwwwws”, my friends, and revel in the cuteness of it all. This show looks like another keeper, indeed.

Community score: 3.9              What is this?   Shikimori seems like the perfect girlfriend: cute, fun to be around, sweet when she wants to be, but she has a cool dark side that comes out under the right circumstances. And her boyfriend Izumi loves to be around when that happens.    Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie is based on Keigo Maki's romantic comedy manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                I read the first volume of Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie for an ANN manga preview guide some time ago. I enjoyed it, but it was one of those single joke premises and I didn't really like it enough to spend actual money on it, so I set it aside. Then Doga Kobo announced they'd be producing an anime, and I figured I'd finally get the rest of the story.    Doga Kobo has produced some fantastic comedy adaptations, even with ones that seem like their single joke couldn't possibly stretch to full-length episodes, such as Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun and Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle, so I had high hopes for Shikimori. And the first few minutes of the episode, wherein the titular Shikimori rescues her hapless boyfriend Izumi from getting hit by a truck and looks impossibly cool doing it, I thought I was going to be in for a good time. Since it is impossible for a critic to be wholly objective, I will reveal one of my biases: I have a huge weakness for gender-reversed tough girl/soft boy romances. Probably my favorite kind of heterosexuals. And Shikimori pinning Izumi against the wall and gently chastising him? That's some good fucking food, right there.    Alas, as the episode wore on, I realized it was more of an excellent amuse-bouche preceding a middling meal than a feast. The comic timing is piss-poor, causing things to drag the entire runtime. The episode is divided roughly into three segments, and each one gets maybe one or two jokes while the rest is paced like a slice-of-life series but without the necessary level of personality. Oh, there were still parts I liked, such as Shikimori choosing to discard her friend's advice to lose on purpose because fake incompetence is cute. I could go into full feminist rage mode about gender roles and it irritated me that Shikimori even entertained the idea, but the important thing is she decided to be her amazing self and bowl a perfect game, and Izumi loved it. Girls, get yourself a boy who doesn't want you to cut off bits of yourself to make them feel better, but instead adores everything awesome you are.    Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie gets three stars for having a good core concept and some good moments, but otherwise kind of boring. The adorable rhythm game ending gets it another star.

Requiem of the Rose King Episode 13  by Rebecca Silverman, Apr 11th 2022                   How would you rate episode 13 of Requiem of the Rose King ?                     Community score: 3.4            I may have anticipated this week's use of Richard's final speech to Henry in Henry the Sixth Part Three in the episode twelve review, but the line “I am myself alone” still informs Richard's character a great deal. Its myriad interpretations speak to the turmoil in his heart, even if he believes that, in killing Henry, he is currently without a soul. What's interesting is that although Richard says more than once that he has killed his own soul in that final encounter with his love, there's not that noticeable a difference in his actions now. He still laments his body, feels conflicted about the crown, and is quietly working behind the scenes, though to what end even he may not be fully aware of. We know what Edward wants, what Elizabeth wants, what Buckingham wants. But what does Richard want? And has he ever really known?    It's fitting that this point in the story is when Aya Kanno's version of the plays brings in Jane Shore. In Shakespearean terms, Jane isn't a named character in any of the plays, although some productions do give her name to one of the random court ladies and she is mentioned as “Mistress Shore.” (She is, however, a significant character in several other versions of the Richard III story, including a 1714 play named after her.) Historically she was in fact Edward's mistress beginning in 1476 until his death in 1483, and while she wasn't a witch, Richard did accuse her of conspiring against him when he took the throne. Ultimately Jane did pretty well for a player in the Wars of the Roses saga, outliving basically everyone else to die in her 80s. Her status as a witch in Requiem of the Rose King, at least as we see it in this episode, is yet another marker of Richard's discomfort with his feminine aspects; he compares her to Joan (also not a witch), and she makes him similarly uncomfortable as she seeks to manipulate him for her own ends. In Richard's world, women are witches like Jane and Joan, betrayers like Anne and Cecily, or schemers like Isabelle, Margaret, and Elizabeth. Why would he want to accept that part of himself when he can't like it in others?    Jane's entry into the scene is also a good way to show us how much time has passed. Prince Edward died in 1471 and King Edward is still alive, so we have to be somewhere between 1476 and 1483, a time frame borne out by the ages of the new sons present in the episode – and Buckingham's impressive growth spurt. (And guess what? The new kids are also all Edwards and Richards!) The king's slide into debauchery and George's descent into wine-fueled anger are what allow Jane to slip in and begin manipulating circumstances as she pleases, but if we're honest she doesn't have to work that hard, because both of Richard's older brothers aren't exactly leading healthy lives. Richard's exclusion – which he basically does himself – is what gives him a better view of what's going on but also what may be keeping him safer than either Edward or George, because he's not out there in plain sight most of the time. Sure people wonder why he and Anne have only one child (and we all know who that adorable kid really is), but for the most part he's just quietly lurking.    That's what makes the opening scene of this cour so striking. It features an actor as Richard, performing the scene I mentioned in the beginning. Richard is playing a part, it implies, reciting his lines as he moves through the world still feeling the pain of Henry's loss and does what he believes is his part for his father's dream.

Requiem of the Rose King Episode 13  by Rebecca Silverman, Apr 11th 2022                   How would you rate episode 13 of Requiem of the Rose King ?                     Community score: 3.4            I may have anticipated this week's use of Richard's final speech to Henry in Henry the Sixth Part Three in the episode twelve review, but the line “I am myself alone” still informs Richard's character a great deal. Its myriad interpretations speak to the turmoil in his heart, even if he believes that, in killing Henry, he is currently without a soul. What's interesting is that although Richard says more than once that he has killed his own soul in that final encounter with his love, there's not that noticeable a difference in his actions now. He still laments his body, feels conflicted about the crown, and is quietly working behind the scenes, though to what end even he may not be fully aware of. We know what Edward wants, what Elizabeth wants, what Buckingham wants. But what does Richard want? And has he ever really known?    It's fitting that this point in the story is when Aya Kanno's version of the plays brings in Jane Shore. In Shakespearean terms, Jane isn't a named character in any of the plays, although some productions do give her name to one of the random court ladies and she is mentioned as “Mistress Shore.” (She is, however, a significant character in several other versions of the Richard III story, including a 1714 play named after her.) Historically she was in fact Edward's mistress beginning in 1476 until his death in 1483, and while she wasn't a witch, Richard did accuse her of conspiring against him when he took the throne. Ultimately Jane did pretty well for a player in the Wars of the Roses saga, outliving basically everyone else to die in her 80s. Her status as a witch in Requiem of the Rose King, at least as we see it in this episode, is yet another marker of Richard's discomfort with his feminine aspects; he compares her to Joan (also not a witch), and she makes him similarly uncomfortable as she seeks to manipulate him for her own ends. In Richard's world, women are witches like Jane and Joan, betrayers like Anne and Cecily, or schemers like Isabelle, Margaret, and Elizabeth. Why would he want to accept that part of himself when he can't like it in others?    Jane's entry into the scene is also a good way to show us how much time has passed. Prince Edward died in 1471 and King Edward is still alive, so we have to be somewhere between 1476 and 1483, a time frame borne out by the ages of the new sons present in the episode – and Buckingham's impressive growth spurt. (And guess what? The new kids are also all Edwards and Richards!) The king's slide into debauchery and George's descent into wine-fueled anger are what allow Jane to slip in and begin manipulating circumstances as she pleases, but if we're honest she doesn't have to work that hard, because both of Richard's older brothers aren't exactly leading healthy lives. Richard's exclusion – which he basically does himself – is what gives him a better view of what's going on but also what may be keeping him safer than either Edward or George, because he's not out there in plain sight most of the time. Sure people wonder why he and Anne have only one child (and we all know who that adorable kid really is), but for the most part he's just quietly lurking.    That's what makes the opening scene of this cour so striking. It features an actor as Richard, performing the scene I mentioned in the beginning. Richard is playing a part, it implies, reciting his lines as he moves through the world still feeling the pain of Henry's loss and does what he believes is his part for his father's dream. Heaven may not be in the circlet of the crown, but Hell most definitely is, and Richard's been staring down into that abyss for a while now. Will he slip over the edge and embrace Shakespearean villainy? The curtain has risen on Richard III. Let's watch and find out.

Requiem of the Rose King Episode 13  by Rebecca Silverman, Apr 11th 2022                   How would you rate episode 13 of Requiem of the Rose King ?                     Community score: 3.4            I may have anticipated this week's use of Richard's final speech to Henry in Henry the Sixth Part Three in the episode twelve review, but the line “I am myself alone” still informs Richard's character a great deal. Its myriad interpretations speak to the turmoil in his heart, even if he believes that, in killing Henry, he is currently without a soul. What's interesting is that although Richard says more than once that he has killed his own soul in that final encounter with his love, there's not that noticeable a difference in his actions now. He still laments his body, feels conflicted about the crown, and is quietly working behind the scenes, though to what end even he may not be fully aware of. We know what Edward wants, what Elizabeth wants, what Buckingham wants. But what does Richard want? And has he ever really known?    It's fitting that this point in the story is when Aya Kanno's version of the plays brings in Jane Shore. In Shakespearean terms, Jane isn't a named character in any of the plays, although some productions do give her name to one of the random court ladies and she is mentioned as “Mistress Shore.” (She is, however, a significant character in several other versions of the Richard III story, including a 1714 play named after her.) Historically she was in fact Edward's mistress beginning in 1476 until his death in 1483, and while she wasn't a witch, Richard did accuse her of conspiring against him when he took the throne. Ultimately Jane did pretty well for a player in the Wars of the Roses saga, outliving basically everyone else to die in her 80s. Her status as a witch in Requiem of the Rose King, at least as we see it in this episode, is yet another marker of Richard's discomfort with his feminine aspects; he compares her to Joan (also not a witch), and she makes him similarly uncomfortable as she seeks to manipulate him for her own ends. In Richard's world, women are witches like Jane and Joan, betrayers like Anne and Cecily, or schemers like Isabelle, Margaret, and Elizabeth. Why would he want to accept that part of himself when he can't like it in others?    Jane's entry into the scene is also a good way to show us how much time has passed. Prince Edward died in 1471 and King Edward is still alive, so we have to be somewhere between 1476 and 1483, a time frame borne out by the ages of the new sons present in the episode – and Buckingham's impressive growth spurt. (And guess what? The new kids are also all Edwards and Richards!) The king's slide into debauchery and George's descent into wine-fueled anger are what allow Jane to slip in and begin manipulating circumstances as she pleases, but if we're honest she doesn't have to work that hard, because both of Richard's older brothers aren't exactly leading healthy lives. Richard's exclusion – which he basically does himself – is what gives him a better view of what's going on but also what may be keeping him safer than either Edward or George, because he's not out there in plain sight most of the time. Sure people wonder why he and Anne have only one child (and we all know who that adorable kid really is), but for the most part he's just quietly lurking.    That's what makes the opening scene of this cour so striking. It features an actor as Richard, performing the scene I mentioned in the beginning. Richard is playing a part, it implies, reciting his lines as he moves through the world still feeling the pain of Henry's loss and does what he believes is his part for his father's dream. Heaven may not be in the circlet of the crown, but Hell most definitely is, and Richard's been staring down into that abyss for a while now. Will he slip over the edge and embrace Shakespearean villainy? The curtain has risen on Richard III. Let's watch and find out.

Requiem of the Rose King Episode 13  by Rebecca Silverman, Apr 11th 2022                   How would you rate episode 13 of Requiem of the Rose King ?                     Community score: 3.4            I may have anticipated this week's use of Richard's final speech to Henry in Henry the Sixth Part Three in the episode twelve review, but the line “I am myself alone” still informs Richard's character a great deal. Its myriad interpretations speak to the turmoil in his heart, even if he believes that, in killing Henry, he is currently without a soul. What's interesting is that although Richard says more than once that he has killed his own soul in that final encounter with his love, there's not that noticeable a difference in his actions now. He still laments his body, feels conflicted about the crown, and is quietly working behind the scenes, though to what end even he may not be fully aware of. We know what Edward wants, what Elizabeth wants, what Buckingham wants. But what does Richard want? And has he ever really known?    It's fitting that this point in the story is when Aya Kanno's version of the plays brings in Jane Shore. In Shakespearean terms, Jane isn't a named character in any of the plays, although some productions do give her name to one of the random court ladies and she is mentioned as “Mistress Shore.” (She is, however, a significant character in several other versions of the Richard III story, including a 1714 play named after her.) Historically she was in fact Edward's mistress beginning in 1476 until his death in 1483, and while she wasn't a witch, Richard did accuse her of conspiring against him when he took the throne. Ultimately Jane did pretty well for a player in the Wars of the Roses saga, outliving basically everyone else to die in her 80s. Her status as a witch in Requiem of the Rose King, at least as we see it in this episode, is yet another marker of Richard's discomfort with his feminine aspects; he compares her to Joan (also not a witch), and she makes him similarly uncomfortable as she seeks to manipulate him for her own ends. In Richard's world, women are witches like Jane and Joan, betrayers like Anne and Cecily, or schemers like Isabelle, Margaret, and Elizabeth. Why would he want to accept that part of himself when he can't like it in others?    Jane's entry into the scene is also a good way to show us how much time has passed. Prince Edward died in 1471 and King Edward is still alive, so we have to be somewhere between 1476 and 1483, a time frame borne out by the ages of the new sons present in the episode – and Buckingham's impressive growth spurt. (And guess what? The new kids are also all Edwards and Richards!) The king's slide into debauchery and George's descent into wine-fueled anger are what allow Jane to slip in and begin manipulating circumstances as she pleases, but if we're honest she doesn't have to work that hard, because both of Richard's older brothers aren't exactly leading healthy lives. Richard's exclusion – which he basically does himself – is what gives him a better view of what's going on but also what may be keeping him safer than either Edward or George, because he's not out there in plain sight most of the time. Sure people wonder why he and Anne have only one child (and we all know who that adorable kid really is), but for the most part he's just quietly lurking.    That's what makes the opening scene of this cour so striking. It features an actor as Richard, performing the scene I mentioned in the beginning. Richard is playing a part, it implies, reciting his lines as he moves through the world still feeling the pain of Henry's loss and does what he believes is his part for his father's dream. Heaven may not be in the circlet of the crown, but Hell most definitely is, and Richard's been staring down into that abyss for a while now. Will he slip over the edge and embrace Shakespearean villainy? The curtain has risen on Richard III. Let's watch and find out.

How Composer MAYUKO Created Ranking of Kings' Fantasy-Infused Score   by Lynzee Loveridge, Apr 11th 2022          Writer, composer, arranger and singer, MAYUKO has been performing as a singer-songwriter since she was a student. As a composer, she created music for the drama The Full-Time Wife Escapist, the anime Cells at Work! and her latest soundtrack, available now from Milan Records, is all about capturing the magic of a fantasy world. We sat down with MAYUKO to discuss how she translated the characters and environment of Wit Studio's Ranking of Kings anime series to music.    What sorts of preparation did you do to get a sense of the 'sound' of Ranking of Kings?   I was playing Beethoven, Chopin, Mendelssohn, etc. to bring classical music into my life. It reminded me of my days as a music student.    Are there any key instruments you utilized for consistency throughout the series' score, or is it eclectic?   Since my goal was to build out a full orchestra rather than a specific instrument, I always kept an instrumental instruction book close by and would think about the best instrument that could produce the most appropriate sound in each arrangement. For example, I could really feel the potential of the horn in battle pieces – strong, fat and explosive sound, like in the song “Senritsu.”     What emotions were you hoping to inspire in the series' main theme?   I was told the main theme would be used mostly in teasers and trailers rather than the show itself, so I created it with a more comprehensive, birds-eye vision. The story is about to begin! The chorus of the song expresses the grandeur of the kingdom and the sopranino recorder expresses the Bojji's adventure.     Were there any specifications asked by the series' director or sound director or were you given free rein to experiment?   At my first meeting, I had a spreadsheet of music with over 70 songs and each song was explained in details. Some instruments were specified, but many were left to me. For instance, I decided to use the trombone for “Theme of Kage.”    What was the thought behind the use of a sopranino recorder for Bojji's theme?   I was asked to use a specific instrument for Bojji's theme, and there was a memo asking if that instrument should be a flute. I tried various things, but ultimately decided on a sopranino recorder, which can be both relaxing and cute as well as moderately powerful and strong. It's a great instrument with a wide range of tones.    Are there pieces of music that you feel closely embody specific characters? For example, Bosse, Despa, or Kage?   Bosse is a giant, so boom! I was conscious of using heavy percussion and a low pitch. It was actually easy to create because I only had to keep that in mind. From the beginning, I was given the instruction that Despa's sound should be “cheerful jazz,” and I was very excited to create it. I think it is one of the most unique songs on the soundtrack. Kage, meanwhile, is a survivor of an attack by a group of assassins, but he's not a bad guy, so the instrumentation had to express that middle ground. I thought, “well, maybe the trombone?” Ouken is clad in armor, so I thought the sound of metal = cathedral bells. And then Miranjo expresses some weirdness with the female chorus, triple-time and shimmering bells. Each character was expressed using various rules.     What's your process when you get 'stuck'?   Once you leave the work, you leave the work. When I take a short break and return a few hours later, I start again, and my calm self comes back to me, saying, “What was I so worried about?” When that calm self does not come back… I cry.    Is there a character you came to fond of by the show's end?   Hiling. I don't have such a cute tsundere mother. She can also use her healing ability and I think she is the strongest. I want her to be happy. I want her to listen to my problems when I'm in trouble. I also want to be friends with Despa.    Is there a particular memory of working on the series that will stick with you?   When I wrote the song, “Bojji to Kage no Yujyo,” I was very fond of it and actually wrote and sang lyrics to add to it. It's a song that says, “I will always be by your side.” The reason it was used in the final episode was because of my passion for the song. I couldn't be happier and am so glad I am singer-songwriter.    The full soundtrack for Ranking of Kings is available from Milan Records on Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube Music and more.     discuss this in the forum (1 post) |        bookmark/share with:               Interview homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            column          4 comments       This Week in Games - Let's Talk About Kingdom Hearts   Apr 16, 07:53 4 comments                 games    Heidi speculates on wtf is going on in the new Kingdom Hearts game and holy crap Witch on the Holy Night is getting a Western release?! ― Hi folks.

How Composer MAYUKO Created Ranking of Kings' Fantasy-Infused Score   by Lynzee Loveridge, Apr 11th 2022          Writer, composer, arranger and singer, MAYUKO has been performing as a singer-songwriter since she was a student. As a composer, she created music for the drama The Full-Time Wife Escapist, the anime Cells at Work! and her latest soundtrack, available now from Milan Records, is all about capturing the magic of a fantasy world. We sat down with MAYUKO to discuss how she translated the characters and environment of Wit Studio's Ranking of Kings anime series to music.    What sorts of preparation did you do to get a sense of the 'sound' of Ranking of Kings?   I was playing Beethoven, Chopin, Mendelssohn, etc. to bring classical music into my life. It reminded me of my days as a music student.    Are there any key instruments you utilized for consistency throughout the series' score, or is it eclectic?   Since my goal was to build out a full orchestra rather than a specific instrument, I always kept an instrumental instruction book close by and would think about the best instrument that could produce the most appropriate sound in each arrangement. For example, I could really feel the potential of the horn in battle pieces – strong, fat and explosive sound, like in the song “Senritsu.”     What emotions were you hoping to inspire in the series' main theme?   I was told the main theme would be used mostly in teasers and trailers rather than the show itself, so I created it with a more comprehensive, birds-eye vision. The story is about to begin! The chorus of the song expresses the grandeur of the kingdom and the sopranino recorder expresses the Bojji's adventure.     Were there any specifications asked by the series' director or sound director or were you given free rein to experiment?   At my first meeting, I had a spreadsheet of music with over 70 songs and each song was explained in details. Some instruments were specified, but many were left to me. For instance, I decided to use the trombone for “Theme of Kage.”    What was the thought behind the use of a sopranino recorder for Bojji's theme?   I was asked to use a specific instrument for Bojji's theme, and there was a memo asking if that instrument should be a flute. I tried various things, but ultimately decided on a sopranino recorder, which can be both relaxing and cute as well as moderately powerful and strong. It's a great instrument with a wide range of tones.    Are there pieces of music that you feel closely embody specific characters? For example, Bosse, Despa, or Kage?   Bosse is a giant, so boom! I was conscious of using heavy percussion and a low pitch. It was actually easy to create because I only had to keep that in mind. From the beginning, I was given the instruction that Despa's sound should be “cheerful jazz,” and I was very excited to create it. I think it is one of the most unique songs on the soundtrack. Kage, meanwhile, is a survivor of an attack by a group of assassins, but he's not a bad guy, so the instrumentation had to express that middle ground. I thought, “well, maybe the trombone?” Ouken is clad in armor, so I thought the sound of metal = cathedral bells. And then Miranjo expresses some weirdness with the female chorus, triple-time and shimmering bells. Each character was expressed using various rules.     What's your process when you get 'stuck'?   Once you leave the work, you leave the work. When I take a short break and return a few hours later, I start again, and my calm self comes back to me, saying, “What was I so worried about?” When that calm self does not come back… I cry.    Is there a character you came to fond of by the show's end?   Hiling. I don't have such a cute tsundere mother. She can also use her healing ability and I think she is the strongest. I want her to be happy. I want her to listen to my problems when I'm in trouble. I also want to be friends with Despa.    Is there a particular memory of working on the series that will stick with you?   When I wrote the song, “Bojji to Kage no Yujyo,” I was very fond of it and actually wrote and sang lyrics to add to it. It's a song that says, “I will always be by your side.” The reason it was used in the final episode was because of my passion for the song. I couldn't be happier and am so glad I am singer-songwriter.    The full soundtrack for Ranking of Kings is available from Milan Records on Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube Music and more.     discuss this in the forum (1 post) |        bookmark/share with:               Interview homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            column          4 comments       This Week in Games - Let's Talk About Kingdom Hearts   Apr 16, 07:53 4 comments                 games    Heidi speculates on wtf is going on in the new Kingdom Hearts game and holy crap Witch on the Holy Night is getting a Western release?! ― Hi folks.

How Composer MAYUKO Created Ranking of Kings' Fantasy-Infused Score   by Lynzee Loveridge, Apr 11th 2022          Writer, composer, arranger and singer, MAYUKO has been performing as a singer-songwriter since she was a student. As a composer, she created music for the drama The Full-Time Wife Escapist, the anime Cells at Work! and her latest soundtrack, available now from Milan Records, is all about capturing the magic of a fantasy world. We sat down with MAYUKO to discuss how she translated the characters and environment of Wit Studio's Ranking of Kings anime series to music.    What sorts of preparation did you do to get a sense of the 'sound' of Ranking of Kings?   I was playing Beethoven, Chopin, Mendelssohn, etc. to bring classical music into my life. It reminded me of my days as a music student.    Are there any key instruments you utilized for consistency throughout the series' score, or is it eclectic?   Since my goal was to build out a full orchestra rather than a specific instrument, I always kept an instrumental instruction book close by and would think about the best instrument that could produce the most appropriate sound in each arrangement. For example, I could really feel the potential of the horn in battle pieces – strong, fat and explosive sound, like in the song “Senritsu.”     What emotions were you hoping to inspire in the series' main theme?   I was told the main theme would be used mostly in teasers and trailers rather than the show itself, so I created it with a more comprehensive, birds-eye vision. The story is about to begin! The chorus of the song expresses the grandeur of the kingdom and the sopranino recorder expresses the Bojji's adventure.     Were there any specifications asked by the series' director or sound director or were you given free rein to experiment?   At my first meeting, I had a spreadsheet of music with over 70 songs and each song was explained in details. Some instruments were specified, but many were left to me. For instance, I decided to use the trombone for “Theme of Kage.”    What was the thought behind the use of a sopranino recorder for Bojji's theme?   I was asked to use a specific instrument for Bojji's theme, and there was a memo asking if that instrument should be a flute. I tried various things, but ultimately decided on a sopranino recorder, which can be both relaxing and cute as well as moderately powerful and strong. It's a great instrument with a wide range of tones.    Are there pieces of music that you feel closely embody specific characters? For example, Bosse, Despa, or Kage?   Bosse is a giant, so boom! I was conscious of using heavy percussion and a low pitch. It was actually easy to create because I only had to keep that in mind. From the beginning, I was given the instruction that Despa's sound should be “cheerful jazz,” and I was very excited to create it. I think it is one of the most unique songs on the soundtrack. Kage, meanwhile, is a survivor of an attack by a group of assassins, but he's not a bad guy, so the instrumentation had to express that middle ground. I thought, “well, maybe the trombone?” Ouken is clad in armor, so I thought the sound of metal = cathedral bells. And then Miranjo expresses some weirdness with the female chorus, triple-time and shimmering bells. Each character was expressed using various rules.     What's your process when you get 'stuck'?   Once you leave the work, you leave the work. When I take a short break and return a few hours later, I start again, and my calm self comes back to me, saying, “What was I so worried about?” When that calm self does not come back… I cry.    Is there a character you came to fond of by the show's end?   Hiling. I don't have such a cute tsundere mother. She can also use her healing ability and I think she is the strongest. I want her to be happy. I want her to listen to my problems when I'm in trouble. I also want to be friends with Despa.    Is there a particular memory of working on the series that will stick with you?   When I wrote the song, “Bojji to Kage no Yujyo,” I was very fond of it and actually wrote and sang lyrics to add to it. It's a song that says, “I will always be by your side.” The reason it was used in the final episode was because of my passion for the song. I couldn't be happier and am so glad I am singer-songwriter.    The full soundtrack for Ranking of Kings is available from Milan Records on Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube Music and more.     discuss this in the forum (1 post) |        bookmark/share with:               Interview homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            column          4 comments       This Week in Games - Let's Talk About Kingdom Hearts   Apr 16, 07:53 4 comments                 games    Heidi speculates on wtf is going on in the new Kingdom Hearts game and holy crap Witch on the Holy Night is getting a Western release?! ― Hi folks.

How Composer MAYUKO Created Ranking of Kings' Fantasy-Infused Score   by Lynzee Loveridge, Apr 11th 2022          Writer, composer, arranger and singer, MAYUKO has been performing as a singer-songwriter since she was a student. As a composer, she created music for the drama The Full-Time Wife Escapist, the anime Cells at Work! and her latest soundtrack, available now from Milan Records, is all about capturing the magic of a fantasy world. We sat down with MAYUKO to discuss how she translated the characters and environment of Wit Studio's Ranking of Kings anime series to music.    What sorts of preparation did you do to get a sense of the 'sound' of Ranking of Kings?   I was playing Beethoven, Chopin, Mendelssohn, etc. to bring classical music into my life. It reminded me of my days as a music student.    Are there any key instruments you utilized for consistency throughout the series' score, or is it eclectic?   Since my goal was to build out a full orchestra rather than a specific instrument, I always kept an instrumental instruction book close by and would think about the best instrument that could produce the most appropriate sound in each arrangement. For example, I could really feel the potential of the horn in battle pieces – strong, fat and explosive sound, like in the song “Senritsu.”     What emotions were you hoping to inspire in the series' main theme?   I was told the main theme would be used mostly in teasers and trailers rather than the show itself, so I created it with a more comprehensive, birds-eye vision. The story is about to begin! The chorus of the song expresses the grandeur of the kingdom and the sopranino recorder expresses the Bojji's adventure.     Were there any specifications asked by the series' director or sound director or were you given free rein to experiment?   At my first meeting, I had a spreadsheet of music with over 70 songs and each song was explained in details. Some instruments were specified, but many were left to me. For instance, I decided to use the trombone for “Theme of Kage.”    What was the thought behind the use of a sopranino recorder for Bojji's theme?   I was asked to use a specific instrument for Bojji's theme, and there was a memo asking if that instrument should be a flute. I tried various things, but ultimately decided on a sopranino recorder, which can be both relaxing and cute as well as moderately powerful and strong. It's a great instrument with a wide range of tones.    Are there pieces of music that you feel closely embody specific characters? For example, Bosse, Despa, or Kage?   Bosse is a giant, so boom! I was conscious of using heavy percussion and a low pitch. It was actually easy to create because I only had to keep that in mind. From the beginning, I was given the instruction that Despa's sound should be “cheerful jazz,” and I was very excited to create it. I think it is one of the most unique songs on the soundtrack. Kage, meanwhile, is a survivor of an attack by a group of assassins, but he's not a bad guy, so the instrumentation had to express that middle ground. I thought, “well, maybe the trombone?” Ouken is clad in armor, so I thought the sound of metal = cathedral bells. And then Miranjo expresses some weirdness with the female chorus, triple-time and shimmering bells. Each character was expressed using various rules.     What's your process when you get 'stuck'?   Once you leave the work, you leave the work. When I take a short break and return a few hours later, I start again, and my calm self comes back to me, saying, “What was I so worried about?” When that calm self does not come back… I cry.    Is there a character you came to fond of by the show's end?   Hiling. I don't have such a cute tsundere mother. She can also use her healing ability and I think she is the strongest. I want her to be happy. I want her to listen to my problems when I'm in trouble. I also want to be friends with Despa.    Is there a particular memory of working on the series that will stick with you?   When I wrote the song, “Bojji to Kage no Yujyo,” I was very fond of it and actually wrote and sang lyrics to add to it. It's a song that says, “I will always be by your side.” The reason it was used in the final episode was because of my passion for the song. I couldn't be happier and am so glad I am singer-songwriter.    The full soundtrack for Ranking of Kings is available from Milan Records on Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube Music and more.     discuss this in the forum (1 post) |        bookmark/share with:               Interview homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            column          4 comments       This Week in Games - Let's Talk About Kingdom Hearts   Apr 16, 07:53 4 comments                 games    Heidi speculates on wtf is going on in the new Kingdom Hearts game and holy crap Witch on the Holy Night is getting a Western release?! ― Hi folks.

The chorus of the song expresses the grandeur of the kingdom and the sopranino recorder expresses the Bojji's adventure.     Were there any specifications asked by the series' director or sound director or were you given free rein to experiment?   At my first meeting, I had a spreadsheet of music with over 70 songs and each song was explained in details. Some instruments were specified, but many were left to me. For instance, I decided to use the trombone for “Theme of Kage.”    What was the thought behind the use of a sopranino recorder for Bojji's theme?   I was asked to use a specific instrument for Bojji's theme, and there was a memo asking if that instrument should be a flute. I tried various things, but ultimately decided on a sopranino recorder, which can be both relaxing and cute as well as moderately powerful and strong. It's a great instrument with a wide range of tones.    Are there pieces of music that you feel closely embody specific characters? For example, Bosse, Despa, or Kage?   Bosse is a giant, so boom! I was conscious of using heavy percussion and a low pitch. It was actually easy to create because I only had to keep that in mind. From the beginning, I was given the instruction that Despa's sound should be “cheerful jazz,” and I was very excited to create it. I think it is one of the most unique songs on the soundtrack. Kage, meanwhile, is a survivor of an attack by a group of assassins, but he's not a bad guy, so the instrumentation had to express that middle ground. I thought, “well, maybe the trombone?” Ouken is clad in armor, so I thought the sound of metal = cathedral bells. And then Miranjo expresses some weirdness with the female chorus, triple-time and shimmering bells. Each character was expressed using various rules.     What's your process when you get 'stuck'?   Once you leave the work, you leave the work. When I take a short break and return a few hours later, I start again, and my calm self comes back to me, saying, “What was I so worried about?” When that calm self does not come back… I cry.    Is there a character you came to fond of by the show's end?   Hiling. I don't have such a cute tsundere mother. She can also use her healing ability and I think she is the strongest. I want her to be happy. I want her to listen to my problems when I'm in trouble. I also want to be friends with Despa.    Is there a particular memory of working on the series that will stick with you?   When I wrote the song, “Bojji to Kage no Yujyo,” I was very fond of it and actually wrote and sang lyrics to add to it. It's a song that says, “I will always be by your side.” The reason it was used in the final episode was because of my passion for the song. I couldn't be happier and am so glad I am singer-songwriter.

As a composer, she created music for the drama The Full-Time Wife Escapist, the anime Cells at Work! and her latest soundtrack, available now from Milan Records, is all about capturing the magic of a fantasy world. We sat down with MAYUKO to discuss how she translated the characters and environment of Wit Studio's Ranking of Kings anime series to music.    What sorts of preparation did you do to get a sense of the 'sound' of Ranking of Kings?   I was playing Beethoven, Chopin, Mendelssohn, etc. to bring classical music into my life. It reminded me of my days as a music student.    Are there any key instruments you utilized for consistency throughout the series' score, or is it eclectic?   Since my goal was to build out a full orchestra rather than a specific instrument, I always kept an instrumental instruction book close by and would think about the best instrument that could produce the most appropriate sound in each arrangement. For example, I could really feel the potential of the horn in battle pieces – strong, fat and explosive sound, like in the song “Senritsu.”     What emotions were you hoping to inspire in the series' main theme?

Pile of Shame FINAL: Chie the Brat The Pile of Shame recedes into the mists of history with one final installment, on Isao Takahata's criminally underseen Chie the Brat.  « »     Pile of Shame        — Archives —                  Filters          All Southeast Asia  •  Anime Manga Novels Games Music Merch Events Industry People Live-Action COVID-19           Text-only Compact View             Text-only List View             Text-only Grid View             List View with Images             Grid View with Images                               column          39 comments       Pile of Shame - Colorful   2014 Nov 12, 01:00 39 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look at an understated art house drama anime from a few years ago, and finds a lot to admire. ―  COLORFUL To paraphrase Hideaki Anno, people don't commit suicide because they're depressed, people commit suicide because they can no longer imagine happiness. That thought occurred to me again and again while I was watching Colorful, the remarkable feature film produced by Sunrise in 2010,...                    column          16 comments       Pile of Shame - SOS!

Tokyo Metro Explorers: The Next Anime fans who were around back in 2007 might remember a company briefly appearing on the scene known as Bandai Visual USA. If they do remember, it's usually not a fond memory: BVUSA was the first attempt by a major Japanese anime producer to insert themselves into th...                           column          17 comments       Pile of Shame - Dead Heat & 3D Anime   2014 Oct 15, 00:00 17 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look at the first (and one of the only) 3D anime ever made, for an obscure videodisc system only sold in Japan. ―  Dead Heat Sometimes the reasons behind an anime getting made are more interesting than the show itself. That's definitely the case with Dead Heat, an obscure 1987 OAV from Sunrise that runs only a half hour. Back in the wild days of the nascent 80s home video market, there...                    column          49 comments       Pile of Shame - Special Duty Combat Unit Shinesman   2014 Oct  1, 00:06 49 comments                 anime    Justin revisits what was once considered the finest sentai parody in the land. Does it still hold up? ―  Special Duty Combat Unit Shinesman It's always a terrifying thing, going back to old shows you loved when you were younger and revisiting them. Many of them, comedies in particular, tend to age very poorly. They connect with us at the time, but humor is just so particular and fickle -- what made y...                    column          31 comments       Pile of Shame - Bite Me! Chameleon   2014 Sep 17, 00:00 31 comments                 anime    This little-seen delinquent comedy, an early ADV release, made Justin want to hurt himself. ―  Bite Me! Chameleon There are at least four genres of anime that, no matter what anybody does, always seem to completely fall on their face when released in the West: sports, realistic military, yakuza and yankee (juvenile delinquent) shows. These were discovered through a lot of trial and error in the early...                    column          18 comments       Pile of Shame - The Tibetan Dog   2014 Sep  3, 00:21 18 comments                 anime    An underappreciated Madhouse feature from 2011 featuring a boy and his dog in the harsh terrain of Tibet. ―  The Tibetan Dog Japanese/Chinese co-productions don't happen very often. The last one I can think of would be 1997's anime adaptation of Tsui Hark's Chinese Ghost Story, which was charming in appearance but kind of a plodding, pointless affair. In 2007 another one started production, after ani...                    column          10 comments       Pile of Shame - The Enemy's The Pirates!   2014 Aug 20, 00:00 10 comments                 anime    Justin tries to return to an old 90s favorite that has become more famous for its obscure, awful dub. ―  The Enemy's The Pirates! ~The Cat's Banquet~ There's a Japanese tradition of stand-up comedy duos known as ""manzai (漫才)."" Manzai routines are high-speed, rapid-fire conversations between one person, who's an idiot or a weirdo of some kind (boke), and a straight man (tsukkomi), who's constantly mut...                    column          32 comments       Pile of Shame - MARCO: 3,000 Leagues in Search of Mother   2014 Aug  6, 02:40 32 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look at a remake of Takahata's World Masterpiece Theater classic. Does it hold up? Ehh... ―  MARCO: 3,000 Leagues in Search of Mother We need to declare a new genre of anime, right here and now. There needs to be a separate category for the metric ton of overwrought family fare Japan makes, that aims to be Studio Ghibli in quality, but ends up succumbing to its maudlin sentimentality a...                    column          6 comments       Pile of Shame - Eiji   2014 Jul 22, 22:59 6 comments                 anime    Hisashi Eguchi's boxing manga got a short movie treatment back in 1990, but does it hold up? ―  Eiji Hisashi Eguchi is probably a guy that's better known among Japanese creatives than among American otaku. As an illustrator and manga artist, he's designed characters for such anime as Roujin Z and Spriggan, heavily influenced the look of Satoshi Kon's characters (Perfect Blue's final look was based on...                    column          33 comments       Pile of Shame - Mermaid's Scar   2014 Jul  9, 01:15 33 comments                 anime    Rumiko Takahashi's macabre OAV still holds up, and is still creepy, but the dub is really weird sounding. ―  Mermaid's Scar Mermaid's Scar is one of those early stocked-at-every-Blockbuster-Video-in-the-country hits of the VHS era that almost every fan that came of age in the mid-90s saw at one time or another. Colorful, violent, and hypnotic in its own way, it made a big impression on 13-year-old Ju...                    column          10 comments       Pile of Shame - ESPer Mami: Hoshizora no Dancing Doll   2014 Jun 25, 00:00 10 comments                 anime    Justin discovers a once-loved series by the creator of Doraemon, and finds it to be pretty dull. ―  ESPer Mami: Hoshizora no Dancing Doll Even though it's never been particularly popular among anime fans in the West, most people at least have heard of Doraemon, Fujiko F. Fujio's famous magical large blue cat character who's the star of over 2500 episodes of TV anime and 35 movies (not including short...                    column          18 comments       Pile of Shame - Guyver: Out of Control   2014 Jun 11, 03:43 18 comments                 anime    A mildly entertaining, but super-dated OAV incarnation of everyone's favorite superhero/grotesque monster/schoolboy. ―  Guyver: Out of Control Guyver: Out of Control was one of the earliest anime VHS releases in the US, and being an alternate retelling of the same story that the same company, US Renditions, would later release in dubbed form, was one of the first titles to confuse the hell out of peo...                    column          45 comments       Pile of Shame - Full Moon O Sagashite   2014 May 28, 00:00 45 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look back at the oddball Magical-Idol-Singer-With-Cancer Show from the early '00s. Because every little girl loves stories about dying tragically. ―  Full Moon o Sagashite I often joke that I love shows about children suffering. I usually mean that as a joke: anime usually involves young protagonists, but too often their concerns are superficial: being the best at a game, or a sport, o...                    column          34 comments       Pile of Shame - 3x3 Eyes   2014 May 14, 02:26 34 comments                 anime    Once a mainstay of anime club video rooms, 3x3 Eyes isn't brought up very often today. Does it stand up? Justin finds out. ―  3x3 EYES Yuzo Takada was never really a big name among American otaku, but back in the 90s his stuff ranked as some of the most popular anime of its day, including Blue Seed, Cat Girl Nuku Nuku, and this -- 3x3 EYES, a dark and gory adventure OAV that once adorned a good numbe...                    column          20 comments       Pile of Shame - Legend of the Dragon Kings   2014 Apr 30, 00:00 20 comments                 anime    A highly mediocre adaptation of a best-selling book series that was illustrated by Yoshitaka Amano and CLAMP. The anime looks nothing like that, of course. ―  Legend of the Dragon Kings(A.K.A. Sohryuden, Legend of the Four Kings) When a much-loved book or manga series gets a TV anime adaptation, fans of the original work hold their breath. Some adaptations improve on the original work. Others take it...                    column          8 comments       Pile of Shame - Nitaboh   2014 Apr 16, 00:00 8 comments                 anime    One of the few anime biographies, Nitaboh is surprisingly formulaic for being a true story. ―  Nitaboh, The Shamisen Master Last year, an old friend of mine asked me to help a non-profit group of radio producers come up with a Kickstarter video for a public radio project called ""Heavenly Sight,"" a multi-part audio documentary and web resource on blind African American blues and jazz musicians. It was...                    column          18 comments       Pile of Shame - Dark Warrior (Makyu Senjo)   2014 Apr  2, 00:00 18 comments                 anime    A non-hentai show from hentai producers that somehow nobody remembers, despite getting two dubs. There's a reason. ―  Dark Warrior (Makyu Senjo) It's pretty rare that an anime gets released in both the US and the UK, and with English dubs no less, and yet hardly anyone even remembers the show exists. Dark Warrior (AKA Makyu Senjo) is one of those, seemingly having made zero impact on fans upon its re...                    column          20 comments       Pile of Shame - Goddamn!!   2014 Mar 19, 06:39 20 comments                 anime    A rally car racing OAV that, aside from the provocative name, doesn't make much of an impact. ―  Goddamn!! Kaoru Shintani has never had much of an American fanbase. His most famous work, the fighter pilot drama series Area 88, landed in the US with a resounding thud in both of its anime adaptations as well as Viz's repeated attempts to publish the manga in English. I lay blame for that mostly in his ...                    column          23 comments       Pile of Shame - Adventures of Hols, Prince of the Sun   2014 Mar  5, 02:24 23 comments                 anime    Isao Takahata's troubled first feature is easily the best anime of the 1960s. ―  Adventures of Hols, Prince of the Sun It's the iron age, somewhere in Scandinavia, and a young boy warrior named Hols is just coming back home from a fierce battle with a pack of wolves. His father, on his deathbed, bids him to return to the Northern village they fled years ago, when an evil sorcerer named Grunwald devas...                    column          8 comments       Pile of Shame - Ai City   2014 Feb 19, 01:00 8 comments                 anime    A sleeper sci-fi film from Koichi Mashimo that might break your brain, but will definitely dazzle your eyes while doing so. ―  Ai City In the opening scenes of Ai City, we are dropped into the middle of a car chase in what is possibly New York City. In the back seat is a former cop, who was fired and is now a private investigator. He doesn't know why he's there, and neither do we. In the front seat a...                    column          14 comments       Pile of Shame - Natsuki Crisis   2014 Feb  5, 01:00 14 comments                 anime    A fun two-part girls-fighting-in-high-school OAV that doesn't take itself too seriously... until it does. ―  Natsuki Crisis When we first meet Kitsumi Natsuki, she's in her school dojo, gleefully trying to find a sparring partner. The rest of the team is all guys, but they don't stand a chance against the tomboy, and politely bow out. In addition to being fearfullly strong, Natsuki is also the protog...                    column          13 comments       Pile of Shame - Seven Cities Story   2014 Jan 22, 01:00 13 comments                 anime    A two-part OAV that tries to transplant Legend of Galactic Heroes onto a sideways-rotated Earth, and succeeds only in being dull and confusing. ―  Seven Cities Story One day, with no warning, the Earth's polar axis shifts 90 degrees, shaking up human civilization like an Etch-A-Sketch and killing everybody. Luckily by this time, humanity had a pretty decent settlement going on the moon, and once thin...                    column          23 comments       Pile of Shame - After School Tinker Bell   2014 Jan  8, 01:00 23 comments                 anime    This week, an OAV based on a light novel series about a romantic couple that solves mysteries around their school. ―  After School Tinker Bell In the last few years there have been a ton of anime adapted from light novels: those small, pulpy, simply written and easy-to-read populist books that lie somewhere between young adult novels and manga. But light novels have been around for a very long time, ...                    column          12 comments       Pile of Shame - Handsome Girl   2013 Dec 25, 01:00 12 comments                 anime    Justin revisits an old one-shot OAV by the creator of Marmalade Boy... and is a little underwhelmed. ―  Handsome Girl When I was in high school, I loved the show Marmalade Boy. A lot. In fact, I wrote an article about it! A perfectly addictive confectionary of chaste teenaged yearning and romance, and undiluted raw crippling angst, I lost many an evening to the adventures of the lovelorn protagonists...                    column          11 comments       Pile of Shame - The Sensualist   2013 Dec 11, 02:10 11 comments                 anime    This week, a unique erotic historical fiction film that has completely slipped through the cracks. ―  The Sensualist (A.K.A. The Life of an Amorous Man) I first saw The Sensualist as a fuzzy VHS tape when I was a teenager. While it's ostensibly an adult work, it never seemed lurid or arousing to me. Rather, it held this strange transcendent beauty. It felt like a piece of another person's life, so fo...                    column          16 comments       Pile of Shame - Emblem Take 2   2013 Nov 27, 02:02 16 comments                 anime    This week, a rare yakuza time travel comedy. Perhaps the ONLY yakuza time travel comedy. ―  Emblem Take 2 Yakuza aren't a pleasant topic. Japan's fully-entrenched organized crime families and organizations, and their connections with everything from banking to entertainment to politics show us Japan at its most corrupt and embarrassing. Unless you go looking for trouble in Tokyo, it's unlikely that a...                    column          17 comments       Pile of Shame: Ai Monogatari: 9 Love Stories   2013 Nov 13, 01:13 17 comments                 anime    Trying to watch this OAV like biting into a large wad of wet cotton: it's not offensive or unpleasant, but you want to end the experience as fast as humanly possible. ―  Ai Monogatari: 9 Love Stories If there's anything that anime lacks, it's real, adult love stories. We have enough yearning, angsty teen romance to sink a battleship, but realistic love stories about people whose frontal lobes are fir...                    column          23 comments       Pile of Shame - Wanna-Be's   2013 Oct 30, 00:01 23 comments     Did anyone say ""I want more women's wrestling anime?"" .... No? Didn't think so. ―  Wanna-Be's Lately there's been a lot of chatter about the girls' wrestling TV series, Wanna Be The Strongest In The World. Given that virtually none of the chatter is positive, I'm not really making plans to check out the show for myself. But hearing about a mediocre girls' wresting anime did jog my memory about anothe...                    column          5 comments       Pile of Shame - Grandeek: The Alternative   2013 Sep 18, 00:56 5 comments                 anime    An early digipaint OAV that has a lot of potential, but is so awkwardly made that the storytelling really suffers. ―  Grandeek: The Alternative When visiting Japan, one of my favorite things to do is explore the DVD sections of every Book Off location I can find. Usually I can identify and easily dismiss pretty much everything on the shelf, but every once in a while I happen upon something that I hav...                    column          17 comments       Pile of Shame - Butt Attack Punisher Girl Gautaman   2013 Sep  4, 00:00 17 comments                 anime                manga    It could've been offensive, bawdy, witty and hilarious. Instead, it's just sort of lazy and crappy. ―  Butt Attack Punisher Girl Gautaman One thing you can say about Butt Attack Girl Punisher Gautaman (and its sequel OAV, Butt Attack Punisher Girl Gautaman R), you know pretty much exactly what you're getting: a cut-rate early-90s dirty comedy OAV about a girl that beats dudes down with her butt. It o...                    column          43 comments       Pile of Shame - Yagami-kun's Family Affairs   2013 Aug 21, 00:08 43 comments                 anime    This week, a slapstick comedy OAV from 1990 that's all about incest. ―  Yagami-kun's Family Affairs Remember when incest was shocking? I mean that honestly. There was a time not long ago, even in otaku circles, when the idea of incest was odd and outré enough to elicit giggles from the less mature parts of ourselves, and maybe even an ""oh god."" You can tell what we used to be like by going up to your...                    column          28 comments       Pile of Shame - Moshidora   2013 Aug  7, 02:32 28 comments                 anime    Only Japan would attempt to take a business management textbook and turn it into a high school sports story. ―  Moshidora When I first heard the premise behind Moshidora, which is short for a ridiculously long title that translates to, ""What If the Girl Manager of a High School Baseball Team Read Drucker's 'Management?'"" I believe I laughed and said, ""Oh, Japan."" Because really, what other response i...                    column          22 comments       Pile of Shame - Kenya Boy   2013 Jul 24, 01:00 22 comments                 anime    Adjectives fail Justin has he tries to describe the absolute insanity contained in a 1984 feature film retelling of a popular 1950s manga series. ― One of the benefits to writing a column on obscure anime for so long is that occasionally friends hand you things that they think would inspire a good column.

Pile of Shame FINAL: Chie the Brat The Pile of Shame recedes into the mists of history with one final installment, on Isao Takahata's criminally underseen Chie the Brat.  « »     Pile of Shame        — Archives —                  Filters          All Southeast Asia  •  Anime Manga Novels Games Music Merch Events Industry People Live-Action COVID-19           Text-only Compact View             Text-only List View             Text-only Grid View             List View with Images             Grid View with Images                               column          39 comments       Pile of Shame - Colorful   2014 Nov 12, 01:00 39 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look at an understated art house drama anime from a few years ago, and finds a lot to admire. ―  COLORFUL To paraphrase Hideaki Anno, people don't commit suicide because they're depressed, people commit suicide because they can no longer imagine happiness. That thought occurred to me again and again while I was watching Colorful, the remarkable feature film produced by Sunrise in 2010,...                    column          16 comments       Pile of Shame - SOS!

Tokyo Metro Explorers: The Next Anime fans who were around back in 2007 might remember a company briefly appearing on the scene known as Bandai Visual USA. If they do remember, it's usually not a fond memory: BVUSA was the first attempt by a major Japanese anime producer to insert themselves into th...                           column          17 comments       Pile of Shame - Dead Heat & 3D Anime   2014 Oct 15, 00:00 17 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look at the first (and one of the only) 3D anime ever made, for an obscure videodisc system only sold in Japan. ―  Dead Heat Sometimes the reasons behind an anime getting made are more interesting than the show itself. That's definitely the case with Dead Heat, an obscure 1987 OAV from Sunrise that runs only a half hour. Back in the wild days of the nascent 80s home video market, there...                    column          49 comments       Pile of Shame - Special Duty Combat Unit Shinesman   2014 Oct  1, 00:06 49 comments                 anime    Justin revisits what was once considered the finest sentai parody in the land. Does it still hold up? ―  Special Duty Combat Unit Shinesman It's always a terrifying thing, going back to old shows you loved when you were younger and revisiting them. Many of them, comedies in particular, tend to age very poorly. They connect with us at the time, but humor is just so particular and fickle -- what made y...                    column          31 comments       Pile of Shame - Bite Me! Chameleon   2014 Sep 17, 00:00 31 comments                 anime    This little-seen delinquent comedy, an early ADV release, made Justin want to hurt himself. ―  Bite Me! Chameleon There are at least four genres of anime that, no matter what anybody does, always seem to completely fall on their face when released in the West: sports, realistic military, yakuza and yankee (juvenile delinquent) shows. These were discovered through a lot of trial and error in the early...                    column          18 comments       Pile of Shame - The Tibetan Dog   2014 Sep  3, 00:21 18 comments                 anime    An underappreciated Madhouse feature from 2011 featuring a boy and his dog in the harsh terrain of Tibet. ―  The Tibetan Dog Japanese/Chinese co-productions don't happen very often. The last one I can think of would be 1997's anime adaptation of Tsui Hark's Chinese Ghost Story, which was charming in appearance but kind of a plodding, pointless affair. In 2007 another one started production, after ani...                    column          10 comments       Pile of Shame - The Enemy's The Pirates!   2014 Aug 20, 00:00 10 comments                 anime    Justin tries to return to an old 90s favorite that has become more famous for its obscure, awful dub. ―  The Enemy's The Pirates! ~The Cat's Banquet~ There's a Japanese tradition of stand-up comedy duos known as ""manzai (漫才)."" Manzai routines are high-speed, rapid-fire conversations between one person, who's an idiot or a weirdo of some kind (boke), and a straight man (tsukkomi), who's constantly mut...                    column          32 comments       Pile of Shame - MARCO: 3,000 Leagues in Search of Mother   2014 Aug  6, 02:40 32 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look at a remake of Takahata's World Masterpiece Theater classic. Does it hold up? Ehh... ―  MARCO: 3,000 Leagues in Search of Mother We need to declare a new genre of anime, right here and now. There needs to be a separate category for the metric ton of overwrought family fare Japan makes, that aims to be Studio Ghibli in quality, but ends up succumbing to its maudlin sentimentality a...                    column          6 comments       Pile of Shame - Eiji   2014 Jul 22, 22:59 6 comments                 anime    Hisashi Eguchi's boxing manga got a short movie treatment back in 1990, but does it hold up? ―  Eiji Hisashi Eguchi is probably a guy that's better known among Japanese creatives than among American otaku. As an illustrator and manga artist, he's designed characters for such anime as Roujin Z and Spriggan, heavily influenced the look of Satoshi Kon's characters (Perfect Blue's final look was based on...                    column          33 comments       Pile of Shame - Mermaid's Scar   2014 Jul  9, 01:15 33 comments                 anime    Rumiko Takahashi's macabre OAV still holds up, and is still creepy, but the dub is really weird sounding. ―  Mermaid's Scar Mermaid's Scar is one of those early stocked-at-every-Blockbuster-Video-in-the-country hits of the VHS era that almost every fan that came of age in the mid-90s saw at one time or another. Colorful, violent, and hypnotic in its own way, it made a big impression on 13-year-old Ju...                    column          10 comments       Pile of Shame - ESPer Mami: Hoshizora no Dancing Doll   2014 Jun 25, 00:00 10 comments                 anime    Justin discovers a once-loved series by the creator of Doraemon, and finds it to be pretty dull. ―  ESPer Mami: Hoshizora no Dancing Doll Even though it's never been particularly popular among anime fans in the West, most people at least have heard of Doraemon, Fujiko F. Fujio's famous magical large blue cat character who's the star of over 2500 episodes of TV anime and 35 movies (not including short...                    column          18 comments       Pile of Shame - Guyver: Out of Control   2014 Jun 11, 03:43 18 comments                 anime    A mildly entertaining, but super-dated OAV incarnation of everyone's favorite superhero/grotesque monster/schoolboy. ―  Guyver: Out of Control Guyver: Out of Control was one of the earliest anime VHS releases in the US, and being an alternate retelling of the same story that the same company, US Renditions, would later release in dubbed form, was one of the first titles to confuse the hell out of peo...                    column          45 comments       Pile of Shame - Full Moon O Sagashite   2014 May 28, 00:00 45 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look back at the oddball Magical-Idol-Singer-With-Cancer Show from the early '00s. Because every little girl loves stories about dying tragically. ―  Full Moon o Sagashite I often joke that I love shows about children suffering. I usually mean that as a joke: anime usually involves young protagonists, but too often their concerns are superficial: being the best at a game, or a sport, o...                    column          34 comments       Pile of Shame - 3x3 Eyes   2014 May 14, 02:26 34 comments                 anime    Once a mainstay of anime club video rooms, 3x3 Eyes isn't brought up very often today. Does it stand up? Justin finds out. ―  3x3 EYES Yuzo Takada was never really a big name among American otaku, but back in the 90s his stuff ranked as some of the most popular anime of its day, including Blue Seed, Cat Girl Nuku Nuku, and this -- 3x3 EYES, a dark and gory adventure OAV that once adorned a good numbe...                    column          20 comments       Pile of Shame - Legend of the Dragon Kings   2014 Apr 30, 00:00 20 comments                 anime    A highly mediocre adaptation of a best-selling book series that was illustrated by Yoshitaka Amano and CLAMP. The anime looks nothing like that, of course. ―  Legend of the Dragon Kings(A.K.A. Sohryuden, Legend of the Four Kings) When a much-loved book or manga series gets a TV anime adaptation, fans of the original work hold their breath. Some adaptations improve on the original work. Others take it...                    column          8 comments       Pile of Shame - Nitaboh   2014 Apr 16, 00:00 8 comments                 anime    One of the few anime biographies, Nitaboh is surprisingly formulaic for being a true story. ―  Nitaboh, The Shamisen Master Last year, an old friend of mine asked me to help a non-profit group of radio producers come up with a Kickstarter video for a public radio project called ""Heavenly Sight,"" a multi-part audio documentary and web resource on blind African American blues and jazz musicians. It was...                    column          18 comments       Pile of Shame - Dark Warrior (Makyu Senjo)   2014 Apr  2, 00:00 18 comments                 anime    A non-hentai show from hentai producers that somehow nobody remembers, despite getting two dubs. There's a reason. ―  Dark Warrior (Makyu Senjo) It's pretty rare that an anime gets released in both the US and the UK, and with English dubs no less, and yet hardly anyone even remembers the show exists. Dark Warrior (AKA Makyu Senjo) is one of those, seemingly having made zero impact on fans upon its re...                    column          20 comments       Pile of Shame - Goddamn!!   2014 Mar 19, 06:39 20 comments                 anime    A rally car racing OAV that, aside from the provocative name, doesn't make much of an impact. ―  Goddamn!! Kaoru Shintani has never had much of an American fanbase. His most famous work, the fighter pilot drama series Area 88, landed in the US with a resounding thud in both of its anime adaptations as well as Viz's repeated attempts to publish the manga in English. I lay blame for that mostly in his ...                    column          23 comments       Pile of Shame - Adventures of Hols, Prince of the Sun   2014 Mar  5, 02:24 23 comments                 anime    Isao Takahata's troubled first feature is easily the best anime of the 1960s. ―  Adventures of Hols, Prince of the Sun It's the iron age, somewhere in Scandinavia, and a young boy warrior named Hols is just coming back home from a fierce battle with a pack of wolves. His father, on his deathbed, bids him to return to the Northern village they fled years ago, when an evil sorcerer named Grunwald devas...                    column          8 comments       Pile of Shame - Ai City   2014 Feb 19, 01:00 8 comments                 anime    A sleeper sci-fi film from Koichi Mashimo that might break your brain, but will definitely dazzle your eyes while doing so. ―  Ai City In the opening scenes of Ai City, we are dropped into the middle of a car chase in what is possibly New York City. In the back seat is a former cop, who was fired and is now a private investigator. He doesn't know why he's there, and neither do we. In the front seat a...                    column          14 comments       Pile of Shame - Natsuki Crisis   2014 Feb  5, 01:00 14 comments                 anime    A fun two-part girls-fighting-in-high-school OAV that doesn't take itself too seriously... until it does. ―  Natsuki Crisis When we first meet Kitsumi Natsuki, she's in her school dojo, gleefully trying to find a sparring partner. The rest of the team is all guys, but they don't stand a chance against the tomboy, and politely bow out. In addition to being fearfullly strong, Natsuki is also the protog...                    column          13 comments       Pile of Shame - Seven Cities Story   2014 Jan 22, 01:00 13 comments                 anime    A two-part OAV that tries to transplant Legend of Galactic Heroes onto a sideways-rotated Earth, and succeeds only in being dull and confusing. ―  Seven Cities Story One day, with no warning, the Earth's polar axis shifts 90 degrees, shaking up human civilization like an Etch-A-Sketch and killing everybody. Luckily by this time, humanity had a pretty decent settlement going on the moon, and once thin...                    column          23 comments       Pile of Shame - After School Tinker Bell   2014 Jan  8, 01:00 23 comments                 anime    This week, an OAV based on a light novel series about a romantic couple that solves mysteries around their school. ―  After School Tinker Bell In the last few years there have been a ton of anime adapted from light novels: those small, pulpy, simply written and easy-to-read populist books that lie somewhere between young adult novels and manga. But light novels have been around for a very long time, ...                    column          12 comments       Pile of Shame - Handsome Girl   2013 Dec 25, 01:00 12 comments                 anime    Justin revisits an old one-shot OAV by the creator of Marmalade Boy... and is a little underwhelmed. ―  Handsome Girl When I was in high school, I loved the show Marmalade Boy. A lot. In fact, I wrote an article about it! A perfectly addictive confectionary of chaste teenaged yearning and romance, and undiluted raw crippling angst, I lost many an evening to the adventures of the lovelorn protagonists...                    column          11 comments       Pile of Shame - The Sensualist   2013 Dec 11, 02:10 11 comments                 anime    This week, a unique erotic historical fiction film that has completely slipped through the cracks. ―  The Sensualist (A.K.A. The Life of an Amorous Man) I first saw The Sensualist as a fuzzy VHS tape when I was a teenager. While it's ostensibly an adult work, it never seemed lurid or arousing to me. Rather, it held this strange transcendent beauty. It felt like a piece of another person's life, so fo...                    column          16 comments       Pile of Shame - Emblem Take 2   2013 Nov 27, 02:02 16 comments                 anime    This week, a rare yakuza time travel comedy. Perhaps the ONLY yakuza time travel comedy. ―  Emblem Take 2 Yakuza aren't a pleasant topic. Japan's fully-entrenched organized crime families and organizations, and their connections with everything from banking to entertainment to politics show us Japan at its most corrupt and embarrassing.

No? Didn't think so. ―  Wanna-Be's Lately there's been a lot of chatter about the girls' wrestling TV series, Wanna Be The Strongest In The World. Given that virtually none of the chatter is positive, I'm not really making plans to check out the show for myself. But hearing about a mediocre girls' wresting anime did jog my memory about anothe...                    column          5 comments       Pile of Shame - Grandeek: The Alternative   2013 Sep 18, 00:56 5 comments                 anime    An early digipaint OAV that has a lot of potential, but is so awkwardly made that the storytelling really suffers. ―  Grandeek: The Alternative When visiting Japan, one of my favorite things to do is explore the DVD sections of every Book Off location I can find.

Instead, it's just sort of lazy and crappy. ―  Butt Attack Punisher Girl Gautaman One thing you can say about Butt Attack Girl Punisher Gautaman (and its sequel OAV, Butt Attack Punisher Girl Gautaman R), you know pretty much exactly what you're getting: a cut-rate early-90s dirty comedy OAV about a girl that beats dudes down with her butt.

I mean that honestly. There was a time not long ago, even in otaku circles, when the idea of incest was odd and outré enough to elicit giggles from the less mature parts of ourselves, and maybe even an ""oh god.""

That thought occurred to me again and again while I was watching Colorful, the remarkable feature film produced by Sunrise in 2010,...                    column          16 comments       Pile of Shame - SOS!

Tokyo Metro Explorers: The Next Anime fans who were around back in 2007 might remember a company briefly appearing on the scene known as Bandai Visual USA. If they do remember, it's usually not a fond memory: BVUSA was the first attempt by a major Japanese anime producer to insert themselves into th...                           column          17 comments       Pile of Shame - Dead Heat & 3D Anime   2014 Oct 15, 00:00 17 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look at the first (and one of the only) 3D anime ever made, for an obscure videodisc system only sold in Japan. ―  Dead Heat Sometimes the reasons behind an anime getting made are more interesting than the show itself. That's definitely the case with Dead Heat, an obscure 1987 OAV from Sunrise that runs only a half hour. Back in the wild days of the nascent 80s home video market, there...                    column          49 comments       Pile of Shame - Special Duty Combat Unit Shinesman   2014 Oct  1, 00:06 49 comments                 anime    Justin revisits what was once considered the finest sentai parody in the land. Does it still hold up? ―  Special Duty Combat Unit Shinesman It's always a terrifying thing, going back to old shows you loved when you were younger and revisiting them. Many of them, comedies in particular, tend to age very poorly. They connect with us at the time, but humor is just so particular and fickle -- what made y...                    column          31 comments       Pile of Shame - Bite Me!

Chameleon There are at least four genres of anime that, no matter what anybody does, always seem to completely fall on their face when released in the West: sports, realistic military, yakuza and yankee (juvenile delinquent) shows. These were discovered through a lot of trial and error in the early...                    column          18 comments       Pile of Shame - The Tibetan Dog   2014 Sep  3, 00:21 18 comments                 anime    An underappreciated Madhouse feature from 2011 featuring a boy and his dog in the harsh terrain of Tibet. ―  The Tibetan Dog Japanese/Chinese co-productions don't happen very often. The last one I can think of would be 1997's anime adaptation of Tsui Hark's Chinese Ghost Story, which was charming in appearance but kind of a plodding, pointless affair. In 2007 another one started production, after ani...                    column          10 comments       Pile of Shame - The Enemy's The Pirates!   2014 Aug 20, 00:00 10 comments                 anime    Justin tries to return to an old 90s favorite that has become more famous for its obscure, awful dub. ―  The Enemy's The Pirates! ~The Cat's Banquet~ There's a Japanese tradition of stand-up comedy duos known as ""manzai (漫才)."" Manzai routines are high-speed, rapid-fire conversations between one person, who's an idiot or a weirdo of some kind (boke), and a straight man (tsukkomi), who's constantly mut...                    column          32 comments       Pile of Shame - MARCO: 3,000 Leagues in Search of Mother   2014 Aug  6, 02:40 32 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look at a remake of Takahata's World Masterpiece Theater classic. Does it hold up? Ehh... ―  MARCO: 3,000 Leagues in Search of Mother We need to declare a new genre of anime, right here and now. There needs to be a separate category for the metric ton of overwrought family fare Japan makes, that aims to be Studio Ghibli in quality, but ends up succumbing to its maudlin sentimentality a...                    column          6 comments       Pile of Shame - Eiji   2014 Jul 22, 22:59 6 comments                 anime    Hisashi Eguchi's boxing manga got a short movie treatment back in 1990, but does it hold up? ―  Eiji Hisashi Eguchi is probably a guy that's better known among Japanese creatives than among American otaku. As an illustrator and manga artist, he's designed characters for such anime as Roujin Z and Spriggan, heavily influenced the look of Satoshi Kon's characters (Perfect Blue's final look was based on...                    column          33 comments       Pile of Shame - Mermaid's Scar   2014 Jul  9, 01:15 33 comments                 anime    Rumiko Takahashi's macabre OAV still holds up, and is still creepy, but the dub is really weird sounding. ―  Mermaid's Scar Mermaid's Scar is one of those early stocked-at-every-Blockbuster-Video-in-the-country hits of the VHS era that almost every fan that came of age in the mid-90s saw at one time or another. Colorful, violent, and hypnotic in its own way, it made a big impression on 13-year-old Ju...                    column          10 comments       Pile of Shame - ESPer Mami: Hoshizora no Dancing Doll   2014 Jun 25, 00:00 10 comments                 anime    Justin discovers a once-loved series by the creator of Doraemon, and finds it to be pretty dull. ―  ESPer Mami: Hoshizora no Dancing Doll Even though it's never been particularly popular among anime fans in the West, most people at least have heard of Doraemon, Fujiko F. Fujio's famous magical large blue cat character who's the star of over 2500 episodes of TV anime and 35 movies (not including short...                    column          18 comments       Pile of Shame - Guyver: Out of Control   2014 Jun 11, 03:43 18 comments                 anime    A mildly entertaining, but super-dated OAV incarnation of everyone's favorite superhero/grotesque monster/schoolboy. ―  Guyver: Out of Control Guyver: Out of Control was one of the earliest anime VHS releases in the US, and being an alternate retelling of the same story that the same company, US Renditions, would later release in dubbed form, was one of the first titles to confuse the hell out of peo...                    column          45 comments       Pile of Shame - Full Moon O Sagashite   2014 May 28, 00:00 45 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look back at the oddball Magical-Idol-Singer-With-Cancer Show from the early '00s. Because every little girl loves stories about dying tragically. ―  Full Moon o Sagashite I often joke that I love shows about children suffering. I usually mean that as a joke: anime usually involves young protagonists, but too often their concerns are superficial: being the best at a game, or a sport, o...                    column          34 comments       Pile of Shame - 3x3 Eyes   2014 May 14, 02:26 34 comments                 anime    Once a mainstay of anime club video rooms, 3x3 Eyes isn't brought up very often today. Does it stand up? Justin finds out. ―  3x3 EYES Yuzo Takada was never really a big name among American otaku, but back in the 90s his stuff ranked as some of the most popular anime of its day, including Blue Seed, Cat Girl Nuku Nuku, and this -- 3x3 EYES, a dark and gory adventure OAV that once adorned a good numbe...                    column          20 comments       Pile of Shame - Legend of the Dragon Kings   2014 Apr 30, 00:00 20 comments                 anime    A highly mediocre adaptation of a best-selling book series that was illustrated by Yoshitaka Amano and CLAMP. The anime looks nothing like that, of course. ―  Legend of the Dragon Kings(A.K.A. Sohryuden, Legend of the Four Kings) When a much-loved book or manga series gets a TV anime adaptation, fans of the original work hold their breath. Some adaptations improve on the original work. Others take it...                    column          8 comments       Pile of Shame - Nitaboh   2014 Apr 16, 00:00 8 comments                 anime    One of the few anime biographies, Nitaboh is surprisingly formulaic for being a true story. ―  Nitaboh, The Shamisen Master Last year, an old friend of mine asked me to help a non-profit group of radio producers come up with a Kickstarter video for a public radio project called ""Heavenly Sight,"" a multi-part audio documentary and web resource on blind African American blues and jazz musicians.

There's a reason. ―  Dark Warrior (Makyu Senjo) It's pretty rare that an anime gets released in both the US and the UK, and with English dubs no less, and yet hardly anyone even remembers the show exists. Dark Warrior (AKA Makyu Senjo) is one of those, seemingly having made zero impact on fans upon its re...                    column          20 comments       Pile of Shame - Goddamn!!   2014 Mar 19, 06:39 20 comments                 anime    A rally car racing OAV that, aside from the provocative name, doesn't make much of an impact. ―  Goddamn!! Kaoru Shintani has never had much of an American fanbase. His most famous work, the fighter pilot drama series Area 88, landed in the US with a resounding thud in both of its anime adaptations as well as Viz's repeated attempts to publish the manga in English.

I mean that honestly. There was a time not long ago, even in otaku circles, when the idea of incest was odd and outré enough to elicit giggles from the less mature parts of ourselves, and maybe even an ""oh god.""

Tokyo Metro Explorers: The Next Anime fans who were around back in 2007 might remember a company briefly appearing on the scene known as Bandai Visual USA. If they do remember, it's usually not a fond memory: BVUSA was the first attempt by a major Japanese anime producer to insert themselves into th...                           column          17 comments       Pile of Shame - Dead Heat & 3D Anime   2014 Oct 15, 00:00 17 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look at the first (and one of the only) 3D anime ever made, for an obscure videodisc system only sold in Japan. ―  Dead Heat Sometimes the reasons behind an anime getting made are more interesting than the show itself. That's definitely the case with Dead Heat, an obscure 1987 OAV from Sunrise that runs only a half hour. Back in the wild days of the nascent 80s home video market, there...                    column          49 comments       Pile of Shame - Special Duty Combat Unit Shinesman   2014 Oct  1, 00:06 49 comments                 anime    Justin revisits what was once considered the finest sentai parody in the land. Does it still hold up? ―  Special Duty Combat Unit Shinesman It's always a terrifying thing, going back to old shows you loved when you were younger and revisiting them. Many of them, comedies in particular, tend to age very poorly. They connect with us at the time, but humor is just so particular and fickle -- what made y...                    column          31 comments       Pile of Shame - Bite Me!

Chameleon There are at least four genres of anime that, no matter what anybody does, always seem to completely fall on their face when released in the West: sports, realistic military, yakuza and yankee (juvenile delinquent) shows. These were discovered through a lot of trial and error in the early...                    column          18 comments       Pile of Shame - The Tibetan Dog   2014 Sep  3, 00:21 18 comments                 anime    An underappreciated Madhouse feature from 2011 featuring a boy and his dog in the harsh terrain of Tibet. ―  The Tibetan Dog Japanese/Chinese co-productions don't happen very often. The last one I can think of would be 1997's anime adaptation of Tsui Hark's Chinese Ghost Story, which was charming in appearance but kind of a plodding, pointless affair.

Manzai routines are high-speed, rapid-fire conversations between one person, who's an idiot or a weirdo of some kind (boke), and a straight man (tsukkomi), who's constantly mut...                    column          32 comments       Pile of Shame - MARCO: 3,000 Leagues in Search of Mother   2014 Aug  6, 02:40 32 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look at a remake of Takahata's World Masterpiece Theater classic. Does it hold up? Ehh... ―  MARCO: 3,000 Leagues in Search of Mother We need to declare a new genre of anime, right here and now.

As an illustrator and manga artist, he's designed characters for such anime as Roujin Z and Spriggan, heavily influenced the look of Satoshi Kon's characters (Perfect Blue's final look was based on...                    column          33 comments       Pile of Shame - Mermaid's Scar   2014 Jul  9, 01:15 33 comments                 anime    Rumiko Takahashi's macabre OAV still holds up, and is still creepy, but the dub is really weird sounding. ―  Mermaid's Scar Mermaid's Scar is one of those early stocked-at-every-Blockbuster-Video-in-the-country hits of the VHS era that almost every fan that came of age in the mid-90s saw at one time or another. Colorful, violent, and hypnotic in its own way, it made a big impression on 13-year-old Ju...                    column          10 comments       Pile of Shame - ESPer Mami: Hoshizora no Dancing Doll   2014 Jun 25, 00:00 10 comments                 anime    Justin discovers a once-loved series by the creator of Doraemon, and finds it to be pretty dull. ―  ESPer Mami: Hoshizora no Dancing Doll Even though it's never been particularly popular among anime fans in the West, most people at least have heard of Doraemon, Fujiko F.

Because every little girl loves stories about dying tragically. ―  Full Moon o Sagashite I often joke that I love shows about children suffering. I usually mean that as a joke: anime usually involves young protagonists, but too often their concerns are superficial: being the best at a game, or a sport, o...                    column          34 comments       Pile of Shame - 3x3 Eyes   2014 May 14, 02:26 34 comments                 anime    Once a mainstay of anime club video rooms, 3x3 Eyes isn't brought up very often today. Does it stand up? Justin finds out. ―  3x3 EYES Yuzo Takada was never really a big name among American otaku, but back in the 90s his stuff ranked as some of the most popular anime of its day, including Blue Seed, Cat Girl Nuku Nuku, and this -- 3x3 EYES, a dark and gory adventure OAV that once adorned a good numbe...                    column          20 comments       Pile of Shame - Legend of the Dragon Kings   2014 Apr 30, 00:00 20 comments                 anime    A highly mediocre adaptation of a best-selling book series that was illustrated by Yoshitaka Amano and CLAMP. The anime looks nothing like that, of course. ―  Legend of the Dragon Kings(A.K.A.

There's a reason. ―  Dark Warrior (Makyu Senjo) It's pretty rare that an anime gets released in both the US and the UK, and with English dubs no less, and yet hardly anyone even remembers the show exists. Dark Warrior (AKA Makyu Senjo) is one of those, seemingly having made zero impact on fans upon its re...                    column          20 comments       Pile of Shame - Goddamn!!   2014 Mar 19, 06:39 20 comments                 anime    A rally car racing OAV that, aside from the provocative name, doesn't make much of an impact. ―  Goddamn!! Kaoru Shintani has never had much of an American fanbase. His most famous work, the fighter pilot drama series Area 88, landed in the US with a resounding thud in both of its anime adaptations as well as Viz's repeated attempts to publish the manga in English.

Tokyo Metro Explorers: The Next Anime fans who were around back in 2007 might remember a company briefly appearing on the scene known as Bandai Visual USA.

That's definitely the case with Dead Heat, an obscure 1987 OAV from Sunrise that runs only a half hour.

They connect with us at the time, but humor is just so particular and fickle -- what made y...                    column          31 comments       Pile of Shame - Bite Me!

Chameleon There are at least four genres of anime that, no matter what anybody does, always seem to completely fall on their face when released in the West: sports, realistic military, yakuza and yankee (juvenile delinquent) shows. These were discovered through a lot of trial and error in the early...                    column          18 comments       Pile of Shame - The Tibetan Dog   2014 Sep  3, 00:21 18 comments                 anime    An underappreciated Madhouse feature from 2011 featuring a boy and his dog in the harsh terrain of Tibet. ―  The Tibetan Dog Japanese/Chinese co-productions don't happen very often. The last one I can think of would be 1997's anime adaptation of Tsui Hark's Chinese Ghost Story, which was charming in appearance but kind of a plodding, pointless affair.

Because every little girl loves stories about dying tragically. ―  Full Moon o Sagashite I often joke that I love shows about children suffering. I usually mean that as a joke: anime usually involves young protagonists, but too often their concerns are superficial: being the best at a game, or a sport, o...                    column          34 comments       Pile of Shame - 3x3 Eyes   2014 May 14, 02:26 34 comments                 anime    Once a mainstay of anime club video rooms, 3x3 Eyes isn't brought up very often today. Does it stand up? Justin finds out. ―  3x3 EYES Yuzo Takada was never really a big name among American otaku, but back in the 90s his stuff ranked as some of the most popular anime of its day, including Blue Seed, Cat Girl Nuku Nuku, and this -- 3x3 EYES, a dark and gory adventure OAV that once adorned a good numbe...                    column          20 comments       Pile of Shame - Legend of the Dragon Kings   2014 Apr 30, 00:00 20 comments                 anime    A highly mediocre adaptation of a best-selling book series that was illustrated by Yoshitaka Amano and CLAMP. The anime looks nothing like that, of course. ―  Legend of the Dragon Kings(A.K.A.

Dark Warrior (AKA Makyu Senjo) is one of those, seemingly having made zero impact on fans upon its re...                    column          20 comments       Pile of Shame - Goddamn!!   2014 Mar 19, 06:39 20 comments                 anime    A rally car racing OAV that, aside from the provocative name, doesn't make much of an impact. ―  Goddamn!! Kaoru Shintani has never had much of an American fanbase.

Chameleon There are at least four genres of anime that, no matter what anybody does, always seem to completely fall on their face when released in the West: sports, realistic military, yakuza and yankee (juvenile delinquent) shows. These were discovered through a lot of trial and error in the early...                    column          18 comments       Pile of Shame - The Tibetan Dog   2014 Sep  3, 00:21 18 comments                 anime    An underappreciated Madhouse feature from 2011 featuring a boy and his dog in the harsh terrain of Tibet. ―  The Tibetan Dog Japanese/Chinese co-productions don't happen very often. The last one I can think of would be 1997's anime adaptation of Tsui Hark's Chinese Ghost Story, which was charming in appearance but kind of a plodding, pointless affair.

Manzai routines are high-speed, rapid-fire conversations between one person, who's an idiot or a weirdo of some kind (boke), and a straight man (tsukkomi), who's constantly mut...                    column          32 comments       Pile of Shame - MARCO: 3,000 Leagues in Search of Mother   2014 Aug  6, 02:40 32 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look at a remake of Takahata's World Masterpiece Theater classic.

As an illustrator and manga artist, he's designed characters for such anime as Roujin Z and Spriggan, heavily influenced the look of Satoshi Kon's characters (Perfect Blue's final look was based on...                    column          33 comments       Pile of Shame - Mermaid's Scar   2014 Jul  9, 01:15 33 comments                 anime    Rumiko Takahashi's macabre OAV still holds up, and is still creepy, but the dub is really weird sounding. ―  Mermaid's Scar Mermaid's Scar is one of those early stocked-at-every-Blockbuster-Video-in-the-country hits of the VHS era that almost every fan that came of age in the mid-90s saw at one time or another. Colorful, violent, and hypnotic in its own way, it made a big impression on 13-year-old Ju...                    column          10 comments       Pile of Shame - ESPer Mami: Hoshizora no Dancing Doll   2014 Jun 25, 00:00 10 comments                 anime    Justin discovers a once-loved series by the creator of Doraemon, and finds it to be pretty dull. ―  ESPer Mami: Hoshizora no Dancing Doll Even though it's never been particularly popular among anime fans in the West, most people at least have heard of Doraemon, Fujiko F.

Because every little girl loves stories about dying tragically. ―  Full Moon o Sagashite I often joke that I love shows about children suffering. I usually mean that as a joke: anime usually involves young protagonists, but too often their concerns are superficial: being the best at a game, or a sport, o...                    column          34 comments       Pile of Shame - 3x3 Eyes   2014 May 14, 02:26 34 comments                 anime    Once a mainstay of anime club video rooms, 3x3 Eyes isn't brought up very often today. Does it stand up? Justin finds out. ―  3x3 EYES Yuzo Takada was never really a big name among American otaku, but back in the 90s his stuff ranked as some of the most popular anime of its day, including Blue Seed, Cat Girl Nuku Nuku, and this -- 3x3 EYES, a dark and gory adventure OAV that once adorned a good numbe...                    column          20 comments       Pile of Shame - Legend of the Dragon Kings   2014 Apr 30, 00:00 20 comments                 anime    A highly mediocre adaptation of a best-selling book series that was illustrated by Yoshitaka Amano and CLAMP. The anime looks nothing like that, of course. ―  Legend of the Dragon Kings(A.K.A. Sohryuden, Legend of the Four Kings) When a much-loved book or manga series gets a TV anime adaptation, fans of the original work hold their breath. Some adaptations improve on the original work. Others take it...                    column          8 comments       Pile of Shame - Nitaboh   2014 Apr 16, 00:00 8 comments                 anime    One of the few anime biographies, Nitaboh is surprisingly formulaic for being a true story. ―  Nitaboh, The Shamisen Master Last year, an old friend of mine asked me to help a non-profit group of radio producers come up with a Kickstarter video for a public radio project called ""Heavenly Sight,"" a multi-part audio documentary and web resource on blind African American blues and jazz musicians.

There's a reason. ―  Dark Warrior (Makyu Senjo) It's pretty rare that an anime gets released in both the US and the UK, and with English dubs no less, and yet hardly anyone even remembers the show exists. Dark Warrior (AKA Makyu Senjo) is one of those, seemingly having made zero impact on fans upon its re...                    column          20 comments       Pile of Shame - Goddamn!!   2014 Mar 19, 06:39 20 comments                 anime    A rally car racing OAV that, aside from the provocative name, doesn't make much of an impact. ―  Goddamn!! Kaoru Shintani has never had much of an American fanbase. His most famous work, the fighter pilot drama series Area 88, landed in the US with a resounding thud in both of its anime adaptations as well as Viz's repeated attempts to publish the manga in English. I lay blame for that mostly in his ...                    column          23 comments       Pile of Shame - Adventures of Hols, Prince of the Sun   2014 Mar  5, 02:24 23 comments                 anime    Isao Takahata's troubled first feature is easily the best anime of the 1960s. ―  Adventures of Hols, Prince of the Sun It's the iron age, somewhere in Scandinavia, and a young boy warrior named Hols is just coming back home from a fierce battle with a pack of wolves. His father, on his deathbed, bids him to return to the Northern village they fled years ago, when an evil sorcerer named Grunwald devas...                    column          8 comments       Pile of Shame - Ai City   2014 Feb 19, 01:00 8 comments                 anime    A sleeper sci-fi film from Koichi Mashimo that might break your brain, but will definitely dazzle your eyes while doing so. ―  Ai City In the opening scenes of Ai City, we are dropped into the middle of a car chase in what is possibly New York City. In the back seat is a former cop, who was fired and is now a private investigator. He doesn't know why he's there, and neither do we. In the front seat a...                    column          14 comments       Pile of Shame - Natsuki Crisis   2014 Feb  5, 01:00 14 comments                 anime    A fun two-part girls-fighting-in-high-school OAV that doesn't take itself too seriously... until it does. ―  Natsuki Crisis When we first meet Kitsumi Natsuki, she's in her school dojo, gleefully trying to find a sparring partner. The rest of the team is all guys, but they don't stand a chance against the tomboy, and politely bow out. In addition to being fearfullly strong, Natsuki is also the protog...                    column          13 comments       Pile of Shame - Seven Cities Story   2014 Jan 22, 01:00 13 comments                 anime    A two-part OAV that tries to transplant Legend of Galactic Heroes onto a sideways-rotated Earth, and succeeds only in being dull and confusing. ―  Seven Cities Story One day, with no warning, the Earth's polar axis shifts 90 degrees, shaking up human civilization like an Etch-A-Sketch and killing everybody. Luckily by this time, humanity had a pretty decent settlement going on the moon, and once thin...                    column          23 comments       Pile of Shame - After School Tinker Bell   2014 Jan  8, 01:00 23 comments                 anime    This week, an OAV based on a light novel series about a romantic couple that solves mysteries around their school. ―  After School Tinker Bell In the last few years there have been a ton of anime adapted from light novels: those small, pulpy, simply written and easy-to-read populist books that lie somewhere between young adult novels and manga. But light novels have been around for a very long time, ...                    column          12 comments       Pile of Shame - Handsome Girl   2013 Dec 25, 01:00 12 comments                 anime    Justin revisits an old one-shot OAV by the creator of Marmalade Boy... and is a little underwhelmed. ―  Handsome Girl When I was in high school, I loved the show Marmalade Boy. A lot. In fact, I wrote an article about it! A perfectly addictive confectionary of chaste teenaged yearning and romance, and undiluted raw crippling angst, I lost many an evening to the adventures of the lovelorn protagonists...                    column          11 comments       Pile of Shame - The Sensualist   2013 Dec 11, 02:10 11 comments                 anime    This week, a unique erotic historical fiction film that has completely slipped through the cracks. ―  The Sensualist (A.K.A. The Life of an Amorous Man) I first saw The Sensualist as a fuzzy VHS tape when I was a teenager. While it's ostensibly an adult work, it never seemed lurid or arousing to me. Rather, it held this strange transcendent beauty. It felt like a piece of another person's life, so fo...                    column          16 comments       Pile of Shame - Emblem Take 2   2013 Nov 27, 02:02 16 comments                 anime    This week, a rare yakuza time travel comedy. Perhaps the ONLY yakuza time travel comedy. ―  Emblem Take 2 Yakuza aren't a pleasant topic. Japan's fully-entrenched organized crime families and organizations, and their connections with everything from banking to entertainment to politics show us Japan at its most corrupt and embarrassing. Unless you go looking for trouble in Tokyo, it's unlikely that a...                    column          17 comments       Pile of Shame: Ai Monogatari: 9 Love Stories   2013 Nov 13, 01:13 17 comments                 anime    Trying to watch this OAV like biting into a large wad of wet cotton: it's not offensive or unpleasant, but you want to end the experience as fast as humanly possible. ―  Ai Monogatari: 9 Love Stories If there's anything that anime lacks, it's real, adult love stories. We have enough yearning, angsty teen romance to sink a battleship, but realistic love stories about people whose frontal lobes are fir...                    column          23 comments       Pile of Shame - Wanna-Be's   2013 Oct 30, 00:01 23 comments     Did anyone say ""I want more women's wrestling anime?"" .... No? Didn't think so. ―  Wanna-Be's Lately there's been a lot of chatter about the girls' wrestling TV series, Wanna Be The Strongest In The World. Given that virtually none of the chatter is positive, I'm not really making plans to check out the show for myself. But hearing about a mediocre girls' wresting anime did jog my memory about anothe...                    column          5 comments       Pile of Shame - Grandeek: The Alternative   2013 Sep 18, 00:56 5 comments                 anime    An early digipaint OAV that has a lot of potential, but is so awkwardly made that the storytelling really suffers. ―  Grandeek: The Alternative When visiting Japan, one of my favorite things to do is explore the DVD sections of every Book Off location I can find. Usually I can identify and easily dismiss pretty much everything on the shelf, but every once in a while I happen upon something that I hav...                    column          17 comments       Pile of Shame - Butt Attack Punisher Girl Gautaman   2013 Sep  4, 00:00 17 comments                 anime                manga    It could've been offensive, bawdy, witty and hilarious. Instead, it's just sort of lazy and crappy. ―  Butt Attack Punisher Girl Gautaman One thing you can say about Butt Attack Girl Punisher Gautaman (and its sequel OAV, Butt Attack Punisher Girl Gautaman R), you know pretty much exactly what you're getting: a cut-rate early-90s dirty comedy OAV about a girl that beats dudes down with her butt.

I mean that honestly. There was a time not long ago, even in otaku circles, when the idea of incest was odd and outré enough to elicit giggles from the less mature parts of ourselves, and maybe even an ""oh god.""

Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision Episodes 25-27  by Christopher Farris, Apr 16th 2022                   How would you rate episode 25 of Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision (movies) ?                     Community score: 4.5                  How would you rate episode 26 of Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision (movies) ?                     Community score: 4.1                  How would you rate episode 27 of Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision (movies) ?                     Community score: 4.1            My thoughts on the opening episode of Collision were covered back at  the beginning of the preview guide, but to summarize, I regarded it as effectively a thematic opener for this season, less connected to the dense plotting we all really keep coming back to Legend of the Galactic Heroes for. But that might turn out to be a harbinger of the more roundabout approach to storytelling this season might overall be taking, as the following pair of episodes aren't overly concerned with advancing any major battle plans on either side of the conflict either. Instead, they are about two specific dudes: Wolfgang Mittermeyer and Oskar von Reuenthal. If you're a fan of LOGH from its previous incarnations, then these two need no introduction, but if you're a newcomer, this duology serves as a pretty effective one.    Of course, Mittermeyer and Reuenthal have been around Die Neue These for a while at this point; it's just now that the show is deciding to detail exactly who these two are, and how they got so close with each other and so trusted with Reinhard.  As with the first episode's Julian-focused aside prologue, this pair of backstory-based episodes uses the flashbacks for Mittermeyer and Reuenthal as vectors for overall thematic worldbuilding in laying out what their deal is. As well, getting two episodes in a row about these guys shows early on that Collision might be less beholden to the previous seasons' rigid alternating Alliance/Empire story focus structure; that also makes sense, given that, as this season's title implies, the two sides will be more directly clashing again as it goes on, as opposed to the more isolated plots they were dealing with in the last batch.    All that's structural setup for the season as it goes on, however, with Episodes 26 and 27 rooted firmly in the past, and entirely on the Empire's side of things to boot. The initial recounting of the more personal circumstances of Mittermeyer and Reuenthal's contrasting upbringings are more about establishing the men personally before the past's plot-heavy stuff rears its head. Stuff like Mittermeyer's courtship with his eventual wife Evangelin is pretty basic (though his dad's little fist-pump as his son's proposal is accepted is a cute detail), while Reuenthal's drunken confession of his distrust of all women stemming from his problems with his mother is as comparatively melodramatic as you would expect from this series. Beyond the actual context of the content, these beats are mainly here to impart to us the trust in the bond these two men forged. Mittermeyer acknowledges the irrationality of Reuenthal's issues, sure, but you can't not be heartened at his no-hesitance response the morning after when his bro asks him to act like he didn't hear anything.    It's basically all flavor, but it at least makes for a properly engaging opener for a season that's seemingly going to be heavy on featuring these guys. It gets them out in front of the audience, and makes clear what their dynamic is and why it's supposed to be appealing. The next step is showing that dynamic in more of a story-based context, in this case via a plotline that got shuffled around compared to the previous LOGH anime: The Klopstock Incident. Doing this story as a flashback has a few advantages, like getting to see more of Sieg even after his death at the end of last season. But there is still a sense of the post-hoc about the placement here, since a large part of this story is showing earlier interactions between our main Imperial heroes with aristocratic characters like Braunschweig and Ansbach, who you'll remember from the Empire's civil war plot from last season. It's dotted with a lot of signs of how things will lead into that story, particularly the establishment of how Mittermeyer and Reuenthal wound up courting the animosity of this particular group. But given how all those rich jerks have since been killed and their whole story wrapped up, it can feel like a retroactive thematic inclusion to something that finished nearly three years ago, which isn't great as far as pertinent storytelling goes.    That said, as a piece of storytelling on its own, this is still a tight little flashback arc that expounds on the themes of LOGH while at least keeping the energy of the series up. Mittermeyer and Reuenthal prove that they are still an appealing pair of characters that can carry a story that's largely a forgone conclusion by this point. And the thematics remain well-aligned, both in terms of where this season's story will ultimately go (let's just say the discussion of a potential military tribunal is something of a dry run), as well as the overarching ideas that have always been part of LOGH. Sure, we already knew that Mittermeyer and Reuenthal were aligned with Reinhard's beliefs about the corruption at the heart of the royalty running the Empire at the time, but seeing them demonstrate those principles, against the kind of barbarous bastard who would cut open a woman's throat just to steal a ring, unflinchingly shows how these guys are the 'Heroes' of this story even on this side of the conflict (Also if that scene of him shooting the guy doesn't convince you that Mittermeyer rules, I don't think anything will). The procession of events fits with the always-present historical stylings of LOGH, demonstrating that things rarely happen in neat, contained arcs in reality; instead, it's often a sequence of interactions that lead to connections and changes that continuously occur through time. By the end of Episode 27, the implication is that each of the commanders Reinhard has assembled under him have as rich personal histories connecting them to the new Prime Minister as Mittermeyer and Reuenthal do, as if all of these galactic heroes have their own legends. Or something like that.    I'd also be remiss if I didn't comment on the stylizations this sequence of episodes takes us through. Production I.G's Legend of the Galactic Heroes has always had a fair bit of gloss on it, but these episodes go hard on some of the more colorful elements of the presentation: The contrasting palette on the flashback to Reuenthal's mommy issues, the striking orange of the sun over Mittermeyer's gunning down of the noble, or the brief flash of lightning illuminating the conversation with Reinhard and Sieg. It all does a good job of reminding you that, oh right, these episodes are part of a Capital-M Movie in their original release. Things still get a little rote at the end when we're being introduced to the rest of Reinhard's commanders and DNT does that thing where it just keeps naming dudes. That means that even in an extended flashback of questionable relevance to the primary story, LOGH is still LOGH, for better and for worse. It can almost make these episodes feel entirely like fanservice for the established viewers at this point, spending time presenting a polished piece about a pair of popular players. It's an interesting choice three seasons in, to be sure, but it's also hard to argue with the pure entertainment that results.

Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision Episodes 25-27  by Christopher Farris, Apr 16th 2022                   How would you rate episode 25 of Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision (movies) ?                     Community score: 4.5                  How would you rate episode 26 of Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision (movies) ?                     Community score: 4.1                  How would you rate episode 27 of Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision (movies) ?                     Community score: 4.1            My thoughts on the opening episode of Collision were covered back at  the beginning of the preview guide, but to summarize, I regarded it as effectively a thematic opener for this season, less connected to the dense plotting we all really keep coming back to Legend of the Galactic Heroes for. But that might turn out to be a harbinger of the more roundabout approach to storytelling this season might overall be taking, as the following pair of episodes aren't overly concerned with advancing any major battle plans on either side of the conflict either. Instead, they are about two specific dudes: Wolfgang Mittermeyer and Oskar von Reuenthal. If you're a fan of LOGH from its previous incarnations, then these two need no introduction, but if you're a newcomer, this duology serves as a pretty effective one.    Of course, Mittermeyer and Reuenthal have been around Die Neue These for a while at this point; it's just now that the show is deciding to detail exactly who these two are, and how they got so close with each other and so trusted with Reinhard.  As with the first episode's Julian-focused aside prologue, this pair of backstory-based episodes uses the flashbacks for Mittermeyer and Reuenthal as vectors for overall thematic worldbuilding in laying out what their deal is. As well, getting two episodes in a row about these guys shows early on that Collision might be less beholden to the previous seasons' rigid alternating Alliance/Empire story focus structure; that also makes sense, given that, as this season's title implies, the two sides will be more directly clashing again as it goes on, as opposed to the more isolated plots they were dealing with in the last batch.    All that's structural setup for the season as it goes on, however, with Episodes 26 and 27 rooted firmly in the past, and entirely on the Empire's side of things to boot. The initial recounting of the more personal circumstances of Mittermeyer and Reuenthal's contrasting upbringings are more about establishing the men personally before the past's plot-heavy stuff rears its head. Stuff like Mittermeyer's courtship with his eventual wife Evangelin is pretty basic (though his dad's little fist-pump as his son's proposal is accepted is a cute detail), while Reuenthal's drunken confession of his distrust of all women stemming from his problems with his mother is as comparatively melodramatic as you would expect from this series. Beyond the actual context of the content, these beats are mainly here to impart to us the trust in the bond these two men forged. Mittermeyer acknowledges the irrationality of Reuenthal's issues, sure, but you can't not be heartened at his no-hesitance response the morning after when his bro asks him to act like he didn't hear anything.    It's basically all flavor, but it at least makes for a properly engaging opener for a season that's seemingly going to be heavy on featuring these guys. It gets them out in front of the audience, and makes clear what their dynamic is and why it's supposed to be appealing. The next step is showing that dynamic in more of a story-based context, in this case via a plotline that got shuffled around compared to the previous LOGH anime: The Klopstock Incident. Doing this story as a flashback has a few advantages, like getting to see more of Sieg even after his death at the end of last season. But there is still a sense of the post-hoc about the placement here, since a large part of this story is showing earlier interactions between our main Imperial heroes with aristocratic characters like Braunschweig and Ansbach, who you'll remember from the Empire's civil war plot from last season. It's dotted with a lot of signs of how things will lead into that story, particularly the establishment of how Mittermeyer and Reuenthal wound up courting the animosity of this particular group. But given how all those rich jerks have since been killed and their whole story wrapped up, it can feel like a retroactive thematic inclusion to something that finished nearly three years ago, which isn't great as far as pertinent storytelling goes.    That said, as a piece of storytelling on its own, this is still a tight little flashback arc that expounds on the themes of LOGH while at least keeping the energy of the series up. Mittermeyer and Reuenthal prove that they are still an appealing pair of characters that can carry a story that's largely a forgone conclusion by this point. And the thematics remain well-aligned, both in terms of where this season's story will ultimately go (let's just say the discussion of a potential military tribunal is something of a dry run), as well as the overarching ideas that have always been part of LOGH. Sure, we already knew that Mittermeyer and Reuenthal were aligned with Reinhard's beliefs about the corruption at the heart of the royalty running the Empire at the time, but seeing them demonstrate those principles, against the kind of barbarous bastard who would cut open a woman's throat just to steal a ring, unflinchingly shows how these guys are the 'Heroes' of this story even on this side of the conflict (Also if that scene of him shooting the guy doesn't convince you that Mittermeyer rules, I don't think anything will). The procession of events fits with the always-present historical stylings of LOGH, demonstrating that things rarely happen in neat, contained arcs in reality; instead, it's often a sequence of interactions that lead to connections and changes that continuously occur through time. By the end of Episode 27, the implication is that each of the commanders Reinhard has assembled under him have as rich personal histories connecting them to the new Prime Minister as Mittermeyer and Reuenthal do, as if all of these galactic heroes have their own legends. Or something like that.    I'd also be remiss if I didn't comment on the stylizations this sequence of episodes takes us through. Production I.G's Legend of the Galactic Heroes has always had a fair bit of gloss on it, but these episodes go hard on some of the more colorful elements of the presentation: The contrasting palette on the flashback to Reuenthal's mommy issues, the striking orange of the sun over Mittermeyer's gunning down of the noble, or the brief flash of lightning illuminating the conversation with Reinhard and Sieg. It all does a good job of reminding you that, oh right, these episodes are part of a Capital-M Movie in their original release. Things still get a little rote at the end when we're being introduced to the rest of Reinhard's commanders and DNT does that thing where it just keeps naming dudes. That means that even in an extended flashback of questionable relevance to the primary story, LOGH is still LOGH, for better and for worse. It can almost make these episodes feel entirely like fanservice for the established viewers at this point, spending time presenting a polished piece about a pair of popular players. It's an interesting choice three seasons in, to be sure, but it's also hard to argue with the pure entertainment that results.

Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision Episodes 25-27  by Christopher Farris, Apr 16th 2022                   How would you rate episode 25 of Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision (movies) ?                     Community score: 4.5                  How would you rate episode 26 of Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision (movies) ?                     Community score: 4.1                  How would you rate episode 27 of Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision (movies) ?                     Community score: 4.1            My thoughts on the opening episode of Collision were covered back at  the beginning of the preview guide, but to summarize, I regarded it as effectively a thematic opener for this season, less connected to the dense plotting we all really keep coming back to Legend of the Galactic Heroes for. But that might turn out to be a harbinger of the more roundabout approach to storytelling this season might overall be taking, as the following pair of episodes aren't overly concerned with advancing any major battle plans on either side of the conflict either. Instead, they are about two specific dudes: Wolfgang Mittermeyer and Oskar von Reuenthal. If you're a fan of LOGH from its previous incarnations, then these two need no introduction, but if you're a newcomer, this duology serves as a pretty effective one.    Of course, Mittermeyer and Reuenthal have been around Die Neue These for a while at this point; it's just now that the show is deciding to detail exactly who these two are, and how they got so close with each other and so trusted with Reinhard.  As with the first episode's Julian-focused aside prologue, this pair of backstory-based episodes uses the flashbacks for Mittermeyer and Reuenthal as vectors for overall thematic worldbuilding in laying out what their deal is. As well, getting two episodes in a row about these guys shows early on that Collision might be less beholden to the previous seasons' rigid alternating Alliance/Empire story focus structure; that also makes sense, given that, as this season's title implies, the two sides will be more directly clashing again as it goes on, as opposed to the more isolated plots they were dealing with in the last batch.    All that's structural setup for the season as it goes on, however, with Episodes 26 and 27 rooted firmly in the past, and entirely on the Empire's side of things to boot. The initial recounting of the more personal circumstances of Mittermeyer and Reuenthal's contrasting upbringings are more about establishing the men personally before the past's plot-heavy stuff rears its head. Stuff like Mittermeyer's courtship with his eventual wife Evangelin is pretty basic (though his dad's little fist-pump as his son's proposal is accepted is a cute detail), while Reuenthal's drunken confession of his distrust of all women stemming from his problems with his mother is as comparatively melodramatic as you would expect from this series. Beyond the actual context of the content, these beats are mainly here to impart to us the trust in the bond these two men forged. Mittermeyer acknowledges the irrationality of Reuenthal's issues, sure, but you can't not be heartened at his no-hesitance response the morning after when his bro asks him to act like he didn't hear anything.    It's basically all flavor, but it at least makes for a properly engaging opener for a season that's seemingly going to be heavy on featuring these guys. It gets them out in front of the audience, and makes clear what their dynamic is and why it's supposed to be appealing. The next step is showing that dynamic in more of a story-based context, in this case via a plotline that got shuffled around compared to the previous LOGH anime: The Klopstock Incident. Doing this story as a flashback has a few advantages, like getting to see more of Sieg even after his death at the end of last season. But there is still a sense of the post-hoc about the placement here, since a large part of this story is showing earlier interactions between our main Imperial heroes with aristocratic characters like Braunschweig and Ansbach, who you'll remember from the Empire's civil war plot from last season. It's dotted with a lot of signs of how things will lead into that story, particularly the establishment of how Mittermeyer and Reuenthal wound up courting the animosity of this particular group. But given how all those rich jerks have since been killed and their whole story wrapped up, it can feel like a retroactive thematic inclusion to something that finished nearly three years ago, which isn't great as far as pertinent storytelling goes.    That said, as a piece of storytelling on its own, this is still a tight little flashback arc that expounds on the themes of LOGH while at least keeping the energy of the series up. Mittermeyer and Reuenthal prove that they are still an appealing pair of characters that can carry a story that's largely a forgone conclusion by this point. And the thematics remain well-aligned, both in terms of where this season's story will ultimately go (let's just say the discussion of a potential military tribunal is something of a dry run), as well as the overarching ideas that have always been part of LOGH. Sure, we already knew that Mittermeyer and Reuenthal were aligned with Reinhard's beliefs about the corruption at the heart of the royalty running the Empire at the time, but seeing them demonstrate those principles, against the kind of barbarous bastard who would cut open a woman's throat just to steal a ring, unflinchingly shows how these guys are the 'Heroes' of this story even on this side of the conflict (Also if that scene of him shooting the guy doesn't convince you that Mittermeyer rules, I don't think anything will). The procession of events fits with the always-present historical stylings of LOGH, demonstrating that things rarely happen in neat, contained arcs in reality; instead, it's often a sequence of interactions that lead to connections and changes that continuously occur through time. By the end of Episode 27, the implication is that each of the commanders Reinhard has assembled under him have as rich personal histories connecting them to the new Prime Minister as Mittermeyer and Reuenthal do, as if all of these galactic heroes have their own legends. Or something like that.    I'd also be remiss if I didn't comment on the stylizations this sequence of episodes takes us through. Production I.G's Legend of the Galactic Heroes has always had a fair bit of gloss on it, but these episodes go hard on some of the more colorful elements of the presentation: The contrasting palette on the flashback to Reuenthal's mommy issues, the striking orange of the sun over Mittermeyer's gunning down of the noble, or the brief flash of lightning illuminating the conversation with Reinhard and Sieg. It all does a good job of reminding you that, oh right, these episodes are part of a Capital-M Movie in their original release. Things still get a little rote at the end when we're being introduced to the rest of Reinhard's commanders and DNT does that thing where it just keeps naming dudes. That means that even in an extended flashback of questionable relevance to the primary story, LOGH is still LOGH, for better and for worse. It can almost make these episodes feel entirely like fanservice for the established viewers at this point, spending time presenting a polished piece about a pair of popular players. It's an interesting choice three seasons in, to be sure, but it's also hard to argue with the pure entertainment that results.

Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision Episodes 25-27  by Christopher Farris, Apr 16th 2022                   How would you rate episode 25 of Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision (movies) ?                     Community score: 4.5                  How would you rate episode 26 of Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision (movies) ?                     Community score: 4.1                  How would you rate episode 27 of Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision (movies) ?                     Community score: 4.1            My thoughts on the opening episode of Collision were covered back at  the beginning of the preview guide, but to summarize, I regarded it as effectively a thematic opener for this season, less connected to the dense plotting we all really keep coming back to Legend of the Galactic Heroes for. But that might turn out to be a harbinger of the more roundabout approach to storytelling this season might overall be taking, as the following pair of episodes aren't overly concerned with advancing any major battle plans on either side of the conflict either. Instead, they are about two specific dudes: Wolfgang Mittermeyer and Oskar von Reuenthal. If you're a fan of LOGH from its previous incarnations, then these two need no introduction, but if you're a newcomer, this duology serves as a pretty effective one.    Of course, Mittermeyer and Reuenthal have been around Die Neue These for a while at this point; it's just now that the show is deciding to detail exactly who these two are, and how they got so close with each other and so trusted with Reinhard.  As with the first episode's Julian-focused aside prologue, this pair of backstory-based episodes uses the flashbacks for Mittermeyer and Reuenthal as vectors for overall thematic worldbuilding in laying out what their deal is. As well, getting two episodes in a row about these guys shows early on that Collision might be less beholden to the previous seasons' rigid alternating Alliance/Empire story focus structure; that also makes sense, given that, as this season's title implies, the two sides will be more directly clashing again as it goes on, as opposed to the more isolated plots they were dealing with in the last batch.    All that's structural setup for the season as it goes on, however, with Episodes 26 and 27 rooted firmly in the past, and entirely on the Empire's side of things to boot. The initial recounting of the more personal circumstances of Mittermeyer and Reuenthal's contrasting upbringings are more about establishing the men personally before the past's plot-heavy stuff rears its head. Stuff like Mittermeyer's courtship with his eventual wife Evangelin is pretty basic (though his dad's little fist-pump as his son's proposal is accepted is a cute detail), while Reuenthal's drunken confession of his distrust of all women stemming from his problems with his mother is as comparatively melodramatic as you would expect from this series. Beyond the actual context of the content, these beats are mainly here to impart to us the trust in the bond these two men forged. Mittermeyer acknowledges the irrationality of Reuenthal's issues, sure, but you can't not be heartened at his no-hesitance response the morning after when his bro asks him to act like he didn't hear anything.    It's basically all flavor, but it at least makes for a properly engaging opener for a season that's seemingly going to be heavy on featuring these guys. It gets them out in front of the audience, and makes clear what their dynamic is and why it's supposed to be appealing. The next step is showing that dynamic in more of a story-based context, in this case via a plotline that got shuffled around compared to the previous LOGH anime: The Klopstock Incident. Doing this story as a flashback has a few advantages, like getting to see more of Sieg even after his death at the end of last season. But there is still a sense of the post-hoc about the placement here, since a large part of this story is showing earlier interactions between our main Imperial heroes with aristocratic characters like Braunschweig and Ansbach, who you'll remember from the Empire's civil war plot from last season. It's dotted with a lot of signs of how things will lead into that story, particularly the establishment of how Mittermeyer and Reuenthal wound up courting the animosity of this particular group. But given how all those rich jerks have since been killed and their whole story wrapped up, it can feel like a retroactive thematic inclusion to something that finished nearly three years ago, which isn't great as far as pertinent storytelling goes.    That said, as a piece of storytelling on its own, this is still a tight little flashback arc that expounds on the themes of LOGH while at least keeping the energy of the series up. Mittermeyer and Reuenthal prove that they are still an appealing pair of characters that can carry a story that's largely a forgone conclusion by this point. And the thematics remain well-aligned, both in terms of where this season's story will ultimately go (let's just say the discussion of a potential military tribunal is something of a dry run), as well as the overarching ideas that have always been part of LOGH. Sure, we already knew that Mittermeyer and Reuenthal were aligned with Reinhard's beliefs about the corruption at the heart of the royalty running the Empire at the time, but seeing them demonstrate those principles, against the kind of barbarous bastard who would cut open a woman's throat just to steal a ring, unflinchingly shows how these guys are the 'Heroes' of this story even on this side of the conflict (Also if that scene of him shooting the guy doesn't convince you that Mittermeyer rules, I don't think anything will). The procession of events fits with the always-present historical stylings of LOGH, demonstrating that things rarely happen in neat, contained arcs in reality; instead, it's often a sequence of interactions that lead to connections and changes that continuously occur through time. By the end of Episode 27, the implication is that each of the commanders Reinhard has assembled under him have as rich personal histories connecting them to the new Prime Minister as Mittermeyer and Reuenthal do, as if all of these galactic heroes have their own legends. Or something like that.    I'd also be remiss if I didn't comment on the stylizations this sequence of episodes takes us through. Production I.G's Legend of the Galactic Heroes has always had a fair bit of gloss on it, but these episodes go hard on some of the more colorful elements of the presentation: The contrasting palette on the flashback to Reuenthal's mommy issues, the striking orange of the sun over Mittermeyer's gunning down of the noble, or the brief flash of lightning illuminating the conversation with Reinhard and Sieg. It all does a good job of reminding you that, oh right, these episodes are part of a Capital-M Movie in their original release. Things still get a little rote at the end when we're being introduced to the rest of Reinhard's commanders and DNT does that thing where it just keeps naming dudes. That means that even in an extended flashback of questionable relevance to the primary story, LOGH is still LOGH, for better and for worse. It can almost make these episodes feel entirely like fanservice for the established viewers at this point, spending time presenting a polished piece about a pair of popular players. It's an interesting choice three seasons in, to be sure, but it's also hard to argue with the pure entertainment that results.
