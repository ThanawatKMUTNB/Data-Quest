The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Rising of The Shield Hero Season 2   Apr  7th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Rising of The Shield Hero Season 2 ?                     Community score: 3.9              What is this?   No sooner has Naofumi settled into his role as the new ruler of Raphtalia's village, that they're beset by an attack from a horde of bat monsters! The timer for the Waves is mysteriously stalled, and a meeting with the other Cardinal Heroes and the Queen reveals the rising of a new threat: The 'Spirit Tortoise' is bringing potential ruin with it, and with the other Heroes opting out of doing anything about it, things naturally fall to Naofumi to take care of things. With new ally (and new slave) Rishia in tow, the Shield Hero's party heads for the Spirit Tortoise Kingdom in order to save the world once again.    The Rising of The Shield Hero Season 2 is based on Aneko Yusagi's novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Wednesdays.      How was the first episode?  Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               When last we left off, Naofumi and the others were struggling with the revelation that they were involved in a battle between worlds rather than a simple monster invasion. However, all this is put to the side as a new threat arises, the Spirit Tortoise, whose arrival mysteriously puts a stop to the Waves for the time being.    When it comes down to it, this episode is really only concerned with one thing: exposition. Though we do get two quick action scenes, the thrust of the episode is about establishing the status quo for the arc—i.e., the threat of the turtle—while reminding us of important plot points from the previous season.    Luckily, this is done largely through character building. We see that Naofumi is far from the aggrieved man he was for much of the first season. Becoming the lord of Raphtalia's hometown has tied him irrevocably to the kingdom. While the other heroes still see the fantasy world as a game, to Naofumi it has become his true life filled with things he is driven to protect.    We also spend a lot of time developing Rishia, the newest member of Naofumi's party. She's a young woman in turmoil—in love with a man who has rejected her even though she is dying to be useful to him. But in her, there is potential, though Naofumi and his friends are unsure how to bring it out and what form it will ultimately take. She is an inherently tragic character but through Naofumi's party, it looks like she will be able to become the person she was meant to be. If nothing else, her earnestness makes her easy to root for.    All in all, while this is one of the weaker episodes, it does its job setting up the next arc well enough and gives us some solid character development to boot. Hopefully, things will pick up a bit next episode.      How was the first episode?  Christopher Farris  Rating:               There's the possibility that kicking off a second season of The Rising of the Shield Hero could be a boon for the series. There's a clean break to all the consternation and baggage that fueled the original outing: most of the foundation built on Naofumi's persecution  has cleared up. However, not content with just the one demihuman slave, he now gets to be the ruler of a whole village of demihumans. The world is still besieged by regular monster attacks, which is also now subject to hero-assassination attempts from other worlds. So of course, some new issue inevitably gets foisted into the plot for Naofumi and crew.    There's definitely the sense of a plot-necessity swerve in the development of this premiere episode. The driving force of the entire story of the first season, the Waves, quite literally gets put on pause so the Queen can impart the new issue of a 'Spirit Tortoise' that we haven't heard of before but we're assured is every bit as much a major disaster. It certainly means the episode gets going quickly; we hardly have any time for the sort of reestablishing elements with Naofumi in the demihuman village before suddenly they're beset by random bat monsters brought by the ascension of the evil Turtle Pope. But it also means that parts of the story get back to too-perfunctory Business As Usual for Shield Hero. The other Cardinal Heroes, apparently having learned nothing from the climax of the previous adventure, are still acting like callous jerks to Naofumi and friends, and shrugging off needing to actually do anything about the Spirit Tortoise under the auspices that it's not their job.    So even though Naofumi has more predisposition to help with the situation, the storytelling still oddly proceeds with that sense of begrudgement we're just supposed to expect around him in this story. It's almost unintentionally hilarious, the way both the Queen and later Fitoria act like they need to convince Naofumi to take care of the Spirit Tortoise under duress, despite him immediately agreeing to do so. I know that this sort of disagreeable tone is part-and-parcel to the darker, nihilistic angle of appeal Shield Hero is trying to present in its fantasy world, but it just comes off needlessly enforced when its main character character has no reason to act like the world's against him anymore .    That said, the slack of the struggle in Shield-land is instead picked up in this premiere by Rishia, who ends up with what could be considered the emotional core of this episode. Her persecution by her former party with the Bow Hero definitely reflects Naofumi's own story, to where you can almost hear the author going ""See, I can write a woman who gets put upon and mistreated for unfair reasons too! It's equality!"" Of course the major difference is that when Naofumi was at his lowest point, he was forced to buy a slave, while as Rishia finds herself struggling she is convinced to become a slave and aaaaaawwwwww Christ.    Look, I don't need to get into the weeds on this, we had half a year of slavery discourse with the first Shield Hero season. But it must be said that it comes off as downright undermining that the show ever portrayed the slave trade as this dark, seedy element its hero could turn to out of desperation, when at this point it's mostly just an odd mechanic characters can submit themselves to for in-story power-up convenience and lip service to a fetish that isn't even portrayed half as entertainingly as in other series like How NOT to Summon a Demon Lord. That is to say, Rishia agreeing to become Naofumi's slave for a time doesn't prompt aghast reactions of offense, it simply comes off as eyeroll-worthy.    Regardless, Shield Hero's second season has at least started with plenty of momentum to it, even if some of the new story elements come off like ham-fisted hard-turns. But this is a show that worked better the more it expanded its world-building anyway, so maybe figuring out what the deal with this Spirit Tortoise actually is or seeing how Rishia's development along the way plays out will be to its benefit. The fights we get in this episode featuring our heroes slaughtering their way through Countries both Bat and Donkey Kong are decent, concentrated bursts of action (there's a little bit of shaky CGI, but you know I always love seeing Filo fight in her big, puffy, bird form), and you know Kevin Penkin's score is still pulling its weight. It's the beginning of a second season that seems to be justifying its existence, with all the caveats from however you felt about the original's existence in the first place.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          2 comments       Akari Akase's Ending Theme Song for My Dress-Up Darling Anime Streamed 7 Million Times   Apr 16, 13:35 2 comments                 music    Music video debuted on January 9 ― The music video for Akari Akase's ""Koi no Yukue"" (Where Love Is), the ending theme song for the television anime of Shinichi Fukuda's My Dress-Up Darling (Sono Bisque Doll wa Koi wo Suru), has been streamed over seven million times since its release about three months ago.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Rising of The Shield Hero Season 2   Apr  7th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Rising of The Shield Hero Season 2 ?                     Community score: 3.9              What is this?   No sooner has Naofumi settled into his role as the new ruler of Raphtalia's village, that they're beset by an attack from a horde of bat monsters! The timer for the Waves is mysteriously stalled, and a meeting with the other Cardinal Heroes and the Queen reveals the rising of a new threat: The 'Spirit Tortoise' is bringing potential ruin with it, and with the other Heroes opting out of doing anything about it, things naturally fall to Naofumi to take care of things. With new ally (and new slave) Rishia in tow, the Shield Hero's party heads for the Spirit Tortoise Kingdom in order to save the world once again.    The Rising of The Shield Hero Season 2 is based on Aneko Yusagi's novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Wednesdays.      How was the first episode?  Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               When last we left off, Naofumi and the others were struggling with the revelation that they were involved in a battle between worlds rather than a simple monster invasion. However, all this is put to the side as a new threat arises, the Spirit Tortoise, whose arrival mysteriously puts a stop to the Waves for the time being.    When it comes down to it, this episode is really only concerned with one thing: exposition. Though we do get two quick action scenes, the thrust of the episode is about establishing the status quo for the arc—i.e., the threat of the turtle—while reminding us of important plot points from the previous season.    Luckily, this is done largely through character building. We see that Naofumi is far from the aggrieved man he was for much of the first season. Becoming the lord of Raphtalia's hometown has tied him irrevocably to the kingdom. While the other heroes still see the fantasy world as a game, to Naofumi it has become his true life filled with things he is driven to protect.    We also spend a lot of time developing Rishia, the newest member of Naofumi's party. She's a young woman in turmoil—in love with a man who has rejected her even though she is dying to be useful to him. But in her, there is potential, though Naofumi and his friends are unsure how to bring it out and what form it will ultimately take. She is an inherently tragic character but through Naofumi's party, it looks like she will be able to become the person she was meant to be. If nothing else, her earnestness makes her easy to root for.    All in all, while this is one of the weaker episodes, it does its job setting up the next arc well enough and gives us some solid character development to boot. Hopefully, things will pick up a bit next episode.      How was the first episode?  Christopher Farris  Rating:               There's the possibility that kicking off a second season of The Rising of the Shield Hero could be a boon for the series. There's a clean break to all the consternation and baggage that fueled the original outing: most of the foundation built on Naofumi's persecution  has cleared up. However, not content with just the one demihuman slave, he now gets to be the ruler of a whole village of demihumans. The world is still besieged by regular monster attacks, which is also now subject to hero-assassination attempts from other worlds. So of course, some new issue inevitably gets foisted into the plot for Naofumi and crew.    There's definitely the sense of a plot-necessity swerve in the development of this premiere episode. The driving force of the entire story of the first season, the Waves, quite literally gets put on pause so the Queen can impart the new issue of a 'Spirit Tortoise' that we haven't heard of before but we're assured is every bit as much a major disaster. It certainly means the episode gets going quickly; we hardly have any time for the sort of reestablishing elements with Naofumi in the demihuman village before suddenly they're beset by random bat monsters brought by the ascension of the evil Turtle Pope. But it also means that parts of the story get back to too-perfunctory Business As Usual for Shield Hero. The other Cardinal Heroes, apparently having learned nothing from the climax of the previous adventure, are still acting like callous jerks to Naofumi and friends, and shrugging off needing to actually do anything about the Spirit Tortoise under the auspices that it's not their job.    So even though Naofumi has more predisposition to help with the situation, the storytelling still oddly proceeds with that sense of begrudgement we're just supposed to expect around him in this story. It's almost unintentionally hilarious, the way both the Queen and later Fitoria act like they need to convince Naofumi to take care of the Spirit Tortoise under duress, despite him immediately agreeing to do so. I know that this sort of disagreeable tone is part-and-parcel to the darker, nihilistic angle of appeal Shield Hero is trying to present in its fantasy world, but it just comes off needlessly enforced when its main character character has no reason to act like the world's against him anymore .    That said, the slack of the struggle in Shield-land is instead picked up in this premiere by Rishia, who ends up with what could be considered the emotional core of this episode. Her persecution by her former party with the Bow Hero definitely reflects Naofumi's own story, to where you can almost hear the author going ""See, I can write a woman who gets put upon and mistreated for unfair reasons too! It's equality!"" Of course the major difference is that when Naofumi was at his lowest point, he was forced to buy a slave, while as Rishia finds herself struggling she is convinced to become a slave and aaaaaawwwwww Christ.    Look, I don't need to get into the weeds on this, we had half a year of slavery discourse with the first Shield Hero season. But it must be said that it comes off as downright undermining that the show ever portrayed the slave trade as this dark, seedy element its hero could turn to out of desperation, when at this point it's mostly just an odd mechanic characters can submit themselves to for in-story power-up convenience and lip service to a fetish that isn't even portrayed half as entertainingly as in other series like How NOT to Summon a Demon Lord. That is to say, Rishia agreeing to become Naofumi's slave for a time doesn't prompt aghast reactions of offense, it simply comes off as eyeroll-worthy.    Regardless, Shield Hero's second season has at least started with plenty of momentum to it, even if some of the new story elements come off like ham-fisted hard-turns. But this is a show that worked better the more it expanded its world-building anyway, so maybe figuring out what the deal with this Spirit Tortoise actually is or seeing how Rishia's development along the way plays out will be to its benefit. The fights we get in this episode featuring our heroes slaughtering their way through Countries both Bat and Donkey Kong are decent, concentrated bursts of action (there's a little bit of shaky CGI, but you know I always love seeing Filo fight in her big, puffy, bird form), and you know Kevin Penkin's score is still pulling its weight. It's the beginning of a second season that seems to be justifying its existence, with all the caveats from however you felt about the original's existence in the first place.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          2 comments       Akari Akase's Ending Theme Song for My Dress-Up Darling Anime Streamed 7 Million Times   Apr 16, 13:35 2 comments                 music    Music video debuted on January 9 ― The music video for Akari Akase's ""Koi no Yukue"" (Where Love Is), the ending theme song for the television anime of Shinichi Fukuda's My Dress-Up Darling (Sono Bisque Doll wa Koi wo Suru), has been streamed over seven million times since its release about three months ago.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Rising of The Shield Hero Season 2   Apr  7th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Rising of The Shield Hero Season 2 ?                     Community score: 3.9              What is this?   No sooner has Naofumi settled into his role as the new ruler of Raphtalia's village, that they're beset by an attack from a horde of bat monsters! The timer for the Waves is mysteriously stalled, and a meeting with the other Cardinal Heroes and the Queen reveals the rising of a new threat: The 'Spirit Tortoise' is bringing potential ruin with it, and with the other Heroes opting out of doing anything about it, things naturally fall to Naofumi to take care of things. With new ally (and new slave) Rishia in tow, the Shield Hero's party heads for the Spirit Tortoise Kingdom in order to save the world once again.    The Rising of The Shield Hero Season 2 is based on Aneko Yusagi's novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Wednesdays.      How was the first episode?  Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               When last we left off, Naofumi and the others were struggling with the revelation that they were involved in a battle between worlds rather than a simple monster invasion. However, all this is put to the side as a new threat arises, the Spirit Tortoise, whose arrival mysteriously puts a stop to the Waves for the time being.    When it comes down to it, this episode is really only concerned with one thing: exposition. Though we do get two quick action scenes, the thrust of the episode is about establishing the status quo for the arc—i.e., the threat of the turtle—while reminding us of important plot points from the previous season.    Luckily, this is done largely through character building. We see that Naofumi is far from the aggrieved man he was for much of the first season. Becoming the lord of Raphtalia's hometown has tied him irrevocably to the kingdom. While the other heroes still see the fantasy world as a game, to Naofumi it has become his true life filled with things he is driven to protect.    We also spend a lot of time developing Rishia, the newest member of Naofumi's party. She's a young woman in turmoil—in love with a man who has rejected her even though she is dying to be useful to him. But in her, there is potential, though Naofumi and his friends are unsure how to bring it out and what form it will ultimately take. She is an inherently tragic character but through Naofumi's party, it looks like she will be able to become the person she was meant to be. If nothing else, her earnestness makes her easy to root for.    All in all, while this is one of the weaker episodes, it does its job setting up the next arc well enough and gives us some solid character development to boot. Hopefully, things will pick up a bit next episode.      How was the first episode?  Christopher Farris  Rating:               There's the possibility that kicking off a second season of The Rising of the Shield Hero could be a boon for the series. There's a clean break to all the consternation and baggage that fueled the original outing: most of the foundation built on Naofumi's persecution  has cleared up. However, not content with just the one demihuman slave, he now gets to be the ruler of a whole village of demihumans. The world is still besieged by regular monster attacks, which is also now subject to hero-assassination attempts from other worlds. So of course, some new issue inevitably gets foisted into the plot for Naofumi and crew.    There's definitely the sense of a plot-necessity swerve in the development of this premiere episode. The driving force of the entire story of the first season, the Waves, quite literally gets put on pause so the Queen can impart the new issue of a 'Spirit Tortoise' that we haven't heard of before but we're assured is every bit as much a major disaster. It certainly means the episode gets going quickly; we hardly have any time for the sort of reestablishing elements with Naofumi in the demihuman village before suddenly they're beset by random bat monsters brought by the ascension of the evil Turtle Pope. But it also means that parts of the story get back to too-perfunctory Business As Usual for Shield Hero. The other Cardinal Heroes, apparently having learned nothing from the climax of the previous adventure, are still acting like callous jerks to Naofumi and friends, and shrugging off needing to actually do anything about the Spirit Tortoise under the auspices that it's not their job.    So even though Naofumi has more predisposition to help with the situation, the storytelling still oddly proceeds with that sense of begrudgement we're just supposed to expect around him in this story. It's almost unintentionally hilarious, the way both the Queen and later Fitoria act like they need to convince Naofumi to take care of the Spirit Tortoise under duress, despite him immediately agreeing to do so. I know that this sort of disagreeable tone is part-and-parcel to the darker, nihilistic angle of appeal Shield Hero is trying to present in its fantasy world, but it just comes off needlessly enforced when its main character character has no reason to act like the world's against him anymore .    That said, the slack of the struggle in Shield-land is instead picked up in this premiere by Rishia, who ends up with what could be considered the emotional core of this episode. Her persecution by her former party with the Bow Hero definitely reflects Naofumi's own story, to where you can almost hear the author going ""See, I can write a woman who gets put upon and mistreated for unfair reasons too! It's equality!"" Of course the major difference is that when Naofumi was at his lowest point, he was forced to buy a slave, while as Rishia finds herself struggling she is convinced to become a slave and aaaaaawwwwww Christ.    Look, I don't need to get into the weeds on this, we had half a year of slavery discourse with the first Shield Hero season. But it must be said that it comes off as downright undermining that the show ever portrayed the slave trade as this dark, seedy element its hero could turn to out of desperation, when at this point it's mostly just an odd mechanic characters can submit themselves to for in-story power-up convenience and lip service to a fetish that isn't even portrayed half as entertainingly as in other series like How NOT to Summon a Demon Lord. That is to say, Rishia agreeing to become Naofumi's slave for a time doesn't prompt aghast reactions of offense, it simply comes off as eyeroll-worthy.    Regardless, Shield Hero's second season has at least started with plenty of momentum to it, even if some of the new story elements come off like ham-fisted hard-turns. But this is a show that worked better the more it expanded its world-building anyway, so maybe figuring out what the deal with this Spirit Tortoise actually is or seeing how Rishia's development along the way plays out will be to its benefit. The fights we get in this episode featuring our heroes slaughtering their way through Countries both Bat and Donkey Kong are decent, concentrated bursts of action (there's a little bit of shaky CGI, but you know I always love seeing Filo fight in her big, puffy, bird form), and you know Kevin Penkin's score is still pulling its weight. It's the beginning of a second season that seems to be justifying its existence, with all the caveats from however you felt about the original's existence in the first place.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          2 comments       Akari Akase's Ending Theme Song for My Dress-Up Darling Anime Streamed 7 Million Times   Apr 16, 13:35 2 comments                 music    Music video debuted on January 9 ― The music video for Akari Akase's ""Koi no Yukue"" (Where Love Is), the ending theme song for the television anime of Shinichi Fukuda's My Dress-Up Darling (Sono Bisque Doll wa Koi wo Suru), has been streamed over seven million times since its release about three months ago.

When it comes down to it, this episode is really only concerned with one thing: exposition. Though we do get two quick action scenes, the thrust of the episode is about establishing the status quo for the arc—i.e., the threat of the turtle—while reminding us of important plot points from the previous season.    Luckily, this is done largely through character building. We see that Naofumi is far from the aggrieved man he was for much of the first season. Becoming the lord of Raphtalia's hometown has tied him irrevocably to the kingdom. While the other heroes still see the fantasy world as a game, to Naofumi it has become his true life filled with things he is driven to protect.    We also spend a lot of time developing Rishia, the newest member of Naofumi's party. She's a young woman in turmoil—in love with a man who has rejected her even though she is dying to be useful to him. But in her, there is potential, though Naofumi and his friends are unsure how to bring it out and what form it will ultimately take. She is an inherently tragic character but through Naofumi's party, it looks like she will be able to become the person she was meant to be. If nothing else, her earnestness makes her easy to root for.    All in all, while this is one of the weaker episodes, it does its job setting up the next arc well enough and gives us some solid character development to boot. Hopefully, things will pick up a bit next episode.      How was the first episode?  Christopher Farris  Rating:               There's the possibility that kicking off a second season of The Rising of the Shield Hero could be a boon for the series. There's a clean break to all the consternation and baggage that fueled the original outing: most of the foundation built on Naofumi's persecution  has cleared up. However, not content with just the one demihuman slave, he now gets to be the ruler of a whole village of demihumans. The world is still besieged by regular monster attacks, which is also now subject to hero-assassination attempts from other worlds. So of course, some new issue inevitably gets foisted into the plot for Naofumi and crew.    There's definitely the sense of a plot-necessity swerve in the development of this premiere episode. The driving force of the entire story of the first season, the Waves, quite literally gets put on pause so the Queen can impart the new issue of a 'Spirit Tortoise' that we haven't heard of before but we're assured is every bit as much a major disaster. It certainly means the episode gets going quickly; we hardly have any time for the sort of reestablishing elements with Naofumi in the demihuman village before suddenly they're beset by random bat monsters brought by the ascension of the evil Turtle Pope. But it also means that parts of the story get back to too-perfunctory Business As Usual for Shield Hero. The other Cardinal Heroes, apparently having learned nothing from the climax of the previous adventure, are still acting like callous jerks to Naofumi and friends, and shrugging off needing to actually do anything about the Spirit Tortoise under the auspices that it's not their job.    So even though Naofumi has more predisposition to help with the situation, the storytelling still oddly proceeds with that sense of begrudgement we're just supposed to expect around him in this story. It's almost unintentionally hilarious, the way both the Queen and later Fitoria act like they need to convince Naofumi to take care of the Spirit Tortoise under duress, despite him immediately agreeing to do so. I know that this sort of disagreeable tone is part-and-parcel to the darker, nihilistic angle of appeal Shield Hero is trying to present in its fantasy world, but it just comes off needlessly enforced when its main character character has no reason to act like the world's against him anymore .    That said, the slack of the struggle in Shield-land is instead picked up in this premiere by Rishia, who ends up with what could be considered the emotional core of this episode. Her persecution by her former party with the Bow Hero definitely reflects Naofumi's own story, to where you can almost hear the author going ""See, I can write a woman who gets put upon and mistreated for unfair reasons too! It's equality!"" Of course the major difference is that when Naofumi was at his lowest point, he was forced to buy a slave, while as Rishia finds herself struggling she is convinced to become a slave and aaaaaawwwwww Christ.    Look, I don't need to get into the weeds on this, we had half a year of slavery discourse with the first Shield Hero season. But it must be said that it comes off as downright undermining that the show ever portrayed the slave trade as this dark, seedy element its hero could turn to out of desperation, when at this point it's mostly just an odd mechanic characters can submit themselves to for in-story power-up convenience and lip service to a fetish that isn't even portrayed half as entertainingly as in other series like How NOT to Summon a Demon Lord. That is to say, Rishia agreeing to become Naofumi's slave for a time doesn't prompt aghast reactions of offense, it simply comes off as eyeroll-worthy.    Regardless, Shield Hero's second season has at least started with plenty of momentum to it, even if some of the new story elements come off like ham-fisted hard-turns. But this is a show that worked better the more it expanded its world-building anyway, so maybe figuring out what the deal with this Spirit Tortoise actually is or seeing how Rishia's development along the way plays out will be to its benefit. The fights we get in this episode featuring our heroes slaughtering their way through Countries both Bat and Donkey Kong are decent, concentrated bursts of action (there's a little bit of shaky CGI, but you know I always love seeing Filo fight in her big, puffy, bird form), and you know Kevin Penkin's score is still pulling its weight. It's the beginning of a second season that seems to be justifying its existence, with all the caveats from however you felt about the original's existence in the first place.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          2 comments       Akari Akase's Ending Theme Song for My Dress-Up Darling Anime Streamed 7 Million Times   Apr 16, 13:35 2 comments                 music    Music video debuted on January 9 ― The music video for Akari Akase's ""Koi no Yukue"" (Where Love Is), the ending theme song for the television anime of Shinichi Fukuda's My Dress-Up Darling (Sono Bisque Doll wa Koi wo Suru), has been streamed over seven million times since its release about three months ago.

Konosuba: God's Blessing on this Wonderful World! TRPG is published by Yen Press.      Review:            Ah, finally a review that leans into both my lifelong hobbies: anime and tabletop RPGs (or TRPGs in short). I'm always curious to see what happens when the two worlds entwine, but beyond my personal interest, this being an official English release of a Japanese TRPG already makes it worth checking out on its own. Though it's pretty common for video games from other languages/regions to receive official English translations, the same cannot be said of tabletop games. Japanese language TRPGs with official English releases are few and far between – with Tenra Bansho Zero's 2013 Kickstarter likely being the most prominent example. So I was excited to pick this up if for no other reason than to encourage future translations of tabletop titles (fingers crossed for a release of Sword World one of these days...).    I won't go too in-depth into KONOSUBA as I'm sure most reading this are already quite familiar with the series. But in brief, KONOSUBA is a story about a young man named Kazuma Sato who dies and is reincarnated into an alternate fantasy world. Forming a party with the goddess Aqua, the wizard Megumin, and the crusader Darkness, Kazuma and Co. embark on quests, fight giant monsters, and generally get into wacky situations. It's an action-comedy romp that revels in the tropes of many modern RPG games, which of course makes TRPG a natural fit.    In terms of gameplay, this TRPG boasts a very straightforward system. Most actions are resolved by rolling 2d6 and adding them together, usually with a modifier based on an attribute. You try to meet or beat a target number against passive opposition (such as picking a lock or trying to listen through a wall) or try to beat an opposed roll against active opposition (such as trying to attack an opponent). Additional d6s can be added to the pool via abilities – most commonly the expenditure of Blessings, the game's Luck mechanic – and they are also added to the total. If any two dice show 6s that makes for a critical (regardless of how many dice were rolled), and you get a fumble if all the dice show 1s. This makes spending Blessings a way to fish for criticals and lower chances of fumbles at the same time. The use of d6s rather than d20s and other polyhedral dice may shock some readers since the d20 is almost synonymous with the hobby, but it is not completely unheard of, and the ""odd"" polyhedral dice can be expensive to purchase and difficult to find in regions outside the US. 2d6 rolls also tend to be more forgiving and consistent compared to the d20 which is notoriously ""swingy"" in turns of the table feel.    Characters are defined by their race, class, and origin. This is likely a familiar framework if you have any experience with other fantasy TRPGs, but there are some fun twists here. First of all, while the way race is handled can be a thorny issue in many RPGs, I like the KONOSUBA TRPG's approach. The three races presented are Reincarnated Person, Native Inhabitant, and Crimson Magic Clan. It's simple and functional, allowing for some variety in character creation while largely avoiding some of the more negative tropes associated with race in RPGs.    Classes are largely what you would expect. There are warriors, thieves, wizards, and the like, as well as advanced classes that can be taken down the road as your character levels up. Classes are defined by the list of Skills that they can take, which are less similar to skills in games like D&D (which are usually modifiers to certain in-world mundane actions, like Stealth or Athletics) and more analogous to what would be considered powers or spells. The KONOSUBA TRPG's skills can range from a wizard's fireball to a priest's healing to a warrior covering a friend from damage; like its source material, the skill system is clearly inspired by MMORPGs which often gives all classes a suite of powers that operate more or less in the same space. Each Skill is a discreet little block of text, much like a spell list might be in other games, with listed timing for when to use it, effects, cost in mana or MP, etc. In this way it is actually somewhat similar to the 4th edition of D&D, which was also criticized of being too MMO-like (though, for my money, it was also a terrific game).    Origins, Blessings, and Cheats round out the player characters. Origins are basically simple story-bits that help you find out how you got to where you are and what your long-term goal might be. Blessings are essentially a fate or reroll mechanic, where you have a pool of extra dice to add to rolls (or you can spend them to reroll checks entirely). Cheats are a special optional rule that have lots of tantalizing benefits and drawbacks that can be quite flavorful, but the game makes it clear that those wanting a more grounded experience might not want to use them as they can break things wide open. Personally, I found the Cheats quite charming and in line with the flavor of the show, and while the game can be played without them, I imagine most fans of the series will want to use them.    Combat is pretty straightforward and obviously where the meat of the rules are focused. Characters act in order of initiative based on Action Points (which is a flat initiative value and not, in fact, a pool of points that are spent). They get a move, minor, and major action, which are spent for the round once they act. Distances are abstracted and measured in ""engagements"" similar to zones from other games. Characters who are close to one another are in an Engagement and generally feels similar to most fantasy TRPGs that have concepts like attacks of opportunity, zones of control, etc. Other RPG strategies like taking cover, taking hits for other party members, or allowing warriors to tank and pull aggro are also implemented. If you've played any fantasy RPG of the past few decades you'll likely feel right at home with the basics.    As such, the KONOSUBA TRPG is largely what I would consider a traditional tabletop game, heavily leaning into the gamist and simulationist spaces of game design. There is not a whole lot in the way of manipulation of narrative beyond Blessings and Cheats, and players familiar with RPGs (of tabletop or video game variety) will probably feel right at home. It also lacks a lot of the overt story-centric focus of games like Fate, Powered by the Apocalypse titles, or Forged in the Dark games. It's a small, light, comfortable little game.    But that's not to say it isn't without its fun flourishes. For example, when handing out XP at the end of a session, even the gamemaster earns experience points. This is then applied to whatever characters the gamemaster has, with the understanding that in future sessions someone else will run and they will get to play their character who has been quietly leveling up in the background. The implication is that there will be some rotation of GM-ing responsibilities within the same campaign; not completely unheard of, but certainly not the norm at most tables I have been at. Still, I like that this is baked into the core rules and there's a sense that even the GM is making progress week to week, something which is often left out of most games.    This translates to the reading of the book as well. The game is north of 300 pages; it is an easy, digest-sized read jam-packed with an example adventure, plenty of pre-made adventure hooks, a touch of background information, full monster bestiary and trap list, gamemastering advice, and more. That said, there are some elements which may cause hang-ups, most prominently the opening replay. A replay – also known as an actual play – serves as the opener to the book, where we get a detailed account of a game session featuring guest star player characters. This group includes Natsumi Akatsuki, the creator of the original light novel series. We get detailed writeups on each of the characters, full custom art for them, and the full transcription of their adventure. While most modern TRPGs include a few pages of example text from a session to give a sense of the tempo of the game, these tend to be brief. In KONOSUBA's case, however, we get a complete session that comprises 80+ pages; in other words, 25% of the book is dedicated to someone else's session, and while players new to TRPG may appreciate such an inclusion, I'm not sure it's worth the space it takes up (especially when recordings of real play sessions are easily accessible online).    There are also a few readability issues to note. First off, the book is very affordable but that comes at the expense of production value. It is priced and formatted like a manga or light novel release in paperback – there are a few color pages early on, but it is largely black and white print on middling quality paper. The layout and usability is also a bit of a mess. While everything flows pretty logically as you read, it is very difficult to reference concepts. In making a character and testing the mechanics I found myself flipping around the book constantly, and while there are some reference sheets, just remembering where everything is placed in the book can be a challenge. Then again, the book is cheap enough that you could probably grab multiple copies for your table and mark them up for easy reference.    I have to make a particular note about the digital version of the book, too. An affordable pdf version is available on BookWalker (roughly $8.00 USD at the time of this writing), but as with the physical release, the quality leaves much to be desired. For one, the scan at the time of this writing is atrocious. It's so low res that trying to zoom in even slightly on a mobile device will strain your eyes. Furthermore, there's no bookmarking or any of the other modern conveniences we've come to enjoy from modern TRPG pdf releases in recent years. Sure it is cheap, and looks fine on a regular monitor, but most players (in my experience) like to have a pdf on a phone or tablet in addition to a physical book at the table, which allows the to individually look up rules while someone else is using the physical book. Simply put, I don't think the pdf is legible for that use due to how low-quality the scan is at this time, and that makes its utility next to zero.    The issue of complexity is also one to mention. In my experience, lighter games are great for new players and/or shorter campaigns and one-shots. The more complex the game, the more support there tends to be for long-term play. The KONOSUBA TRPG has breadth for sure but not a terrible amount of depth, and the mechanics can feel repetitive after a few sessions. Certainly things like changing class or gaining an advanced class may keep things fresh, but I can easily see players falling into patterns of using the same skills over and over without much variety.    That said, simplicity lends to expandability, and many early, simple games like white box D&D flourished because people were constantly homebrewing new rules, spells, and ideas into the very basic framework the game provided. Any GM or player willing to put in a bit of time with the KONOSUBA TRPG could likely generate tons of new skills and abilities, or fun sub-systems for domain management, running a business, entirely new classes, and more. There's also plenty of design space to come up with creative uses for Blessings or new Cheats to create that much-needed variety long-term play often requires. And though it is a fairly generic fantasy RPG in most respects, that makes it very easy to port over adventures or ideas from the plethora of other fantasy games on the market.    Overall, this is a terrific little gem that I think will please most KONOSUBA fans. While it is a simple little game, I think that like its source material there is just enough charm to make it a fun experience for at least a few sessions – and with a bit of work, perhaps many more.

Konosuba: God's Blessing on this Wonderful World! TRPG is published by Yen Press.      Review:            Ah, finally a review that leans into both my lifelong hobbies: anime and tabletop RPGs (or TRPGs in short). I'm always curious to see what happens when the two worlds entwine, but beyond my personal interest, this being an official English release of a Japanese TRPG already makes it worth checking out on its own. Though it's pretty common for video games from other languages/regions to receive official English translations, the same cannot be said of tabletop games. Japanese language TRPGs with official English releases are few and far between – with Tenra Bansho Zero's 2013 Kickstarter likely being the most prominent example. So I was excited to pick this up if for no other reason than to encourage future translations of tabletop titles (fingers crossed for a release of Sword World one of these days...).    I won't go too in-depth into KONOSUBA as I'm sure most reading this are already quite familiar with the series. But in brief, KONOSUBA is a story about a young man named Kazuma Sato who dies and is reincarnated into an alternate fantasy world. Forming a party with the goddess Aqua, the wizard Megumin, and the crusader Darkness, Kazuma and Co. embark on quests, fight giant monsters, and generally get into wacky situations. It's an action-comedy romp that revels in the tropes of many modern RPG games, which of course makes TRPG a natural fit.    In terms of gameplay, this TRPG boasts a very straightforward system. Most actions are resolved by rolling 2d6 and adding them together, usually with a modifier based on an attribute. You try to meet or beat a target number against passive opposition (such as picking a lock or trying to listen through a wall) or try to beat an opposed roll against active opposition (such as trying to attack an opponent). Additional d6s can be added to the pool via abilities – most commonly the expenditure of Blessings, the game's Luck mechanic – and they are also added to the total. If any two dice show 6s that makes for a critical (regardless of how many dice were rolled), and you get a fumble if all the dice show 1s. This makes spending Blessings a way to fish for criticals and lower chances of fumbles at the same time. The use of d6s rather than d20s and other polyhedral dice may shock some readers since the d20 is almost synonymous with the hobby, but it is not completely unheard of, and the ""odd"" polyhedral dice can be expensive to purchase and difficult to find in regions outside the US. 2d6 rolls also tend to be more forgiving and consistent compared to the d20 which is notoriously ""swingy"" in turns of the table feel.    Characters are defined by their race, class, and origin. This is likely a familiar framework if you have any experience with other fantasy TRPGs, but there are some fun twists here. First of all, while the way race is handled can be a thorny issue in many RPGs, I like the KONOSUBA TRPG's approach. The three races presented are Reincarnated Person, Native Inhabitant, and Crimson Magic Clan. It's simple and functional, allowing for some variety in character creation while largely avoiding some of the more negative tropes associated with race in RPGs.    Classes are largely what you would expect. There are warriors, thieves, wizards, and the like, as well as advanced classes that can be taken down the road as your character levels up. Classes are defined by the list of Skills that they can take, which are less similar to skills in games like D&D (which are usually modifiers to certain in-world mundane actions, like Stealth or Athletics) and more analogous to what would be considered powers or spells. The KONOSUBA TRPG's skills can range from a wizard's fireball to a priest's healing to a warrior covering a friend from damage; like its source material, the skill system is clearly inspired by MMORPGs which often gives all classes a suite of powers that operate more or less in the same space. Each Skill is a discreet little block of text, much like a spell list might be in other games, with listed timing for when to use it, effects, cost in mana or MP, etc. In this way it is actually somewhat similar to the 4th edition of D&D, which was also criticized of being too MMO-like (though, for my money, it was also a terrific game).    Origins, Blessings, and Cheats round out the player characters. Origins are basically simple story-bits that help you find out how you got to where you are and what your long-term goal might be. Blessings are essentially a fate or reroll mechanic, where you have a pool of extra dice to add to rolls (or you can spend them to reroll checks entirely). Cheats are a special optional rule that have lots of tantalizing benefits and drawbacks that can be quite flavorful, but the game makes it clear that those wanting a more grounded experience might not want to use them as they can break things wide open. Personally, I found the Cheats quite charming and in line with the flavor of the show, and while the game can be played without them, I imagine most fans of the series will want to use them.    Combat is pretty straightforward and obviously where the meat of the rules are focused. Characters act in order of initiative based on Action Points (which is a flat initiative value and not, in fact, a pool of points that are spent). They get a move, minor, and major action, which are spent for the round once they act. Distances are abstracted and measured in ""engagements"" similar to zones from other games. Characters who are close to one another are in an Engagement and generally feels similar to most fantasy TRPGs that have concepts like attacks of opportunity, zones of control, etc. Other RPG strategies like taking cover, taking hits for other party members, or allowing warriors to tank and pull aggro are also implemented. If you've played any fantasy RPG of the past few decades you'll likely feel right at home with the basics.    As such, the KONOSUBA TRPG is largely what I would consider a traditional tabletop game, heavily leaning into the gamist and simulationist spaces of game design. There is not a whole lot in the way of manipulation of narrative beyond Blessings and Cheats, and players familiar with RPGs (of tabletop or video game variety) will probably feel right at home. It also lacks a lot of the overt story-centric focus of games like Fate, Powered by the Apocalypse titles, or Forged in the Dark games. It's a small, light, comfortable little game.    But that's not to say it isn't without its fun flourishes. For example, when handing out XP at the end of a session, even the gamemaster earns experience points. This is then applied to whatever characters the gamemaster has, with the understanding that in future sessions someone else will run and they will get to play their character who has been quietly leveling up in the background. The implication is that there will be some rotation of GM-ing responsibilities within the same campaign; not completely unheard of, but certainly not the norm at most tables I have been at. Still, I like that this is baked into the core rules and there's a sense that even the GM is making progress week to week, something which is often left out of most games.    This translates to the reading of the book as well. The game is north of 300 pages; it is an easy, digest-sized read jam-packed with an example adventure, plenty of pre-made adventure hooks, a touch of background information, full monster bestiary and trap list, gamemastering advice, and more. That said, there are some elements which may cause hang-ups, most prominently the opening replay. A replay – also known as an actual play – serves as the opener to the book, where we get a detailed account of a game session featuring guest star player characters. This group includes Natsumi Akatsuki, the creator of the original light novel series. We get detailed writeups on each of the characters, full custom art for them, and the full transcription of their adventure. While most modern TRPGs include a few pages of example text from a session to give a sense of the tempo of the game, these tend to be brief. In KONOSUBA's case, however, we get a complete session that comprises 80+ pages; in other words, 25% of the book is dedicated to someone else's session, and while players new to TRPG may appreciate such an inclusion, I'm not sure it's worth the space it takes up (especially when recordings of real play sessions are easily accessible online).    There are also a few readability issues to note. First off, the book is very affordable but that comes at the expense of production value. It is priced and formatted like a manga or light novel release in paperback – there are a few color pages early on, but it is largely black and white print on middling quality paper. The layout and usability is also a bit of a mess. While everything flows pretty logically as you read, it is very difficult to reference concepts. In making a character and testing the mechanics I found myself flipping around the book constantly, and while there are some reference sheets, just remembering where everything is placed in the book can be a challenge. Then again, the book is cheap enough that you could probably grab multiple copies for your table and mark them up for easy reference.    I have to make a particular note about the digital version of the book, too. An affordable pdf version is available on BookWalker (roughly $8.00 USD at the time of this writing), but as with the physical release, the quality leaves much to be desired. For one, the scan at the time of this writing is atrocious. It's so low res that trying to zoom in even slightly on a mobile device will strain your eyes. Furthermore, there's no bookmarking or any of the other modern conveniences we've come to enjoy from modern TRPG pdf releases in recent years. Sure it is cheap, and looks fine on a regular monitor, but most players (in my experience) like to have a pdf on a phone or tablet in addition to a physical book at the table, which allows the to individually look up rules while someone else is using the physical book. Simply put, I don't think the pdf is legible for that use due to how low-quality the scan is at this time, and that makes its utility next to zero.    The issue of complexity is also one to mention. In my experience, lighter games are great for new players and/or shorter campaigns and one-shots. The more complex the game, the more support there tends to be for long-term play. The KONOSUBA TRPG has breadth for sure but not a terrible amount of depth, and the mechanics can feel repetitive after a few sessions. Certainly things like changing class or gaining an advanced class may keep things fresh, but I can easily see players falling into patterns of using the same skills over and over without much variety.    That said, simplicity lends to expandability, and many early, simple games like white box D&D flourished because people were constantly homebrewing new rules, spells, and ideas into the very basic framework the game provided. Any GM or player willing to put in a bit of time with the KONOSUBA TRPG could likely generate tons of new skills and abilities, or fun sub-systems for domain management, running a business, entirely new classes, and more. There's also plenty of design space to come up with creative uses for Blessings or new Cheats to create that much-needed variety long-term play often requires. And though it is a fairly generic fantasy RPG in most respects, that makes it very easy to port over adventures or ideas from the plethora of other fantasy games on the market.    Overall, this is a terrific little gem that I think will please most KONOSUBA fans. While it is a simple little game, I think that like its source material there is just enough charm to make it a fun experience for at least a few sessions – and with a bit of work, perhaps many more.

Konosuba: God's Blessing on this Wonderful World! TRPG is published by Yen Press.      Review:            Ah, finally a review that leans into both my lifelong hobbies: anime and tabletop RPGs (or TRPGs in short). I'm always curious to see what happens when the two worlds entwine, but beyond my personal interest, this being an official English release of a Japanese TRPG already makes it worth checking out on its own. Though it's pretty common for video games from other languages/regions to receive official English translations, the same cannot be said of tabletop games. Japanese language TRPGs with official English releases are few and far between – with Tenra Bansho Zero's 2013 Kickstarter likely being the most prominent example. So I was excited to pick this up if for no other reason than to encourage future translations of tabletop titles (fingers crossed for a release of Sword World one of these days...).    I won't go too in-depth into KONOSUBA as I'm sure most reading this are already quite familiar with the series. But in brief, KONOSUBA is a story about a young man named Kazuma Sato who dies and is reincarnated into an alternate fantasy world. Forming a party with the goddess Aqua, the wizard Megumin, and the crusader Darkness, Kazuma and Co. embark on quests, fight giant monsters, and generally get into wacky situations. It's an action-comedy romp that revels in the tropes of many modern RPG games, which of course makes TRPG a natural fit.    In terms of gameplay, this TRPG boasts a very straightforward system. Most actions are resolved by rolling 2d6 and adding them together, usually with a modifier based on an attribute. You try to meet or beat a target number against passive opposition (such as picking a lock or trying to listen through a wall) or try to beat an opposed roll against active opposition (such as trying to attack an opponent). Additional d6s can be added to the pool via abilities – most commonly the expenditure of Blessings, the game's Luck mechanic – and they are also added to the total. If any two dice show 6s that makes for a critical (regardless of how many dice were rolled), and you get a fumble if all the dice show 1s. This makes spending Blessings a way to fish for criticals and lower chances of fumbles at the same time. The use of d6s rather than d20s and other polyhedral dice may shock some readers since the d20 is almost synonymous with the hobby, but it is not completely unheard of, and the ""odd"" polyhedral dice can be expensive to purchase and difficult to find in regions outside the US. 2d6 rolls also tend to be more forgiving and consistent compared to the d20 which is notoriously ""swingy"" in turns of the table feel.    Characters are defined by their race, class, and origin. This is likely a familiar framework if you have any experience with other fantasy TRPGs, but there are some fun twists here. First of all, while the way race is handled can be a thorny issue in many RPGs, I like the KONOSUBA TRPG's approach. The three races presented are Reincarnated Person, Native Inhabitant, and Crimson Magic Clan. It's simple and functional, allowing for some variety in character creation while largely avoiding some of the more negative tropes associated with race in RPGs.    Classes are largely what you would expect. There are warriors, thieves, wizards, and the like, as well as advanced classes that can be taken down the road as your character levels up. Classes are defined by the list of Skills that they can take, which are less similar to skills in games like D&D (which are usually modifiers to certain in-world mundane actions, like Stealth or Athletics) and more analogous to what would be considered powers or spells. The KONOSUBA TRPG's skills can range from a wizard's fireball to a priest's healing to a warrior covering a friend from damage; like its source material, the skill system is clearly inspired by MMORPGs which often gives all classes a suite of powers that operate more or less in the same space. Each Skill is a discreet little block of text, much like a spell list might be in other games, with listed timing for when to use it, effects, cost in mana or MP, etc. In this way it is actually somewhat similar to the 4th edition of D&D, which was also criticized of being too MMO-like (though, for my money, it was also a terrific game).    Origins, Blessings, and Cheats round out the player characters. Origins are basically simple story-bits that help you find out how you got to where you are and what your long-term goal might be. Blessings are essentially a fate or reroll mechanic, where you have a pool of extra dice to add to rolls (or you can spend them to reroll checks entirely). Cheats are a special optional rule that have lots of tantalizing benefits and drawbacks that can be quite flavorful, but the game makes it clear that those wanting a more grounded experience might not want to use them as they can break things wide open. Personally, I found the Cheats quite charming and in line with the flavor of the show, and while the game can be played without them, I imagine most fans of the series will want to use them.    Combat is pretty straightforward and obviously where the meat of the rules are focused. Characters act in order of initiative based on Action Points (which is a flat initiative value and not, in fact, a pool of points that are spent). They get a move, minor, and major action, which are spent for the round once they act. Distances are abstracted and measured in ""engagements"" similar to zones from other games. Characters who are close to one another are in an Engagement and generally feels similar to most fantasy TRPGs that have concepts like attacks of opportunity, zones of control, etc. Other RPG strategies like taking cover, taking hits for other party members, or allowing warriors to tank and pull aggro are also implemented. If you've played any fantasy RPG of the past few decades you'll likely feel right at home with the basics.    As such, the KONOSUBA TRPG is largely what I would consider a traditional tabletop game, heavily leaning into the gamist and simulationist spaces of game design. There is not a whole lot in the way of manipulation of narrative beyond Blessings and Cheats, and players familiar with RPGs (of tabletop or video game variety) will probably feel right at home. It also lacks a lot of the overt story-centric focus of games like Fate, Powered by the Apocalypse titles, or Forged in the Dark games. It's a small, light, comfortable little game.    But that's not to say it isn't without its fun flourishes. For example, when handing out XP at the end of a session, even the gamemaster earns experience points. This is then applied to whatever characters the gamemaster has, with the understanding that in future sessions someone else will run and they will get to play their character who has been quietly leveling up in the background. The implication is that there will be some rotation of GM-ing responsibilities within the same campaign; not completely unheard of, but certainly not the norm at most tables I have been at. Still, I like that this is baked into the core rules and there's a sense that even the GM is making progress week to week, something which is often left out of most games.    This translates to the reading of the book as well. The game is north of 300 pages; it is an easy, digest-sized read jam-packed with an example adventure, plenty of pre-made adventure hooks, a touch of background information, full monster bestiary and trap list, gamemastering advice, and more. That said, there are some elements which may cause hang-ups, most prominently the opening replay. A replay – also known as an actual play – serves as the opener to the book, where we get a detailed account of a game session featuring guest star player characters. This group includes Natsumi Akatsuki, the creator of the original light novel series. We get detailed writeups on each of the characters, full custom art for them, and the full transcription of their adventure. While most modern TRPGs include a few pages of example text from a session to give a sense of the tempo of the game, these tend to be brief. In KONOSUBA's case, however, we get a complete session that comprises 80+ pages; in other words, 25% of the book is dedicated to someone else's session, and while players new to TRPG may appreciate such an inclusion, I'm not sure it's worth the space it takes up (especially when recordings of real play sessions are easily accessible online).    There are also a few readability issues to note. First off, the book is very affordable but that comes at the expense of production value. It is priced and formatted like a manga or light novel release in paperback – there are a few color pages early on, but it is largely black and white print on middling quality paper. The layout and usability is also a bit of a mess. While everything flows pretty logically as you read, it is very difficult to reference concepts. In making a character and testing the mechanics I found myself flipping around the book constantly, and while there are some reference sheets, just remembering where everything is placed in the book can be a challenge. Then again, the book is cheap enough that you could probably grab multiple copies for your table and mark them up for easy reference.    I have to make a particular note about the digital version of the book, too. An affordable pdf version is available on BookWalker (roughly $8.00 USD at the time of this writing), but as with the physical release, the quality leaves much to be desired. For one, the scan at the time of this writing is atrocious. It's so low res that trying to zoom in even slightly on a mobile device will strain your eyes. Furthermore, there's no bookmarking or any of the other modern conveniences we've come to enjoy from modern TRPG pdf releases in recent years. Sure it is cheap, and looks fine on a regular monitor, but most players (in my experience) like to have a pdf on a phone or tablet in addition to a physical book at the table, which allows the to individually look up rules while someone else is using the physical book. Simply put, I don't think the pdf is legible for that use due to how low-quality the scan is at this time, and that makes its utility next to zero.    The issue of complexity is also one to mention. In my experience, lighter games are great for new players and/or shorter campaigns and one-shots. The more complex the game, the more support there tends to be for long-term play. The KONOSUBA TRPG has breadth for sure but not a terrible amount of depth, and the mechanics can feel repetitive after a few sessions. Certainly things like changing class or gaining an advanced class may keep things fresh, but I can easily see players falling into patterns of using the same skills over and over without much variety.    That said, simplicity lends to expandability, and many early, simple games like white box D&D flourished because people were constantly homebrewing new rules, spells, and ideas into the very basic framework the game provided. Any GM or player willing to put in a bit of time with the KONOSUBA TRPG could likely generate tons of new skills and abilities, or fun sub-systems for domain management, running a business, entirely new classes, and more. There's also plenty of design space to come up with creative uses for Blessings or new Cheats to create that much-needed variety long-term play often requires. And though it is a fairly generic fantasy RPG in most respects, that makes it very easy to port over adventures or ideas from the plethora of other fantasy games on the market.    Overall, this is a terrific little gem that I think will please most KONOSUBA fans. While it is a simple little game, I think that like its source material there is just enough charm to make it a fun experience for at least a few sessions – and with a bit of work, perhaps many more.

Konosuba: God's Blessing on this Wonderful World! TRPG is published by Yen Press.      Review:            Ah, finally a review that leans into both my lifelong hobbies: anime and tabletop RPGs (or TRPGs in short). I'm always curious to see what happens when the two worlds entwine, but beyond my personal interest, this being an official English release of a Japanese TRPG already makes it worth checking out on its own. Though it's pretty common for video games from other languages/regions to receive official English translations, the same cannot be said of tabletop games. Japanese language TRPGs with official English releases are few and far between – with Tenra Bansho Zero's 2013 Kickstarter likely being the most prominent example. So I was excited to pick this up if for no other reason than to encourage future translations of tabletop titles (fingers crossed for a release of Sword World one of these days...).    I won't go too in-depth into KONOSUBA as I'm sure most reading this are already quite familiar with the series. But in brief, KONOSUBA is a story about a young man named Kazuma Sato who dies and is reincarnated into an alternate fantasy world. Forming a party with the goddess Aqua, the wizard Megumin, and the crusader Darkness, Kazuma and Co. embark on quests, fight giant monsters, and generally get into wacky situations. It's an action-comedy romp that revels in the tropes of many modern RPG games, which of course makes TRPG a natural fit.    In terms of gameplay, this TRPG boasts a very straightforward system. Most actions are resolved by rolling 2d6 and adding them together, usually with a modifier based on an attribute. You try to meet or beat a target number against passive opposition (such as picking a lock or trying to listen through a wall) or try to beat an opposed roll against active opposition (such as trying to attack an opponent). Additional d6s can be added to the pool via abilities – most commonly the expenditure of Blessings, the game's Luck mechanic – and they are also added to the total. If any two dice show 6s that makes for a critical (regardless of how many dice were rolled), and you get a fumble if all the dice show 1s. This makes spending Blessings a way to fish for criticals and lower chances of fumbles at the same time. The use of d6s rather than d20s and other polyhedral dice may shock some readers since the d20 is almost synonymous with the hobby, but it is not completely unheard of, and the ""odd"" polyhedral dice can be expensive to purchase and difficult to find in regions outside the US. 2d6 rolls also tend to be more forgiving and consistent compared to the d20 which is notoriously ""swingy"" in turns of the table feel.    Characters are defined by their race, class, and origin. This is likely a familiar framework if you have any experience with other fantasy TRPGs, but there are some fun twists here. First of all, while the way race is handled can be a thorny issue in many RPGs, I like the KONOSUBA TRPG's approach. The three races presented are Reincarnated Person, Native Inhabitant, and Crimson Magic Clan. It's simple and functional, allowing for some variety in character creation while largely avoiding some of the more negative tropes associated with race in RPGs.    Classes are largely what you would expect. There are warriors, thieves, wizards, and the like, as well as advanced classes that can be taken down the road as your character levels up. Classes are defined by the list of Skills that they can take, which are less similar to skills in games like D&D (which are usually modifiers to certain in-world mundane actions, like Stealth or Athletics) and more analogous to what would be considered powers or spells. The KONOSUBA TRPG's skills can range from a wizard's fireball to a priest's healing to a warrior covering a friend from damage; like its source material, the skill system is clearly inspired by MMORPGs which often gives all classes a suite of powers that operate more or less in the same space. Each Skill is a discreet little block of text, much like a spell list might be in other games, with listed timing for when to use it, effects, cost in mana or MP, etc. In this way it is actually somewhat similar to the 4th edition of D&D, which was also criticized of being too MMO-like (though, for my money, it was also a terrific game).    Origins, Blessings, and Cheats round out the player characters. Origins are basically simple story-bits that help you find out how you got to where you are and what your long-term goal might be. Blessings are essentially a fate or reroll mechanic, where you have a pool of extra dice to add to rolls (or you can spend them to reroll checks entirely). Cheats are a special optional rule that have lots of tantalizing benefits and drawbacks that can be quite flavorful, but the game makes it clear that those wanting a more grounded experience might not want to use them as they can break things wide open. Personally, I found the Cheats quite charming and in line with the flavor of the show, and while the game can be played without them, I imagine most fans of the series will want to use them.    Combat is pretty straightforward and obviously where the meat of the rules are focused. Characters act in order of initiative based on Action Points (which is a flat initiative value and not, in fact, a pool of points that are spent). They get a move, minor, and major action, which are spent for the round once they act. Distances are abstracted and measured in ""engagements"" similar to zones from other games. Characters who are close to one another are in an Engagement and generally feels similar to most fantasy TRPGs that have concepts like attacks of opportunity, zones of control, etc. Other RPG strategies like taking cover, taking hits for other party members, or allowing warriors to tank and pull aggro are also implemented. If you've played any fantasy RPG of the past few decades you'll likely feel right at home with the basics.    As such, the KONOSUBA TRPG is largely what I would consider a traditional tabletop game, heavily leaning into the gamist and simulationist spaces of game design. There is not a whole lot in the way of manipulation of narrative beyond Blessings and Cheats, and players familiar with RPGs (of tabletop or video game variety) will probably feel right at home. It also lacks a lot of the overt story-centric focus of games like Fate, Powered by the Apocalypse titles, or Forged in the Dark games. It's a small, light, comfortable little game.    But that's not to say it isn't without its fun flourishes. For example, when handing out XP at the end of a session, even the gamemaster earns experience points. This is then applied to whatever characters the gamemaster has, with the understanding that in future sessions someone else will run and they will get to play their character who has been quietly leveling up in the background. The implication is that there will be some rotation of GM-ing responsibilities within the same campaign; not completely unheard of, but certainly not the norm at most tables I have been at. Still, I like that this is baked into the core rules and there's a sense that even the GM is making progress week to week, something which is often left out of most games.    This translates to the reading of the book as well. The game is north of 300 pages; it is an easy, digest-sized read jam-packed with an example adventure, plenty of pre-made adventure hooks, a touch of background information, full monster bestiary and trap list, gamemastering advice, and more. That said, there are some elements which may cause hang-ups, most prominently the opening replay. A replay – also known as an actual play – serves as the opener to the book, where we get a detailed account of a game session featuring guest star player characters. This group includes Natsumi Akatsuki, the creator of the original light novel series. We get detailed writeups on each of the characters, full custom art for them, and the full transcription of their adventure. While most modern TRPGs include a few pages of example text from a session to give a sense of the tempo of the game, these tend to be brief. In KONOSUBA's case, however, we get a complete session that comprises 80+ pages; in other words, 25% of the book is dedicated to someone else's session, and while players new to TRPG may appreciate such an inclusion, I'm not sure it's worth the space it takes up (especially when recordings of real play sessions are easily accessible online).    There are also a few readability issues to note. First off, the book is very affordable but that comes at the expense of production value. It is priced and formatted like a manga or light novel release in paperback – there are a few color pages early on, but it is largely black and white print on middling quality paper. The layout and usability is also a bit of a mess. While everything flows pretty logically as you read, it is very difficult to reference concepts. In making a character and testing the mechanics I found myself flipping around the book constantly, and while there are some reference sheets, just remembering where everything is placed in the book can be a challenge. Then again, the book is cheap enough that you could probably grab multiple copies for your table and mark them up for easy reference.    I have to make a particular note about the digital version of the book, too. An affordable pdf version is available on BookWalker (roughly $8.00 USD at the time of this writing), but as with the physical release, the quality leaves much to be desired. For one, the scan at the time of this writing is atrocious. It's so low res that trying to zoom in even slightly on a mobile device will strain your eyes. Furthermore, there's no bookmarking or any of the other modern conveniences we've come to enjoy from modern TRPG pdf releases in recent years. Sure it is cheap, and looks fine on a regular monitor, but most players (in my experience) like to have a pdf on a phone or tablet in addition to a physical book at the table, which allows the to individually look up rules while someone else is using the physical book. Simply put, I don't think the pdf is legible for that use due to how low-quality the scan is at this time, and that makes its utility next to zero.    The issue of complexity is also one to mention. In my experience, lighter games are great for new players and/or shorter campaigns and one-shots. The more complex the game, the more support there tends to be for long-term play. The KONOSUBA TRPG has breadth for sure but not a terrible amount of depth, and the mechanics can feel repetitive after a few sessions. Certainly things like changing class or gaining an advanced class may keep things fresh, but I can easily see players falling into patterns of using the same skills over and over without much variety.    That said, simplicity lends to expandability, and many early, simple games like white box D&D flourished because people were constantly homebrewing new rules, spells, and ideas into the very basic framework the game provided. Any GM or player willing to put in a bit of time with the KONOSUBA TRPG could likely generate tons of new skills and abilities, or fun sub-systems for domain management, running a business, entirely new classes, and more. There's also plenty of design space to come up with creative uses for Blessings or new Cheats to create that much-needed variety long-term play often requires. And though it is a fairly generic fantasy RPG in most respects, that makes it very easy to port over adventures or ideas from the plethora of other fantasy games on the market.    Overall, this is a terrific little gem that I think will please most KONOSUBA fans. While it is a simple little game, I think that like its source material there is just enough charm to make it a fun experience for at least a few sessions – and with a bit of work, perhaps many more.

Konosuba: God's Blessing on this Wonderful World! TRPG is published by Yen Press.      Review:            Ah, finally a review that leans into both my lifelong hobbies: anime and tabletop RPGs (or TRPGs in short). I'm always curious to see what happens when the two worlds entwine, but beyond my personal interest, this being an official English release of a Japanese TRPG already makes it worth checking out on its own. Though it's pretty common for video games from other languages/regions to receive official English translations, the same cannot be said of tabletop games. Japanese language TRPGs with official English releases are few and far between – with Tenra Bansho Zero's 2013 Kickstarter likely being the most prominent example. So I was excited to pick this up if for no other reason than to encourage future translations of tabletop titles (fingers crossed for a release of Sword World one of these days...).    I won't go too in-depth into KONOSUBA as I'm sure most reading this are already quite familiar with the series. But in brief, KONOSUBA is a story about a young man named Kazuma Sato who dies and is reincarnated into an alternate fantasy world. Forming a party with the goddess Aqua, the wizard Megumin, and the crusader Darkness, Kazuma and Co. embark on quests, fight giant monsters, and generally get into wacky situations. It's an action-comedy romp that revels in the tropes of many modern RPG games, which of course makes TRPG a natural fit.    In terms of gameplay, this TRPG boasts a very straightforward system. Most actions are resolved by rolling 2d6 and adding them together, usually with a modifier based on an attribute. You try to meet or beat a target number against passive opposition (such as picking a lock or trying to listen through a wall) or try to beat an opposed roll against active opposition (such as trying to attack an opponent). Additional d6s can be added to the pool via abilities – most commonly the expenditure of Blessings, the game's Luck mechanic – and they are also added to the total. If any two dice show 6s that makes for a critical (regardless of how many dice were rolled), and you get a fumble if all the dice show 1s. This makes spending Blessings a way to fish for criticals and lower chances of fumbles at the same time. The use of d6s rather than d20s and other polyhedral dice may shock some readers since the d20 is almost synonymous with the hobby, but it is not completely unheard of, and the ""odd"" polyhedral dice can be expensive to purchase and difficult to find in regions outside the US. 2d6 rolls also tend to be more forgiving and consistent compared to the d20 which is notoriously ""swingy"" in turns of the table feel.    Characters are defined by their race, class, and origin. This is likely a familiar framework if you have any experience with other fantasy TRPGs, but there are some fun twists here. First of all, while the way race is handled can be a thorny issue in many RPGs, I like the KONOSUBA TRPG's approach. The three races presented are Reincarnated Person, Native Inhabitant, and Crimson Magic Clan. It's simple and functional, allowing for some variety in character creation while largely avoiding some of the more negative tropes associated with race in RPGs.    Classes are largely what you would expect. There are warriors, thieves, wizards, and the like, as well as advanced classes that can be taken down the road as your character levels up. Classes are defined by the list of Skills that they can take, which are less similar to skills in games like D&D (which are usually modifiers to certain in-world mundane actions, like Stealth or Athletics) and more analogous to what would be considered powers or spells. The KONOSUBA TRPG's skills can range from a wizard's fireball to a priest's healing to a warrior covering a friend from damage; like its source material, the skill system is clearly inspired by MMORPGs which often gives all classes a suite of powers that operate more or less in the same space. Each Skill is a discreet little block of text, much like a spell list might be in other games, with listed timing for when to use it, effects, cost in mana or MP, etc. In this way it is actually somewhat similar to the 4th edition of D&D, which was also criticized of being too MMO-like (though, for my money, it was also a terrific game).    Origins, Blessings, and Cheats round out the player characters. Origins are basically simple story-bits that help you find out how you got to where you are and what your long-term goal might be. Blessings are essentially a fate or reroll mechanic, where you have a pool of extra dice to add to rolls (or you can spend them to reroll checks entirely). Cheats are a special optional rule that have lots of tantalizing benefits and drawbacks that can be quite flavorful, but the game makes it clear that those wanting a more grounded experience might not want to use them as they can break things wide open. Personally, I found the Cheats quite charming and in line with the flavor of the show, and while the game can be played without them, I imagine most fans of the series will want to use them.    Combat is pretty straightforward and obviously where the meat of the rules are focused. Characters act in order of initiative based on Action Points (which is a flat initiative value and not, in fact, a pool of points that are spent). They get a move, minor, and major action, which are spent for the round once they act. Distances are abstracted and measured in ""engagements"" similar to zones from other games. Characters who are close to one another are in an Engagement and generally feels similar to most fantasy TRPGs that have concepts like attacks of opportunity, zones of control, etc. Other RPG strategies like taking cover, taking hits for other party members, or allowing warriors to tank and pull aggro are also implemented. If you've played any fantasy RPG of the past few decades you'll likely feel right at home with the basics.    As such, the KONOSUBA TRPG is largely what I would consider a traditional tabletop game, heavily leaning into the gamist and simulationist spaces of game design. There is not a whole lot in the way of manipulation of narrative beyond Blessings and Cheats, and players familiar with RPGs (of tabletop or video game variety) will probably feel right at home. It also lacks a lot of the overt story-centric focus of games like Fate, Powered by the Apocalypse titles, or Forged in the Dark games. It's a small, light, comfortable little game.    But that's not to say it isn't without its fun flourishes. For example, when handing out XP at the end of a session, even the gamemaster earns experience points. This is then applied to whatever characters the gamemaster has, with the understanding that in future sessions someone else will run and they will get to play their character who has been quietly leveling up in the background. The implication is that there will be some rotation of GM-ing responsibilities within the same campaign; not completely unheard of, but certainly not the norm at most tables I have been at. Still, I like that this is baked into the core rules and there's a sense that even the GM is making progress week to week, something which is often left out of most games.    This translates to the reading of the book as well. The game is north of 300 pages; it is an easy, digest-sized read jam-packed with an example adventure, plenty of pre-made adventure hooks, a touch of background information, full monster bestiary and trap list, gamemastering advice, and more. That said, there are some elements which may cause hang-ups, most prominently the opening replay. A replay – also known as an actual play – serves as the opener to the book, where we get a detailed account of a game session featuring guest star player characters. This group includes Natsumi Akatsuki, the creator of the original light novel series. We get detailed writeups on each of the characters, full custom art for them, and the full transcription of their adventure. While most modern TRPGs include a few pages of example text from a session to give a sense of the tempo of the game, these tend to be brief. In KONOSUBA's case, however, we get a complete session that comprises 80+ pages; in other words, 25% of the book is dedicated to someone else's session, and while players new to TRPG may appreciate such an inclusion, I'm not sure it's worth the space it takes up (especially when recordings of real play sessions are easily accessible online).    There are also a few readability issues to note. First off, the book is very affordable but that comes at the expense of production value. It is priced and formatted like a manga or light novel release in paperback – there are a few color pages early on, but it is largely black and white print on middling quality paper. The layout and usability is also a bit of a mess. While everything flows pretty logically as you read, it is very difficult to reference concepts. In making a character and testing the mechanics I found myself flipping around the book constantly, and while there are some reference sheets, just remembering where everything is placed in the book can be a challenge. Then again, the book is cheap enough that you could probably grab multiple copies for your table and mark them up for easy reference.    I have to make a particular note about the digital version of the book, too. An affordable pdf version is available on BookWalker (roughly $8.00 USD at the time of this writing), but as with the physical release, the quality leaves much to be desired. For one, the scan at the time of this writing is atrocious. It's so low res that trying to zoom in even slightly on a mobile device will strain your eyes. Furthermore, there's no bookmarking or any of the other modern conveniences we've come to enjoy from modern TRPG pdf releases in recent years. Sure it is cheap, and looks fine on a regular monitor, but most players (in my experience) like to have a pdf on a phone or tablet in addition to a physical book at the table, which allows the to individually look up rules while someone else is using the physical book. Simply put, I don't think the pdf is legible for that use due to how low-quality the scan is at this time, and that makes its utility next to zero.    The issue of complexity is also one to mention. In my experience, lighter games are great for new players and/or shorter campaigns and one-shots. The more complex the game, the more support there tends to be for long-term play. The KONOSUBA TRPG has breadth for sure but not a terrible amount of depth, and the mechanics can feel repetitive after a few sessions. Certainly things like changing class or gaining an advanced class may keep things fresh, but I can easily see players falling into patterns of using the same skills over and over without much variety.    That said, simplicity lends to expandability, and many early, simple games like white box D&D flourished because people were constantly homebrewing new rules, spells, and ideas into the very basic framework the game provided. Any GM or player willing to put in a bit of time with the KONOSUBA TRPG could likely generate tons of new skills and abilities, or fun sub-systems for domain management, running a business, entirely new classes, and more. There's also plenty of design space to come up with creative uses for Blessings or new Cheats to create that much-needed variety long-term play often requires. And though it is a fairly generic fantasy RPG in most respects, that makes it very easy to port over adventures or ideas from the plethora of other fantasy games on the market.    Overall, this is a terrific little gem that I think will please most KONOSUBA fans. While it is a simple little game, I think that like its source material there is just enough charm to make it a fun experience for at least a few sessions – and with a bit of work, perhaps many more.

Konosuba: God's Blessing on this Wonderful World! TRPG is published by Yen Press.      Review:            Ah, finally a review that leans into both my lifelong hobbies: anime and tabletop RPGs (or TRPGs in short). I'm always curious to see what happens when the two worlds entwine, but beyond my personal interest, this being an official English release of a Japanese TRPG already makes it worth checking out on its own. Though it's pretty common for video games from other languages/regions to receive official English translations, the same cannot be said of tabletop games. Japanese language TRPGs with official English releases are few and far between – with Tenra Bansho Zero's 2013 Kickstarter likely being the most prominent example. So I was excited to pick this up if for no other reason than to encourage future translations of tabletop titles (fingers crossed for a release of Sword World one of these days...).    I won't go too in-depth into KONOSUBA as I'm sure most reading this are already quite familiar with the series. But in brief, KONOSUBA is a story about a young man named Kazuma Sato who dies and is reincarnated into an alternate fantasy world. Forming a party with the goddess Aqua, the wizard Megumin, and the crusader Darkness, Kazuma and Co. embark on quests, fight giant monsters, and generally get into wacky situations. It's an action-comedy romp that revels in the tropes of many modern RPG games, which of course makes TRPG a natural fit.    In terms of gameplay, this TRPG boasts a very straightforward system. Most actions are resolved by rolling 2d6 and adding them together, usually with a modifier based on an attribute. You try to meet or beat a target number against passive opposition (such as picking a lock or trying to listen through a wall) or try to beat an opposed roll against active opposition (such as trying to attack an opponent). Additional d6s can be added to the pool via abilities – most commonly the expenditure of Blessings, the game's Luck mechanic – and they are also added to the total. If any two dice show 6s that makes for a critical (regardless of how many dice were rolled), and you get a fumble if all the dice show 1s. This makes spending Blessings a way to fish for criticals and lower chances of fumbles at the same time. The use of d6s rather than d20s and other polyhedral dice may shock some readers since the d20 is almost synonymous with the hobby, but it is not completely unheard of, and the ""odd"" polyhedral dice can be expensive to purchase and difficult to find in regions outside the US. 2d6 rolls also tend to be more forgiving and consistent compared to the d20 which is notoriously ""swingy"" in turns of the table feel.    Characters are defined by their race, class, and origin. This is likely a familiar framework if you have any experience with other fantasy TRPGs, but there are some fun twists here. First of all, while the way race is handled can be a thorny issue in many RPGs, I like the KONOSUBA TRPG's approach. The three races presented are Reincarnated Person, Native Inhabitant, and Crimson Magic Clan. It's simple and functional, allowing for some variety in character creation while largely avoiding some of the more negative tropes associated with race in RPGs.    Classes are largely what you would expect. There are warriors, thieves, wizards, and the like, as well as advanced classes that can be taken down the road as your character levels up. Classes are defined by the list of Skills that they can take, which are less similar to skills in games like D&D (which are usually modifiers to certain in-world mundane actions, like Stealth or Athletics) and more analogous to what would be considered powers or spells. The KONOSUBA TRPG's skills can range from a wizard's fireball to a priest's healing to a warrior covering a friend from damage; like its source material, the skill system is clearly inspired by MMORPGs which often gives all classes a suite of powers that operate more or less in the same space. Each Skill is a discreet little block of text, much like a spell list might be in other games, with listed timing for when to use it, effects, cost in mana or MP, etc. In this way it is actually somewhat similar to the 4th edition of D&D, which was also criticized of being too MMO-like (though, for my money, it was also a terrific game).    Origins, Blessings, and Cheats round out the player characters. Origins are basically simple story-bits that help you find out how you got to where you are and what your long-term goal might be. Blessings are essentially a fate or reroll mechanic, where you have a pool of extra dice to add to rolls (or you can spend them to reroll checks entirely). Cheats are a special optional rule that have lots of tantalizing benefits and drawbacks that can be quite flavorful, but the game makes it clear that those wanting a more grounded experience might not want to use them as they can break things wide open. Personally, I found the Cheats quite charming and in line with the flavor of the show, and while the game can be played without them, I imagine most fans of the series will want to use them.    Combat is pretty straightforward and obviously where the meat of the rules are focused. Characters act in order of initiative based on Action Points (which is a flat initiative value and not, in fact, a pool of points that are spent). They get a move, minor, and major action, which are spent for the round once they act. Distances are abstracted and measured in ""engagements"" similar to zones from other games. Characters who are close to one another are in an Engagement and generally feels similar to most fantasy TRPGs that have concepts like attacks of opportunity, zones of control, etc. Other RPG strategies like taking cover, taking hits for other party members, or allowing warriors to tank and pull aggro are also implemented. If you've played any fantasy RPG of the past few decades you'll likely feel right at home with the basics.    As such, the KONOSUBA TRPG is largely what I would consider a traditional tabletop game, heavily leaning into the gamist and simulationist spaces of game design. There is not a whole lot in the way of manipulation of narrative beyond Blessings and Cheats, and players familiar with RPGs (of tabletop or video game variety) will probably feel right at home. It also lacks a lot of the overt story-centric focus of games like Fate, Powered by the Apocalypse titles, or Forged in the Dark games. It's a small, light, comfortable little game.    But that's not to say it isn't without its fun flourishes. For example, when handing out XP at the end of a session, even the gamemaster earns experience points. This is then applied to whatever characters the gamemaster has, with the understanding that in future sessions someone else will run and they will get to play their character who has been quietly leveling up in the background. The implication is that there will be some rotation of GM-ing responsibilities within the same campaign; not completely unheard of, but certainly not the norm at most tables I have been at. Still, I like that this is baked into the core rules and there's a sense that even the GM is making progress week to week, something which is often left out of most games.    This translates to the reading of the book as well. The game is north of 300 pages; it is an easy, digest-sized read jam-packed with an example adventure, plenty of pre-made adventure hooks, a touch of background information, full monster bestiary and trap list, gamemastering advice, and more. That said, there are some elements which may cause hang-ups, most prominently the opening replay. A replay – also known as an actual play – serves as the opener to the book, where we get a detailed account of a game session featuring guest star player characters. This group includes Natsumi Akatsuki, the creator of the original light novel series. We get detailed writeups on each of the characters, full custom art for them, and the full transcription of their adventure. While most modern TRPGs include a few pages of example text from a session to give a sense of the tempo of the game, these tend to be brief. In KONOSUBA's case, however, we get a complete session that comprises 80+ pages; in other words, 25% of the book is dedicated to someone else's session, and while players new to TRPG may appreciate such an inclusion, I'm not sure it's worth the space it takes up (especially when recordings of real play sessions are easily accessible online).    There are also a few readability issues to note. First off, the book is very affordable but that comes at the expense of production value. It is priced and formatted like a manga or light novel release in paperback – there are a few color pages early on, but it is largely black and white print on middling quality paper. The layout and usability is also a bit of a mess. While everything flows pretty logically as you read, it is very difficult to reference concepts. In making a character and testing the mechanics I found myself flipping around the book constantly, and while there are some reference sheets, just remembering where everything is placed in the book can be a challenge. Then again, the book is cheap enough that you could probably grab multiple copies for your table and mark them up for easy reference.    I have to make a particular note about the digital version of the book, too. An affordable pdf version is available on BookWalker (roughly $8.00 USD at the time of this writing), but as with the physical release, the quality leaves much to be desired. For one, the scan at the time of this writing is atrocious. It's so low res that trying to zoom in even slightly on a mobile device will strain your eyes. Furthermore, there's no bookmarking or any of the other modern conveniences we've come to enjoy from modern TRPG pdf releases in recent years. Sure it is cheap, and looks fine on a regular monitor, but most players (in my experience) like to have a pdf on a phone or tablet in addition to a physical book at the table, which allows the to individually look up rules while someone else is using the physical book. Simply put, I don't think the pdf is legible for that use due to how low-quality the scan is at this time, and that makes its utility next to zero.    The issue of complexity is also one to mention. In my experience, lighter games are great for new players and/or shorter campaigns and one-shots. The more complex the game, the more support there tends to be for long-term play. The KONOSUBA TRPG has breadth for sure but not a terrible amount of depth, and the mechanics can feel repetitive after a few sessions. Certainly things like changing class or gaining an advanced class may keep things fresh, but I can easily see players falling into patterns of using the same skills over and over without much variety.    That said, simplicity lends to expandability, and many early, simple games like white box D&D flourished because people were constantly homebrewing new rules, spells, and ideas into the very basic framework the game provided. Any GM or player willing to put in a bit of time with the KONOSUBA TRPG could likely generate tons of new skills and abilities, or fun sub-systems for domain management, running a business, entirely new classes, and more. There's also plenty of design space to come up with creative uses for Blessings or new Cheats to create that much-needed variety long-term play often requires. And though it is a fairly generic fantasy RPG in most respects, that makes it very easy to port over adventures or ideas from the plethora of other fantasy games on the market.    Overall, this is a terrific little gem that I think will please most KONOSUBA fans. While it is a simple little game, I think that like its source material there is just enough charm to make it a fun experience for at least a few sessions – and with a bit of work, perhaps many more.             Grade:      Overall : B+ Art : A+  + Simple, charming, complete game in one book, easy to learn − Maybe a bit too simple, low res digital release, layout makes reference a challenge            discuss this in the forum (2 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                       Review homepage / archives      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

The KONOSUBA TRPG's skills can range from a wizard's fireball to a priest's healing to a warrior covering a friend from damage; like its source material, the skill system is clearly inspired by MMORPGs which often gives all classes a suite of powers that operate more or less in the same space. Each Skill is a discreet little block of text, much like a spell list might be in other games, with listed timing for when to use it, effects, cost in mana or MP, etc. In this way it is actually somewhat similar to the 4th edition of D&D, which was also criticized of being too MMO-like (though, for my money, it was also a terrific game).    Origins, Blessings, and Cheats round out the player characters. Origins are basically simple story-bits that help you find out how you got to where you are and what your long-term goal might be. Blessings are essentially a fate or reroll mechanic, where you have a pool of extra dice to add to rolls (or you can spend them to reroll checks entirely). Cheats are a special optional rule that have lots of tantalizing benefits and drawbacks that can be quite flavorful, but the game makes it clear that those wanting a more grounded experience might not want to use them as they can break things wide open. Personally, I found the Cheats quite charming and in line with the flavor of the show, and while the game can be played without them, I imagine most fans of the series will want to use them.    Combat is pretty straightforward and obviously where the meat of the rules are focused. Characters act in order of initiative based on Action Points (which is a flat initiative value and not, in fact, a pool of points that are spent). They get a move, minor, and major action, which are spent for the round once they act. Distances are abstracted and measured in ""engagements"" similar to zones from other games. Characters who are close to one another are in an Engagement and generally feels similar to most fantasy TRPGs that have concepts like attacks of opportunity, zones of control, etc. Other RPG strategies like taking cover, taking hits for other party members, or allowing warriors to tank and pull aggro are also implemented. If you've played any fantasy RPG of the past few decades you'll likely feel right at home with the basics.    As such, the KONOSUBA TRPG is largely what I would consider a traditional tabletop game, heavily leaning into the gamist and simulationist spaces of game design. There is not a whole lot in the way of manipulation of narrative beyond Blessings and Cheats, and players familiar with RPGs (of tabletop or video game variety) will probably feel right at home. It also lacks a lot of the overt story-centric focus of games like Fate, Powered by the Apocalypse titles, or Forged in the Dark games. It's a small, light, comfortable little game.    But that's not to say it isn't without its fun flourishes. For example, when handing out XP at the end of a session, even the gamemaster earns experience points. This is then applied to whatever characters the gamemaster has, with the understanding that in future sessions someone else will run and they will get to play their character who has been quietly leveling up in the background. The implication is that there will be some rotation of GM-ing responsibilities within the same campaign; not completely unheard of, but certainly not the norm at most tables I have been at. Still, I like that this is baked into the core rules and there's a sense that even the GM is making progress week to week, something which is often left out of most games.    This translates to the reading of the book as well. The game is north of 300 pages; it is an easy, digest-sized read jam-packed with an example adventure, plenty of pre-made adventure hooks, a touch of background information, full monster bestiary and trap list, gamemastering advice, and more. That said, there are some elements which may cause hang-ups, most prominently the opening replay. A replay – also known as an actual play – serves as the opener to the book, where we get a detailed account of a game session featuring guest star player characters. This group includes Natsumi Akatsuki, the creator of the original light novel series. We get detailed writeups on each of the characters, full custom art for them, and the full transcription of their adventure. While most modern TRPGs include a few pages of example text from a session to give a sense of the tempo of the game, these tend to be brief. In KONOSUBA's case, however, we get a complete session that comprises 80+ pages; in other words, 25% of the book is dedicated to someone else's session, and while players new to TRPG may appreciate such an inclusion, I'm not sure it's worth the space it takes up (especially when recordings of real play sessions are easily accessible online).    There are also a few readability issues to note. First off, the book is very affordable but that comes at the expense of production value. It is priced and formatted like a manga or light novel release in paperback – there are a few color pages early on, but it is largely black and white print on middling quality paper. The layout and usability is also a bit of a mess. While everything flows pretty logically as you read, it is very difficult to reference concepts. In making a character and testing the mechanics I found myself flipping around the book constantly, and while there are some reference sheets, just remembering where everything is placed in the book can be a challenge. Then again, the book is cheap enough that you could probably grab multiple copies for your table and mark them up for easy reference.    I have to make a particular note about the digital version of the book, too. An affordable pdf version is available on BookWalker (roughly $8.00 USD at the time of this writing), but as with the physical release, the quality leaves much to be desired. For one, the scan at the time of this writing is atrocious. It's so low res that trying to zoom in even slightly on a mobile device will strain your eyes. Furthermore, there's no bookmarking or any of the other modern conveniences we've come to enjoy from modern TRPG pdf releases in recent years. Sure it is cheap, and looks fine on a regular monitor, but most players (in my experience) like to have a pdf on a phone or tablet in addition to a physical book at the table, which allows the to individually look up rules while someone else is using the physical book. Simply put, I don't think the pdf is legible for that use due to how low-quality the scan is at this time, and that makes its utility next to zero.    The issue of complexity is also one to mention. In my experience, lighter games are great for new players and/or shorter campaigns and one-shots. The more complex the game, the more support there tends to be for long-term play. The KONOSUBA TRPG has breadth for sure but not a terrible amount of depth, and the mechanics can feel repetitive after a few sessions. Certainly things like changing class or gaining an advanced class may keep things fresh, but I can easily see players falling into patterns of using the same skills over and over without much variety.    That said, simplicity lends to expandability, and many early, simple games like white box D&D flourished because people were constantly homebrewing new rules, spells, and ideas into the very basic framework the game provided. Any GM or player willing to put in a bit of time with the KONOSUBA TRPG could likely generate tons of new skills and abilities, or fun sub-systems for domain management, running a business, entirely new classes, and more. There's also plenty of design space to come up with creative uses for Blessings or new Cheats to create that much-needed variety long-term play often requires. And though it is a fairly generic fantasy RPG in most respects, that makes it very easy to port over adventures or ideas from the plethora of other fantasy games on the market.    Overall, this is a terrific little gem that I think will please most KONOSUBA fans. While it is a simple little game, I think that like its source material there is just enough charm to make it a fun experience for at least a few sessions – and with a bit of work, perhaps many more.

Konosuba: God's Blessing on this Wonderful World! TRPG is published by Yen Press.      Review:            Ah, finally a review that leans into both my lifelong hobbies: anime and tabletop RPGs (or TRPGs in short). I'm always curious to see what happens when the two worlds entwine, but beyond my personal interest, this being an official English release of a Japanese TRPG already makes it worth checking out on its own. Though it's pretty common for video games from other languages/regions to receive official English translations, the same cannot be said of tabletop games. Japanese language TRPGs with official English releases are few and far between – with Tenra Bansho Zero's 2013 Kickstarter likely being the most prominent example. So I was excited to pick this up if for no other reason than to encourage future translations of tabletop titles (fingers crossed for a release of Sword World one of these days...).    I won't go too in-depth into KONOSUBA as I'm sure most reading this are already quite familiar with the series. But in brief, KONOSUBA is a story about a young man named Kazuma Sato who dies and is reincarnated into an alternate fantasy world. Forming a party with the goddess Aqua, the wizard Megumin, and the crusader Darkness, Kazuma and Co. embark on quests, fight giant monsters, and generally get into wacky situations. It's an action-comedy romp that revels in the tropes of many modern RPG games, which of course makes TRPG a natural fit.    In terms of gameplay, this TRPG boasts a very straightforward system. Most actions are resolved by rolling 2d6 and adding them together, usually with a modifier based on an attribute. You try to meet or beat a target number against passive opposition (such as picking a lock or trying to listen through a wall) or try to beat an opposed roll against active opposition (such as trying to attack an opponent). Additional d6s can be added to the pool via abilities – most commonly the expenditure of Blessings, the game's Luck mechanic – and they are also added to the total. If any two dice show 6s that makes for a critical (regardless of how many dice were rolled), and you get a fumble if all the dice show 1s. This makes spending Blessings a way to fish for criticals and lower chances of fumbles at the same time. The use of d6s rather than d20s and other polyhedral dice may shock some readers since the d20 is almost synonymous with the hobby, but it is not completely unheard of, and the ""odd"" polyhedral dice can be expensive to purchase and difficult to find in regions outside the US. 2d6 rolls also tend to be more forgiving and consistent compared to the d20 which is notoriously ""swingy"" in turns of the table feel.    Characters are defined by their race, class, and origin. This is likely a familiar framework if you have any experience with other fantasy TRPGs, but there are some fun twists here. First of all, while the way race is handled can be a thorny issue in many RPGs, I like the KONOSUBA TRPG's approach. The three races presented are Reincarnated Person, Native Inhabitant, and Crimson Magic Clan. It's simple and functional, allowing for some variety in character creation while largely avoiding some of the more negative tropes associated with race in RPGs.    Classes are largely what you would expect. There are warriors, thieves, wizards, and the like, as well as advanced classes that can be taken down the road as your character levels up. Classes are defined by the list of Skills that they can take, which are less similar to skills in games like D&D (which are usually modifiers to certain in-world mundane actions, like Stealth or Athletics) and more analogous to what would be considered powers or spells. The KONOSUBA TRPG's skills can range from a wizard's fireball to a priest's healing to a warrior covering a friend from damage; like its source material, the skill system is clearly inspired by MMORPGs which often gives all classes a suite of powers that operate more or less in the same space.

Blessings are essentially a fate or reroll mechanic, where you have a pool of extra dice to add to rolls (or you can spend them to reroll checks entirely). Cheats are a special optional rule that have lots of tantalizing benefits and drawbacks that can be quite flavorful, but the game makes it clear that those wanting a more grounded experience might not want to use them as they can break things wide open.

The layout and usability is also a bit of a mess. While everything flows pretty logically as you read, it is very difficult to reference concepts. In making a character and testing the mechanics I found myself flipping around the book constantly, and while there are some reference sheets, just remembering where everything is placed in the book can be a challenge. Then again, the book is cheap enough that you could probably grab multiple copies for your table and mark them up for easy reference.    I have to make a particular note about the digital version of the book, too. An affordable pdf version is available on BookWalker (roughly $8.00 USD at the time of this writing), but as with the physical release, the quality leaves much to be desired. For one, the scan at the time of this writing is atrocious. It's so low res that trying to zoom in even slightly on a mobile device will strain your eyes. Furthermore, there's no bookmarking or any of the other modern conveniences we've come to enjoy from modern TRPG pdf releases in recent years. Sure it is cheap, and looks fine on a regular monitor, but most players (in my experience) like to have a pdf on a phone or tablet in addition to a physical book at the table, which allows the to individually look up rules while someone else is using the physical book. Simply put, I don't think the pdf is legible for that use due to how low-quality the scan is at this time, and that makes its utility next to zero.    The issue of complexity is also one to mention. In my experience, lighter games are great for new players and/or shorter campaigns and one-shots. The more complex the game, the more support there tends to be for long-term play. The KONOSUBA TRPG has breadth for sure but not a terrible amount of depth, and the mechanics can feel repetitive after a few sessions. Certainly things like changing class or gaining an advanced class may keep things fresh, but I can easily see players falling into patterns of using the same skills over and over without much variety.    That said, simplicity lends to expandability, and many early, simple games like white box D&D flourished because people were constantly homebrewing new rules, spells, and ideas into the very basic framework the game provided. Any GM or player willing to put in a bit of time with the KONOSUBA TRPG could likely generate tons of new skills and abilities, or fun sub-systems for domain management, running a business, entirely new classes, and more. There's also plenty of design space to come up with creative uses for Blessings or new Cheats to create that much-needed variety long-term play often requires. And though it is a fairly generic fantasy RPG in most respects, that makes it very easy to port over adventures or ideas from the plethora of other fantasy games on the market.    Overall, this is a terrific little gem that I think will please most KONOSUBA fans. While it is a simple little game, I think that like its source material there is just enough charm to make it a fun experience for at least a few sessions – and with a bit of work, perhaps many more.

Konosuba: God's Blessing on this Wonderful World! TRPG is published by Yen Press.      Review:            Ah, finally a review that leans into both my lifelong hobbies: anime and tabletop RPGs (or TRPGs in short). I'm always curious to see what happens when the two worlds entwine, but beyond my personal interest, this being an official English release of a Japanese TRPG already makes it worth checking out on its own. Though it's pretty common for video games from other languages/regions to receive official English translations, the same cannot be said of tabletop games. Japanese language TRPGs with official English releases are few and far between – with Tenra Bansho Zero's 2013 Kickstarter likely being the most prominent example. So I was excited to pick this up if for no other reason than to encourage future translations of tabletop titles (fingers crossed for a release of Sword World one of these days...).    I won't go too in-depth into KONOSUBA as I'm sure most reading this are already quite familiar with the series. But in brief, KONOSUBA is a story about a young man named Kazuma Sato who dies and is reincarnated into an alternate fantasy world. Forming a party with the goddess Aqua, the wizard Megumin, and the crusader Darkness, Kazuma and Co. embark on quests, fight giant monsters, and generally get into wacky situations. It's an action-comedy romp that revels in the tropes of many modern RPG games, which of course makes TRPG a natural fit.    In terms of gameplay, this TRPG boasts a very straightforward system. Most actions are resolved by rolling 2d6 and adding them together, usually with a modifier based on an attribute. You try to meet or beat a target number against passive opposition (such as picking a lock or trying to listen through a wall) or try to beat an opposed roll against active opposition (such as trying to attack an opponent). Additional d6s can be added to the pool via abilities – most commonly the expenditure of Blessings, the game's Luck mechanic – and they are also added to the total. If any two dice show 6s that makes for a critical (regardless of how many dice were rolled), and you get a fumble if all the dice show 1s. This makes spending Blessings a way to fish for criticals and lower chances of fumbles at the same time. The use of d6s rather than d20s and other polyhedral dice may shock some readers since the d20 is almost synonymous with the hobby, but it is not completely unheard of, and the ""odd"" polyhedral dice can be expensive to purchase and difficult to find in regions outside the US. 2d6 rolls also tend to be more forgiving and consistent compared to the d20 which is notoriously ""swingy"" in turns of the table feel.    Characters are defined by their race, class, and origin. This is likely a familiar framework if you have any experience with other fantasy TRPGs, but there are some fun twists here. First of all, while the way race is handled can be a thorny issue in many RPGs, I like the KONOSUBA TRPG's approach. The three races presented are Reincarnated Person, Native Inhabitant, and Crimson Magic Clan. It's simple and functional, allowing for some variety in character creation while largely avoiding some of the more negative tropes associated with race in RPGs.    Classes are largely what you would expect. There are warriors, thieves, wizards, and the like, as well as advanced classes that can be taken down the road as your character levels up. Classes are defined by the list of Skills that they can take, which are less similar to skills in games like D&D (which are usually modifiers to certain in-world mundane actions, like Stealth or Athletics) and more analogous to what would be considered powers or spells. The KONOSUBA TRPG's skills can range from a wizard's fireball to a priest's healing to a warrior covering a friend from damage; like its source material, the skill system is clearly inspired by MMORPGs which often gives all classes a suite of powers that operate more or less in the same space. Each Skill is a discreet little block of text, much like a spell list might be in other games, with listed timing for when to use it, effects, cost in mana or MP, etc. In this way it is actually somewhat similar to the 4th edition of D&D, which was also criticized of being too MMO-like (though, for my money, it was also a terrific game).    Origins, Blessings, and Cheats round out the player characters. Origins are basically simple story-bits that help you find out how you got to where you are and what your long-term goal might be. Blessings are essentially a fate or reroll mechanic, where you have a pool of extra dice to add to rolls (or you can spend them to reroll checks entirely). Cheats are a special optional rule that have lots of tantalizing benefits and drawbacks that can be quite flavorful, but the game makes it clear that those wanting a more grounded experience might not want to use them as they can break things wide open. Personally, I found the Cheats quite charming and in line with the flavor of the show, and while the game can be played without them, I imagine most fans of the series will want to use them.    Combat is pretty straightforward and obviously where the meat of the rules are focused. Characters act in order of initiative based on Action Points (which is a flat initiative value and not, in fact, a pool of points that are spent). They get a move, minor, and major action, which are spent for the round once they act. Distances are abstracted and measured in ""engagements"" similar to zones from other games. Characters who are close to one another are in an Engagement and generally feels similar to most fantasy TRPGs that have concepts like attacks of opportunity, zones of control, etc. Other RPG strategies like taking cover, taking hits for other party members, or allowing warriors to tank and pull aggro are also implemented. If you've played any fantasy RPG of the past few decades you'll likely feel right at home with the basics.    As such, the KONOSUBA TRPG is largely what I would consider a traditional tabletop game, heavily leaning into the gamist and simulationist spaces of game design. There is not a whole lot in the way of manipulation of narrative beyond Blessings and Cheats, and players familiar with RPGs (of tabletop or video game variety) will probably feel right at home. It also lacks a lot of the overt story-centric focus of games like Fate, Powered by the Apocalypse titles, or Forged in the Dark games. It's a small, light, comfortable little game.    But that's not to say it isn't without its fun flourishes. For example, when handing out XP at the end of a session, even the gamemaster earns experience points. This is then applied to whatever characters the gamemaster has, with the understanding that in future sessions someone else will run and they will get to play their character who has been quietly leveling up in the background. The implication is that there will be some rotation of GM-ing responsibilities within the same campaign; not completely unheard of, but certainly not the norm at most tables I have been at. Still, I like that this is baked into the core rules and there's a sense that even the GM is making progress week to week, something which is often left out of most games.    This translates to the reading of the book as well. The game is north of 300 pages; it is an easy, digest-sized read jam-packed with an example adventure, plenty of pre-made adventure hooks, a touch of background information, full monster bestiary and trap list, gamemastering advice, and more. That said, there are some elements which may cause hang-ups, most prominently the opening replay. A replay – also known as an actual play – serves as the opener to the book, where we get a detailed account of a game session featuring guest star player characters. This group includes Natsumi Akatsuki, the creator of the original light novel series. We get detailed writeups on each of the characters, full custom art for them, and the full transcription of their adventure. While most modern TRPGs include a few pages of example text from a session to give a sense of the tempo of the game, these tend to be brief. In KONOSUBA's case, however, we get a complete session that comprises 80+ pages; in other words, 25% of the book is dedicated to someone else's session, and while players new to TRPG may appreciate such an inclusion, I'm not sure it's worth the space it takes up (especially when recordings of real play sessions are easily accessible online).    There are also a few readability issues to note. First off, the book is very affordable but that comes at the expense of production value. It is priced and formatted like a manga or light novel release in paperback – there are a few color pages early on, but it is largely black and white print on middling quality paper.

Shueisha published the manga's 19th compiled book volume on April 4. The manga has over 65 million copies in circulation (including print and digital copies, as well as copies not yet sold) as of that volume's release date.    Viz Media published the manga's first three chapters in English simultaneously with Japan as part of its Jump Start initiative. When Viz then switched to its new Shonen Jump model in December 2018, the company began publishing new chapters of the manga digitally. Shueisha is also publishing the manga on its MANGA Plus website.    Viz Media describes the story:    In a world where demons feed on unsuspecting humans, fragments of the legendary and feared demon Ryoma Sukuna were lost and scattered about. Should any demon consume Sukuna's body parts, the power they gain could destroy the world as we know it. Fortunately, there exists a mysterious school of Jujutsu Sorcerers who exist to protect the precarious existence of the living from the supernatural!   Yuji Itadori is high schooler who spends his days visiting his bedridden grandfather. Although he looks like your average teenager, his immense physical strength is something to behold! Every sports club wants him to join, but Itadori would rather hang out with the school outcasts in the Occult Club. One day, the club manages to get their hands on a sealed cursed object, but little do they know the terror they'll unleash when they break the seal...    The Jujutsu Kaisen anime premiered in October 2020, and it had 24 episodes. The anime will get a second season in 2023. Jujutsu Kaisen 0 opened in Japan on December 24 and is currently the 18th highest-grossing film in Japan of all time. The film is based on Gege Akutami's Jujutsu Kaisen 0 Tokyo Toritsu Jujutsu Kōtō Senmon Gakkō (Jujutsu Kaisen 0: Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School) manga prequel story.

News Jujutsu Kaisen Stage Play's Video Introduces Cast in Costume   posted on 2022-04-14 12:32 UTC-8 by Egan Loo          Ryūji Satō, Ryosuke Miura star in July-August play    A press conference for the stage play of Gege Akutami's Jujutsu Kaisen manga introduced the production's promotional video, main cast, and other details on Wednesday.         The cast members are:    Ryūji Satō as Yūji Itadori    Kazuaki Yasue as Megumi Fushiguro    Erika Toyohara as Nobara Kugisaki    Sara Takatsuki as Maki Zenin    Fūma Sadamoto as Toge Inumaki    Takeshi Terayama as Panda    Masanari Wada as Kento Nanami    Hosaki Tanaka as Kiyotaka Ijichi    Mikako Ishii as Shoko Ieiri    Motohiro Ōta as Mahito    Noa Fukuzawa (Watwing) as Junpei Yoshino    Rei Fujita as Suguru Getou    Mondo Yamagishi as Jogou    Yoshihiro Minami as Hanami    Tact Igarashi as Ryōmen Sukuna    Ryōsuke Miura as Satoru Gojo     The production will run in The Galaxy Theatre at Tokyo's Tennōzu from July 15 to July 31 and then move to Mielparque Hall Osaka from August 4 to August 14. Kensaku Kobayashi is directing the play off a script by Kōhei Kiyasu.    Akutami launched the manga in Shueisha's Weekly Shonen Jump magazine in March 2018. Shueisha published the manga's 19th compiled book volume on April 4. The manga has over 65 million copies in circulation (including print and digital copies, as well as copies not yet sold) as of that volume's release date.    Viz Media published the manga's first three chapters in English simultaneously with Japan as part of its Jump Start initiative. When Viz then switched to its new Shonen Jump model in December 2018, the company began publishing new chapters of the manga digitally. Shueisha is also publishing the manga on its MANGA Plus website.    Viz Media describes the story:    In a world where demons feed on unsuspecting humans, fragments of the legendary and feared demon Ryoma Sukuna were lost and scattered about. Should any demon consume Sukuna's body parts, the power they gain could destroy the world as we know it. Fortunately, there exists a mysterious school of Jujutsu Sorcerers who exist to protect the precarious existence of the living from the supernatural!   Yuji Itadori is high schooler who spends his days visiting his bedridden grandfather. Although he looks like your average teenager, his immense physical strength is something to behold! Every sports club wants him to join, but Itadori would rather hang out with the school outcasts in the Occult Club. One day, the club manages to get their hands on a sealed cursed object, but little do they know the terror they'll unleash when they break the seal...    The Jujutsu Kaisen anime premiered in October 2020, and it had 24 episodes. The anime will get a second season in 2023. Jujutsu Kaisen 0 opened in Japan on December 24 and is currently the 18th highest-grossing film in Japan of all time. The film is based on Gege Akutami's Jujutsu Kaisen 0 Tokyo Toritsu Jujutsu Kōtō Senmon Gakkō (Jujutsu Kaisen 0: Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School) manga prequel story.

News Jujutsu Kaisen Stage Play's Video Introduces Cast in Costume   posted on 2022-04-14 12:32 UTC-8 by Egan Loo          Ryūji Satō, Ryosuke Miura star in July-August play    A press conference for the stage play of Gege Akutami's Jujutsu Kaisen manga introduced the production's promotional video, main cast, and other details on Wednesday.         The cast members are:    Ryūji Satō as Yūji Itadori    Kazuaki Yasue as Megumi Fushiguro    Erika Toyohara as Nobara Kugisaki    Sara Takatsuki as Maki Zenin    Fūma Sadamoto as Toge Inumaki    Takeshi Terayama as Panda    Masanari Wada as Kento Nanami    Hosaki Tanaka as Kiyotaka Ijichi    Mikako Ishii as Shoko Ieiri    Motohiro Ōta as Mahito    Noa Fukuzawa (Watwing) as Junpei Yoshino    Rei Fujita as Suguru Getou    Mondo Yamagishi as Jogou    Yoshihiro Minami as Hanami    Tact Igarashi as Ryōmen Sukuna    Ryōsuke Miura as Satoru Gojo     The production will run in The Galaxy Theatre at Tokyo's Tennōzu from July 15 to July 31 and then move to Mielparque Hall Osaka from August 4 to August 14. Kensaku Kobayashi is directing the play off a script by Kōhei Kiyasu.    Akutami launched the manga in Shueisha's Weekly Shonen Jump magazine in March 2018. Shueisha published the manga's 19th compiled book volume on April 4. The manga has over 65 million copies in circulation (including print and digital copies, as well as copies not yet sold) as of that volume's release date.    Viz Media published the manga's first three chapters in English simultaneously with Japan as part of its Jump Start initiative.

Viz Media describes the story:    In a world where demons feed on unsuspecting humans, fragments of the legendary and feared demon Ryoma Sukuna were lost and scattered about. Should any demon consume Sukuna's body parts, the power they gain could destroy the world as we know it. Fortunately, there exists a mysterious school of Jujutsu Sorcerers who exist to protect the precarious existence of the living from the supernatural!   Yuji Itadori is high schooler who spends his days visiting his bedridden grandfather. Although he looks like your average teenager, his immense physical strength is something to behold! Every sports club wants him to join, but Itadori would rather hang out with the school outcasts in the Occult Club. One day, the club manages to get their hands on a sealed cursed object, but little do they know the terror they'll unleash when they break the seal...    The Jujutsu Kaisen anime premiered in October 2020, and it had 24 episodes. The anime will get a second season in 2023. Jujutsu Kaisen 0 opened in Japan on December 24 and is currently the 18th highest-grossing film in Japan of all time. The film is based on Gege Akutami's Jujutsu Kaisen 0 Tokyo Toritsu Jujutsu Kōtō Senmon Gakkō (Jujutsu Kaisen 0: Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School) manga prequel story.

The cast members are:    Ryūji Satō as Yūji Itadori    Kazuaki Yasue as Megumi Fushiguro    Erika Toyohara as Nobara Kugisaki    Sara Takatsuki as Maki Zenin    Fūma Sadamoto as Toge Inumaki    Takeshi Terayama as Panda    Masanari Wada as Kento Nanami    Hosaki Tanaka as Kiyotaka Ijichi    Mikako Ishii as Shoko Ieiri    Motohiro Ōta as Mahito    Noa Fukuzawa (Watwing) as Junpei Yoshino    Rei Fujita as Suguru Getou    Mondo Yamagishi as Jogou    Yoshihiro Minami as Hanami    Tact Igarashi as Ryōmen Sukuna    Ryōsuke Miura as Satoru Gojo     The production will run in The Galaxy Theatre at Tokyo's Tennōzu from July 15 to July 31 and then move to Mielparque Hall Osaka from August 4 to August 14.

Shueisha published the manga's 19th compiled book volume on April 4. The manga has over 65 million copies in circulation (including print and digital copies, as well as copies not yet sold) as of that volume's release date.

Should any demon consume Sukuna's body parts, the power they gain could destroy the world as we know it. Fortunately, there exists a mysterious school of Jujutsu Sorcerers who exist to protect the precarious existence of the living from the supernatural!   Yuji Itadori is high schooler who spends his days visiting his bedridden grandfather. Although he looks like your average teenager, his immense physical strength is something to behold! Every sports club wants him to join, but Itadori would rather hang out with the school outcasts in the Occult Club. One day, the club manages to get their hands on a sealed cursed object, but little do they know the terror they'll unleash when they break the seal...    The Jujutsu Kaisen anime premiered in October 2020, and it had 24 episodes. The anime will get a second season in 2023. Jujutsu Kaisen 0 opened in Japan on December 24 and is currently the 18th highest-grossing film in Japan of all time.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Kotaro Lives Alone   Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Kotaro Lives Alone (ONA) ?                     Community score: 4.2              What is this?   The story centers on a 4-year-old boy named Kotarō Satо̄, who moves next door to Shin Karino, an unsuccessful manga artist. Kotarō has no parents and lives alone. Not only does he seem to earn a living, he actually seems more put together than his own strange neighbors.    Kotaro Lives Alone is based on Mami Tsumura's manga and streams on Netflix.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Because of my day job, I have a love-hate relationship with anime that feature young children. Write them well, and I'll gush over how the series really gets them; write them poorly or overly-precocious and it's difficult for me to suspend belief long enough to really get into the story. I'd heard good things about Kotaro Lives Alone, but I couldn't feel anything beyond the most cautious of optimism as I started up the first episode. I know four-year-olds, and it was hard to imagine a story where I could both believe a child is four and is capable of surviving on his own.    Somehow, miraculously, the first episode manages to strike that balance, painting a tragicomic picture of a young child who has been forced to grow up way too fast. Part of the reason it works is because of the way Kotaro wears certain affectations, such as copying the extremely formal and old-fashioned language from a samurai cartoon he likes, like a suit of armor as he imitates adult behavior. Moments like the brief shot of him reading a newspaper on the toilet – and Japanese newspapers have a lot of difficult kanji in them, at an age where a child is barely expected to read hiragana – with his little legs dangling speak volumes.    What Kotaro Lives Alone understands is that a four-year-old doesn't become this uncanny mix of adult and child from growing up in a healthy environment. Nothing has been explicitly stated so far, but there's a lot of little one-off lines that indicate that something in his former home life forced him to grow up way too early, and whatever happened, it was neither fun nor cute. There's a tragic undercurrent to every laugh, whether it's due to Kotaro or the hot messes that are the other adult tenants in his building, that keeps it from becoming cloying or too-sentimental. If anything, it's a bit too real of a reminder that children are denied their childhoods every day.       James Beckett  Rating:                I turned 30 this year, and the older I get, the happier I am to see domestic anime that focus on more “adult” issues. Despite the very peculiar and almost fantastical nature of its premise, Kotaro Lives Alone is right up my alley. Shin Karino is exactly the kind of protagonist that I'm interested in seeing more of these days: a real human person who deals with real everyday struggles. He's trying to rekindle his creative spark and salvage his career as a manga artist; he's got to deal with his colorful and bizarre neighbors; he even throws out his back just getting up from the table (it happens to the best of us, my man, don't sweat it). The only “weird” angle to Shin's life is that he's suddenly found himself involved in the day-to-day adventures of an incredibly precocious and eccentric four-year-old that apparently lives on his own.    This is the angle of the plot that I was unsure of, since unrealistically independent and intelligent tots are such a cliché for anime in general, but I like the way that Kotaro Lives Alone characterizes its titular tyke. The very childlike issues he goes through—figuring out how bathhouses work, successfully bandaging skinned knees, procuring a TV to watch his favorite cartoon—all contrast nicely with the jaded adults around him. Mizuki clearly has some drama in her personal life and work as a hostess, and even the outlandish Tamaru feels more grounded once you learn that he's having a hard time keeping his own family together. The jokey bits where Kotaro's “feudal lord” act clashes with his inherent immaturity could have come across as tacky or try-hard, but the show always manages to get the viewer to empathize with the boy's trials and tribulations as much as the grown-ups. Who among us hasn't also marched into a complete stranger's home just so they could tell you that you did a good job?    I only have one major complaint about Kotaro, but it's kind of a doozy: the show is pretty ugly. The art style is apparently going for this strange kind of abstraction that isn't quite Crayon Shin-chan, but all of the faces and bodies are just oddly proportioned and stretchy enough to look off-putting. It's a look that might appeal to some folks, but I just couldn't warm up to it no matter how hard I tried. Still, Kotaro Lives Alone was a very pleasant surprise, and if you can get past its rough presentation, you might come to love the kid just as much as his neighbors do.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Watching this episode, I couldn't decide whether I wanted to laugh or cry—and I suspect that's exactly what the creators were aiming for. After all, it's got a setup that is either inherently comedic or inherently tragic depending on the tone of the work. And let's be clear here, Kotaro Lives Alone works hard to walk the line right between them.    First, the comedic side of things. We have a four-year-old kid doing all the things a person living alone for the first time needs to do. 90% of the time, he does it just as well as any adult, which leads us to assume that this is his norm. The humor, therefore, comes from the unpredictable moments when he acts like the child he actually is, betraying our expectations in an obvious way. (This is exact same joke framework used for Stewie and Brian in Family Guy). It's an easy way to get a laugh, especially if you care for the character.    Then there's the tragic side of things. We have a kid, ostensibly with no parents, living alone in a rundown apartment building and surrounded by unscrupulous adults. Worse yet, he has a streetwise mindset that no child his age should have—such as knowing how to bring down the swelling from crying too much—which has some heartbreaking implications. Moreover, he clearly still wants to be loved: to have his hair washed by an adult and be praised for doing something on his own for the first time.    But the real hook of the show is that everyone in that apartment building is just as alone as Kotaro is. We have a manga artist who is struggling to live up to his breakout hit; a hostess who escapes her financially abusive boyfriend by getting drunk; and a low-level mobster who isn't allowed to meet his son anymore. Despite their circumstances, this group of broken people has a chance to become something by stepping up and becoming the family Kotaro so desperately needs. It's a show that plays with your emotions in the best way—and one I will most certainly be watching to the end.      Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                Is it weird to say the thing this premiere most reminded me of was Garfield fancomics? Not like, the body-horror ones that go viral on Twitter every once in a while, but the more grounded and dramatic ones that try to apply a sense of emotional realism to the static, archetypal characters of the eternal comic strip. Because the premise of this one – an eccentric kid named Kotaro Lives Alone in a low-rent apartment block and gets into low stakes adventures with his adult neighbors – feels like something you could find running for 20 years in a newspaper comic. That is, until it starts slipping in darker punchlines with much more serious implications.    It's an odd balance to strike, and not one this first episode totally manages to keep. There are long stretches of this episode that are just a couple of jokes being repeated and iterated upon without much escalation or change. Likewise, the initial shock of the implications about Kotaro's life before he wound up a Pre-K lease-holder wears off fairly quickly, and once those hints keep piling up it becomes decidedly harder to chuckle at him strutting around town with his plastic samurai sword. There's definitely a version of this setup that can work – be great even – but as of this premiere it doesn't feel like they've figured out the right formula.    Like sure, there are a handful of moments that are funny, or charming, or bittersweet, but they stand as isolated incidents that don't coalesce quite right. And since they don't properly gel, it winds up feeling like each fraction of what this show's going for is struggling for attention. Are you enjoying this silly segment of Kotaro being pestered by a bird? Well that's over so we can have him learn about his neighbor's failed marriage and struggle for visitation rights with his young son. Are you feeling compelled by Kotaro slowly letting his neighbor in, and perhaps accidentally admitting to his own loneliness? Try to hold onto that feeling while he and Kotaro walk around the supermarket and the guy freaks out over the thought of having an unknown baby of his own.    The upside is the entire series is already up on Netflix, so it's not much of a wait to see if things start to mesh better moving forward. And there is something genuinely engaging to this material – if nothing else Kotaro's striking eyes and bizarre speech patterns kept my attention through the entire first episode. So hopefully this can congeal into the best form of itself, because there's definitely potential here.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          2 comments       Akari Akase's Ending Theme Song for My Dress-Up Darling Anime Streamed 7 Million Times   Apr 16, 13:35 2 comments                 music    Music video debuted on January 9 ― The music video for Akari Akase's ""Koi no Yukue"" (Where Love Is), the ending theme song for the television anime of Shinichi Fukuda's My Dress-Up Darling (Sono Bisque Doll wa Koi wo Suru), has been streamed over seven million times since its release about three months ago.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Kotaro Lives Alone   Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Kotaro Lives Alone (ONA) ?                     Community score: 4.2              What is this?   The story centers on a 4-year-old boy named Kotarō Satо̄, who moves next door to Shin Karino, an unsuccessful manga artist. Kotarō has no parents and lives alone. Not only does he seem to earn a living, he actually seems more put together than his own strange neighbors.    Kotaro Lives Alone is based on Mami Tsumura's manga and streams on Netflix.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Because of my day job, I have a love-hate relationship with anime that feature young children. Write them well, and I'll gush over how the series really gets them; write them poorly or overly-precocious and it's difficult for me to suspend belief long enough to really get into the story. I'd heard good things about Kotaro Lives Alone, but I couldn't feel anything beyond the most cautious of optimism as I started up the first episode. I know four-year-olds, and it was hard to imagine a story where I could both believe a child is four and is capable of surviving on his own.    Somehow, miraculously, the first episode manages to strike that balance, painting a tragicomic picture of a young child who has been forced to grow up way too fast. Part of the reason it works is because of the way Kotaro wears certain affectations, such as copying the extremely formal and old-fashioned language from a samurai cartoon he likes, like a suit of armor as he imitates adult behavior. Moments like the brief shot of him reading a newspaper on the toilet – and Japanese newspapers have a lot of difficult kanji in them, at an age where a child is barely expected to read hiragana – with his little legs dangling speak volumes.    What Kotaro Lives Alone understands is that a four-year-old doesn't become this uncanny mix of adult and child from growing up in a healthy environment. Nothing has been explicitly stated so far, but there's a lot of little one-off lines that indicate that something in his former home life forced him to grow up way too early, and whatever happened, it was neither fun nor cute. There's a tragic undercurrent to every laugh, whether it's due to Kotaro or the hot messes that are the other adult tenants in his building, that keeps it from becoming cloying or too-sentimental. If anything, it's a bit too real of a reminder that children are denied their childhoods every day.       James Beckett  Rating:                I turned 30 this year, and the older I get, the happier I am to see domestic anime that focus on more “adult” issues. Despite the very peculiar and almost fantastical nature of its premise, Kotaro Lives Alone is right up my alley. Shin Karino is exactly the kind of protagonist that I'm interested in seeing more of these days: a real human person who deals with real everyday struggles. He's trying to rekindle his creative spark and salvage his career as a manga artist; he's got to deal with his colorful and bizarre neighbors; he even throws out his back just getting up from the table (it happens to the best of us, my man, don't sweat it). The only “weird” angle to Shin's life is that he's suddenly found himself involved in the day-to-day adventures of an incredibly precocious and eccentric four-year-old that apparently lives on his own.    This is the angle of the plot that I was unsure of, since unrealistically independent and intelligent tots are such a cliché for anime in general, but I like the way that Kotaro Lives Alone characterizes its titular tyke. The very childlike issues he goes through—figuring out how bathhouses work, successfully bandaging skinned knees, procuring a TV to watch his favorite cartoon—all contrast nicely with the jaded adults around him. Mizuki clearly has some drama in her personal life and work as a hostess, and even the outlandish Tamaru feels more grounded once you learn that he's having a hard time keeping his own family together. The jokey bits where Kotaro's “feudal lord” act clashes with his inherent immaturity could have come across as tacky or try-hard, but the show always manages to get the viewer to empathize with the boy's trials and tribulations as much as the grown-ups. Who among us hasn't also marched into a complete stranger's home just so they could tell you that you did a good job?    I only have one major complaint about Kotaro, but it's kind of a doozy: the show is pretty ugly. The art style is apparently going for this strange kind of abstraction that isn't quite Crayon Shin-chan, but all of the faces and bodies are just oddly proportioned and stretchy enough to look off-putting. It's a look that might appeal to some folks, but I just couldn't warm up to it no matter how hard I tried. Still, Kotaro Lives Alone was a very pleasant surprise, and if you can get past its rough presentation, you might come to love the kid just as much as his neighbors do.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Watching this episode, I couldn't decide whether I wanted to laugh or cry—and I suspect that's exactly what the creators were aiming for. After all, it's got a setup that is either inherently comedic or inherently tragic depending on the tone of the work. And let's be clear here, Kotaro Lives Alone works hard to walk the line right between them.    First, the comedic side of things. We have a four-year-old kid doing all the things a person living alone for the first time needs to do. 90% of the time, he does it just as well as any adult, which leads us to assume that this is his norm. The humor, therefore, comes from the unpredictable moments when he acts like the child he actually is, betraying our expectations in an obvious way. (This is exact same joke framework used for Stewie and Brian in Family Guy). It's an easy way to get a laugh, especially if you care for the character.    Then there's the tragic side of things. We have a kid, ostensibly with no parents, living alone in a rundown apartment building and surrounded by unscrupulous adults. Worse yet, he has a streetwise mindset that no child his age should have—such as knowing how to bring down the swelling from crying too much—which has some heartbreaking implications. Moreover, he clearly still wants to be loved: to have his hair washed by an adult and be praised for doing something on his own for the first time.    But the real hook of the show is that everyone in that apartment building is just as alone as Kotaro is. We have a manga artist who is struggling to live up to his breakout hit; a hostess who escapes her financially abusive boyfriend by getting drunk; and a low-level mobster who isn't allowed to meet his son anymore. Despite their circumstances, this group of broken people has a chance to become something by stepping up and becoming the family Kotaro so desperately needs. It's a show that plays with your emotions in the best way—and one I will most certainly be watching to the end.      Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                Is it weird to say the thing this premiere most reminded me of was Garfield fancomics? Not like, the body-horror ones that go viral on Twitter every once in a while, but the more grounded and dramatic ones that try to apply a sense of emotional realism to the static, archetypal characters of the eternal comic strip. Because the premise of this one – an eccentric kid named Kotaro Lives Alone in a low-rent apartment block and gets into low stakes adventures with his adult neighbors – feels like something you could find running for 20 years in a newspaper comic. That is, until it starts slipping in darker punchlines with much more serious implications.    It's an odd balance to strike, and not one this first episode totally manages to keep. There are long stretches of this episode that are just a couple of jokes being repeated and iterated upon without much escalation or change. Likewise, the initial shock of the implications about Kotaro's life before he wound up a Pre-K lease-holder wears off fairly quickly, and once those hints keep piling up it becomes decidedly harder to chuckle at him strutting around town with his plastic samurai sword. There's definitely a version of this setup that can work – be great even – but as of this premiere it doesn't feel like they've figured out the right formula.    Like sure, there are a handful of moments that are funny, or charming, or bittersweet, but they stand as isolated incidents that don't coalesce quite right. And since they don't properly gel, it winds up feeling like each fraction of what this show's going for is struggling for attention. Are you enjoying this silly segment of Kotaro being pestered by a bird? Well that's over so we can have him learn about his neighbor's failed marriage and struggle for visitation rights with his young son. Are you feeling compelled by Kotaro slowly letting his neighbor in, and perhaps accidentally admitting to his own loneliness? Try to hold onto that feeling while he and Kotaro walk around the supermarket and the guy freaks out over the thought of having an unknown baby of his own.    The upside is the entire series is already up on Netflix, so it's not much of a wait to see if things start to mesh better moving forward. And there is something genuinely engaging to this material – if nothing else Kotaro's striking eyes and bizarre speech patterns kept my attention through the entire first episode. So hopefully this can congeal into the best form of itself, because there's definitely potential here.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          2 comments       Akari Akase's Ending Theme Song for My Dress-Up Darling Anime Streamed 7 Million Times   Apr 16, 13:35 2 comments                 music    Music video debuted on January 9 ― The music video for Akari Akase's ""Koi no Yukue"" (Where Love Is), the ending theme song for the television anime of Shinichi Fukuda's My Dress-Up Darling (Sono Bisque Doll wa Koi wo Suru), has been streamed over seven million times since its release about three months ago.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Kotaro Lives Alone   Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Kotaro Lives Alone (ONA) ?                     Community score: 4.2              What is this?   The story centers on a 4-year-old boy named Kotarō Satо̄, who moves next door to Shin Karino, an unsuccessful manga artist. Kotarō has no parents and lives alone. Not only does he seem to earn a living, he actually seems more put together than his own strange neighbors.    Kotaro Lives Alone is based on Mami Tsumura's manga and streams on Netflix.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Because of my day job, I have a love-hate relationship with anime that feature young children. Write them well, and I'll gush over how the series really gets them; write them poorly or overly-precocious and it's difficult for me to suspend belief long enough to really get into the story. I'd heard good things about Kotaro Lives Alone, but I couldn't feel anything beyond the most cautious of optimism as I started up the first episode. I know four-year-olds, and it was hard to imagine a story where I could both believe a child is four and is capable of surviving on his own.    Somehow, miraculously, the first episode manages to strike that balance, painting a tragicomic picture of a young child who has been forced to grow up way too fast. Part of the reason it works is because of the way Kotaro wears certain affectations, such as copying the extremely formal and old-fashioned language from a samurai cartoon he likes, like a suit of armor as he imitates adult behavior. Moments like the brief shot of him reading a newspaper on the toilet – and Japanese newspapers have a lot of difficult kanji in them, at an age where a child is barely expected to read hiragana – with his little legs dangling speak volumes.    What Kotaro Lives Alone understands is that a four-year-old doesn't become this uncanny mix of adult and child from growing up in a healthy environment. Nothing has been explicitly stated so far, but there's a lot of little one-off lines that indicate that something in his former home life forced him to grow up way too early, and whatever happened, it was neither fun nor cute. There's a tragic undercurrent to every laugh, whether it's due to Kotaro or the hot messes that are the other adult tenants in his building, that keeps it from becoming cloying or too-sentimental. If anything, it's a bit too real of a reminder that children are denied their childhoods every day.       James Beckett  Rating:                I turned 30 this year, and the older I get, the happier I am to see domestic anime that focus on more “adult” issues. Despite the very peculiar and almost fantastical nature of its premise, Kotaro Lives Alone is right up my alley. Shin Karino is exactly the kind of protagonist that I'm interested in seeing more of these days: a real human person who deals with real everyday struggles. He's trying to rekindle his creative spark and salvage his career as a manga artist; he's got to deal with his colorful and bizarre neighbors; he even throws out his back just getting up from the table (it happens to the best of us, my man, don't sweat it). The only “weird” angle to Shin's life is that he's suddenly found himself involved in the day-to-day adventures of an incredibly precocious and eccentric four-year-old that apparently lives on his own.    This is the angle of the plot that I was unsure of, since unrealistically independent and intelligent tots are such a cliché for anime in general, but I like the way that Kotaro Lives Alone characterizes its titular tyke. The very childlike issues he goes through—figuring out how bathhouses work, successfully bandaging skinned knees, procuring a TV to watch his favorite cartoon—all contrast nicely with the jaded adults around him. Mizuki clearly has some drama in her personal life and work as a hostess, and even the outlandish Tamaru feels more grounded once you learn that he's having a hard time keeping his own family together. The jokey bits where Kotaro's “feudal lord” act clashes with his inherent immaturity could have come across as tacky or try-hard, but the show always manages to get the viewer to empathize with the boy's trials and tribulations as much as the grown-ups. Who among us hasn't also marched into a complete stranger's home just so they could tell you that you did a good job?    I only have one major complaint about Kotaro, but it's kind of a doozy: the show is pretty ugly. The art style is apparently going for this strange kind of abstraction that isn't quite Crayon Shin-chan, but all of the faces and bodies are just oddly proportioned and stretchy enough to look off-putting. It's a look that might appeal to some folks, but I just couldn't warm up to it no matter how hard I tried. Still, Kotaro Lives Alone was a very pleasant surprise, and if you can get past its rough presentation, you might come to love the kid just as much as his neighbors do.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Watching this episode, I couldn't decide whether I wanted to laugh or cry—and I suspect that's exactly what the creators were aiming for. After all, it's got a setup that is either inherently comedic or inherently tragic depending on the tone of the work. And let's be clear here, Kotaro Lives Alone works hard to walk the line right between them.    First, the comedic side of things. We have a four-year-old kid doing all the things a person living alone for the first time needs to do. 90% of the time, he does it just as well as any adult, which leads us to assume that this is his norm. The humor, therefore, comes from the unpredictable moments when he acts like the child he actually is, betraying our expectations in an obvious way. (This is exact same joke framework used for Stewie and Brian in Family Guy). It's an easy way to get a laugh, especially if you care for the character.    Then there's the tragic side of things. We have a kid, ostensibly with no parents, living alone in a rundown apartment building and surrounded by unscrupulous adults. Worse yet, he has a streetwise mindset that no child his age should have—such as knowing how to bring down the swelling from crying too much—which has some heartbreaking implications. Moreover, he clearly still wants to be loved: to have his hair washed by an adult and be praised for doing something on his own for the first time.    But the real hook of the show is that everyone in that apartment building is just as alone as Kotaro is. We have a manga artist who is struggling to live up to his breakout hit; a hostess who escapes her financially abusive boyfriend by getting drunk; and a low-level mobster who isn't allowed to meet his son anymore. Despite their circumstances, this group of broken people has a chance to become something by stepping up and becoming the family Kotaro so desperately needs. It's a show that plays with your emotions in the best way—and one I will most certainly be watching to the end.      Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                Is it weird to say the thing this premiere most reminded me of was Garfield fancomics? Not like, the body-horror ones that go viral on Twitter every once in a while, but the more grounded and dramatic ones that try to apply a sense of emotional realism to the static, archetypal characters of the eternal comic strip. Because the premise of this one – an eccentric kid named Kotaro Lives Alone in a low-rent apartment block and gets into low stakes adventures with his adult neighbors – feels like something you could find running for 20 years in a newspaper comic. That is, until it starts slipping in darker punchlines with much more serious implications.    It's an odd balance to strike, and not one this first episode totally manages to keep. There are long stretches of this episode that are just a couple of jokes being repeated and iterated upon without much escalation or change. Likewise, the initial shock of the implications about Kotaro's life before he wound up a Pre-K lease-holder wears off fairly quickly, and once those hints keep piling up it becomes decidedly harder to chuckle at him strutting around town with his plastic samurai sword. There's definitely a version of this setup that can work – be great even – but as of this premiere it doesn't feel like they've figured out the right formula.    Like sure, there are a handful of moments that are funny, or charming, or bittersweet, but they stand as isolated incidents that don't coalesce quite right. And since they don't properly gel, it winds up feeling like each fraction of what this show's going for is struggling for attention. Are you enjoying this silly segment of Kotaro being pestered by a bird? Well that's over so we can have him learn about his neighbor's failed marriage and struggle for visitation rights with his young son. Are you feeling compelled by Kotaro slowly letting his neighbor in, and perhaps accidentally admitting to his own loneliness? Try to hold onto that feeling while he and Kotaro walk around the supermarket and the guy freaks out over the thought of having an unknown baby of his own.    The upside is the entire series is already up on Netflix, so it's not much of a wait to see if things start to mesh better moving forward. And there is something genuinely engaging to this material – if nothing else Kotaro's striking eyes and bizarre speech patterns kept my attention through the entire first episode. So hopefully this can congeal into the best form of itself, because there's definitely potential here.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          2 comments       Akari Akase's Ending Theme Song for My Dress-Up Darling Anime Streamed 7 Million Times   Apr 16, 13:35 2 comments                 music    Music video debuted on January 9 ― The music video for Akari Akase's ""Koi no Yukue"" (Where Love Is), the ending theme song for the television anime of Shinichi Fukuda's My Dress-Up Darling (Sono Bisque Doll wa Koi wo Suru), has been streamed over seven million times since its release about three months ago.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Kotaro Lives Alone   Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Kotaro Lives Alone (ONA) ?                     Community score: 4.2              What is this?   The story centers on a 4-year-old boy named Kotarō Satо̄, who moves next door to Shin Karino, an unsuccessful manga artist. Kotarō has no parents and lives alone. Not only does he seem to earn a living, he actually seems more put together than his own strange neighbors.    Kotaro Lives Alone is based on Mami Tsumura's manga and streams on Netflix.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Because of my day job, I have a love-hate relationship with anime that feature young children. Write them well, and I'll gush over how the series really gets them; write them poorly or overly-precocious and it's difficult for me to suspend belief long enough to really get into the story. I'd heard good things about Kotaro Lives Alone, but I couldn't feel anything beyond the most cautious of optimism as I started up the first episode. I know four-year-olds, and it was hard to imagine a story where I could both believe a child is four and is capable of surviving on his own.    Somehow, miraculously, the first episode manages to strike that balance, painting a tragicomic picture of a young child who has been forced to grow up way too fast. Part of the reason it works is because of the way Kotaro wears certain affectations, such as copying the extremely formal and old-fashioned language from a samurai cartoon he likes, like a suit of armor as he imitates adult behavior. Moments like the brief shot of him reading a newspaper on the toilet – and Japanese newspapers have a lot of difficult kanji in them, at an age where a child is barely expected to read hiragana – with his little legs dangling speak volumes.    What Kotaro Lives Alone understands is that a four-year-old doesn't become this uncanny mix of adult and child from growing up in a healthy environment. Nothing has been explicitly stated so far, but there's a lot of little one-off lines that indicate that something in his former home life forced him to grow up way too early, and whatever happened, it was neither fun nor cute. There's a tragic undercurrent to every laugh, whether it's due to Kotaro or the hot messes that are the other adult tenants in his building, that keeps it from becoming cloying or too-sentimental. If anything, it's a bit too real of a reminder that children are denied their childhoods every day.       James Beckett  Rating:                I turned 30 this year, and the older I get, the happier I am to see domestic anime that focus on more “adult” issues. Despite the very peculiar and almost fantastical nature of its premise, Kotaro Lives Alone is right up my alley. Shin Karino is exactly the kind of protagonist that I'm interested in seeing more of these days: a real human person who deals with real everyday struggles. He's trying to rekindle his creative spark and salvage his career as a manga artist; he's got to deal with his colorful and bizarre neighbors; he even throws out his back just getting up from the table (it happens to the best of us, my man, don't sweat it). The only “weird” angle to Shin's life is that he's suddenly found himself involved in the day-to-day adventures of an incredibly precocious and eccentric four-year-old that apparently lives on his own.    This is the angle of the plot that I was unsure of, since unrealistically independent and intelligent tots are such a cliché for anime in general, but I like the way that Kotaro Lives Alone characterizes its titular tyke. The very childlike issues he goes through—figuring out how bathhouses work, successfully bandaging skinned knees, procuring a TV to watch his favorite cartoon—all contrast nicely with the jaded adults around him. Mizuki clearly has some drama in her personal life and work as a hostess, and even the outlandish Tamaru feels more grounded once you learn that he's having a hard time keeping his own family together. The jokey bits where Kotaro's “feudal lord” act clashes with his inherent immaturity could have come across as tacky or try-hard, but the show always manages to get the viewer to empathize with the boy's trials and tribulations as much as the grown-ups. Who among us hasn't also marched into a complete stranger's home just so they could tell you that you did a good job?    I only have one major complaint about Kotaro, but it's kind of a doozy: the show is pretty ugly. The art style is apparently going for this strange kind of abstraction that isn't quite Crayon Shin-chan, but all of the faces and bodies are just oddly proportioned and stretchy enough to look off-putting. It's a look that might appeal to some folks, but I just couldn't warm up to it no matter how hard I tried. Still, Kotaro Lives Alone was a very pleasant surprise, and if you can get past its rough presentation, you might come to love the kid just as much as his neighbors do.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Watching this episode, I couldn't decide whether I wanted to laugh or cry—and I suspect that's exactly what the creators were aiming for. After all, it's got a setup that is either inherently comedic or inherently tragic depending on the tone of the work. And let's be clear here, Kotaro Lives Alone works hard to walk the line right between them.    First, the comedic side of things. We have a four-year-old kid doing all the things a person living alone for the first time needs to do. 90% of the time, he does it just as well as any adult, which leads us to assume that this is his norm. The humor, therefore, comes from the unpredictable moments when he acts like the child he actually is, betraying our expectations in an obvious way. (This is exact same joke framework used for Stewie and Brian in Family Guy). It's an easy way to get a laugh, especially if you care for the character.    Then there's the tragic side of things. We have a kid, ostensibly with no parents, living alone in a rundown apartment building and surrounded by unscrupulous adults. Worse yet, he has a streetwise mindset that no child his age should have—such as knowing how to bring down the swelling from crying too much—which has some heartbreaking implications. Moreover, he clearly still wants to be loved: to have his hair washed by an adult and be praised for doing something on his own for the first time.    But the real hook of the show is that everyone in that apartment building is just as alone as Kotaro is. We have a manga artist who is struggling to live up to his breakout hit; a hostess who escapes her financially abusive boyfriend by getting drunk; and a low-level mobster who isn't allowed to meet his son anymore. Despite their circumstances, this group of broken people has a chance to become something by stepping up and becoming the family Kotaro so desperately needs. It's a show that plays with your emotions in the best way—and one I will most certainly be watching to the end.      Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                Is it weird to say the thing this premiere most reminded me of was Garfield fancomics? Not like, the body-horror ones that go viral on Twitter every once in a while, but the more grounded and dramatic ones that try to apply a sense of emotional realism to the static, archetypal characters of the eternal comic strip. Because the premise of this one – an eccentric kid named Kotaro Lives Alone in a low-rent apartment block and gets into low stakes adventures with his adult neighbors – feels like something you could find running for 20 years in a newspaper comic. That is, until it starts slipping in darker punchlines with much more serious implications.    It's an odd balance to strike, and not one this first episode totally manages to keep. There are long stretches of this episode that are just a couple of jokes being repeated and iterated upon without much escalation or change. Likewise, the initial shock of the implications about Kotaro's life before he wound up a Pre-K lease-holder wears off fairly quickly, and once those hints keep piling up it becomes decidedly harder to chuckle at him strutting around town with his plastic samurai sword. There's definitely a version of this setup that can work – be great even – but as of this premiere it doesn't feel like they've figured out the right formula.    Like sure, there are a handful of moments that are funny, or charming, or bittersweet, but they stand as isolated incidents that don't coalesce quite right. And since they don't properly gel, it winds up feeling like each fraction of what this show's going for is struggling for attention. Are you enjoying this silly segment of Kotaro being pestered by a bird? Well that's over so we can have him learn about his neighbor's failed marriage and struggle for visitation rights with his young son. Are you feeling compelled by Kotaro slowly letting his neighbor in, and perhaps accidentally admitting to his own loneliness? Try to hold onto that feeling while he and Kotaro walk around the supermarket and the guy freaks out over the thought of having an unknown baby of his own.    The upside is the entire series is already up on Netflix, so it's not much of a wait to see if things start to mesh better moving forward. And there is something genuinely engaging to this material – if nothing else Kotaro's striking eyes and bizarre speech patterns kept my attention through the entire first episode. So hopefully this can congeal into the best form of itself, because there's definitely potential here.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          2 comments       Akari Akase's Ending Theme Song for My Dress-Up Darling Anime Streamed 7 Million Times   Apr 16, 13:35 2 comments                 music    Music video debuted on January 9 ― The music video for Akari Akase's ""Koi no Yukue"" (Where Love Is), the ending theme song for the television anime of Shinichi Fukuda's My Dress-Up Darling (Sono Bisque Doll wa Koi wo Suru), has been streamed over seven million times since its release about three months ago.

Well that's over so we can have him learn about his neighbor's failed marriage and struggle for visitation rights with his young son. Are you feeling compelled by Kotaro slowly letting his neighbor in, and perhaps accidentally admitting to his own loneliness? Try to hold onto that feeling while he and Kotaro walk around the supermarket and the guy freaks out over the thought of having an unknown baby of his own.    The upside is the entire series is already up on Netflix, so it's not much of a wait to see if things start to mesh better moving forward. And there is something genuinely engaging to this material – if nothing else Kotaro's striking eyes and bizarre speech patterns kept my attention through the entire first episode.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Kotaro Lives Alone   Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Kotaro Lives Alone (ONA) ?                     Community score: 4.2              What is this?   The story centers on a 4-year-old boy named Kotarō Satо̄, who moves next door to Shin Karino, an unsuccessful manga artist. Kotarō has no parents and lives alone. Not only does he seem to earn a living, he actually seems more put together than his own strange neighbors.    Kotaro Lives Alone is based on Mami Tsumura's manga and streams on Netflix.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Because of my day job, I have a love-hate relationship with anime that feature young children. Write them well, and I'll gush over how the series really gets them; write them poorly or overly-precocious and it's difficult for me to suspend belief long enough to really get into the story. I'd heard good things about Kotaro Lives Alone, but I couldn't feel anything beyond the most cautious of optimism as I started up the first episode. I know four-year-olds, and it was hard to imagine a story where I could both believe a child is four and is capable of surviving on his own.    Somehow, miraculously, the first episode manages to strike that balance, painting a tragicomic picture of a young child who has been forced to grow up way too fast. Part of the reason it works is because of the way Kotaro wears certain affectations, such as copying the extremely formal and old-fashioned language from a samurai cartoon he likes, like a suit of armor as he imitates adult behavior. Moments like the brief shot of him reading a newspaper on the toilet – and Japanese newspapers have a lot of difficult kanji in them, at an age where a child is barely expected to read hiragana – with his little legs dangling speak volumes.    What Kotaro Lives Alone understands is that a four-year-old doesn't become this uncanny mix of adult and child from growing up in a healthy environment. Nothing has been explicitly stated so far, but there's a lot of little one-off lines that indicate that something in his former home life forced him to grow up way too early, and whatever happened, it was neither fun nor cute. There's a tragic undercurrent to every laugh, whether it's due to Kotaro or the hot messes that are the other adult tenants in his building, that keeps it from becoming cloying or too-sentimental. If anything, it's a bit too real of a reminder that children are denied their childhoods every day.       James Beckett  Rating:                I turned 30 this year, and the older I get, the happier I am to see domestic anime that focus on more “adult” issues. Despite the very peculiar and almost fantastical nature of its premise, Kotaro Lives Alone is right up my alley. Shin Karino is exactly the kind of protagonist that I'm interested in seeing more of these days: a real human person who deals with real everyday struggles. He's trying to rekindle his creative spark and salvage his career as a manga artist; he's got to deal with his colorful and bizarre neighbors; he even throws out his back just getting up from the table (it happens to the best of us, my man, don't sweat it). The only “weird” angle to Shin's life is that he's suddenly found himself involved in the day-to-day adventures of an incredibly precocious and eccentric four-year-old that apparently lives on his own.    This is the angle of the plot that I was unsure of, since unrealistically independent and intelligent tots are such a cliché for anime in general, but I like the way that Kotaro Lives Alone characterizes its titular tyke. The very childlike issues he goes through—figuring out how bathhouses work, successfully bandaging skinned knees, procuring a TV to watch his favorite cartoon—all contrast nicely with the jaded adults around him. Mizuki clearly has some drama in her personal life and work as a hostess, and even the outlandish Tamaru feels more grounded once you learn that he's having a hard time keeping his own family together. The jokey bits where Kotaro's “feudal lord” act clashes with his inherent immaturity could have come across as tacky or try-hard, but the show always manages to get the viewer to empathize with the boy's trials and tribulations as much as the grown-ups. Who among us hasn't also marched into a complete stranger's home just so they could tell you that you did a good job?    I only have one major complaint about Kotaro, but it's kind of a doozy: the show is pretty ugly. The art style is apparently going for this strange kind of abstraction that isn't quite Crayon Shin-chan, but all of the faces and bodies are just oddly proportioned and stretchy enough to look off-putting. It's a look that might appeal to some folks, but I just couldn't warm up to it no matter how hard I tried. Still, Kotaro Lives Alone was a very pleasant surprise, and if you can get past its rough presentation, you might come to love the kid just as much as his neighbors do.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Watching this episode, I couldn't decide whether I wanted to laugh or cry—and I suspect that's exactly what the creators were aiming for. After all, it's got a setup that is either inherently comedic or inherently tragic depending on the tone of the work. And let's be clear here, Kotaro Lives Alone works hard to walk the line right between them.    First, the comedic side of things. We have a four-year-old kid doing all the things a person living alone for the first time needs to do. 90% of the time, he does it just as well as any adult, which leads us to assume that this is his norm. The humor, therefore, comes from the unpredictable moments when he acts like the child he actually is, betraying our expectations in an obvious way. (This is exact same joke framework used for Stewie and Brian in Family Guy). It's an easy way to get a laugh, especially if you care for the character.    Then there's the tragic side of things. We have a kid, ostensibly with no parents, living alone in a rundown apartment building and surrounded by unscrupulous adults. Worse yet, he has a streetwise mindset that no child his age should have—such as knowing how to bring down the swelling from crying too much—which has some heartbreaking implications. Moreover, he clearly still wants to be loved: to have his hair washed by an adult and be praised for doing something on his own for the first time.    But the real hook of the show is that everyone in that apartment building is just as alone as Kotaro is. We have a manga artist who is struggling to live up to his breakout hit; a hostess who escapes her financially abusive boyfriend by getting drunk; and a low-level mobster who isn't allowed to meet his son anymore. Despite their circumstances, this group of broken people has a chance to become something by stepping up and becoming the family Kotaro so desperately needs. It's a show that plays with your emotions in the best way—and one I will most certainly be watching to the end.      Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                Is it weird to say the thing this premiere most reminded me of was Garfield fancomics? Not like, the body-horror ones that go viral on Twitter every once in a while, but the more grounded and dramatic ones that try to apply a sense of emotional realism to the static, archetypal characters of the eternal comic strip. Because the premise of this one – an eccentric kid named Kotaro Lives Alone in a low-rent apartment block and gets into low stakes adventures with his adult neighbors – feels like something you could find running for 20 years in a newspaper comic. That is, until it starts slipping in darker punchlines with much more serious implications.    It's an odd balance to strike, and not one this first episode totally manages to keep. There are long stretches of this episode that are just a couple of jokes being repeated and iterated upon without much escalation or change. Likewise, the initial shock of the implications about Kotaro's life before he wound up a Pre-K lease-holder wears off fairly quickly, and once those hints keep piling up it becomes decidedly harder to chuckle at him strutting around town with his plastic samurai sword. There's definitely a version of this setup that can work – be great even – but as of this premiere it doesn't feel like they've figured out the right formula.    Like sure, there are a handful of moments that are funny, or charming, or bittersweet, but they stand as isolated incidents that don't coalesce quite right. And since they don't properly gel, it winds up feeling like each fraction of what this show's going for is struggling for attention.

Are you feeling compelled by Kotaro slowly letting his neighbor in, and perhaps accidentally admitting to his own loneliness? Try to hold onto that feeling while he and Kotaro walk around the supermarket and the guy freaks out over the thought of having an unknown baby of his own.    The upside is the entire series is already up on Netflix, so it's not much of a wait to see if things start to mesh better moving forward.

Community score: 4.2              What is this?   The story centers on a 4-year-old boy named Kotarō Satо̄, who moves next door to Shin Karino, an unsuccessful manga artist. Kotarō has no parents and lives alone. Not only does he seem to earn a living, he actually seems more put together than his own strange neighbors.    Kotaro Lives Alone is based on Mami Tsumura's manga and streams on Netflix.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Because of my day job, I have a love-hate relationship with anime that feature young children. Write them well, and I'll gush over how the series really gets them; write them poorly or overly-precocious and it's difficult for me to suspend belief long enough to really get into the story. I'd heard good things about Kotaro Lives Alone, but I couldn't feel anything beyond the most cautious of optimism as I started up the first episode. I know four-year-olds, and it was hard to imagine a story where I could both believe a child is four and is capable of surviving on his own.    Somehow, miraculously, the first episode manages to strike that balance, painting a tragicomic picture of a young child who has been forced to grow up way too fast. Part of the reason it works is because of the way Kotaro wears certain affectations, such as copying the extremely formal and old-fashioned language from a samurai cartoon he likes, like a suit of armor as he imitates adult behavior. Moments like the brief shot of him reading a newspaper on the toilet – and Japanese newspapers have a lot of difficult kanji in them, at an age where a child is barely expected to read hiragana – with his little legs dangling speak volumes.    What Kotaro Lives Alone understands is that a four-year-old doesn't become this uncanny mix of adult and child from growing up in a healthy environment. Nothing has been explicitly stated so far, but there's a lot of little one-off lines that indicate that something in his former home life forced him to grow up way too early, and whatever happened, it was neither fun nor cute. There's a tragic undercurrent to every laugh, whether it's due to Kotaro or the hot messes that are the other adult tenants in his building, that keeps it from becoming cloying or too-sentimental. If anything, it's a bit too real of a reminder that children are denied their childhoods every day.       James Beckett  Rating:                I turned 30 this year, and the older I get, the happier I am to see domestic anime that focus on more “adult” issues. Despite the very peculiar and almost fantastical nature of its premise, Kotaro Lives Alone is right up my alley. Shin Karino is exactly the kind of protagonist that I'm interested in seeing more of these days: a real human person who deals with real everyday struggles. He's trying to rekindle his creative spark and salvage his career as a manga artist; he's got to deal with his colorful and bizarre neighbors; he even throws out his back just getting up from the table (it happens to the best of us, my man, don't sweat it). The only “weird” angle to Shin's life is that he's suddenly found himself involved in the day-to-day adventures of an incredibly precocious and eccentric four-year-old that apparently lives on his own.    This is the angle of the plot that I was unsure of, since unrealistically independent and intelligent tots are such a cliché for anime in general, but I like the way that Kotaro Lives Alone characterizes its titular tyke. The very childlike issues he goes through—figuring out how bathhouses work, successfully bandaging skinned knees, procuring a TV to watch his favorite cartoon—all contrast nicely with the jaded adults around him. Mizuki clearly has some drama in her personal life and work as a hostess, and even the outlandish Tamaru feels more grounded once you learn that he's having a hard time keeping his own family together. The jokey bits where Kotaro's “feudal lord” act clashes with his inherent immaturity could have come across as tacky or try-hard, but the show always manages to get the viewer to empathize with the boy's trials and tribulations as much as the grown-ups. Who among us hasn't also marched into a complete stranger's home just so they could tell you that you did a good job?    I only have one major complaint about Kotaro, but it's kind of a doozy: the show is pretty ugly. The art style is apparently going for this strange kind of abstraction that isn't quite Crayon Shin-chan, but all of the faces and bodies are just oddly proportioned and stretchy enough to look off-putting. It's a look that might appeal to some folks, but I just couldn't warm up to it no matter how hard I tried. Still, Kotaro Lives Alone was a very pleasant surprise, and if you can get past its rough presentation, you might come to love the kid just as much as his neighbors do.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Watching this episode, I couldn't decide whether I wanted to laugh or cry—and I suspect that's exactly what the creators were aiming for. After all, it's got a setup that is either inherently comedic or inherently tragic depending on the tone of the work. And let's be clear here, Kotaro Lives Alone works hard to walk the line right between them.    First, the comedic side of things. We have a four-year-old kid doing all the things a person living alone for the first time needs to do. 90% of the time, he does it just as well as any adult, which leads us to assume that this is his norm. The humor, therefore, comes from the unpredictable moments when he acts like the child he actually is, betraying our expectations in an obvious way. (This is exact same joke framework used for Stewie and Brian in Family Guy). It's an easy way to get a laugh, especially if you care for the character.    Then there's the tragic side of things. We have a kid, ostensibly with no parents, living alone in a rundown apartment building and surrounded by unscrupulous adults. Worse yet, he has a streetwise mindset that no child his age should have—such as knowing how to bring down the swelling from crying too much—which has some heartbreaking implications. Moreover, he clearly still wants to be loved: to have his hair washed by an adult and be praised for doing something on his own for the first time.    But the real hook of the show is that everyone in that apartment building is just as alone as Kotaro is. We have a manga artist who is struggling to live up to his breakout hit; a hostess who escapes her financially abusive boyfriend by getting drunk; and a low-level mobster who isn't allowed to meet his son anymore. Despite their circumstances, this group of broken people has a chance to become something by stepping up and becoming the family Kotaro so desperately needs. It's a show that plays with your emotions in the best way—and one I will most certainly be watching to the end.      Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                Is it weird to say the thing this premiere most reminded me of was Garfield fancomics? Not like, the body-horror ones that go viral on Twitter every once in a while, but the more grounded and dramatic ones that try to apply a sense of emotional realism to the static, archetypal characters of the eternal comic strip. Because the premise of this one – an eccentric kid named Kotaro Lives Alone in a low-rent apartment block and gets into low stakes adventures with his adult neighbors – feels like something you could find running for 20 years in a newspaper comic. That is, until it starts slipping in darker punchlines with much more serious implications.    It's an odd balance to strike, and not one this first episode totally manages to keep. There are long stretches of this episode that are just a couple of jokes being repeated and iterated upon without much escalation or change. Likewise, the initial shock of the implications about Kotaro's life before he wound up a Pre-K lease-holder wears off fairly quickly, and once those hints keep piling up it becomes decidedly harder to chuckle at him strutting around town with his plastic samurai sword. There's definitely a version of this setup that can work – be great even – but as of this premiere it doesn't feel like they've figured out the right formula.    Like sure, there are a handful of moments that are funny, or charming, or bittersweet, but they stand as isolated incidents that don't coalesce quite right. And since they don't properly gel, it winds up feeling like each fraction of what this show's going for is struggling for attention. Are you enjoying this silly segment of Kotaro being pestered by a bird? Well that's over so we can have him learn about his neighbor's failed marriage and struggle for visitation rights with his young son.

16-04-2022,anime,3,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/preview-guide/2022/spring/kotaro-lives-alone/.183654,Kotaro Lives Alone - The Spring 2022 Preview Guide - Anime News Network:SEA,"            How would you rate episode 1 of Kotaro Lives Alone (ONA) ?                     Community score: 4.2              What is this?   The story centers on a 4-year-old boy named Kotarō Satо̄, who moves next door to Shin Karino, an unsuccessful manga artist. Kotarō has no parents and lives alone. Not only does he seem to earn a living, he actually seems more put together than his own strange neighbors.    Kotaro Lives Alone is based on Mami Tsumura's manga and streams on Netflix.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Because of my day job, I have a love-hate relationship with anime that feature young children. Write them well, and I'll gush over how the series really gets them; write them poorly or overly-precocious and it's difficult for me to suspend belief long enough to really get into the story. I'd heard good things about Kotaro Lives Alone, but I couldn't feel anything beyond the most cautious of optimism as I started up the first episode. I know four-year-olds, and it was hard to imagine a story where I could both believe a child is four and is capable of surviving on his own.    Somehow, miraculously, the first episode manages to strike that balance, painting a tragicomic picture of a young child who has been forced to grow up way too fast. Part of the reason it works is because of the way Kotaro wears certain affectations, such as copying the extremely formal and old-fashioned language from a samurai cartoon he likes, like a suit of armor as he imitates adult behavior. Moments like the brief shot of him reading a newspaper on the toilet – and Japanese newspapers have a lot of difficult kanji in them, at an age where a child is barely expected to read hiragana – with his little legs dangling speak volumes.    What Kotaro Lives Alone understands is that a four-year-old doesn't become this uncanny mix of adult and child from growing up in a healthy environment. Nothing has been explicitly stated so far, but there's a lot of little one-off lines that indicate that something in his former home life forced him to grow up way too early, and whatever happened, it was neither fun nor cute. There's a tragic undercurrent to every laugh, whether it's due to Kotaro or the hot messes that are the other adult tenants in his building, that keeps it from becoming cloying or too-sentimental. If anything, it's a bit too real of a reminder that children are denied their childhoods every day.       James Beckett  Rating:                I turned 30 this year, and the older I get, the happier I am to see domestic anime that focus on more “adult” issues. Despite the very peculiar and almost fantastical nature of its premise, Kotaro Lives Alone is right up my alley. Shin Karino is exactly the kind of protagonist that I'm interested in seeing more of these days: a real human person who deals with real everyday struggles. He's trying to rekindle his creative spark and salvage his career as a manga artist; he's got to deal with his colorful and bizarre neighbors; he even throws out his back just getting up from the table (it happens to the best of us, my man, don't sweat it). The only “weird” angle to Shin's life is that he's suddenly found himself involved in the day-to-day adventures of an incredibly precocious and eccentric four-year-old that apparently lives on his own.    This is the angle of the plot that I was unsure of, since unrealistically independent and intelligent tots are such a cliché for anime in general, but I like the way that Kotaro Lives Alone characterizes its titular tyke. The very childlike issues he goes through—figuring out how bathhouses work, successfully bandaging skinned knees, procuring a TV to watch his favorite cartoon—all contrast nicely with the jaded adults around him. Mizuki clearly has some drama in her personal life and work as a hostess, and even the outlandish Tamaru feels more grounded once you learn that he's having a hard time keeping his own family together. The jokey bits where Kotaro's “feudal lord” act clashes with his inherent immaturity could have come across as tacky or try-hard, but the show always manages to get the viewer to empathize with the boy's trials and tribulations as much as the grown-ups. Who among us hasn't also marched into a complete stranger's home just so they could tell you that you did a good job?    I only have one major complaint about Kotaro, but it's kind of a doozy: the show is pretty ugly. The art style is apparently going for this strange kind of abstraction that isn't quite Crayon Shin-chan, but all of the faces and bodies are just oddly proportioned and stretchy enough to look off-putting. It's a look that might appeal to some folks, but I just couldn't warm up to it no matter how hard I tried. Still, Kotaro Lives Alone was a very pleasant surprise, and if you can get past its rough presentation, you might come to love the kid just as much as his neighbors do.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Watching this episode, I couldn't decide whether I wanted to laugh or cry—and I suspect that's exactly what the creators were aiming for. After all, it's got a setup that is either inherently comedic or inherently tragic depending on the tone of the work. And let's be clear here, Kotaro Lives Alone works hard to walk the line right between them.    First, the comedic side of things. We have a four-year-old kid doing all the things a person living alone for the first time needs to do. 90% of the time, he does it just as well as any adult, which leads us to assume that this is his norm. The humor, therefore, comes from the unpredictable moments when he acts like the child he actually is, betraying our expectations in an obvious way. (This is exact same joke framework used for Stewie and Brian in Family Guy). It's an easy way to get a laugh, especially if you care for the character.    Then there's the tragic side of things. We have a kid, ostensibly with no parents, living alone in a rundown apartment building and surrounded by unscrupulous adults. Worse yet, he has a streetwise mindset that no child his age should have—such as knowing how to bring down the swelling from crying too much—which has some heartbreaking implications. Moreover, he clearly still wants to be loved: to have his hair washed by an adult and be praised for doing something on his own for the first time.    But the real hook of the show is that everyone in that apartment building is just as alone as Kotaro is. We have a manga artist who is struggling to live up to his breakout hit; a hostess who escapes her financially abusive boyfriend by getting drunk; and a low-level mobster who isn't allowed to meet his son anymore. Despite their circumstances, this group of broken people has a chance to become something by stepping up and becoming the family Kotaro so desperately needs. It's a show that plays with your emotions in the best way—and one I will most certainly be watching to the end.      Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                Is it weird to say the thing this premiere most reminded me of was Garfield fancomics? Not like, the body-horror ones that go viral on Twitter every once in a while, but the more grounded and dramatic ones that try to apply a sense of emotional realism to the static, archetypal characters of the eternal comic strip. Because the premise of this one – an eccentric kid named Kotaro Lives Alone in a low-rent apartment block and gets into low stakes adventures with his adult neighbors – feels like something you could find running for 20 years in a newspaper comic. That is, until it starts slipping in darker punchlines with much more serious implications.    It's an odd balance to strike, and not one this first episode totally manages to keep. There are long stretches of this episode that are just a couple of jokes being repeated and iterated upon without much escalation or change. Likewise, the initial shock of the implications about Kotaro's life before he wound up a Pre-K lease-holder wears off fairly quickly, and once those hints keep piling up it becomes decidedly harder to chuckle at him strutting around town with his plastic samurai sword. There's definitely a version of this setup that can work – be great even – but as of this premiere it doesn't feel like they've figured out the right formula.    Like sure, there are a handful of moments that are funny, or charming, or bittersweet, but they stand as isolated incidents that don't coalesce quite right. And since they don't properly gel, it winds up feeling like each fraction of what this show's going for is struggling for attention. Are you enjoying this silly segment of Kotaro being pestered by a bird? Well that's over so we can have him learn about his neighbor's failed marriage and struggle for visitation rights with his young son. Are you feeling compelled by Kotaro slowly letting his neighbor in, and perhaps accidentally admitting to his own loneliness? Try to hold onto that feeling while he and Kotaro walk around the supermarket and the guy freaks out over the thought of having an unknown baby of his own.    The upside is the entire series is already up on Netflix, so it's not much of a wait to see if things start to mesh better moving forward. And there is something genuinely engaging to this material – if nothing else Kotaro's striking eyes and bizarre speech patterns kept my attention through the entire first episode. So hopefully this can congeal into the best form of itself, because there's definitely potential here.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Skeleton Knight in Another World   Apr  8th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Skeleton Knight in Another World ?                     Community score: 3.5              What is this?   A gamer falls asleep—only to wake up in the world of the game he was playing. Arc has the powerful skills and weapons of his character, but there's just one problem, he's stuck looking like that character, too. An adventure in a fantastical new land awaits him, if he can get used to being a walking skeleton.    Skeleton Knight in Another World is based on  Ennki Hakari's light novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Jesus Christ. I started up Skeleton Knight in Another World determined that I wouldn't just repeat everything my fellow reviewers were saying, but that rape scene really casts a pall over the entire episode, doesn't it? Let's leave behind for a second that it's tawdry and potentially triggering and holy fuck Crunchyroll, couldn't you have tried to head it off with a warning screen for at least a couple seconds? Okay? Let's move on from that. It's still a spectacularly bad choice purely in terms of mood, character, and narrative structure.    Once the ridiculously graphic scene ends, the show jumps back to Arc waking up one day in a bunch of high-level gear from his favorite MMORPG with access to super powerful magic skills. But uh-oh! He's a skeleton! So he farts around getting excited about his powers and going gaga over an elf. He needs to interact with people in town without letting them know he's a skeleton, which I imagine is a lot like those dreams where you forget to put on clothes and now you're walking around naked trying to find something to wear before someone notices. I found its mishmash of isekai clichés boring, but I'm sure someone out there would like it, and overall it's pretty inoffensive.    Oh but wait! Back to the graphic rape! And all at once we've gone from silly skeleton antics to rape again, but this time we get to see Arc debating whether or not he should intervene. In a brutal rape. When he knows for a fact he's ridiculously overpowered. His hemming and hawing is even presented as comical, as he ponders whether it would be like entering PVP. It's extreme tonal whiplash, and the heaviness of the subject matter is out of place and totally overshadows everything else that happens. It's also a really, really bad look for Arc, especially as Tomoaki Maeno continues his goofy performance as Arc talks himself up between shots of the bandits ripping off the girl's piss-stained pantaloons, and her maid's breasts jiggling as another bandit slams her face into the ground.    And then, after a short scene of him accompanying them, we're back to goofy skeleton man enjoying some tasty food while trying not to let anyone notice he's a skeleton!! So funny!!    So, you know, it's not just about being offended about on-screen rape being used for cheap shock value. It's just a bad narrative choice all around, and deserves to be criticized for that in addition to being crass.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Holy crap. Hit that play button and you get both barrels, don't you? So let's get this out of the way first. I'm not going to say rape can't be used as a plot device, but it should be used carefully—and be integral to the plot/characters when used. It should not be used for simple shock value or for shorthand to show us the hero is good because he kills rapists.    Moving on, can I say how nice it is to see someone who's having fun being whisked away to a fantasy world as the game character they've put so much into? There's some real joy in seeing Arc play with his powers and get pumped up about seeing a real-life elf. Even better is that, even with his excitement, he's still smart enough to realize the immediate issues he has to face. Arc is way overpowered, sure, but he can't even afford a meal, and he has no idea how to clean and cook his own food.    So it makes sense that he would immediately think to do what he already has some knowledge of: become an adventurer. He doesn't complain about the entry test, and the lack of “epic quests” doesn't really matter to him as long as he can get enough for food and a place to stay. It makes him rather likeable as a character. He's not a gun-ho fool nor is he an angsty complainer. He's just a guy enjoying the cards fate has dealt him.    The bandit scene, despite its subject matter, works well on a character development level for Arc. When coming upon the bandits, Arc doesn't intervene immediately. It isn't because he doesn't care about those being harmed but rather because he thinks he might lose. This is interesting because it shows that he doesn't see the bandits as NPCs or monsters; he sees them as other players. Not only does this mean he views them as real people, but it also makes him associate what's going on with PVP—and in PVP, numbers almost always matter more than gear. That said, he does eventually step in because he feels he has to—he sees the women as real people too, after all. The whole internal conflict speaks volumes about how he views the world he has become trapped in.    Other than that, I liked the little touches the episode threw in here and there, from people noticing his armor and deciding he was a knight to him questioning why he didn't feel bad about slaughtering the bandits despite it being the first time he had ever taken a life. The subversion of him peaking over at the women not because he's a horny asshole but because he wants to make sure they aren't looking while he excitedly loots the bodies was fantastic—and can I just say I love his oversized armor with its giant pauldrons? Him riding a horse was a great visual gag. All in all, despite the rough start, I really enjoyed this episode and can't wait to see where things go from here as he inevitably forms a party and answers the call to adventure.      James Beckett  Rating:                Skeleton Knight in Another World might just be a front-runner for two Preview Guide World Records, though they are dubious achievements indeed. First off, we have the elephant in the room, which is the “Shortest Ever Gap Between A Content Warning And The Content In Question” Award. The literal first shot of this series is of a surprisingly graphic sexual assault, and I don't know what is worse: That the scene is so lascivious and needlessly cruel right off the bat, or that we're forced to watch this twice in a show that is ostensibly a breezy isekai comedy. It isn't more than five seconds after the rapists are violently vivisected in front of their already traumatized victims that we transition to the show's cheesy OP, which I must remind you serves to introduce a main character whose sole defining character trait is that he's a goofy-looking cartoon skeleton. It is as catastrophic failure to read the room as I've seen in a long ass time, and there are a good many viewers who will understandably recoil in disgust and reject this anime outright before the opening credits finish.    The second award that Skeleton Knight in Another World is up for is a far less offensive one, though it also represents a problem that you can't simply fast-forward through. It's the “You Don't Even Really Need To Watch This Show, Because Literally Everything You Could Ever Possibly Need To Know About It Is Right There In The Title” Award! If you take the “…in Another World” half of this anime's title into consideration, then practically every single element of this premiere will fall into place, immediately, in your own head, before you even set eyes on it (except perhaps for the terrible and stupid rape scene, but you get my point).    The main character is somehow reborn into a real, flesh-and-blood universe that just so happens to perfectly mirror his favorite generic fantasy MMORPG. He is improbably strong and gifted in literally every aspect of the game, and he also spends a bunch of time breaking down his “in- game” stats sheet and skill set, as if that is somehow a substitute for having actual world-building and a plot. He then meanders around, talking to people and narrating to himself about this completely bizarre and insane scenario that we've all seen play out so many times before. He also might be a genuine sociopath, since he is completely unfazed by the horrible suffering and pain that he witnesses and inflicts upon others, and seems to live only to hoard loot from the mangled corpses he leaves behind. The ”Skeleton” part of the title tells you that the main character is a skeleton.    And look, I'm a fair critic, and I will give Skeleton Knight in Another World credit where it is due: It is somewhat amusing when when the skeleton guy makes goofy faces and gets unreasonably excited about loot. I chuckled once, near the end of the episode, because of the funny skeleton faces on the screen. For that alone, I will grant this premiere a bonus half-star to its rating. Everything else about it sucks, though, so it can wear its two Premiere Guide World Record badges like the marks of dishonor that they are.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               If any other show this season has a worse start than Skeleton Knight I'll be horribly surprised. It's not “just” that this premiere starts off, from the literal first second, with an attempted rape sequence. Nor is it “just” that said scene is gratuitous and directed with an eye for titillation for the audience, and is a cheap attempt at setting up paper thin bad guys from our hero to kill. It's that this would be a gross and crummy opening for a dark fantasy like Goblin Slayer, but it's a truly abysmal first impression for a premiere that is 90% goofy bullshit with our skeleton gamer protagonist Himbo-ing his way through a bog standard isekai setup.    Because that's what nearly this whole episode is actually about. Our hero, Arc, wakes up in a skeleton body and a suit of magic armor, realizes he's been isekai'd, and basically stumbles through a tutorial fetch quest with his overpowered skills, laughing all the way. And while the actual story is generic as hell, Arc himself makes a pretty good introduction. He's just excited to be in this new world, doesn't think to ask any questions about how it happened, and rolls through every new discovery with an almost infectious zest for fantasy life. It still slows down too much when he's shuffling through his various video game skills, and the world itself is devoid of anything interesting, but I could honestly picture myself following this literal bonehead for a few episodes, especially if the wacky slapstick from the OP animation is an honest promise.    But all that goodwill died once we circled back around to that rape scene. It's just such a lazy, shameless bit of shock-jock writing that stops the episode in its tracks. It exists solely to create some indisputably evil bandits for our hero to gallantly kill, letting him take lives without guilt (literally, the show admits this right after) and gaining him the affection of the victimized waif he saved. It's the same kind of hacky, exploitative garbage that showed up to ruin Sword Art Online every season like clockwork, and it's especially out of place in what is otherwise a goofy comedy. Plus, it's all made even worse when we see the attack from Arc's perspective and know he could have stepped in sooner, but was busy fretting over his chances in a PVP fight and waited until literally the last second. Then once it's over we're right back to silly funtimes with The Bone Boi as he celebrates his new life in this fantasy world, making the entire thing feel like a bad joke.    So congrats to the story for ensuring I'm not going to bother with any more of it. Ya took any charm or fun you managed to generate and threw it in the garbage. If other viewers have more tolerance for this kind of crap writing, maybe it's worth sticking it out and see if this is a one-time aberration. But for me, there's nothing interesting or special enough in the rest of this show to risk sitting through another scene like that.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Do you have a boilerplate isekai story to tell that borrows heavily from about four hundred other similar series? Do you need a way to spice it up and get eyes on your project? Well then, may I suggest not using rape to do that? Skeleton Knight in Another World's first episode opens with a graphic (or at least graphic enough) rape scene that comes back almost shot-for-shot at about the fourteen-minute mark. It does establish that our hero, who is helpfully not the rapist, is a good guy, because he saves Lady Lauren and her maid Rita, but there seems to be no reason to show us the exact same scene of sexual violence twice in the same episode. The opening salvo seems to be a cheap bid to make viewers pay attention, and while I do recall the same scene happening in the source material, that's not an excuse. If your story's not interesting enough to appeal to viewers without shocking them, maybe you should rethink your plot.    That out of the way, the rest of the episode is also a bit shocking – shockingly bland, that is. Arc, the eponymous skeleton knight, fell asleep playing his game and woke up as his character, only he forgot that he went with the skeleton build when he was creating him, so now he's afraid to take his armor off in public. If he wanted to be a bad guy like his bone-related cousin Ainz from Overlord, he'd be all set, but in this story, his character is a holy knight, so the whole skeleton thing is a bit of a problem. So is the fact that everyone sees his ridiculously nice and powerful armor and assumes that he's gainfully employed, because that armor's all he's got and he's hungry. Watching him try to integrate himself into a very run-of-the-mill town is the most amusing part of the episode, because he's both making things up on the fly and getting random backstory assigned to him by townsfolk.    He's also incredibly excited to be having his very own isekai experience, although he doesn't phrase it that way. Arc's disappointed that his new world seems more plain old Medieval than fantasy based on Medieval Europe, and any little bit of fantasy that he can find is thrilling to him, be that an elf, an orc, or the fact that he can use magic. (Why he doesn't use his fire magic to roast himself some food is never answered.) Of course, he teleports himself right off a cliff trying to figure out how to use it, but that actually sounds about right for how this would work.    If the sexual assault had been left out, this would be an okay-ish show. Not innovative, but bland in an inoffensive way. But it does have the rape scene and that is enough to make me say that steering clear is the better option here, because a combination of insipid and offensive doesn't leave this with a whole lot to recommend it.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          2 comments       Akari Akase's Ending Theme Song for My Dress-Up Darling Anime Streamed 7 Million Times   Apr 16, 13:35 2 comments                 music    Music video debuted on January 9 ― The music video for Akari Akase's ""Koi no Yukue"" (Where Love Is), the ending theme song for the television anime of Shinichi Fukuda's My Dress-Up Darling (Sono Bisque Doll wa Koi wo Suru), has been streamed over seven million times since its release about three months ago.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Skeleton Knight in Another World   Apr  8th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Skeleton Knight in Another World ?                     Community score: 3.5              What is this?   A gamer falls asleep—only to wake up in the world of the game he was playing. Arc has the powerful skills and weapons of his character, but there's just one problem, he's stuck looking like that character, too. An adventure in a fantastical new land awaits him, if he can get used to being a walking skeleton.    Skeleton Knight in Another World is based on  Ennki Hakari's light novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Jesus Christ. I started up Skeleton Knight in Another World determined that I wouldn't just repeat everything my fellow reviewers were saying, but that rape scene really casts a pall over the entire episode, doesn't it? Let's leave behind for a second that it's tawdry and potentially triggering and holy fuck Crunchyroll, couldn't you have tried to head it off with a warning screen for at least a couple seconds? Okay? Let's move on from that. It's still a spectacularly bad choice purely in terms of mood, character, and narrative structure.    Once the ridiculously graphic scene ends, the show jumps back to Arc waking up one day in a bunch of high-level gear from his favorite MMORPG with access to super powerful magic skills. But uh-oh! He's a skeleton! So he farts around getting excited about his powers and going gaga over an elf. He needs to interact with people in town without letting them know he's a skeleton, which I imagine is a lot like those dreams where you forget to put on clothes and now you're walking around naked trying to find something to wear before someone notices. I found its mishmash of isekai clichés boring, but I'm sure someone out there would like it, and overall it's pretty inoffensive.    Oh but wait! Back to the graphic rape! And all at once we've gone from silly skeleton antics to rape again, but this time we get to see Arc debating whether or not he should intervene. In a brutal rape. When he knows for a fact he's ridiculously overpowered. His hemming and hawing is even presented as comical, as he ponders whether it would be like entering PVP. It's extreme tonal whiplash, and the heaviness of the subject matter is out of place and totally overshadows everything else that happens. It's also a really, really bad look for Arc, especially as Tomoaki Maeno continues his goofy performance as Arc talks himself up between shots of the bandits ripping off the girl's piss-stained pantaloons, and her maid's breasts jiggling as another bandit slams her face into the ground.    And then, after a short scene of him accompanying them, we're back to goofy skeleton man enjoying some tasty food while trying not to let anyone notice he's a skeleton!! So funny!!    So, you know, it's not just about being offended about on-screen rape being used for cheap shock value. It's just a bad narrative choice all around, and deserves to be criticized for that in addition to being crass.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Holy crap. Hit that play button and you get both barrels, don't you? So let's get this out of the way first. I'm not going to say rape can't be used as a plot device, but it should be used carefully—and be integral to the plot/characters when used. It should not be used for simple shock value or for shorthand to show us the hero is good because he kills rapists.    Moving on, can I say how nice it is to see someone who's having fun being whisked away to a fantasy world as the game character they've put so much into? There's some real joy in seeing Arc play with his powers and get pumped up about seeing a real-life elf. Even better is that, even with his excitement, he's still smart enough to realize the immediate issues he has to face. Arc is way overpowered, sure, but he can't even afford a meal, and he has no idea how to clean and cook his own food.    So it makes sense that he would immediately think to do what he already has some knowledge of: become an adventurer. He doesn't complain about the entry test, and the lack of “epic quests” doesn't really matter to him as long as he can get enough for food and a place to stay. It makes him rather likeable as a character. He's not a gun-ho fool nor is he an angsty complainer. He's just a guy enjoying the cards fate has dealt him.    The bandit scene, despite its subject matter, works well on a character development level for Arc. When coming upon the bandits, Arc doesn't intervene immediately. It isn't because he doesn't care about those being harmed but rather because he thinks he might lose. This is interesting because it shows that he doesn't see the bandits as NPCs or monsters; he sees them as other players. Not only does this mean he views them as real people, but it also makes him associate what's going on with PVP—and in PVP, numbers almost always matter more than gear. That said, he does eventually step in because he feels he has to—he sees the women as real people too, after all. The whole internal conflict speaks volumes about how he views the world he has become trapped in.    Other than that, I liked the little touches the episode threw in here and there, from people noticing his armor and deciding he was a knight to him questioning why he didn't feel bad about slaughtering the bandits despite it being the first time he had ever taken a life. The subversion of him peaking over at the women not because he's a horny asshole but because he wants to make sure they aren't looking while he excitedly loots the bodies was fantastic—and can I just say I love his oversized armor with its giant pauldrons? Him riding a horse was a great visual gag. All in all, despite the rough start, I really enjoyed this episode and can't wait to see where things go from here as he inevitably forms a party and answers the call to adventure.      James Beckett  Rating:                Skeleton Knight in Another World might just be a front-runner for two Preview Guide World Records, though they are dubious achievements indeed. First off, we have the elephant in the room, which is the “Shortest Ever Gap Between A Content Warning And The Content In Question” Award. The literal first shot of this series is of a surprisingly graphic sexual assault, and I don't know what is worse: That the scene is so lascivious and needlessly cruel right off the bat, or that we're forced to watch this twice in a show that is ostensibly a breezy isekai comedy. It isn't more than five seconds after the rapists are violently vivisected in front of their already traumatized victims that we transition to the show's cheesy OP, which I must remind you serves to introduce a main character whose sole defining character trait is that he's a goofy-looking cartoon skeleton. It is as catastrophic failure to read the room as I've seen in a long ass time, and there are a good many viewers who will understandably recoil in disgust and reject this anime outright before the opening credits finish.    The second award that Skeleton Knight in Another World is up for is a far less offensive one, though it also represents a problem that you can't simply fast-forward through. It's the “You Don't Even Really Need To Watch This Show, Because Literally Everything You Could Ever Possibly Need To Know About It Is Right There In The Title” Award! If you take the “…in Another World” half of this anime's title into consideration, then practically every single element of this premiere will fall into place, immediately, in your own head, before you even set eyes on it (except perhaps for the terrible and stupid rape scene, but you get my point).    The main character is somehow reborn into a real, flesh-and-blood universe that just so happens to perfectly mirror his favorite generic fantasy MMORPG. He is improbably strong and gifted in literally every aspect of the game, and he also spends a bunch of time breaking down his “in- game” stats sheet and skill set, as if that is somehow a substitute for having actual world-building and a plot. He then meanders around, talking to people and narrating to himself about this completely bizarre and insane scenario that we've all seen play out so many times before. He also might be a genuine sociopath, since he is completely unfazed by the horrible suffering and pain that he witnesses and inflicts upon others, and seems to live only to hoard loot from the mangled corpses he leaves behind. The ”Skeleton” part of the title tells you that the main character is a skeleton.    And look, I'm a fair critic, and I will give Skeleton Knight in Another World credit where it is due: It is somewhat amusing when when the skeleton guy makes goofy faces and gets unreasonably excited about loot. I chuckled once, near the end of the episode, because of the funny skeleton faces on the screen. For that alone, I will grant this premiere a bonus half-star to its rating. Everything else about it sucks, though, so it can wear its two Premiere Guide World Record badges like the marks of dishonor that they are.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               If any other show this season has a worse start than Skeleton Knight I'll be horribly surprised. It's not “just” that this premiere starts off, from the literal first second, with an attempted rape sequence. Nor is it “just” that said scene is gratuitous and directed with an eye for titillation for the audience, and is a cheap attempt at setting up paper thin bad guys from our hero to kill. It's that this would be a gross and crummy opening for a dark fantasy like Goblin Slayer, but it's a truly abysmal first impression for a premiere that is 90% goofy bullshit with our skeleton gamer protagonist Himbo-ing his way through a bog standard isekai setup.    Because that's what nearly this whole episode is actually about. Our hero, Arc, wakes up in a skeleton body and a suit of magic armor, realizes he's been isekai'd, and basically stumbles through a tutorial fetch quest with his overpowered skills, laughing all the way. And while the actual story is generic as hell, Arc himself makes a pretty good introduction. He's just excited to be in this new world, doesn't think to ask any questions about how it happened, and rolls through every new discovery with an almost infectious zest for fantasy life. It still slows down too much when he's shuffling through his various video game skills, and the world itself is devoid of anything interesting, but I could honestly picture myself following this literal bonehead for a few episodes, especially if the wacky slapstick from the OP animation is an honest promise.    But all that goodwill died once we circled back around to that rape scene. It's just such a lazy, shameless bit of shock-jock writing that stops the episode in its tracks. It exists solely to create some indisputably evil bandits for our hero to gallantly kill, letting him take lives without guilt (literally, the show admits this right after) and gaining him the affection of the victimized waif he saved. It's the same kind of hacky, exploitative garbage that showed up to ruin Sword Art Online every season like clockwork, and it's especially out of place in what is otherwise a goofy comedy. Plus, it's all made even worse when we see the attack from Arc's perspective and know he could have stepped in sooner, but was busy fretting over his chances in a PVP fight and waited until literally the last second. Then once it's over we're right back to silly funtimes with The Bone Boi as he celebrates his new life in this fantasy world, making the entire thing feel like a bad joke.    So congrats to the story for ensuring I'm not going to bother with any more of it. Ya took any charm or fun you managed to generate and threw it in the garbage. If other viewers have more tolerance for this kind of crap writing, maybe it's worth sticking it out and see if this is a one-time aberration. But for me, there's nothing interesting or special enough in the rest of this show to risk sitting through another scene like that.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Do you have a boilerplate isekai story to tell that borrows heavily from about four hundred other similar series? Do you need a way to spice it up and get eyes on your project? Well then, may I suggest not using rape to do that? Skeleton Knight in Another World's first episode opens with a graphic (or at least graphic enough) rape scene that comes back almost shot-for-shot at about the fourteen-minute mark. It does establish that our hero, who is helpfully not the rapist, is a good guy, because he saves Lady Lauren and her maid Rita, but there seems to be no reason to show us the exact same scene of sexual violence twice in the same episode. The opening salvo seems to be a cheap bid to make viewers pay attention, and while I do recall the same scene happening in the source material, that's not an excuse. If your story's not interesting enough to appeal to viewers without shocking them, maybe you should rethink your plot.    That out of the way, the rest of the episode is also a bit shocking – shockingly bland, that is. Arc, the eponymous skeleton knight, fell asleep playing his game and woke up as his character, only he forgot that he went with the skeleton build when he was creating him, so now he's afraid to take his armor off in public. If he wanted to be a bad guy like his bone-related cousin Ainz from Overlord, he'd be all set, but in this story, his character is a holy knight, so the whole skeleton thing is a bit of a problem. So is the fact that everyone sees his ridiculously nice and powerful armor and assumes that he's gainfully employed, because that armor's all he's got and he's hungry. Watching him try to integrate himself into a very run-of-the-mill town is the most amusing part of the episode, because he's both making things up on the fly and getting random backstory assigned to him by townsfolk.    He's also incredibly excited to be having his very own isekai experience, although he doesn't phrase it that way. Arc's disappointed that his new world seems more plain old Medieval than fantasy based on Medieval Europe, and any little bit of fantasy that he can find is thrilling to him, be that an elf, an orc, or the fact that he can use magic. (Why he doesn't use his fire magic to roast himself some food is never answered.) Of course, he teleports himself right off a cliff trying to figure out how to use it, but that actually sounds about right for how this would work.    If the sexual assault had been left out, this would be an okay-ish show. Not innovative, but bland in an inoffensive way. But it does have the rape scene and that is enough to make me say that steering clear is the better option here, because a combination of insipid and offensive doesn't leave this with a whole lot to recommend it.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          2 comments       Akari Akase's Ending Theme Song for My Dress-Up Darling Anime Streamed 7 Million Times   Apr 16, 13:35 2 comments                 music    Music video debuted on January 9 ― The music video for Akari Akase's ""Koi no Yukue"" (Where Love Is), the ending theme song for the television anime of Shinichi Fukuda's My Dress-Up Darling (Sono Bisque Doll wa Koi wo Suru), has been streamed over seven million times since its release about three months ago.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Skeleton Knight in Another World   Apr  8th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Skeleton Knight in Another World ?                     Community score: 3.5              What is this?   A gamer falls asleep—only to wake up in the world of the game he was playing. Arc has the powerful skills and weapons of his character, but there's just one problem, he's stuck looking like that character, too. An adventure in a fantastical new land awaits him, if he can get used to being a walking skeleton.    Skeleton Knight in Another World is based on  Ennki Hakari's light novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Jesus Christ. I started up Skeleton Knight in Another World determined that I wouldn't just repeat everything my fellow reviewers were saying, but that rape scene really casts a pall over the entire episode, doesn't it? Let's leave behind for a second that it's tawdry and potentially triggering and holy fuck Crunchyroll, couldn't you have tried to head it off with a warning screen for at least a couple seconds? Okay? Let's move on from that. It's still a spectacularly bad choice purely in terms of mood, character, and narrative structure.    Once the ridiculously graphic scene ends, the show jumps back to Arc waking up one day in a bunch of high-level gear from his favorite MMORPG with access to super powerful magic skills. But uh-oh! He's a skeleton! So he farts around getting excited about his powers and going gaga over an elf. He needs to interact with people in town without letting them know he's a skeleton, which I imagine is a lot like those dreams where you forget to put on clothes and now you're walking around naked trying to find something to wear before someone notices. I found its mishmash of isekai clichés boring, but I'm sure someone out there would like it, and overall it's pretty inoffensive.    Oh but wait! Back to the graphic rape! And all at once we've gone from silly skeleton antics to rape again, but this time we get to see Arc debating whether or not he should intervene. In a brutal rape. When he knows for a fact he's ridiculously overpowered. His hemming and hawing is even presented as comical, as he ponders whether it would be like entering PVP. It's extreme tonal whiplash, and the heaviness of the subject matter is out of place and totally overshadows everything else that happens. It's also a really, really bad look for Arc, especially as Tomoaki Maeno continues his goofy performance as Arc talks himself up between shots of the bandits ripping off the girl's piss-stained pantaloons, and her maid's breasts jiggling as another bandit slams her face into the ground.    And then, after a short scene of him accompanying them, we're back to goofy skeleton man enjoying some tasty food while trying not to let anyone notice he's a skeleton!! So funny!!    So, you know, it's not just about being offended about on-screen rape being used for cheap shock value. It's just a bad narrative choice all around, and deserves to be criticized for that in addition to being crass.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Holy crap. Hit that play button and you get both barrels, don't you? So let's get this out of the way first. I'm not going to say rape can't be used as a plot device, but it should be used carefully—and be integral to the plot/characters when used. It should not be used for simple shock value or for shorthand to show us the hero is good because he kills rapists.    Moving on, can I say how nice it is to see someone who's having fun being whisked away to a fantasy world as the game character they've put so much into? There's some real joy in seeing Arc play with his powers and get pumped up about seeing a real-life elf. Even better is that, even with his excitement, he's still smart enough to realize the immediate issues he has to face. Arc is way overpowered, sure, but he can't even afford a meal, and he has no idea how to clean and cook his own food.    So it makes sense that he would immediately think to do what he already has some knowledge of: become an adventurer. He doesn't complain about the entry test, and the lack of “epic quests” doesn't really matter to him as long as he can get enough for food and a place to stay. It makes him rather likeable as a character. He's not a gun-ho fool nor is he an angsty complainer. He's just a guy enjoying the cards fate has dealt him.    The bandit scene, despite its subject matter, works well on a character development level for Arc. When coming upon the bandits, Arc doesn't intervene immediately. It isn't because he doesn't care about those being harmed but rather because he thinks he might lose. This is interesting because it shows that he doesn't see the bandits as NPCs or monsters; he sees them as other players. Not only does this mean he views them as real people, but it also makes him associate what's going on with PVP—and in PVP, numbers almost always matter more than gear. That said, he does eventually step in because he feels he has to—he sees the women as real people too, after all. The whole internal conflict speaks volumes about how he views the world he has become trapped in.    Other than that, I liked the little touches the episode threw in here and there, from people noticing his armor and deciding he was a knight to him questioning why he didn't feel bad about slaughtering the bandits despite it being the first time he had ever taken a life. The subversion of him peaking over at the women not because he's a horny asshole but because he wants to make sure they aren't looking while he excitedly loots the bodies was fantastic—and can I just say I love his oversized armor with its giant pauldrons? Him riding a horse was a great visual gag. All in all, despite the rough start, I really enjoyed this episode and can't wait to see where things go from here as he inevitably forms a party and answers the call to adventure.      James Beckett  Rating:                Skeleton Knight in Another World might just be a front-runner for two Preview Guide World Records, though they are dubious achievements indeed. First off, we have the elephant in the room, which is the “Shortest Ever Gap Between A Content Warning And The Content In Question” Award. The literal first shot of this series is of a surprisingly graphic sexual assault, and I don't know what is worse: That the scene is so lascivious and needlessly cruel right off the bat, or that we're forced to watch this twice in a show that is ostensibly a breezy isekai comedy. It isn't more than five seconds after the rapists are violently vivisected in front of their already traumatized victims that we transition to the show's cheesy OP, which I must remind you serves to introduce a main character whose sole defining character trait is that he's a goofy-looking cartoon skeleton. It is as catastrophic failure to read the room as I've seen in a long ass time, and there are a good many viewers who will understandably recoil in disgust and reject this anime outright before the opening credits finish.    The second award that Skeleton Knight in Another World is up for is a far less offensive one, though it also represents a problem that you can't simply fast-forward through. It's the “You Don't Even Really Need To Watch This Show, Because Literally Everything You Could Ever Possibly Need To Know About It Is Right There In The Title” Award! If you take the “…in Another World” half of this anime's title into consideration, then practically every single element of this premiere will fall into place, immediately, in your own head, before you even set eyes on it (except perhaps for the terrible and stupid rape scene, but you get my point).    The main character is somehow reborn into a real, flesh-and-blood universe that just so happens to perfectly mirror his favorite generic fantasy MMORPG. He is improbably strong and gifted in literally every aspect of the game, and he also spends a bunch of time breaking down his “in- game” stats sheet and skill set, as if that is somehow a substitute for having actual world-building and a plot. He then meanders around, talking to people and narrating to himself about this completely bizarre and insane scenario that we've all seen play out so many times before. He also might be a genuine sociopath, since he is completely unfazed by the horrible suffering and pain that he witnesses and inflicts upon others, and seems to live only to hoard loot from the mangled corpses he leaves behind. The ”Skeleton” part of the title tells you that the main character is a skeleton.    And look, I'm a fair critic, and I will give Skeleton Knight in Another World credit where it is due: It is somewhat amusing when when the skeleton guy makes goofy faces and gets unreasonably excited about loot. I chuckled once, near the end of the episode, because of the funny skeleton faces on the screen. For that alone, I will grant this premiere a bonus half-star to its rating. Everything else about it sucks, though, so it can wear its two Premiere Guide World Record badges like the marks of dishonor that they are.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               If any other show this season has a worse start than Skeleton Knight I'll be horribly surprised. It's not “just” that this premiere starts off, from the literal first second, with an attempted rape sequence. Nor is it “just” that said scene is gratuitous and directed with an eye for titillation for the audience, and is a cheap attempt at setting up paper thin bad guys from our hero to kill. It's that this would be a gross and crummy opening for a dark fantasy like Goblin Slayer, but it's a truly abysmal first impression for a premiere that is 90% goofy bullshit with our skeleton gamer protagonist Himbo-ing his way through a bog standard isekai setup.    Because that's what nearly this whole episode is actually about. Our hero, Arc, wakes up in a skeleton body and a suit of magic armor, realizes he's been isekai'd, and basically stumbles through a tutorial fetch quest with his overpowered skills, laughing all the way. And while the actual story is generic as hell, Arc himself makes a pretty good introduction. He's just excited to be in this new world, doesn't think to ask any questions about how it happened, and rolls through every new discovery with an almost infectious zest for fantasy life. It still slows down too much when he's shuffling through his various video game skills, and the world itself is devoid of anything interesting, but I could honestly picture myself following this literal bonehead for a few episodes, especially if the wacky slapstick from the OP animation is an honest promise.    But all that goodwill died once we circled back around to that rape scene. It's just such a lazy, shameless bit of shock-jock writing that stops the episode in its tracks. It exists solely to create some indisputably evil bandits for our hero to gallantly kill, letting him take lives without guilt (literally, the show admits this right after) and gaining him the affection of the victimized waif he saved. It's the same kind of hacky, exploitative garbage that showed up to ruin Sword Art Online every season like clockwork, and it's especially out of place in what is otherwise a goofy comedy. Plus, it's all made even worse when we see the attack from Arc's perspective and know he could have stepped in sooner, but was busy fretting over his chances in a PVP fight and waited until literally the last second. Then once it's over we're right back to silly funtimes with The Bone Boi as he celebrates his new life in this fantasy world, making the entire thing feel like a bad joke.    So congrats to the story for ensuring I'm not going to bother with any more of it. Ya took any charm or fun you managed to generate and threw it in the garbage. If other viewers have more tolerance for this kind of crap writing, maybe it's worth sticking it out and see if this is a one-time aberration. But for me, there's nothing interesting or special enough in the rest of this show to risk sitting through another scene like that.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Do you have a boilerplate isekai story to tell that borrows heavily from about four hundred other similar series? Do you need a way to spice it up and get eyes on your project? Well then, may I suggest not using rape to do that? Skeleton Knight in Another World's first episode opens with a graphic (or at least graphic enough) rape scene that comes back almost shot-for-shot at about the fourteen-minute mark. It does establish that our hero, who is helpfully not the rapist, is a good guy, because he saves Lady Lauren and her maid Rita, but there seems to be no reason to show us the exact same scene of sexual violence twice in the same episode. The opening salvo seems to be a cheap bid to make viewers pay attention, and while I do recall the same scene happening in the source material, that's not an excuse. If your story's not interesting enough to appeal to viewers without shocking them, maybe you should rethink your plot.    That out of the way, the rest of the episode is also a bit shocking – shockingly bland, that is. Arc, the eponymous skeleton knight, fell asleep playing his game and woke up as his character, only he forgot that he went with the skeleton build when he was creating him, so now he's afraid to take his armor off in public. If he wanted to be a bad guy like his bone-related cousin Ainz from Overlord, he'd be all set, but in this story, his character is a holy knight, so the whole skeleton thing is a bit of a problem. So is the fact that everyone sees his ridiculously nice and powerful armor and assumes that he's gainfully employed, because that armor's all he's got and he's hungry. Watching him try to integrate himself into a very run-of-the-mill town is the most amusing part of the episode, because he's both making things up on the fly and getting random backstory assigned to him by townsfolk.    He's also incredibly excited to be having his very own isekai experience, although he doesn't phrase it that way. Arc's disappointed that his new world seems more plain old Medieval than fantasy based on Medieval Europe, and any little bit of fantasy that he can find is thrilling to him, be that an elf, an orc, or the fact that he can use magic. (Why he doesn't use his fire magic to roast himself some food is never answered.) Of course, he teleports himself right off a cliff trying to figure out how to use it, but that actually sounds about right for how this would work.    If the sexual assault had been left out, this would be an okay-ish show. Not innovative, but bland in an inoffensive way. But it does have the rape scene and that is enough to make me say that steering clear is the better option here, because a combination of insipid and offensive doesn't leave this with a whole lot to recommend it.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          2 comments       Akari Akase's Ending Theme Song for My Dress-Up Darling Anime Streamed 7 Million Times   Apr 16, 13:35 2 comments                 music    Music video debuted on January 9 ― The music video for Akari Akase's ""Koi no Yukue"" (Where Love Is), the ending theme song for the television anime of Shinichi Fukuda's My Dress-Up Darling (Sono Bisque Doll wa Koi wo Suru), has been streamed over seven million times since its release about three months ago.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Skeleton Knight in Another World   Apr  8th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Skeleton Knight in Another World ?                     Community score: 3.5              What is this?   A gamer falls asleep—only to wake up in the world of the game he was playing. Arc has the powerful skills and weapons of his character, but there's just one problem, he's stuck looking like that character, too. An adventure in a fantastical new land awaits him, if he can get used to being a walking skeleton.    Skeleton Knight in Another World is based on  Ennki Hakari's light novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Jesus Christ. I started up Skeleton Knight in Another World determined that I wouldn't just repeat everything my fellow reviewers were saying, but that rape scene really casts a pall over the entire episode, doesn't it? Let's leave behind for a second that it's tawdry and potentially triggering and holy fuck Crunchyroll, couldn't you have tried to head it off with a warning screen for at least a couple seconds? Okay? Let's move on from that. It's still a spectacularly bad choice purely in terms of mood, character, and narrative structure.    Once the ridiculously graphic scene ends, the show jumps back to Arc waking up one day in a bunch of high-level gear from his favorite MMORPG with access to super powerful magic skills. But uh-oh! He's a skeleton! So he farts around getting excited about his powers and going gaga over an elf. He needs to interact with people in town without letting them know he's a skeleton, which I imagine is a lot like those dreams where you forget to put on clothes and now you're walking around naked trying to find something to wear before someone notices. I found its mishmash of isekai clichés boring, but I'm sure someone out there would like it, and overall it's pretty inoffensive.    Oh but wait! Back to the graphic rape! And all at once we've gone from silly skeleton antics to rape again, but this time we get to see Arc debating whether or not he should intervene. In a brutal rape. When he knows for a fact he's ridiculously overpowered. His hemming and hawing is even presented as comical, as he ponders whether it would be like entering PVP. It's extreme tonal whiplash, and the heaviness of the subject matter is out of place and totally overshadows everything else that happens. It's also a really, really bad look for Arc, especially as Tomoaki Maeno continues his goofy performance as Arc talks himself up between shots of the bandits ripping off the girl's piss-stained pantaloons, and her maid's breasts jiggling as another bandit slams her face into the ground.    And then, after a short scene of him accompanying them, we're back to goofy skeleton man enjoying some tasty food while trying not to let anyone notice he's a skeleton!! So funny!!    So, you know, it's not just about being offended about on-screen rape being used for cheap shock value. It's just a bad narrative choice all around, and deserves to be criticized for that in addition to being crass.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Holy crap. Hit that play button and you get both barrels, don't you? So let's get this out of the way first. I'm not going to say rape can't be used as a plot device, but it should be used carefully—and be integral to the plot/characters when used. It should not be used for simple shock value or for shorthand to show us the hero is good because he kills rapists.    Moving on, can I say how nice it is to see someone who's having fun being whisked away to a fantasy world as the game character they've put so much into? There's some real joy in seeing Arc play with his powers and get pumped up about seeing a real-life elf. Even better is that, even with his excitement, he's still smart enough to realize the immediate issues he has to face. Arc is way overpowered, sure, but he can't even afford a meal, and he has no idea how to clean and cook his own food.    So it makes sense that he would immediately think to do what he already has some knowledge of: become an adventurer. He doesn't complain about the entry test, and the lack of “epic quests” doesn't really matter to him as long as he can get enough for food and a place to stay. It makes him rather likeable as a character. He's not a gun-ho fool nor is he an angsty complainer. He's just a guy enjoying the cards fate has dealt him.    The bandit scene, despite its subject matter, works well on a character development level for Arc. When coming upon the bandits, Arc doesn't intervene immediately. It isn't because he doesn't care about those being harmed but rather because he thinks he might lose. This is interesting because it shows that he doesn't see the bandits as NPCs or monsters; he sees them as other players. Not only does this mean he views them as real people, but it also makes him associate what's going on with PVP—and in PVP, numbers almost always matter more than gear. That said, he does eventually step in because he feels he has to—he sees the women as real people too, after all. The whole internal conflict speaks volumes about how he views the world he has become trapped in.    Other than that, I liked the little touches the episode threw in here and there, from people noticing his armor and deciding he was a knight to him questioning why he didn't feel bad about slaughtering the bandits despite it being the first time he had ever taken a life. The subversion of him peaking over at the women not because he's a horny asshole but because he wants to make sure they aren't looking while he excitedly loots the bodies was fantastic—and can I just say I love his oversized armor with its giant pauldrons? Him riding a horse was a great visual gag. All in all, despite the rough start, I really enjoyed this episode and can't wait to see where things go from here as he inevitably forms a party and answers the call to adventure.      James Beckett  Rating:                Skeleton Knight in Another World might just be a front-runner for two Preview Guide World Records, though they are dubious achievements indeed. First off, we have the elephant in the room, which is the “Shortest Ever Gap Between A Content Warning And The Content In Question” Award. The literal first shot of this series is of a surprisingly graphic sexual assault, and I don't know what is worse: That the scene is so lascivious and needlessly cruel right off the bat, or that we're forced to watch this twice in a show that is ostensibly a breezy isekai comedy. It isn't more than five seconds after the rapists are violently vivisected in front of their already traumatized victims that we transition to the show's cheesy OP, which I must remind you serves to introduce a main character whose sole defining character trait is that he's a goofy-looking cartoon skeleton. It is as catastrophic failure to read the room as I've seen in a long ass time, and there are a good many viewers who will understandably recoil in disgust and reject this anime outright before the opening credits finish.    The second award that Skeleton Knight in Another World is up for is a far less offensive one, though it also represents a problem that you can't simply fast-forward through. It's the “You Don't Even Really Need To Watch This Show, Because Literally Everything You Could Ever Possibly Need To Know About It Is Right There In The Title” Award! If you take the “…in Another World” half of this anime's title into consideration, then practically every single element of this premiere will fall into place, immediately, in your own head, before you even set eyes on it (except perhaps for the terrible and stupid rape scene, but you get my point).    The main character is somehow reborn into a real, flesh-and-blood universe that just so happens to perfectly mirror his favorite generic fantasy MMORPG. He is improbably strong and gifted in literally every aspect of the game, and he also spends a bunch of time breaking down his “in- game” stats sheet and skill set, as if that is somehow a substitute for having actual world-building and a plot. He then meanders around, talking to people and narrating to himself about this completely bizarre and insane scenario that we've all seen play out so many times before. He also might be a genuine sociopath, since he is completely unfazed by the horrible suffering and pain that he witnesses and inflicts upon others, and seems to live only to hoard loot from the mangled corpses he leaves behind. The ”Skeleton” part of the title tells you that the main character is a skeleton.    And look, I'm a fair critic, and I will give Skeleton Knight in Another World credit where it is due: It is somewhat amusing when when the skeleton guy makes goofy faces and gets unreasonably excited about loot. I chuckled once, near the end of the episode, because of the funny skeleton faces on the screen. For that alone, I will grant this premiere a bonus half-star to its rating. Everything else about it sucks, though, so it can wear its two Premiere Guide World Record badges like the marks of dishonor that they are.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               If any other show this season has a worse start than Skeleton Knight I'll be horribly surprised. It's not “just” that this premiere starts off, from the literal first second, with an attempted rape sequence. Nor is it “just” that said scene is gratuitous and directed with an eye for titillation for the audience, and is a cheap attempt at setting up paper thin bad guys from our hero to kill. It's that this would be a gross and crummy opening for a dark fantasy like Goblin Slayer, but it's a truly abysmal first impression for a premiere that is 90% goofy bullshit with our skeleton gamer protagonist Himbo-ing his way through a bog standard isekai setup.    Because that's what nearly this whole episode is actually about. Our hero, Arc, wakes up in a skeleton body and a suit of magic armor, realizes he's been isekai'd, and basically stumbles through a tutorial fetch quest with his overpowered skills, laughing all the way. And while the actual story is generic as hell, Arc himself makes a pretty good introduction. He's just excited to be in this new world, doesn't think to ask any questions about how it happened, and rolls through every new discovery with an almost infectious zest for fantasy life. It still slows down too much when he's shuffling through his various video game skills, and the world itself is devoid of anything interesting, but I could honestly picture myself following this literal bonehead for a few episodes, especially if the wacky slapstick from the OP animation is an honest promise.    But all that goodwill died once we circled back around to that rape scene. It's just such a lazy, shameless bit of shock-jock writing that stops the episode in its tracks. It exists solely to create some indisputably evil bandits for our hero to gallantly kill, letting him take lives without guilt (literally, the show admits this right after) and gaining him the affection of the victimized waif he saved. It's the same kind of hacky, exploitative garbage that showed up to ruin Sword Art Online every season like clockwork, and it's especially out of place in what is otherwise a goofy comedy. Plus, it's all made even worse when we see the attack from Arc's perspective and know he could have stepped in sooner, but was busy fretting over his chances in a PVP fight and waited until literally the last second. Then once it's over we're right back to silly funtimes with The Bone Boi as he celebrates his new life in this fantasy world, making the entire thing feel like a bad joke.    So congrats to the story for ensuring I'm not going to bother with any more of it. Ya took any charm or fun you managed to generate and threw it in the garbage. If other viewers have more tolerance for this kind of crap writing, maybe it's worth sticking it out and see if this is a one-time aberration. But for me, there's nothing interesting or special enough in the rest of this show to risk sitting through another scene like that.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Do you have a boilerplate isekai story to tell that borrows heavily from about four hundred other similar series? Do you need a way to spice it up and get eyes on your project? Well then, may I suggest not using rape to do that? Skeleton Knight in Another World's first episode opens with a graphic (or at least graphic enough) rape scene that comes back almost shot-for-shot at about the fourteen-minute mark. It does establish that our hero, who is helpfully not the rapist, is a good guy, because he saves Lady Lauren and her maid Rita, but there seems to be no reason to show us the exact same scene of sexual violence twice in the same episode. The opening salvo seems to be a cheap bid to make viewers pay attention, and while I do recall the same scene happening in the source material, that's not an excuse. If your story's not interesting enough to appeal to viewers without shocking them, maybe you should rethink your plot.    That out of the way, the rest of the episode is also a bit shocking – shockingly bland, that is. Arc, the eponymous skeleton knight, fell asleep playing his game and woke up as his character, only he forgot that he went with the skeleton build when he was creating him, so now he's afraid to take his armor off in public. If he wanted to be a bad guy like his bone-related cousin Ainz from Overlord, he'd be all set, but in this story, his character is a holy knight, so the whole skeleton thing is a bit of a problem. So is the fact that everyone sees his ridiculously nice and powerful armor and assumes that he's gainfully employed, because that armor's all he's got and he's hungry. Watching him try to integrate himself into a very run-of-the-mill town is the most amusing part of the episode, because he's both making things up on the fly and getting random backstory assigned to him by townsfolk.    He's also incredibly excited to be having his very own isekai experience, although he doesn't phrase it that way. Arc's disappointed that his new world seems more plain old Medieval than fantasy based on Medieval Europe, and any little bit of fantasy that he can find is thrilling to him, be that an elf, an orc, or the fact that he can use magic. (Why he doesn't use his fire magic to roast himself some food is never answered.) Of course, he teleports himself right off a cliff trying to figure out how to use it, but that actually sounds about right for how this would work.    If the sexual assault had been left out, this would be an okay-ish show. Not innovative, but bland in an inoffensive way. But it does have the rape scene and that is enough to make me say that steering clear is the better option here, because a combination of insipid and offensive doesn't leave this with a whole lot to recommend it.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          2 comments       Akari Akase's Ending Theme Song for My Dress-Up Darling Anime Streamed 7 Million Times   Apr 16, 13:35 2 comments                 music    Music video debuted on January 9 ― The music video for Akari Akase's ""Koi no Yukue"" (Where Love Is), the ending theme song for the television anime of Shinichi Fukuda's My Dress-Up Darling (Sono Bisque Doll wa Koi wo Suru), has been streamed over seven million times since its release about three months ago.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Skeleton Knight in Another World   Apr  8th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Skeleton Knight in Another World ?                     Community score: 3.5              What is this?   A gamer falls asleep—only to wake up in the world of the game he was playing. Arc has the powerful skills and weapons of his character, but there's just one problem, he's stuck looking like that character, too. An adventure in a fantastical new land awaits him, if he can get used to being a walking skeleton.    Skeleton Knight in Another World is based on  Ennki Hakari's light novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Jesus Christ. I started up Skeleton Knight in Another World determined that I wouldn't just repeat everything my fellow reviewers were saying, but that rape scene really casts a pall over the entire episode, doesn't it? Let's leave behind for a second that it's tawdry and potentially triggering and holy fuck Crunchyroll, couldn't you have tried to head it off with a warning screen for at least a couple seconds? Okay? Let's move on from that. It's still a spectacularly bad choice purely in terms of mood, character, and narrative structure.    Once the ridiculously graphic scene ends, the show jumps back to Arc waking up one day in a bunch of high-level gear from his favorite MMORPG with access to super powerful magic skills. But uh-oh! He's a skeleton! So he farts around getting excited about his powers and going gaga over an elf. He needs to interact with people in town without letting them know he's a skeleton, which I imagine is a lot like those dreams where you forget to put on clothes and now you're walking around naked trying to find something to wear before someone notices. I found its mishmash of isekai clichés boring, but I'm sure someone out there would like it, and overall it's pretty inoffensive.    Oh but wait! Back to the graphic rape!

It's extreme tonal whiplash, and the heaviness of the subject matter is out of place and totally overshadows everything else that happens. It's also a really, really bad look for Arc, especially as Tomoaki Maeno continues his goofy performance as Arc talks himself up between shots of the bandits ripping off the girl's piss-stained pantaloons, and her maid's breasts jiggling as another bandit slams her face into the ground.    And then, after a short scene of him accompanying them, we're back to goofy skeleton man enjoying some tasty food while trying not to let anyone notice he's a skeleton!! So funny!!    So, you know, it's not just about being offended about on-screen rape being used for cheap shock value. It's just a bad narrative choice all around, and deserves to be criticized for that in addition to being crass.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Holy crap. Hit that play button and you get both barrels, don't you? So let's get this out of the way first. I'm not going to say rape can't be used as a plot device, but it should be used carefully—and be integral to the plot/characters when used. It should not be used for simple shock value or for shorthand to show us the hero is good because he kills rapists.    Moving on, can I say how nice it is to see someone who's having fun being whisked away to a fantasy world as the game character they've put so much into? There's some real joy in seeing Arc play with his powers and get pumped up about seeing a real-life elf. Even better is that, even with his excitement, he's still smart enough to realize the immediate issues he has to face. Arc is way overpowered, sure, but he can't even afford a meal, and he has no idea how to clean and cook his own food.    So it makes sense that he would immediately think to do what he already has some knowledge of: become an adventurer. He doesn't complain about the entry test, and the lack of “epic quests” doesn't really matter to him as long as he can get enough for food and a place to stay. It makes him rather likeable as a character. He's not a gun-ho fool nor is he an angsty complainer. He's just a guy enjoying the cards fate has dealt him.    The bandit scene, despite its subject matter, works well on a character development level for Arc. When coming upon the bandits, Arc doesn't intervene immediately. It isn't because he doesn't care about those being harmed but rather because he thinks he might lose. This is interesting because it shows that he doesn't see the bandits as NPCs or monsters; he sees them as other players. Not only does this mean he views them as real people, but it also makes him associate what's going on with PVP—and in PVP, numbers almost always matter more than gear. That said, he does eventually step in because he feels he has to—he sees the women as real people too, after all. The whole internal conflict speaks volumes about how he views the world he has become trapped in.    Other than that, I liked the little touches the episode threw in here and there, from people noticing his armor and deciding he was a knight to him questioning why he didn't feel bad about slaughtering the bandits despite it being the first time he had ever taken a life. The subversion of him peaking over at the women not because he's a horny asshole but because he wants to make sure they aren't looking while he excitedly loots the bodies was fantastic—and can I just say I love his oversized armor with its giant pauldrons? Him riding a horse was a great visual gag. All in all, despite the rough start, I really enjoyed this episode and can't wait to see where things go from here as he inevitably forms a party and answers the call to adventure.      James Beckett  Rating:                Skeleton Knight in Another World might just be a front-runner for two Preview Guide World Records, though they are dubious achievements indeed. First off, we have the elephant in the room, which is the “Shortest Ever Gap Between A Content Warning And The Content In Question” Award. The literal first shot of this series is of a surprisingly graphic sexual assault, and I don't know what is worse: That the scene is so lascivious and needlessly cruel right off the bat, or that we're forced to watch this twice in a show that is ostensibly a breezy isekai comedy. It isn't more than five seconds after the rapists are violently vivisected in front of their already traumatized victims that we transition to the show's cheesy OP, which I must remind you serves to introduce a main character whose sole defining character trait is that he's a goofy-looking cartoon skeleton. It is as catastrophic failure to read the room as I've seen in a long ass time, and there are a good many viewers who will understandably recoil in disgust and reject this anime outright before the opening credits finish.    The second award that Skeleton Knight in Another World is up for is a far less offensive one, though it also represents a problem that you can't simply fast-forward through. It's the “You Don't Even Really Need To Watch This Show, Because Literally Everything You Could Ever Possibly Need To Know About It Is Right There In The Title” Award! If you take the “…in Another World” half of this anime's title into consideration, then practically every single element of this premiere will fall into place, immediately, in your own head, before you even set eyes on it (except perhaps for the terrible and stupid rape scene, but you get my point).    The main character is somehow reborn into a real, flesh-and-blood universe that just so happens to perfectly mirror his favorite generic fantasy MMORPG. He is improbably strong and gifted in literally every aspect of the game, and he also spends a bunch of time breaking down his “in- game” stats sheet and skill set, as if that is somehow a substitute for having actual world-building and a plot. He then meanders around, talking to people and narrating to himself about this completely bizarre and insane scenario that we've all seen play out so many times before. He also might be a genuine sociopath, since he is completely unfazed by the horrible suffering and pain that he witnesses and inflicts upon others, and seems to live only to hoard loot from the mangled corpses he leaves behind. The ”Skeleton” part of the title tells you that the main character is a skeleton.    And look, I'm a fair critic, and I will give Skeleton Knight in Another World credit where it is due: It is somewhat amusing when when the skeleton guy makes goofy faces and gets unreasonably excited about loot. I chuckled once, near the end of the episode, because of the funny skeleton faces on the screen. For that alone, I will grant this premiere a bonus half-star to its rating. Everything else about it sucks, though, so it can wear its two Premiere Guide World Record badges like the marks of dishonor that they are.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               If any other show this season has a worse start than Skeleton Knight I'll be horribly surprised. It's not “just” that this premiere starts off, from the literal first second, with an attempted rape sequence. Nor is it “just” that said scene is gratuitous and directed with an eye for titillation for the audience, and is a cheap attempt at setting up paper thin bad guys from our hero to kill. It's that this would be a gross and crummy opening for a dark fantasy like Goblin Slayer, but it's a truly abysmal first impression for a premiere that is 90% goofy bullshit with our skeleton gamer protagonist Himbo-ing his way through a bog standard isekai setup.    Because that's what nearly this whole episode is actually about. Our hero, Arc, wakes up in a skeleton body and a suit of magic armor, realizes he's been isekai'd, and basically stumbles through a tutorial fetch quest with his overpowered skills, laughing all the way. And while the actual story is generic as hell, Arc himself makes a pretty good introduction. He's just excited to be in this new world, doesn't think to ask any questions about how it happened, and rolls through every new discovery with an almost infectious zest for fantasy life. It still slows down too much when he's shuffling through his various video game skills, and the world itself is devoid of anything interesting, but I could honestly picture myself following this literal bonehead for a few episodes, especially if the wacky slapstick from the OP animation is an honest promise.    But all that goodwill died once we circled back around to that rape scene. It's just such a lazy, shameless bit of shock-jock writing that stops the episode in its tracks. It exists solely to create some indisputably evil bandits for our hero to gallantly kill, letting him take lives without guilt (literally, the show admits this right after) and gaining him the affection of the victimized waif he saved. It's the same kind of hacky, exploitative garbage that showed up to ruin Sword Art Online every season like clockwork, and it's especially out of place in what is otherwise a goofy comedy. Plus, it's all made even worse when we see the attack from Arc's perspective and know he could have stepped in sooner, but was busy fretting over his chances in a PVP fight and waited until literally the last second. Then once it's over we're right back to silly funtimes with The Bone Boi as he celebrates his new life in this fantasy world, making the entire thing feel like a bad joke.    So congrats to the story for ensuring I'm not going to bother with any more of it. Ya took any charm or fun you managed to generate and threw it in the garbage. If other viewers have more tolerance for this kind of crap writing, maybe it's worth sticking it out and see if this is a one-time aberration. But for me, there's nothing interesting or special enough in the rest of this show to risk sitting through another scene like that.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Do you have a boilerplate isekai story to tell that borrows heavily from about four hundred other similar series? Do you need a way to spice it up and get eyes on your project? Well then, may I suggest not using rape to do that? Skeleton Knight in Another World's first episode opens with a graphic (or at least graphic enough) rape scene that comes back almost shot-for-shot at about the fourteen-minute mark. It does establish that our hero, who is helpfully not the rapist, is a good guy, because he saves Lady Lauren and her maid Rita, but there seems to be no reason to show us the exact same scene of sexual violence twice in the same episode. The opening salvo seems to be a cheap bid to make viewers pay attention, and while I do recall the same scene happening in the source material, that's not an excuse. If your story's not interesting enough to appeal to viewers without shocking them, maybe you should rethink your plot.    That out of the way, the rest of the episode is also a bit shocking – shockingly bland, that is. Arc, the eponymous skeleton knight, fell asleep playing his game and woke up as his character, only he forgot that he went with the skeleton build when he was creating him, so now he's afraid to take his armor off in public. If he wanted to be a bad guy like his bone-related cousin Ainz from Overlord, he'd be all set, but in this story, his character is a holy knight, so the whole skeleton thing is a bit of a problem. So is the fact that everyone sees his ridiculously nice and powerful armor and assumes that he's gainfully employed, because that armor's all he's got and he's hungry. Watching him try to integrate himself into a very run-of-the-mill town is the most amusing part of the episode, because he's both making things up on the fly and getting random backstory assigned to him by townsfolk.    He's also incredibly excited to be having his very own isekai experience, although he doesn't phrase it that way. Arc's disappointed that his new world seems more plain old Medieval than fantasy based on Medieval Europe, and any little bit of fantasy that he can find is thrilling to him, be that an elf, an orc, or the fact that he can use magic. (Why he doesn't use his fire magic to roast himself some food is never answered.) Of course, he teleports himself right off a cliff trying to figure out how to use it, but that actually sounds about right for how this would work.    If the sexual assault had been left out, this would be an okay-ish show. Not innovative, but bland in an inoffensive way. But it does have the rape scene and that is enough to make me say that steering clear is the better option here, because a combination of insipid and offensive doesn't leave this with a whole lot to recommend it.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Skeleton Knight in Another World   Apr  8th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Skeleton Knight in Another World ?                     Community score: 3.5              What is this?   A gamer falls asleep—only to wake up in the world of the game he was playing. Arc has the powerful skills and weapons of his character, but there's just one problem, he's stuck looking like that character, too. An adventure in a fantastical new land awaits him, if he can get used to being a walking skeleton.    Skeleton Knight in Another World is based on  Ennki Hakari's light novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Jesus Christ. I started up Skeleton Knight in Another World determined that I wouldn't just repeat everything my fellow reviewers were saying, but that rape scene really casts a pall over the entire episode, doesn't it? Let's leave behind for a second that it's tawdry and potentially triggering and holy fuck Crunchyroll, couldn't you have tried to head it off with a warning screen for at least a couple seconds? Okay? Let's move on from that. It's still a spectacularly bad choice purely in terms of mood, character, and narrative structure.    Once the ridiculously graphic scene ends, the show jumps back to Arc waking up one day in a bunch of high-level gear from his favorite MMORPG with access to super powerful magic skills. But uh-oh! He's a skeleton! So he farts around getting excited about his powers and going gaga over an elf. He needs to interact with people in town without letting them know he's a skeleton, which I imagine is a lot like those dreams where you forget to put on clothes and now you're walking around naked trying to find something to wear before someone notices. I found its mishmash of isekai clichés boring, but I'm sure someone out there would like it, and overall it's pretty inoffensive.    Oh but wait! Back to the graphic rape! And all at once we've gone from silly skeleton antics to rape again, but this time we get to see Arc debating whether or not he should intervene. In a brutal rape. When he knows for a fact he's ridiculously overpowered. His hemming and hawing is even presented as comical, as he ponders whether it would be like entering PVP. It's extreme tonal whiplash, and the heaviness of the subject matter is out of place and totally overshadows everything else that happens. It's also a really, really bad look for Arc, especially as Tomoaki Maeno continues his goofy performance as Arc talks himself up between shots of the bandits ripping off the girl's piss-stained pantaloons, and her maid's breasts jiggling as another bandit slams her face into the ground.    And then, after a short scene of him accompanying them, we're back to goofy skeleton man enjoying some tasty food while trying not to let anyone notice he's a skeleton!! So funny!!    So, you know, it's not just about being offended about on-screen rape being used for cheap shock value. It's just a bad narrative choice all around, and deserves to be criticized for that in addition to being crass.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Holy crap. Hit that play button and you get both barrels, don't you? So let's get this out of the way first. I'm not going to say rape can't be used as a plot device, but it should be used carefully—and be integral to the plot/characters when used. It should not be used for simple shock value or for shorthand to show us the hero is good because he kills rapists.    Moving on, can I say how nice it is to see someone who's having fun being whisked away to a fantasy world as the game character they've put so much into? There's some real joy in seeing Arc play with his powers and get pumped up about seeing a real-life elf.

Arc is way overpowered, sure, but he can't even afford a meal, and he has no idea how to clean and cook his own food.    So it makes sense that he would immediately think to do what he already has some knowledge of: become an adventurer. He doesn't complain about the entry test, and the lack of “epic quests” doesn't really matter to him as long as he can get enough for food and a place to stay. It makes him rather likeable as a character. He's not a gun-ho fool nor is he an angsty complainer. He's just a guy enjoying the cards fate has dealt him.    The bandit scene, despite its subject matter, works well on a character development level for Arc. When coming upon the bandits, Arc doesn't intervene immediately. It isn't because he doesn't care about those being harmed but rather because he thinks he might lose. This is interesting because it shows that he doesn't see the bandits as NPCs or monsters; he sees them as other players. Not only does this mean he views them as real people, but it also makes him associate what's going on with PVP—and in PVP, numbers almost always matter more than gear. That said, he does eventually step in because he feels he has to—he sees the women as real people too, after all. The whole internal conflict speaks volumes about how he views the world he has become trapped in.    Other than that, I liked the little touches the episode threw in here and there, from people noticing his armor and deciding he was a knight to him questioning why he didn't feel bad about slaughtering the bandits despite it being the first time he had ever taken a life. The subversion of him peaking over at the women not because he's a horny asshole but because he wants to make sure they aren't looking while he excitedly loots the bodies was fantastic—and can I just say I love his oversized armor with its giant pauldrons? Him riding a horse was a great visual gag. All in all, despite the rough start, I really enjoyed this episode and can't wait to see where things go from here as he inevitably forms a party and answers the call to adventure.      James Beckett  Rating:                Skeleton Knight in Another World might just be a front-runner for two Preview Guide World Records, though they are dubious achievements indeed. First off, we have the elephant in the room, which is the “Shortest Ever Gap Between A Content Warning And The Content In Question” Award. The literal first shot of this series is of a surprisingly graphic sexual assault, and I don't know what is worse: That the scene is so lascivious and needlessly cruel right off the bat, or that we're forced to watch this twice in a show that is ostensibly a breezy isekai comedy. It isn't more than five seconds after the rapists are violently vivisected in front of their already traumatized victims that we transition to the show's cheesy OP, which I must remind you serves to introduce a main character whose sole defining character trait is that he's a goofy-looking cartoon skeleton. It is as catastrophic failure to read the room as I've seen in a long ass time, and there are a good many viewers who will understandably recoil in disgust and reject this anime outright before the opening credits finish.    The second award that Skeleton Knight in Another World is up for is a far less offensive one, though it also represents a problem that you can't simply fast-forward through. It's the “You Don't Even Really Need To Watch This Show, Because Literally Everything You Could Ever Possibly Need To Know About It Is Right There In The Title” Award! If you take the “…in Another World” half of this anime's title into consideration, then practically every single element of this premiere will fall into place, immediately, in your own head, before you even set eyes on it (except perhaps for the terrible and stupid rape scene, but you get my point).    The main character is somehow reborn into a real, flesh-and-blood universe that just so happens to perfectly mirror his favorite generic fantasy MMORPG. He is improbably strong and gifted in literally every aspect of the game, and he also spends a bunch of time breaking down his “in- game” stats sheet and skill set, as if that is somehow a substitute for having actual world-building and a plot. He then meanders around, talking to people and narrating to himself about this completely bizarre and insane scenario that we've all seen play out so many times before. He also might be a genuine sociopath, since he is completely unfazed by the horrible suffering and pain that he witnesses and inflicts upon others, and seems to live only to hoard loot from the mangled corpses he leaves behind. The ”Skeleton” part of the title tells you that the main character is a skeleton.    And look, I'm a fair critic, and I will give Skeleton Knight in Another World credit where it is due: It is somewhat amusing when when the skeleton guy makes goofy faces and gets unreasonably excited about loot. I chuckled once, near the end of the episode, because of the funny skeleton faces on the screen. For that alone, I will grant this premiere a bonus half-star to its rating. Everything else about it sucks, though, so it can wear its two Premiere Guide World Record badges like the marks of dishonor that they are.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               If any other show this season has a worse start than Skeleton Knight I'll be horribly surprised. It's not “just” that this premiere starts off, from the literal first second, with an attempted rape sequence. Nor is it “just” that said scene is gratuitous and directed with an eye for titillation for the audience, and is a cheap attempt at setting up paper thin bad guys from our hero to kill. It's that this would be a gross and crummy opening for a dark fantasy like Goblin Slayer, but it's a truly abysmal first impression for a premiere that is 90% goofy bullshit with our skeleton gamer protagonist Himbo-ing his way through a bog standard isekai setup.    Because that's what nearly this whole episode is actually about. Our hero, Arc, wakes up in a skeleton body and a suit of magic armor, realizes he's been isekai'd, and basically stumbles through a tutorial fetch quest with his overpowered skills, laughing all the way. And while the actual story is generic as hell, Arc himself makes a pretty good introduction. He's just excited to be in this new world, doesn't think to ask any questions about how it happened, and rolls through every new discovery with an almost infectious zest for fantasy life. It still slows down too much when he's shuffling through his various video game skills, and the world itself is devoid of anything interesting, but I could honestly picture myself following this literal bonehead for a few episodes, especially if the wacky slapstick from the OP animation is an honest promise.    But all that goodwill died once we circled back around to that rape scene. It's just such a lazy, shameless bit of shock-jock writing that stops the episode in its tracks. It exists solely to create some indisputably evil bandits for our hero to gallantly kill, letting him take lives without guilt (literally, the show admits this right after) and gaining him the affection of the victimized waif he saved. It's the same kind of hacky, exploitative garbage that showed up to ruin Sword Art Online every season like clockwork, and it's especially out of place in what is otherwise a goofy comedy. Plus, it's all made even worse when we see the attack from Arc's perspective and know he could have stepped in sooner, but was busy fretting over his chances in a PVP fight and waited until literally the last second. Then once it's over we're right back to silly funtimes with The Bone Boi as he celebrates his new life in this fantasy world, making the entire thing feel like a bad joke.    So congrats to the story for ensuring I'm not going to bother with any more of it. Ya took any charm or fun you managed to generate and threw it in the garbage. If other viewers have more tolerance for this kind of crap writing, maybe it's worth sticking it out and see if this is a one-time aberration. But for me, there's nothing interesting or special enough in the rest of this show to risk sitting through another scene like that.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Do you have a boilerplate isekai story to tell that borrows heavily from about four hundred other similar series? Do you need a way to spice it up and get eyes on your project? Well then, may I suggest not using rape to do that? Skeleton Knight in Another World's first episode opens with a graphic (or at least graphic enough) rape scene that comes back almost shot-for-shot at about the fourteen-minute mark. It does establish that our hero, who is helpfully not the rapist, is a good guy, because he saves Lady Lauren and her maid Rita, but there seems to be no reason to show us the exact same scene of sexual violence twice in the same episode. The opening salvo seems to be a cheap bid to make viewers pay attention, and while I do recall the same scene happening in the source material, that's not an excuse. If your story's not interesting enough to appeal to viewers without shocking them, maybe you should rethink your plot.    That out of the way, the rest of the episode is also a bit shocking – shockingly bland, that is. Arc, the eponymous skeleton knight, fell asleep playing his game and woke up as his character, only he forgot that he went with the skeleton build when he was creating him, so now he's afraid to take his armor off in public. If he wanted to be a bad guy like his bone-related cousin Ainz from Overlord, he'd be all set, but in this story, his character is a holy knight, so the whole skeleton thing is a bit of a problem. So is the fact that everyone sees his ridiculously nice and powerful armor and assumes that he's gainfully employed, because that armor's all he's got and he's hungry. Watching him try to integrate himself into a very run-of-the-mill town is the most amusing part of the episode, because he's both making things up on the fly and getting random backstory assigned to him by townsfolk.    He's also incredibly excited to be having his very own isekai experience, although he doesn't phrase it that way. Arc's disappointed that his new world seems more plain old Medieval than fantasy based on Medieval Europe, and any little bit of fantasy that he can find is thrilling to him, be that an elf, an orc, or the fact that he can use magic. (Why he doesn't use his fire magic to roast himself some food is never answered.) Of course, he teleports himself right off a cliff trying to figure out how to use it, but that actually sounds about right for how this would work.    If the sexual assault had been left out, this would be an okay-ish show. Not innovative, but bland in an inoffensive way. But it does have the rape scene and that is enough to make me say that steering clear is the better option here, because a combination of insipid and offensive doesn't leave this with a whole lot to recommend it.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 3.5              What is this?   A gamer falls asleep—only to wake up in the world of the game he was playing. Arc has the powerful skills and weapons of his character, but there's just one problem, he's stuck looking like that character, too. An adventure in a fantastical new land awaits him, if he can get used to being a walking skeleton.    Skeleton Knight in Another World is based on  Ennki Hakari's light novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Jesus Christ. I started up Skeleton Knight in Another World determined that I wouldn't just repeat everything my fellow reviewers were saying, but that rape scene really casts a pall over the entire episode, doesn't it? Let's leave behind for a second that it's tawdry and potentially triggering and holy fuck Crunchyroll, couldn't you have tried to head it off with a warning screen for at least a couple seconds? Okay? Let's move on from that. It's still a spectacularly bad choice purely in terms of mood, character, and narrative structure.    Once the ridiculously graphic scene ends, the show jumps back to Arc waking up one day in a bunch of high-level gear from his favorite MMORPG with access to super powerful magic skills. But uh-oh! He's a skeleton! So he farts around getting excited about his powers and going gaga over an elf. He needs to interact with people in town without letting them know he's a skeleton, which I imagine is a lot like those dreams where you forget to put on clothes and now you're walking around naked trying to find something to wear before someone notices. I found its mishmash of isekai clichés boring, but I'm sure someone out there would like it, and overall it's pretty inoffensive.    Oh but wait! Back to the graphic rape! And all at once we've gone from silly skeleton antics to rape again, but this time we get to see Arc debating whether or not he should intervene. In a brutal rape. When he knows for a fact he's ridiculously overpowered. His hemming and hawing is even presented as comical, as he ponders whether it would be like entering PVP. It's extreme tonal whiplash, and the heaviness of the subject matter is out of place and totally overshadows everything else that happens. It's also a really, really bad look for Arc, especially as Tomoaki Maeno continues his goofy performance as Arc talks himself up between shots of the bandits ripping off the girl's piss-stained pantaloons, and her maid's breasts jiggling as another bandit slams her face into the ground.    And then, after a short scene of him accompanying them, we're back to goofy skeleton man enjoying some tasty food while trying not to let anyone notice he's a skeleton!! So funny!!    So, you know, it's not just about being offended about on-screen rape being used for cheap shock value. It's just a bad narrative choice all around, and deserves to be criticized for that in addition to being crass.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Holy crap. Hit that play button and you get both barrels, don't you? So let's get this out of the way first. I'm not going to say rape can't be used as a plot device, but it should be used carefully—and be integral to the plot/characters when used. It should not be used for simple shock value or for shorthand to show us the hero is good because he kills rapists.    Moving on, can I say how nice it is to see someone who's having fun being whisked away to a fantasy world as the game character they've put so much into? There's some real joy in seeing Arc play with his powers and get pumped up about seeing a real-life elf. Even better is that, even with his excitement, he's still smart enough to realize the immediate issues he has to face. Arc is way overpowered, sure, but he can't even afford a meal, and he has no idea how to clean and cook his own food.    So it makes sense that he would immediately think to do what he already has some knowledge of: become an adventurer.

The whole internal conflict speaks volumes about how he views the world he has become trapped in.    Other than that, I liked the little touches the episode threw in here and there, from people noticing his armor and deciding he was a knight to him questioning why he didn't feel bad about slaughtering the bandits despite it being the first time he had ever taken a life. The subversion of him peaking over at the women not because he's a horny asshole but because he wants to make sure they aren't looking while he excitedly loots the bodies was fantastic—and can I just say I love his oversized armor with its giant pauldrons? Him riding a horse was a great visual gag. All in all, despite the rough start, I really enjoyed this episode and can't wait to see where things go from here as he inevitably forms a party and answers the call to adventure.      James Beckett  Rating:                Skeleton Knight in Another World might just be a front-runner for two Preview Guide World Records, though they are dubious achievements indeed. First off, we have the elephant in the room, which is the “Shortest Ever Gap Between A Content Warning And The Content In Question” Award. The literal first shot of this series is of a surprisingly graphic sexual assault, and I don't know what is worse: That the scene is so lascivious and needlessly cruel right off the bat, or that we're forced to watch this twice in a show that is ostensibly a breezy isekai comedy. It isn't more than five seconds after the rapists are violently vivisected in front of their already traumatized victims that we transition to the show's cheesy OP, which I must remind you serves to introduce a main character whose sole defining character trait is that he's a goofy-looking cartoon skeleton. It is as catastrophic failure to read the room as I've seen in a long ass time, and there are a good many viewers who will understandably recoil in disgust and reject this anime outright before the opening credits finish.    The second award that Skeleton Knight in Another World is up for is a far less offensive one, though it also represents a problem that you can't simply fast-forward through. It's the “You Don't Even Really Need To Watch This Show, Because Literally Everything You Could Ever Possibly Need To Know About It Is Right There In The Title” Award! If you take the “…in Another World” half of this anime's title into consideration, then practically every single element of this premiere will fall into place, immediately, in your own head, before you even set eyes on it (except perhaps for the terrible and stupid rape scene, but you get my point).    The main character is somehow reborn into a real, flesh-and-blood universe that just so happens to perfectly mirror his favorite generic fantasy MMORPG. He is improbably strong and gifted in literally every aspect of the game, and he also spends a bunch of time breaking down his “in- game” stats sheet and skill set, as if that is somehow a substitute for having actual world-building and a plot. He then meanders around, talking to people and narrating to himself about this completely bizarre and insane scenario that we've all seen play out so many times before. He also might be a genuine sociopath, since he is completely unfazed by the horrible suffering and pain that he witnesses and inflicts upon others, and seems to live only to hoard loot from the mangled corpses he leaves behind. The ”Skeleton” part of the title tells you that the main character is a skeleton.    And look, I'm a fair critic, and I will give Skeleton Knight in Another World credit where it is due: It is somewhat amusing when when the skeleton guy makes goofy faces and gets unreasonably excited about loot. I chuckled once, near the end of the episode, because of the funny skeleton faces on the screen. For that alone, I will grant this premiere a bonus half-star to its rating. Everything else about it sucks, though, so it can wear its two Premiere Guide World Record badges like the marks of dishonor that they are.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               If any other show this season has a worse start than Skeleton Knight I'll be horribly surprised. It's not “just” that this premiere starts off, from the literal first second, with an attempted rape sequence. Nor is it “just” that said scene is gratuitous and directed with an eye for titillation for the audience, and is a cheap attempt at setting up paper thin bad guys from our hero to kill. It's that this would be a gross and crummy opening for a dark fantasy like Goblin Slayer, but it's a truly abysmal first impression for a premiere that is 90% goofy bullshit with our skeleton gamer protagonist Himbo-ing his way through a bog standard isekai setup.    Because that's what nearly this whole episode is actually about. Our hero, Arc, wakes up in a skeleton body and a suit of magic armor, realizes he's been isekai'd, and basically stumbles through a tutorial fetch quest with his overpowered skills, laughing all the way. And while the actual story is generic as hell, Arc himself makes a pretty good introduction. He's just excited to be in this new world, doesn't think to ask any questions about how it happened, and rolls through every new discovery with an almost infectious zest for fantasy life. It still slows down too much when he's shuffling through his various video game skills, and the world itself is devoid of anything interesting, but I could honestly picture myself following this literal bonehead for a few episodes, especially if the wacky slapstick from the OP animation is an honest promise.    But all that goodwill died once we circled back around to that rape scene. It's just such a lazy, shameless bit of shock-jock writing that stops the episode in its tracks. It exists solely to create some indisputably evil bandits for our hero to gallantly kill, letting him take lives without guilt (literally, the show admits this right after) and gaining him the affection of the victimized waif he saved. It's the same kind of hacky, exploitative garbage that showed up to ruin Sword Art Online every season like clockwork, and it's especially out of place in what is otherwise a goofy comedy. Plus, it's all made even worse when we see the attack from Arc's perspective and know he could have stepped in sooner, but was busy fretting over his chances in a PVP fight and waited until literally the last second. Then once it's over we're right back to silly funtimes with The Bone Boi as he celebrates his new life in this fantasy world, making the entire thing feel like a bad joke.    So congrats to the story for ensuring I'm not going to bother with any more of it. Ya took any charm or fun you managed to generate and threw it in the garbage. If other viewers have more tolerance for this kind of crap writing, maybe it's worth sticking it out and see if this is a one-time aberration. But for me, there's nothing interesting or special enough in the rest of this show to risk sitting through another scene like that.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Do you have a boilerplate isekai story to tell that borrows heavily from about four hundred other similar series? Do you need a way to spice it up and get eyes on your project? Well then, may I suggest not using rape to do that? Skeleton Knight in Another World's first episode opens with a graphic (or at least graphic enough) rape scene that comes back almost shot-for-shot at about the fourteen-minute mark. It does establish that our hero, who is helpfully not the rapist, is a good guy, because he saves Lady Lauren and her maid Rita, but there seems to be no reason to show us the exact same scene of sexual violence twice in the same episode. The opening salvo seems to be a cheap bid to make viewers pay attention, and while I do recall the same scene happening in the source material, that's not an excuse. If your story's not interesting enough to appeal to viewers without shocking them, maybe you should rethink your plot.    That out of the way, the rest of the episode is also a bit shocking – shockingly bland, that is. Arc, the eponymous skeleton knight, fell asleep playing his game and woke up as his character, only he forgot that he went with the skeleton build when he was creating him, so now he's afraid to take his armor off in public. If he wanted to be a bad guy like his bone-related cousin Ainz from Overlord, he'd be all set, but in this story, his character is a holy knight, so the whole skeleton thing is a bit of a problem. So is the fact that everyone sees his ridiculously nice and powerful armor and assumes that he's gainfully employed, because that armor's all he's got and he's hungry. Watching him try to integrate himself into a very run-of-the-mill town is the most amusing part of the episode, because he's both making things up on the fly and getting random backstory assigned to him by townsfolk.    He's also incredibly excited to be having his very own isekai experience, although he doesn't phrase it that way. Arc's disappointed that his new world seems more plain old Medieval than fantasy based on Medieval Europe, and any little bit of fantasy that he can find is thrilling to him, be that an elf, an orc, or the fact that he can use magic. (Why he doesn't use his fire magic to roast himself some food is never answered.) Of course, he teleports himself right off a cliff trying to figure out how to use it, but that actually sounds about right for how this would work.    If the sexual assault had been left out, this would be an okay-ish show. Not innovative, but bland in an inoffensive way. But it does have the rape scene and that is enough to make me say that steering clear is the better option here, because a combination of insipid and offensive doesn't leave this with a whole lot to recommend it.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives    ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 3.5              What is this?   A gamer falls asleep—only to wake up in the world of the game he was playing. Arc has the powerful skills and weapons of his character, but there's just one problem, he's stuck looking like that character, too. An adventure in a fantastical new land awaits him, if he can get used to being a walking skeleton.    Skeleton Knight in Another World is based on  Ennki Hakari's light novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Jesus Christ. I started up Skeleton Knight in Another World determined that I wouldn't just repeat everything my fellow reviewers were saying, but that rape scene really casts a pall over the entire episode, doesn't it? Let's leave behind for a second that it's tawdry and potentially triggering and holy fuck Crunchyroll, couldn't you have tried to head it off with a warning screen for at least a couple seconds? Okay? Let's move on from that. It's still a spectacularly bad choice purely in terms of mood, character, and narrative structure.    Once the ridiculously graphic scene ends, the show jumps back to Arc waking up one day in a bunch of high-level gear from his favorite MMORPG with access to super powerful magic skills. But uh-oh! He's a skeleton! So he farts around getting excited about his powers and going gaga over an elf. He needs to interact with people in town without letting them know he's a skeleton, which I imagine is a lot like those dreams where you forget to put on clothes and now you're walking around naked trying to find something to wear before someone notices. I found its mishmash of isekai clichés boring, but I'm sure someone out there would like it, and overall it's pretty inoffensive.    Oh but wait! Back to the graphic rape! And all at once we've gone from silly skeleton antics to rape again, but this time we get to see Arc debating whether or not he should intervene. In a brutal rape. When he knows for a fact he's ridiculously overpowered. His hemming and hawing is even presented as comical, as he ponders whether it would be like entering PVP. It's extreme tonal whiplash, and the heaviness of the subject matter is out of place and totally overshadows everything else that happens. It's also a really, really bad look for Arc, especially as Tomoaki Maeno continues his goofy performance as Arc talks himself up between shots of the bandits ripping off the girl's piss-stained pantaloons, and her maid's breasts jiggling as another bandit slams her face into the ground.    And then, after a short scene of him accompanying them, we're back to goofy skeleton man enjoying some tasty food while trying not to let anyone notice he's a skeleton!! So funny!!    So, you know, it's not just about being offended about on-screen rape being used for cheap shock value. It's just a bad narrative choice all around, and deserves to be criticized for that in addition to being crass.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Holy crap. Hit that play button and you get both barrels, don't you? So let's get this out of the way first. I'm not going to say rape can't be used as a plot device, but it should be used carefully—and be integral to the plot/characters when used. It should not be used for simple shock value or for shorthand to show us the hero is good because he kills rapists.    Moving on, can I say how nice it is to see someone who's having fun being whisked away to a fantasy world as the game character they've put so much into? There's some real joy in seeing Arc play with his powers and get pumped up about seeing a real-life elf. Even better is that, even with his excitement, he's still smart enough to realize the immediate issues he has to face. Arc is way overpowered, sure, but he can't even afford a meal, and he has no idea how to clean and cook his own food.    So it makes sense that he would immediately think to do what he already has some knowledge of: become an adventurer. He doesn't complain about the entry test, and the lack of “epic quests” doesn't really matter to him as long as he can get enough for food and a place to stay. It makes him rather likeable as a character. He's not a gun-ho fool nor is he an angsty complainer. He's just a guy enjoying the cards fate has dealt him.    The bandit scene, despite its subject matter, works well on a character development level for Arc. When coming upon the bandits, Arc doesn't intervene immediately. It isn't because he doesn't care about those being harmed but rather because he thinks he might lose. This is interesting because it shows that he doesn't see the bandits as NPCs or monsters; he sees them as other players. Not only does this mean he views them as real people, but it also makes him associate what's going on with PVP—and in PVP, numbers almost always matter more than gear. That said, he does eventually step in because he feels he has to—he sees the women as real people too, after all. The whole internal conflict speaks volumes about how he views the world he has become trapped in.    Other than that, I liked the little touches the episode threw in here and there, from people noticing his armor and deciding he was a knight to him questioning why he didn't feel bad about slaughtering the bandits despite it being the first time he had ever taken a life.

It isn't more than five seconds after the rapists are violently vivisected in front of their already traumatized victims that we transition to the show's cheesy OP, which I must remind you serves to introduce a main character whose sole defining character trait is that he's a goofy-looking cartoon skeleton. It is as catastrophic failure to read the room as I've seen in a long ass time, and there are a good many viewers who will understandably recoil in disgust and reject this anime outright before the opening credits finish.    The second award that Skeleton Knight in Another World is up for is a far less offensive one, though it also represents a problem that you can't simply fast-forward through. It's the “You Don't Even Really Need To Watch This Show, Because Literally Everything You Could Ever Possibly Need To Know About It Is Right There In The Title” Award! If you take the “…in Another World” half of this anime's title into consideration, then practically every single element of this premiere will fall into place, immediately, in your own head, before you even set eyes on it (except perhaps for the terrible and stupid rape scene, but you get my point).    The main character is somehow reborn into a real, flesh-and-blood universe that just so happens to perfectly mirror his favorite generic fantasy MMORPG. He is improbably strong and gifted in literally every aspect of the game, and he also spends a bunch of time breaking down his “in- game” stats sheet and skill set, as if that is somehow a substitute for having actual world-building and a plot. He then meanders around, talking to people and narrating to himself about this completely bizarre and insane scenario that we've all seen play out so many times before. He also might be a genuine sociopath, since he is completely unfazed by the horrible suffering and pain that he witnesses and inflicts upon others, and seems to live only to hoard loot from the mangled corpses he leaves behind. The ”Skeleton” part of the title tells you that the main character is a skeleton.    And look, I'm a fair critic, and I will give Skeleton Knight in Another World credit where it is due: It is somewhat amusing when when the skeleton guy makes goofy faces and gets unreasonably excited about loot. I chuckled once, near the end of the episode, because of the funny skeleton faces on the screen. For that alone, I will grant this premiere a bonus half-star to its rating. Everything else about it sucks, though, so it can wear its two Premiere Guide World Record badges like the marks of dishonor that they are.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               If any other show this season has a worse start than Skeleton Knight I'll be horribly surprised. It's not “just” that this premiere starts off, from the literal first second, with an attempted rape sequence. Nor is it “just” that said scene is gratuitous and directed with an eye for titillation for the audience, and is a cheap attempt at setting up paper thin bad guys from our hero to kill. It's that this would be a gross and crummy opening for a dark fantasy like Goblin Slayer, but it's a truly abysmal first impression for a premiere that is 90% goofy bullshit with our skeleton gamer protagonist Himbo-ing his way through a bog standard isekai setup.    Because that's what nearly this whole episode is actually about. Our hero, Arc, wakes up in a skeleton body and a suit of magic armor, realizes he's been isekai'd, and basically stumbles through a tutorial fetch quest with his overpowered skills, laughing all the way. And while the actual story is generic as hell, Arc himself makes a pretty good introduction. He's just excited to be in this new world, doesn't think to ask any questions about how it happened, and rolls through every new discovery with an almost infectious zest for fantasy life. It still slows down too much when he's shuffling through his various video game skills, and the world itself is devoid of anything interesting, but I could honestly picture myself following this literal bonehead for a few episodes, especially if the wacky slapstick from the OP animation is an honest promise.    But all that goodwill died once we circled back around to that rape scene. It's just such a lazy, shameless bit of shock-jock writing that stops the episode in its tracks. It exists solely to create some indisputably evil bandits for our hero to gallantly kill, letting him take lives without guilt (literally, the show admits this right after) and gaining him the affection of the victimized waif he saved. It's the same kind of hacky, exploitative garbage that showed up to ruin Sword Art Online every season like clockwork, and it's especially out of place in what is otherwise a goofy comedy. Plus, it's all made even worse when we see the attack from Arc's perspective and know he could have stepped in sooner, but was busy fretting over his chances in a PVP fight and waited until literally the last second. Then once it's over we're right back to silly funtimes with The Bone Boi as he celebrates his new life in this fantasy world, making the entire thing feel like a bad joke.    So congrats to the story for ensuring I'm not going to bother with any more of it. Ya took any charm or fun you managed to generate and threw it in the garbage. If other viewers have more tolerance for this kind of crap writing, maybe it's worth sticking it out and see if this is a one-time aberration. But for me, there's nothing interesting or special enough in the rest of this show to risk sitting through another scene like that.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Do you have a boilerplate isekai story to tell that borrows heavily from about four hundred other similar series? Do you need a way to spice it up and get eyes on your project? Well then, may I suggest not using rape to do that? Skeleton Knight in Another World's first episode opens with a graphic (or at least graphic enough) rape scene that comes back almost shot-for-shot at about the fourteen-minute mark. It does establish that our hero, who is helpfully not the rapist, is a good guy, because he saves Lady Lauren and her maid Rita, but there seems to be no reason to show us the exact same scene of sexual violence twice in the same episode. The opening salvo seems to be a cheap bid to make viewers pay attention, and while I do recall the same scene happening in the source material, that's not an excuse. If your story's not interesting enough to appeal to viewers without shocking them, maybe you should rethink your plot.    That out of the way, the rest of the episode is also a bit shocking – shockingly bland, that is. Arc, the eponymous skeleton knight, fell asleep playing his game and woke up as his character, only he forgot that he went with the skeleton build when he was creating him, so now he's afraid to take his armor off in public. If he wanted to be a bad guy like his bone-related cousin Ainz from Overlord, he'd be all set, but in this story, his character is a holy knight, so the whole skeleton thing is a bit of a problem. So is the fact that everyone sees his ridiculously nice and powerful armor and assumes that he's gainfully employed, because that armor's all he's got and he's hungry. Watching him try to integrate himself into a very run-of-the-mill town is the most amusing part of the episode, because he's both making things up on the fly and getting random backstory assigned to him by townsfolk.    He's also incredibly excited to be having his very own isekai experience, although he doesn't phrase it that way. Arc's disappointed that his new world seems more plain old Medieval than fantasy based on Medieval Europe, and any little bit of fantasy that he can find is thrilling to him, be that an elf, an orc, or the fact that he can use magic. (Why he doesn't use his fire magic to roast himself some food is never answered.) Of course, he teleports himself right off a cliff trying to figure out how to use it, but that actually sounds about right for how this would work.    If the sexual assault had been left out, this would be an okay-ish show. Not innovative, but bland in an inoffensive way. But it does have the rape scene and that is enough to make me say that steering clear is the better option here, because a combination of insipid and offensive doesn't leave this with a whole lot to recommend it.

Community score: 3.5              What is this?   A gamer falls asleep—only to wake up in the world of the game he was playing. Arc has the powerful skills and weapons of his character, but there's just one problem, he's stuck looking like that character, too. An adventure in a fantastical new land awaits him, if he can get used to being a walking skeleton.    Skeleton Knight in Another World is based on  Ennki Hakari's light novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Jesus Christ. I started up Skeleton Knight in Another World determined that I wouldn't just repeat everything my fellow reviewers were saying, but that rape scene really casts a pall over the entire episode, doesn't it? Let's leave behind for a second that it's tawdry and potentially triggering and holy fuck Crunchyroll, couldn't you have tried to head it off with a warning screen for at least a couple seconds? Okay? Let's move on from that. It's still a spectacularly bad choice purely in terms of mood, character, and narrative structure.    Once the ridiculously graphic scene ends, the show jumps back to Arc waking up one day in a bunch of high-level gear from his favorite MMORPG with access to super powerful magic skills. But uh-oh! He's a skeleton! So he farts around getting excited about his powers and going gaga over an elf. He needs to interact with people in town without letting them know he's a skeleton, which I imagine is a lot like those dreams where you forget to put on clothes and now you're walking around naked trying to find something to wear before someone notices. I found its mishmash of isekai clichés boring, but I'm sure someone out there would like it, and overall it's pretty inoffensive.    Oh but wait! Back to the graphic rape! And all at once we've gone from silly skeleton antics to rape again, but this time we get to see Arc debating whether or not he should intervene. In a brutal rape. When he knows for a fact he's ridiculously overpowered. His hemming and hawing is even presented as comical, as he ponders whether it would be like entering PVP. It's extreme tonal whiplash, and the heaviness of the subject matter is out of place and totally overshadows everything else that happens. It's also a really, really bad look for Arc, especially as Tomoaki Maeno continues his goofy performance as Arc talks himself up between shots of the bandits ripping off the girl's piss-stained pantaloons, and her maid's breasts jiggling as another bandit slams her face into the ground.    And then, after a short scene of him accompanying them, we're back to goofy skeleton man enjoying some tasty food while trying not to let anyone notice he's a skeleton!! So funny!!    So, you know, it's not just about being offended about on-screen rape being used for cheap shock value. It's just a bad narrative choice all around, and deserves to be criticized for that in addition to being crass.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Holy crap. Hit that play button and you get both barrels, don't you? So let's get this out of the way first. I'm not going to say rape can't be used as a plot device, but it should be used carefully—and be integral to the plot/characters when used. It should not be used for simple shock value or for shorthand to show us the hero is good because he kills rapists.    Moving on, can I say how nice it is to see someone who's having fun being whisked away to a fantasy world as the game character they've put so much into? There's some real joy in seeing Arc play with his powers and get pumped up about seeing a real-life elf. Even better is that, even with his excitement, he's still smart enough to realize the immediate issues he has to face. Arc is way overpowered, sure, but he can't even afford a meal, and he has no idea how to clean and cook his own food.    So it makes sense that he would immediately think to do what he already has some knowledge of: become an adventurer. He doesn't complain about the entry test, and the lack of “epic quests” doesn't really matter to him as long as he can get enough for food and a place to stay. It makes him rather likeable as a character. He's not a gun-ho fool nor is he an angsty complainer. He's just a guy enjoying the cards fate has dealt him.    The bandit scene, despite its subject matter, works well on a character development level for Arc. When coming upon the bandits, Arc doesn't intervene immediately. It isn't because he doesn't care about those being harmed but rather because he thinks he might lose. This is interesting because it shows that he doesn't see the bandits as NPCs or monsters; he sees them as other players. Not only does this mean he views them as real people, but it also makes him associate what's going on with PVP—and in PVP, numbers almost always matter more than gear. That said, he does eventually step in because he feels he has to—he sees the women as real people too, after all. The whole internal conflict speaks volumes about how he views the world he has become trapped in.    Other than that, I liked the little touches the episode threw in here and there, from people noticing his armor and deciding he was a knight to him questioning why he didn't feel bad about slaughtering the bandits despite it being the first time he had ever taken a life. The subversion of him peaking over at the women not because he's a horny asshole but because he wants to make sure they aren't looking while he excitedly loots the bodies was fantastic—and can I just say I love his oversized armor with its giant pauldrons? Him riding a horse was a great visual gag. All in all, despite the rough start, I really enjoyed this episode and can't wait to see where things go from here as he inevitably forms a party and answers the call to adventure.      James Beckett  Rating:                Skeleton Knight in Another World might just be a front-runner for two Preview Guide World Records, though they are dubious achievements indeed.

Review:         Synopsis:        Through a culmination of years of personal research on cosplay, author Frenchy Lunning combines the fascinating viewpoints of cosplayers with observational, in-depth research on cosplay history, its practices, and a deep dive into critical theory involving the modes of fictional existence, in order to understand its global expansion. Who was the first cosplayer? How has cosplay's relationship with popular culture changed throughout the decades? What are the different ways the practice is executed and celebrated throughout the world? Cosplay: The Fictional Mode of Existence is an interesting examination of identity, performance, play, and otaku fandom in its relation to the growing art of cosplay.     Review:            Cosplay is one of the cornerstones of pop culture celebration. Whether it's science-fiction, fantasy, western, or eastern animation, it feels like you don't have to go far nowadays to come across people that wear their love for these mediums on their sleeves in a very literal way. Granted, in my passive research, a lot of media use cosplay as an extension of nerd fandom or otaku culture, but very rarely is it seen as a focus of cultural significance in and of itself. So as someone who has cosplayed for roughly the past decade with a fluctuating involvement in the larger cosplay community, do I think the text accomplishes that goal of proper focus and attention? Yes I do and with flying colors to boot.    The best way to describe Cosplay: The Fictional Mode of Existence would be that it is an amazing outline for a cosplay 101 class that could be taught in a college semester. Yes, I understand that to some people that might sound silly because there can't possibly be that much informed history and social analysis to actually teach a class over an extended period of time…right? I will admit I was one of those people. Of course I knew cosplay had to have started somewhere and that the way things are now probably wasn't the way they were 20 or 30 years ago. However, the sheer extent to which things have evolved that got us to this point shocked me to my very core with questions that I didn't even think could be asked. A speculative yet thorough look at the origins of cosplay and spaces that celebrate them? Oftentimes across different cultures and locations? Check. An extensive breakdown on the parasocial relationship that cosplayers have with their performances as well as the costumes they wear as a form of love and artistic expression? Check. How the evolution of cosplay as a social construct correlates to how collective people evolve as a culture? Check.    This is the most scholarly and straightforward approach to the idea of cosplay that I have ever seen. Granted, I didn't look very far for media like this, but I feel like this book covers so much ground and then some, you could walk away feeling like you just took an extensive course on how interesting this medium is from an angle where you don't even have to cosplay yourself. I feel like I could write half a dozen pages on some of the interesting passive and direct influences that the very concept of cosplaying has had on society and vice versa. I don't feel confident in proclaiming whether or not Lunning considers themselves a cosplayer or as a part of the larger cosplay community. But the sheer love and respect displayed right out the gate in this book feels like it also deserves equal recognition.    Although I will say I'm curious if the author had an extra year or two to include how recent difficult events have affected the cosplay community as well, as COVID-19 not only shut down a majority of the events that are discussed in this book, but in my personal experience, it has also given life to a much more prominent online culture born from people who shoot from home. That's the funny thing, things are always changing and cosplay has always sort of adapted and grown with the times dating back to before the term cosplay was even developed. There was one sentence towards the end of the book that really stood out to me “Cosplay, then, is an art form that may or may not last, but even if it does not, it will always-as it does now-evolve”.    Thankfully the book doesn't try to present itself as some kind of definitive Bible on how cosplay works. It also avoids purporting any definitions revolving around the culture or history above others as some accounts of events can be conflicting and different places might consider different angles. If anything, the book makes it apparent very early on that it is the culmination of various different thoughts, opinions, and definitions from dozens upon dozens of people who could give even a passive insight into this evolving culture. This didn't just include cosplayers old and young but also photographers, historians, scholars, performers, writers etc. all of these are very well cited and documented at the end of the book in a way that is easy to refer to with proper citations (although I will admit reading this in PDF form was a little difficult since I had to constantly scroll back-and-forth. Definitely get a physical copy.) The book is even filled with pictures from the variety of different conventions, plays, and countries in order to add further context to some of the key examples that are talked about.    Unfortunately, that overall thoroughness and passion for detail might end up doubling as the book's greatest weakness. This is not a book that I think most people could reasonably absorb in a short amount of time. Not only does the text cover a wide spectrum of times, cultures and fandoms, but it also presents that information in an extremely direct and scholarly way. Obviously given the overall intention and subject matter, such density is to be expected. However, this even bleeds into the sentence by sentence prose. Granted, I do not have the most astute attention span, but when certain sections can be filled with sentences that go on for 5 to 6 lines at a time, it's easy to get lost and not properly absorb the sheer amount of detail without a couple of rereads. None of this is helped by the fact that reading this as a cosplayer can sort of be a double-edged sword because while you can appreciate the information that is not commonly known to a lot of people, some sections can feel redundant in how they explain or set up events that are already obvious to those who have had those experiences. Looking back, I do think some sections could've been a bit more condensed or perhaps there could've been a more efficient way of easing readers into the sheer bulk of history that is about to be dropped on them.    However, the fact that I found a historical and cultural analysis of cosplay overwhelming is kind of an accomplishment in and of itself. Every section was filled with new information that only made me grow more and more respect for the medium. It was amazing seeing this almost logical progression of cosplay culture from the early days until present day and a culture that is still evolving as I am writing this review now. If anything, this book made me feel proud to be a cosplayer at a time when circumstances make certain forms of expression more difficult than they used to be. I have nothing but respect and appreciation for the amount of love, thought, and care that went into this book. You might have to set aside a good amount of time to go through it, but I definitely think this is a must read for those curious about cosplay or for those who are at all interested in where things got started or want to theorize on where things might go next.             Grade:      Overall : A-  + Extremely thorough and well researched, properly cited sources, possesses information that long time cosplayers and newcomers will appreciate, properly treats the artform with a great sense of weight and cultural importance − Some sections might feel redundant if you're already an experienced cosplayer, the sheer density of the material can be overwhelming, literary prose can drag on and be frontloaded with too much information too quickly            discuss this in the forum (7 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                       Review homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          2 comments       Akari Akase's Ending Theme Song for My Dress-Up Darling Anime Streamed 7 Million Times   Apr 16, 13:35 2 comments                 music    Music video debuted on January 9 ― The music video for Akari Akase's ""Koi no Yukue"" (Where Love Is), the ending theme song for the television anime of Shinichi Fukuda's My Dress-Up Darling (Sono Bisque Doll wa Koi wo Suru), has been streamed over seven million times since its release about three months ago.

Review:         Synopsis:        Through a culmination of years of personal research on cosplay, author Frenchy Lunning combines the fascinating viewpoints of cosplayers with observational, in-depth research on cosplay history, its practices, and a deep dive into critical theory involving the modes of fictional existence, in order to understand its global expansion. Who was the first cosplayer? How has cosplay's relationship with popular culture changed throughout the decades? What are the different ways the practice is executed and celebrated throughout the world? Cosplay: The Fictional Mode of Existence is an interesting examination of identity, performance, play, and otaku fandom in its relation to the growing art of cosplay.     Review:            Cosplay is one of the cornerstones of pop culture celebration. Whether it's science-fiction, fantasy, western, or eastern animation, it feels like you don't have to go far nowadays to come across people that wear their love for these mediums on their sleeves in a very literal way. Granted, in my passive research, a lot of media use cosplay as an extension of nerd fandom or otaku culture, but very rarely is it seen as a focus of cultural significance in and of itself. So as someone who has cosplayed for roughly the past decade with a fluctuating involvement in the larger cosplay community, do I think the text accomplishes that goal of proper focus and attention? Yes I do and with flying colors to boot.    The best way to describe Cosplay: The Fictional Mode of Existence would be that it is an amazing outline for a cosplay 101 class that could be taught in a college semester. Yes, I understand that to some people that might sound silly because there can't possibly be that much informed history and social analysis to actually teach a class over an extended period of time…right? I will admit I was one of those people. Of course I knew cosplay had to have started somewhere and that the way things are now probably wasn't the way they were 20 or 30 years ago. However, the sheer extent to which things have evolved that got us to this point shocked me to my very core with questions that I didn't even think could be asked. A speculative yet thorough look at the origins of cosplay and spaces that celebrate them? Oftentimes across different cultures and locations? Check. An extensive breakdown on the parasocial relationship that cosplayers have with their performances as well as the costumes they wear as a form of love and artistic expression? Check. How the evolution of cosplay as a social construct correlates to how collective people evolve as a culture? Check.    This is the most scholarly and straightforward approach to the idea of cosplay that I have ever seen. Granted, I didn't look very far for media like this, but I feel like this book covers so much ground and then some, you could walk away feeling like you just took an extensive course on how interesting this medium is from an angle where you don't even have to cosplay yourself. I feel like I could write half a dozen pages on some of the interesting passive and direct influences that the very concept of cosplaying has had on society and vice versa. I don't feel confident in proclaiming whether or not Lunning considers themselves a cosplayer or as a part of the larger cosplay community. But the sheer love and respect displayed right out the gate in this book feels like it also deserves equal recognition.    Although I will say I'm curious if the author had an extra year or two to include how recent difficult events have affected the cosplay community as well, as COVID-19 not only shut down a majority of the events that are discussed in this book, but in my personal experience, it has also given life to a much more prominent online culture born from people who shoot from home. That's the funny thing, things are always changing and cosplay has always sort of adapted and grown with the times dating back to before the term cosplay was even developed. There was one sentence towards the end of the book that really stood out to me “Cosplay, then, is an art form that may or may not last, but even if it does not, it will always-as it does now-evolve”.    Thankfully the book doesn't try to present itself as some kind of definitive Bible on how cosplay works. It also avoids purporting any definitions revolving around the culture or history above others as some accounts of events can be conflicting and different places might consider different angles. If anything, the book makes it apparent very early on that it is the culmination of various different thoughts, opinions, and definitions from dozens upon dozens of people who could give even a passive insight into this evolving culture. This didn't just include cosplayers old and young but also photographers, historians, scholars, performers, writers etc. all of these are very well cited and documented at the end of the book in a way that is easy to refer to with proper citations (although I will admit reading this in PDF form was a little difficult since I had to constantly scroll back-and-forth. Definitely get a physical copy.) The book is even filled with pictures from the variety of different conventions, plays, and countries in order to add further context to some of the key examples that are talked about.    Unfortunately, that overall thoroughness and passion for detail might end up doubling as the book's greatest weakness. This is not a book that I think most people could reasonably absorb in a short amount of time. Not only does the text cover a wide spectrum of times, cultures and fandoms, but it also presents that information in an extremely direct and scholarly way. Obviously given the overall intention and subject matter, such density is to be expected. However, this even bleeds into the sentence by sentence prose. Granted, I do not have the most astute attention span, but when certain sections can be filled with sentences that go on for 5 to 6 lines at a time, it's easy to get lost and not properly absorb the sheer amount of detail without a couple of rereads. None of this is helped by the fact that reading this as a cosplayer can sort of be a double-edged sword because while you can appreciate the information that is not commonly known to a lot of people, some sections can feel redundant in how they explain or set up events that are already obvious to those who have had those experiences. Looking back, I do think some sections could've been a bit more condensed or perhaps there could've been a more efficient way of easing readers into the sheer bulk of history that is about to be dropped on them.    However, the fact that I found a historical and cultural analysis of cosplay overwhelming is kind of an accomplishment in and of itself. Every section was filled with new information that only made me grow more and more respect for the medium. It was amazing seeing this almost logical progression of cosplay culture from the early days until present day and a culture that is still evolving as I am writing this review now. If anything, this book made me feel proud to be a cosplayer at a time when circumstances make certain forms of expression more difficult than they used to be. I have nothing but respect and appreciation for the amount of love, thought, and care that went into this book. You might have to set aside a good amount of time to go through it, but I definitely think this is a must read for those curious about cosplay or for those who are at all interested in where things got started or want to theorize on where things might go next.             Grade:      Overall : A-  + Extremely thorough and well researched, properly cited sources, possesses information that long time cosplayers and newcomers will appreciate, properly treats the artform with a great sense of weight and cultural importance − Some sections might feel redundant if you're already an experienced cosplayer, the sheer density of the material can be overwhelming, literary prose can drag on and be frontloaded with too much information too quickly            discuss this in the forum (7 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                       Review homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          2 comments       Akari Akase's Ending Theme Song for My Dress-Up Darling Anime Streamed 7 Million Times   Apr 16, 13:35 2 comments                 music    Music video debuted on January 9 ― The music video for Akari Akase's ""Koi no Yukue"" (Where Love Is), the ending theme song for the television anime of Shinichi Fukuda's My Dress-Up Darling (Sono Bisque Doll wa Koi wo Suru), has been streamed over seven million times since its release about three months ago.

Review:         Synopsis:        Through a culmination of years of personal research on cosplay, author Frenchy Lunning combines the fascinating viewpoints of cosplayers with observational, in-depth research on cosplay history, its practices, and a deep dive into critical theory involving the modes of fictional existence, in order to understand its global expansion. Who was the first cosplayer? How has cosplay's relationship with popular culture changed throughout the decades? What are the different ways the practice is executed and celebrated throughout the world? Cosplay: The Fictional Mode of Existence is an interesting examination of identity, performance, play, and otaku fandom in its relation to the growing art of cosplay.     Review:            Cosplay is one of the cornerstones of pop culture celebration. Whether it's science-fiction, fantasy, western, or eastern animation, it feels like you don't have to go far nowadays to come across people that wear their love for these mediums on their sleeves in a very literal way. Granted, in my passive research, a lot of media use cosplay as an extension of nerd fandom or otaku culture, but very rarely is it seen as a focus of cultural significance in and of itself. So as someone who has cosplayed for roughly the past decade with a fluctuating involvement in the larger cosplay community, do I think the text accomplishes that goal of proper focus and attention? Yes I do and with flying colors to boot.    The best way to describe Cosplay: The Fictional Mode of Existence would be that it is an amazing outline for a cosplay 101 class that could be taught in a college semester. Yes, I understand that to some people that might sound silly because there can't possibly be that much informed history and social analysis to actually teach a class over an extended period of time…right? I will admit I was one of those people. Of course I knew cosplay had to have started somewhere and that the way things are now probably wasn't the way they were 20 or 30 years ago. However, the sheer extent to which things have evolved that got us to this point shocked me to my very core with questions that I didn't even think could be asked. A speculative yet thorough look at the origins of cosplay and spaces that celebrate them? Oftentimes across different cultures and locations? Check. An extensive breakdown on the parasocial relationship that cosplayers have with their performances as well as the costumes they wear as a form of love and artistic expression? Check. How the evolution of cosplay as a social construct correlates to how collective people evolve as a culture? Check.    This is the most scholarly and straightforward approach to the idea of cosplay that I have ever seen. Granted, I didn't look very far for media like this, but I feel like this book covers so much ground and then some, you could walk away feeling like you just took an extensive course on how interesting this medium is from an angle where you don't even have to cosplay yourself. I feel like I could write half a dozen pages on some of the interesting passive and direct influences that the very concept of cosplaying has had on society and vice versa. I don't feel confident in proclaiming whether or not Lunning considers themselves a cosplayer or as a part of the larger cosplay community. But the sheer love and respect displayed right out the gate in this book feels like it also deserves equal recognition.    Although I will say I'm curious if the author had an extra year or two to include how recent difficult events have affected the cosplay community as well, as COVID-19 not only shut down a majority of the events that are discussed in this book, but in my personal experience, it has also given life to a much more prominent online culture born from people who shoot from home. That's the funny thing, things are always changing and cosplay has always sort of adapted and grown with the times dating back to before the term cosplay was even developed. There was one sentence towards the end of the book that really stood out to me “Cosplay, then, is an art form that may or may not last, but even if it does not, it will always-as it does now-evolve”.    Thankfully the book doesn't try to present itself as some kind of definitive Bible on how cosplay works. It also avoids purporting any definitions revolving around the culture or history above others as some accounts of events can be conflicting and different places might consider different angles. If anything, the book makes it apparent very early on that it is the culmination of various different thoughts, opinions, and definitions from dozens upon dozens of people who could give even a passive insight into this evolving culture. This didn't just include cosplayers old and young but also photographers, historians, scholars, performers, writers etc. all of these are very well cited and documented at the end of the book in a way that is easy to refer to with proper citations (although I will admit reading this in PDF form was a little difficult since I had to constantly scroll back-and-forth. Definitely get a physical copy.) The book is even filled with pictures from the variety of different conventions, plays, and countries in order to add further context to some of the key examples that are talked about.    Unfortunately, that overall thoroughness and passion for detail might end up doubling as the book's greatest weakness. This is not a book that I think most people could reasonably absorb in a short amount of time. Not only does the text cover a wide spectrum of times, cultures and fandoms, but it also presents that information in an extremely direct and scholarly way. Obviously given the overall intention and subject matter, such density is to be expected. However, this even bleeds into the sentence by sentence prose. Granted, I do not have the most astute attention span, but when certain sections can be filled with sentences that go on for 5 to 6 lines at a time, it's easy to get lost and not properly absorb the sheer amount of detail without a couple of rereads. None of this is helped by the fact that reading this as a cosplayer can sort of be a double-edged sword because while you can appreciate the information that is not commonly known to a lot of people, some sections can feel redundant in how they explain or set up events that are already obvious to those who have had those experiences. Looking back, I do think some sections could've been a bit more condensed or perhaps there could've been a more efficient way of easing readers into the sheer bulk of history that is about to be dropped on them.    However, the fact that I found a historical and cultural analysis of cosplay overwhelming is kind of an accomplishment in and of itself. Every section was filled with new information that only made me grow more and more respect for the medium. It was amazing seeing this almost logical progression of cosplay culture from the early days until present day and a culture that is still evolving as I am writing this review now. If anything, this book made me feel proud to be a cosplayer at a time when circumstances make certain forms of expression more difficult than they used to be. I have nothing but respect and appreciation for the amount of love, thought, and care that went into this book. You might have to set aside a good amount of time to go through it, but I definitely think this is a must read for those curious about cosplay or for those who are at all interested in where things got started or want to theorize on where things might go next.             Grade:      Overall : A-  + Extremely thorough and well researched, properly cited sources, possesses information that long time cosplayers and newcomers will appreciate, properly treats the artform with a great sense of weight and cultural importance − Some sections might feel redundant if you're already an experienced cosplayer, the sheer density of the material can be overwhelming, literary prose can drag on and be frontloaded with too much information too quickly            discuss this in the forum (7 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                       Review homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          2 comments       Akari Akase's Ending Theme Song for My Dress-Up Darling Anime Streamed 7 Million Times   Apr 16, 13:35 2 comments                 music    Music video debuted on January 9 ― The music video for Akari Akase's ""Koi no Yukue"" (Where Love Is), the ending theme song for the television anime of Shinichi Fukuda's My Dress-Up Darling (Sono Bisque Doll wa Koi wo Suru), has been streamed over seven million times since its release about three months ago.

Review:         Synopsis:        Through a culmination of years of personal research on cosplay, author Frenchy Lunning combines the fascinating viewpoints of cosplayers with observational, in-depth research on cosplay history, its practices, and a deep dive into critical theory involving the modes of fictional existence, in order to understand its global expansion. Who was the first cosplayer? How has cosplay's relationship with popular culture changed throughout the decades? What are the different ways the practice is executed and celebrated throughout the world? Cosplay: The Fictional Mode of Existence is an interesting examination of identity, performance, play, and otaku fandom in its relation to the growing art of cosplay.     Review:            Cosplay is one of the cornerstones of pop culture celebration. Whether it's science-fiction, fantasy, western, or eastern animation, it feels like you don't have to go far nowadays to come across people that wear their love for these mediums on their sleeves in a very literal way. Granted, in my passive research, a lot of media use cosplay as an extension of nerd fandom or otaku culture, but very rarely is it seen as a focus of cultural significance in and of itself. So as someone who has cosplayed for roughly the past decade with a fluctuating involvement in the larger cosplay community, do I think the text accomplishes that goal of proper focus and attention? Yes I do and with flying colors to boot.    The best way to describe Cosplay: The Fictional Mode of Existence would be that it is an amazing outline for a cosplay 101 class that could be taught in a college semester. Yes, I understand that to some people that might sound silly because there can't possibly be that much informed history and social analysis to actually teach a class over an extended period of time…right? I will admit I was one of those people. Of course I knew cosplay had to have started somewhere and that the way things are now probably wasn't the way they were 20 or 30 years ago. However, the sheer extent to which things have evolved that got us to this point shocked me to my very core with questions that I didn't even think could be asked. A speculative yet thorough look at the origins of cosplay and spaces that celebrate them? Oftentimes across different cultures and locations? Check. An extensive breakdown on the parasocial relationship that cosplayers have with their performances as well as the costumes they wear as a form of love and artistic expression? Check. How the evolution of cosplay as a social construct correlates to how collective people evolve as a culture? Check.    This is the most scholarly and straightforward approach to the idea of cosplay that I have ever seen. Granted, I didn't look very far for media like this, but I feel like this book covers so much ground and then some, you could walk away feeling like you just took an extensive course on how interesting this medium is from an angle where you don't even have to cosplay yourself. I feel like I could write half a dozen pages on some of the interesting passive and direct influences that the very concept of cosplaying has had on society and vice versa. I don't feel confident in proclaiming whether or not Lunning considers themselves a cosplayer or as a part of the larger cosplay community. But the sheer love and respect displayed right out the gate in this book feels like it also deserves equal recognition.    Although I will say I'm curious if the author had an extra year or two to include how recent difficult events have affected the cosplay community as well, as COVID-19 not only shut down a majority of the events that are discussed in this book, but in my personal experience, it has also given life to a much more prominent online culture born from people who shoot from home. That's the funny thing, things are always changing and cosplay has always sort of adapted and grown with the times dating back to before the term cosplay was even developed. There was one sentence towards the end of the book that really stood out to me “Cosplay, then, is an art form that may or may not last, but even if it does not, it will always-as it does now-evolve”.    Thankfully the book doesn't try to present itself as some kind of definitive Bible on how cosplay works. It also avoids purporting any definitions revolving around the culture or history above others as some accounts of events can be conflicting and different places might consider different angles. If anything, the book makes it apparent very early on that it is the culmination of various different thoughts, opinions, and definitions from dozens upon dozens of people who could give even a passive insight into this evolving culture. This didn't just include cosplayers old and young but also photographers, historians, scholars, performers, writers etc. all of these are very well cited and documented at the end of the book in a way that is easy to refer to with proper citations (although I will admit reading this in PDF form was a little difficult since I had to constantly scroll back-and-forth. Definitely get a physical copy.) The book is even filled with pictures from the variety of different conventions, plays, and countries in order to add further context to some of the key examples that are talked about.    Unfortunately, that overall thoroughness and passion for detail might end up doubling as the book's greatest weakness. This is not a book that I think most people could reasonably absorb in a short amount of time. Not only does the text cover a wide spectrum of times, cultures and fandoms, but it also presents that information in an extremely direct and scholarly way. Obviously given the overall intention and subject matter, such density is to be expected. However, this even bleeds into the sentence by sentence prose. Granted, I do not have the most astute attention span, but when certain sections can be filled with sentences that go on for 5 to 6 lines at a time, it's easy to get lost and not properly absorb the sheer amount of detail without a couple of rereads. None of this is helped by the fact that reading this as a cosplayer can sort of be a double-edged sword because while you can appreciate the information that is not commonly known to a lot of people, some sections can feel redundant in how they explain or set up events that are already obvious to those who have had those experiences. Looking back, I do think some sections could've been a bit more condensed or perhaps there could've been a more efficient way of easing readers into the sheer bulk of history that is about to be dropped on them.    However, the fact that I found a historical and cultural analysis of cosplay overwhelming is kind of an accomplishment in and of itself. Every section was filled with new information that only made me grow more and more respect for the medium. It was amazing seeing this almost logical progression of cosplay culture from the early days until present day and a culture that is still evolving as I am writing this review now. If anything, this book made me feel proud to be a cosplayer at a time when circumstances make certain forms of expression more difficult than they used to be. I have nothing but respect and appreciation for the amount of love, thought, and care that went into this book. You might have to set aside a good amount of time to go through it, but I definitely think this is a must read for those curious about cosplay or for those who are at all interested in where things got started or want to theorize on where things might go next.             Grade:      Overall : A-  + Extremely thorough and well researched, properly cited sources, possesses information that long time cosplayers and newcomers will appreciate, properly treats the artform with a great sense of weight and cultural importance − Some sections might feel redundant if you're already an experienced cosplayer, the sheer density of the material can be overwhelming, literary prose can drag on and be frontloaded with too much information too quickly            discuss this in the forum (7 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                       Review homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          2 comments       Akari Akase's Ending Theme Song for My Dress-Up Darling Anime Streamed 7 Million Times   Apr 16, 13:35 2 comments                 music    Music video debuted on January 9 ― The music video for Akari Akase's ""Koi no Yukue"" (Where Love Is), the ending theme song for the television anime of Shinichi Fukuda's My Dress-Up Darling (Sono Bisque Doll wa Koi wo Suru), has been streamed over seven million times since its release about three months ago.
