But what exactly are the decisions that got us here? ― Unlike animation, video games are in large part a disposable medium.

GN 1                      Synopsis:             Not only is 24-year-old Koduka Chiyo wallowing in self-pity after quitting her job, she's also three months behind on her rent. Her 19-year-old landlady proposes an unusual solution: perform favors for her in exchange for the owed money – with the first being that the two sleep together. An arrangement is made where the landlord moves in with Chiyo to make the transfer of these “favors” easier but what is the true reason behind this young landlord's arrangement?      Review:         Synopsis:        Not only is 24-year-old Koduka Chiyo wallowing in self-pity after quitting her job, she's also three months behind on her rent. Her 19-year-old landlady proposes an unusual solution: perform favors for her in exchange for the owed money – with the first being that the two sleep together. An arrangement is made where the landlord moves in with Chiyo to make the transfer of these “favors” easier but what is the true reason behind this young landlord's arrangement?     Review:            It's hard not to feel cautious about delving into a manga with such a premise. When a story about a blossoming romance between two characters starts with one of them very directly taking advantage of the other, it has to do a lot of legwork to dig itself out of that hole. Handle that poorly and readers may be left wondering why they should root for these characters by the second chapter. While I don't think that all of the legwork was achieved in this first volume, I was nevertheless surprised at just how subtle yet involved the series is in raising some rather realistic questions about non-heteronormative sexual orientations and how society views them.    A lot of this doesn't come from our main character Chiyo (though there is some bicuriosity starting to bloom there) but rather from the landlord that is placing her in this situation. Despite being younger, there is a clear power imbalance between the two characters and the manga very much treads the line of making sure that the situation doesn't come across as too malicious. A lot of the “favors” being requested range from the mundane to the surprisingly wholesome, and you do get a strong feeling that the landlord isn't going into this arrangement with sex as the primary goal. The manga goes out of its way to highlight that Chiyo's landlord is simply feeling very lonely and a lot of this is borne out of her desperation to fill the void. It is honestly rather refreshing to have a female character that is so blunt about only being into women, but what I found just as fascinating was the occasional snide comment about other sexualities and how people view her.    The manga does not spell out everything for the reader which I appreciate. You get the sense that this was written for an audience that is willing to look past the uncomfortable premise to see where the story actually goes, and what you'll discover beneath that facade is an account of the desperate lengths that people will go to find a connection in a society where their attractions are frowned upon, as well as what it's like to live through a world of microaggressions from people that probably didn't mean to be hurtful but still end up accomplishing just that. That said, I personally think that there are certain lines that should never be crossed regardless of circumstance, and this landlord crossed at least two of them throughout this first volume alone. But surprisingly, I didn't walk away thinking that she was a terrible person, but rather a lonely and misguided soul, which is an accomplishment given my trepidations about the material. If anything, I am interested in seeing where this story goes and if it can pull off the difficult task of having me fully buy into this developing relationship.    However, while I appreciate how the landlord's character is written as she is far and away the most interesting thing about this manga, I can't say the same about our actual named protagonist. She is very much the typical wide-eyed screw-up manga lead that is comedically incapable of taking care of herself despite being the oldest of the two. She definitely means well, and she is willing to step outside her comfort zone for the sake of making up for her own shortcomings, which is endearing. However, the jokes about her incompetence could get a little tiring towards the end. There's nothing necessarily wrong with her character; it's just that this first volume was a little lopsided in its characterization – the bulk of that very subtle character-building went to the landlord whereas Chiyo is clearly meant to counterbalance that as a source of levity. Still, I think that levity could have had more variety towards the end. There are hints towards the end that imply something deeper is beginning to develop – and I hope that goes somewhere – but aside from that, there's just not a lot to Chiyo in this first volume.    Repressed sexuality and sexual desire, non-heterosexual curiosity, societal commentary on different types of sexual orientation – I must admit, none of these are things I was expecting this manga to really touch upon when I originally picked it up to review. While it's impossible to resolve such heavy issues within a single 188-page volume, the fact that there is a clear setup for the story to explore them more deeply made me look at the volume in a more favorable light than I initially had. It is uncomfortable and as I alluded to before, ethical lines like consent or subtle manipulation are muddied more than I think the story really needed to. Unlike the larger societal issues, these more interpersonal dynamics are not treated with the seriousness they deserve, being accompanied by an overall lighter, almost comedic tone. Sometimes it's a nice blend, but mostly they feel incongruous with the at times cartoonish sense of humor the manga has.    This could also be a stylistic issue as the manga will occasionally use simplified character expressions for the sake of brevity. Things like Chiyo's rounded, airheaded expressions are nice and it's not like the art tries too hard to be cute or funny. However, similar to Chiyo's characterization, these don't have a lot of variety to them. That's not true for the whole manga as there are plenty of other instances where the paneling and character framing are being used in subtle ways to elevate the heavier moments. But whenever the style shifts away from that, it can sometimes get jarring and even disappointing to see engaging artwork being undercut by something more typical and repetitive. I hope the balance is improved in future columes.    All in all I Can't Believe I Slept With You! left me pleasantly surprised. It could be because my expectations weren't exactly positive going in, but I do think there are some genuine attempts at leveraging that initial discomfort to talk about some pretty relevant stuff. The mileage on whether or not those conversation starters are worth the shiftier implications of some of our characters' actions will vary from person to person. For me personally though, I think it's a step in the right direction and while I'm not sure if the story will fully redeem itself from the place where it starts, there is enough competency and thoughtfulness on display here that at the very least makes me believe there's a chance that might happen. Guess the manga is forcing me to check out the other volumes to see if my assumptions were right.             Grade:      Overall : B Story : B Art : B  + A morally questionable lead that's able to generate a surprising amount of sympathy, subtle yet relevant social commentary on sexuality and loneliness − Not much to Chiyo's character for most of the book, humor lacks variety and can clash with more serious moments            discuss this in the forum (2 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                  				Add this manga to 				               Production Info:        Story & Art: Miyako Miyahara   Full encyclopedia details aboutI Can't Believe I Slept With You!

Her 19-year-old landlady proposes an unusual solution: perform favors for her in exchange for the owed money – with the first being that the two sleep together.

Review:         Synopsis:        Not only is 24-year-old Koduka Chiyo wallowing in self-pity after quitting her job, she's also three months behind on her rent. Her 19-year-old landlady proposes an unusual solution: perform favors for her in exchange for the owed money – with the first being that the two sleep together. An arrangement is made where the landlord moves in with Chiyo to make the transfer of these “favors” easier but what is the true reason behind this young landlord's arrangement?     Review:            It's hard not to feel cautious about delving into a manga with such a premise. When a story about a blossoming romance between two characters starts with one of them very directly taking advantage of the other, it has to do a lot of legwork to dig itself out of that hole. Handle that poorly and readers may be left wondering why they should root for these characters by the second chapter. While I don't think that all of the legwork was achieved in this first volume, I was nevertheless surprised at just how subtle yet involved the series is in raising some rather realistic questions about non-heteronormative sexual orientations and how society views them.    A lot of this doesn't come from our main character Chiyo (though there is some bicuriosity starting to bloom there) but rather from the landlord that is placing her in this situation. Despite being younger, there is a clear power imbalance between the two characters and the manga very much treads the line of making sure that the situation doesn't come across as too malicious. A lot of the “favors” being requested range from the mundane to the surprisingly wholesome, and you do get a strong feeling that the landlord isn't going into this arrangement with sex as the primary goal. The manga goes out of its way to highlight that Chiyo's landlord is simply feeling very lonely and a lot of this is borne out of her desperation to fill the void. It is honestly rather refreshing to have a female character that is so blunt about only being into women, but what I found just as fascinating was the occasional snide comment about other sexualities and how people view her.    The manga does not spell out everything for the reader which I appreciate. You get the sense that this was written for an audience that is willing to look past the uncomfortable premise to see where the story actually goes, and what you'll discover beneath that facade is an account of the desperate lengths that people will go to find a connection in a society where their attractions are frowned upon, as well as what it's like to live through a world of microaggressions from people that probably didn't mean to be hurtful but still end up accomplishing just that. That said, I personally think that there are certain lines that should never be crossed regardless of circumstance, and this landlord crossed at least two of them throughout this first volume alone. But surprisingly, I didn't walk away thinking that she was a terrible person, but rather a lonely and misguided soul, which is an accomplishment given my trepidations about the material. If anything, I am interested in seeing where this story goes and if it can pull off the difficult task of having me fully buy into this developing relationship.    However, while I appreciate how the landlord's character is written as she is far and away the most interesting thing about this manga, I can't say the same about our actual named protagonist. She is very much the typical wide-eyed screw-up manga lead that is comedically incapable of taking care of herself despite being the oldest of the two. She definitely means well, and she is willing to step outside her comfort zone for the sake of making up for her own shortcomings, which is endearing. However, the jokes about her incompetence could get a little tiring towards the end. There's nothing necessarily wrong with her character; it's just that this first volume was a little lopsided in its characterization – the bulk of that very subtle character-building went to the landlord whereas Chiyo is clearly meant to counterbalance that as a source of levity. Still, I think that levity could have had more variety towards the end. There are hints towards the end that imply something deeper is beginning to develop – and I hope that goes somewhere – but aside from that, there's just not a lot to Chiyo in this first volume.    Repressed sexuality and sexual desire, non-heterosexual curiosity, societal commentary on different types of sexual orientation – I must admit, none of these are things I was expecting this manga to really touch upon when I originally picked it up to review. While it's impossible to resolve such heavy issues within a single 188-page volume, the fact that there is a clear setup for the story to explore them more deeply made me look at the volume in a more favorable light than I initially had. It is uncomfortable and as I alluded to before, ethical lines like consent or subtle manipulation are muddied more than I think the story really needed to.

The mileage on whether or not those conversation starters are worth the shiftier implications of some of our characters' actions will vary from person to person.

GN 1                      Synopsis:             Not only is 24-year-old Koduka Chiyo wallowing in self-pity after quitting her job, she's also three months behind on her rent. Her 19-year-old landlady proposes an unusual solution: perform favors for her in exchange for the owed money – with the first being that the two sleep together. An arrangement is made where the landlord moves in with Chiyo to make the transfer of these “favors” easier but what is the true reason behind this young landlord's arrangement?      Review:         Synopsis:        Not only is 24-year-old Koduka Chiyo wallowing in self-pity after quitting her job, she's also three months behind on her rent. Her 19-year-old landlady proposes an unusual solution: perform favors for her in exchange for the owed money – with the first being that the two sleep together. An arrangement is made where the landlord moves in with Chiyo to make the transfer of these “favors” easier but what is the true reason behind this young landlord's arrangement?     Review:            It's hard not to feel cautious about delving into a manga with such a premise. When a story about a blossoming romance between two characters starts with one of them very directly taking advantage of the other, it has to do a lot of legwork to dig itself out of that hole. Handle that poorly and readers may be left wondering why they should root for these characters by the second chapter. While I don't think that all of the legwork was achieved in this first volume, I was nevertheless surprised at just how subtle yet involved the series is in raising some rather realistic questions about non-heteronormative sexual orientations and how society views them.    A lot of this doesn't come from our main character Chiyo (though there is some bicuriosity starting to bloom there) but rather from the landlord that is placing her in this situation. Despite being younger, there is a clear power imbalance between the two characters and the manga very much treads the line of making sure that the situation doesn't come across as too malicious. A lot of the “favors” being requested range from the mundane to the surprisingly wholesome, and you do get a strong feeling that the landlord isn't going into this arrangement with sex as the primary goal. The manga goes out of its way to highlight that Chiyo's landlord is simply feeling very lonely and a lot of this is borne out of her desperation to fill the void. It is honestly rather refreshing to have a female character that is so blunt about only being into women, but what I found just as fascinating was the occasional snide comment about other sexualities and how people view her.    The manga does not spell out everything for the reader which I appreciate. You get the sense that this was written for an audience that is willing to look past the uncomfortable premise to see where the story actually goes, and what you'll discover beneath that facade is an account of the desperate lengths that people will go to find a connection in a society where their attractions are frowned upon, as well as what it's like to live through a world of microaggressions from people that probably didn't mean to be hurtful but still end up accomplishing just that. That said, I personally think that there are certain lines that should never be crossed regardless of circumstance, and this landlord crossed at least two of them throughout this first volume alone. But surprisingly, I didn't walk away thinking that she was a terrible person, but rather a lonely and misguided soul, which is an accomplishment given my trepidations about the material. If anything, I am interested in seeing where this story goes and if it can pull off the difficult task of having me fully buy into this developing relationship.    However, while I appreciate how the landlord's character is written as she is far and away the most interesting thing about this manga, I can't say the same about our actual named protagonist. She is very much the typical wide-eyed screw-up manga lead that is comedically incapable of taking care of herself despite being the oldest of the two. She definitely means well, and she is willing to step outside her comfort zone for the sake of making up for her own shortcomings, which is endearing. However, the jokes about her incompetence could get a little tiring towards the end. There's nothing necessarily wrong with her character; it's just that this first volume was a little lopsided in its characterization – the bulk of that very subtle character-building went to the landlord whereas Chiyo is clearly meant to counterbalance that as a source of levity. Still, I think that levity could have had more variety towards the end. There are hints towards the end that imply something deeper is beginning to develop – and I hope that goes somewhere – but aside from that, there's just not a lot to Chiyo in this first volume.    Repressed sexuality and sexual desire, non-heterosexual curiosity, societal commentary on different types of sexual orientation – I must admit, none of these are things I was expecting this manga to really touch upon when I originally picked it up to review. While it's impossible to resolve such heavy issues within a single 188-page volume, the fact that there is a clear setup for the story to explore them more deeply made me look at the volume in a more favorable light than I initially had. It is uncomfortable and as I alluded to before, ethical lines like consent or subtle manipulation are muddied more than I think the story really needed to. Unlike the larger societal issues, these more interpersonal dynamics are not treated with the seriousness they deserve, being accompanied by an overall lighter, almost comedic tone. Sometimes it's a nice blend, but mostly they feel incongruous with the at times cartoonish sense of humor the manga has.    This could also be a stylistic issue as the manga will occasionally use simplified character expressions for the sake of brevity. Things like Chiyo's rounded, airheaded expressions are nice and it's not like the art tries too hard to be cute or funny. However, similar to Chiyo's characterization, these don't have a lot of variety to them. That's not true for the whole manga as there are plenty of other instances where the paneling and character framing are being used in subtle ways to elevate the heavier moments. But whenever the style shifts away from that, it can sometimes get jarring and even disappointing to see engaging artwork being undercut by something more typical and repetitive. I hope the balance is improved in future columes.    All in all I Can't Believe I Slept With You! left me pleasantly surprised.

GN 1                      Synopsis:             Not only is 24-year-old Koduka Chiyo wallowing in self-pity after quitting her job, she's also three months behind on her rent. Her 19-year-old landlady proposes an unusual solution: perform favors for her in exchange for the owed money – with the first being that the two sleep together. An arrangement is made where the landlord moves in with Chiyo to make the transfer of these “favors” easier but what is the true reason behind this young landlord's arrangement?      Review:         Synopsis:        Not only is 24-year-old Koduka Chiyo wallowing in self-pity after quitting her job, she's also three months behind on her rent. Her 19-year-old landlady proposes an unusual solution: perform favors for her in exchange for the owed money – with the first being that the two sleep together. An arrangement is made where the landlord moves in with Chiyo to make the transfer of these “favors” easier but what is the true reason behind this young landlord's arrangement?     Review:            It's hard not to feel cautious about delving into a manga with such a premise. When a story about a blossoming romance between two characters starts with one of them very directly taking advantage of the other, it has to do a lot of legwork to dig itself out of that hole. Handle that poorly and readers may be left wondering why they should root for these characters by the second chapter. While I don't think that all of the legwork was achieved in this first volume, I was nevertheless surprised at just how subtle yet involved the series is in raising some rather realistic questions about non-heteronormative sexual orientations and how society views them.    A lot of this doesn't come from our main character Chiyo (though there is some bicuriosity starting to bloom there) but rather from the landlord that is placing her in this situation. Despite being younger, there is a clear power imbalance between the two characters and the manga very much treads the line of making sure that the situation doesn't come across as too malicious. A lot of the “favors” being requested range from the mundane to the surprisingly wholesome, and you do get a strong feeling that the landlord isn't going into this arrangement with sex as the primary goal. The manga goes out of its way to highlight that Chiyo's landlord is simply feeling very lonely and a lot of this is borne out of her desperation to fill the void. It is honestly rather refreshing to have a female character that is so blunt about only being into women, but what I found just as fascinating was the occasional snide comment about other sexualities and how people view her.    The manga does not spell out everything for the reader which I appreciate. You get the sense that this was written for an audience that is willing to look past the uncomfortable premise to see where the story actually goes, and what you'll discover beneath that facade is an account of the desperate lengths that people will go to find a connection in a society where their attractions are frowned upon, as well as what it's like to live through a world of microaggressions from people that probably didn't mean to be hurtful but still end up accomplishing just that. That said, I personally think that there are certain lines that should never be crossed regardless of circumstance, and this landlord crossed at least two of them throughout this first volume alone. But surprisingly, I didn't walk away thinking that she was a terrible person, but rather a lonely and misguided soul, which is an accomplishment given my trepidations about the material. If anything, I am interested in seeing where this story goes and if it can pull off the difficult task of having me fully buy into this developing relationship.    However, while I appreciate how the landlord's character is written as she is far and away the most interesting thing about this manga, I can't say the same about our actual named protagonist. She is very much the typical wide-eyed screw-up manga lead that is comedically incapable of taking care of herself despite being the oldest of the two. She definitely means well, and she is willing to step outside her comfort zone for the sake of making up for her own shortcomings, which is endearing. However, the jokes about her incompetence could get a little tiring towards the end. There's nothing necessarily wrong with her character; it's just that this first volume was a little lopsided in its characterization – the bulk of that very subtle character-building went to the landlord whereas Chiyo is clearly meant to counterbalance that as a source of levity. Still, I think that levity could have had more variety towards the end. There are hints towards the end that imply something deeper is beginning to develop – and I hope that goes somewhere – but aside from that, there's just not a lot to Chiyo in this first volume.    Repressed sexuality and sexual desire, non-heterosexual curiosity, societal commentary on different types of sexual orientation – I must admit, none of these are things I was expecting this manga to really touch upon when I originally picked it up to review. While it's impossible to resolve such heavy issues within a single 188-page volume, the fact that there is a clear setup for the story to explore them more deeply made me look at the volume in a more favorable light than I initially had. It is uncomfortable and as I alluded to before, ethical lines like consent or subtle manipulation are muddied more than I think the story really needed to. Unlike the larger societal issues, these more interpersonal dynamics are not treated with the seriousness they deserve, being accompanied by an overall lighter, almost comedic tone. Sometimes it's a nice blend, but mostly they feel incongruous with the at times cartoonish sense of humor the manga has.    This could also be a stylistic issue as the manga will occasionally use simplified character expressions for the sake of brevity. Things like Chiyo's rounded, airheaded expressions are nice and it's not like the art tries too hard to be cute or funny. However, similar to Chiyo's characterization, these don't have a lot of variety to them. That's not true for the whole manga as there are plenty of other instances where the paneling and character framing are being used in subtle ways to elevate the heavier moments. But whenever the style shifts away from that, it can sometimes get jarring and even disappointing to see engaging artwork being undercut by something more typical and repetitive. I hope the balance is improved in future columes.    All in all I Can't Believe I Slept With You! left me pleasantly surprised. It could be because my expectations weren't exactly positive going in, but I do think there are some genuine attempts at leveraging that initial discomfort to talk about some pretty relevant stuff. The mileage on whether or not those conversation starters are worth the shiftier implications of some of our characters' actions will vary from person to person. For me personally though, I think it's a step in the right direction and while I'm not sure if the story will fully redeem itself from the place where it starts, there is enough competency and thoughtfulness on display here that at the very least makes me believe there's a chance that might happen. Guess the manga is forcing me to check out the other volumes to see if my assumptions were right.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These Gekitotsu   Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 25 of Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision (movies) ?                     Community score: 4.5              What is this?   Following the resolution of their respective civil wars, the conflict between the Free Planets Alliance and the Galactic Empire has resumed in earnest. Julian Mintz, adopted son of Yang Wen-Li, enlists in the Alliance military and, while being trained during a routine patrol, finds himself caught up in a conflict with a passing Empire fleet. Under the command of Dusty Attenborough, the Alliance soldiers struggle to hold their ground until Yang can send reinforcements, as Julian and his fellow recruits struggle to adapt to the realities of being thrust into real combat for the first time.    Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These Gekitotsu is the third season of the new anime of Yoshiki Tanaka's epic science fiction novel and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?    Christopher Farris  Rating:                Three years later we're back with another set of new Legend of the Galactic Heroes movies, with Crunchyroll once again chopping them up and releasing them as weekly episodes. Granted, it's more likely the other way around, as just with the pacing of the previous 'season', this first episode pretty clearly functions as an isolated half-hour that is connected with a greater whole as any piece of serialized storytelling. And it means there's enough focus in this premiere episode to bring us back into the story of all these Galactic Heroes, with just enough passing remarks on the status quo to remind us of how we got here (Though given the storied history-book density of LOGH, it might not hurt to at least go back and peruse some synopses for the preceding plot. It has been three actual years after all).    Helping to ease us into all that is the fact that this one has a relatively narrower, smaller-scale focus than LOGH adventures previously tended to end up with. The real-world-style march of time in this galaxy sees Yang's young ward Julian formally enlist in the Alliance military, and it's through his eyes that we get back to engaging with the focal conflict of this series. It comes off as a brisk, concentrated re-introduction to things, where instead of focusing on Reinhard or his consolidations in the Empire, we get a bunch of flashbacks to Julian's training and details of what he's been put through up until this first battle he finds himself in. They do also throw in some informational setup for future long-term developments of this arc (there's a reason a class question prompts a whole spiel from Julian about warp technology), but otherwise this is firmly a story about seeing the war through the fresh eyes of a rookie and their feelings of contrast with the various flavors of veteran we know exist in the LOGH ranks.    That's all well and good in terms of directly defining Julian as we follow him in this new stage of his life and the show's plot, but it does also have the side effect of the series feeling given to over-explaining its tones at every turn. There's basically no time to see Julian reflect on his situation on his own; each point has to be punctuated by a conversation with someone else in this establishment. For instance, the episode sends Dusty down to just have this detailed, emotional conversation with Julian in-between fighting where the kid directly exposits all his thoughts and feelings about the battle he was just in. The episode ends with Julian's rookie-in-arms Peter rambling about the complexities of experience and survivor's guilt in relation to the deaths of their more experienced comrades, when the following simple, solemn shot of Julian looking up at his instructor's name on the listing of the deceased communicates that same impact much more effectively in a moment. If you've been keeping up with this LOGH adaptation this long, these kinds of overt sensibilities aren't really surprising, but it's still mildly annoying to see them still in place, even as the series shows inklings of knowing how to do more with less.    Thankfully, a lot of the appreciable little touches of LOGH persist here. I love the bit where Dusty relates a funny anecdote to the bridge crew and they all laugh, despite being in the middle of a heated battle. Similarly, the idea that ostensibly-inexperienced fighter-pilot movements would cause Empire officers to second-guess their approaches because they're used to going up against Yang's galaxy-brain strategies is a fun acknowledgement of how far reputation for the main characters has come at this point in the story. And it's all presented with the now-expected glossy finish of this modern animated adaptation, making the most of the opportunity to open with an episode that features a bunch of zippy space-ship dogfights. Some of its less-welcome adaptational flourishes persist, but this is still recognizably Legend of the Galactic Heroes, and it's still nice to have more of it.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                One of the great things about space operas is the size of their stories. Here we have the start of a new season, with one of our warring protagonists suffering from the tragic death of a close friend and the other having just crushed a rebellion full of people he respected. Yet this episode touches on none of that—our main characters barely even make an appearance. Rather, it is a largely self-contained “boots on the ground” story from the front lines centering on the first deployment of Yang Wen-li's adoptive son, Julian.    Julain is in a unique position. While he is intelligent and brave, he stands in the shadow of the Alliance's greatest hero. Instead of being jealous of this fact, he is humbled and wants to be of use to his adopted father. But how do you support a man like that? By becoming a fighter pilot, Julain has decided to be Yang's eyes on the front. His personal struggle over the episode is one of ego, learning to accept the victories and the losses without letting them go to his head or force him into despair.    At the same time, the whole episode is a graphic example of the futility of war. What we watch is a meaningless battle: two patrolling fleets that run into each other and start fighting. Then both sides call in reinforcements and it just snowballs. It's a pointless meatgrinder of a battle. Nothing will change based on who wins or loses. By the time Yang shows up with a fleet so massive that retreat is the only option for the Empire, pretty much every fighter pilot besides Julian is dead—and the one other newbie who made it through is on the edge of a mental break.    It's great stuff full of drama that explores the nature of the human soul—or to put it another way, it's an average episode of The Legend of Galactic Heroes.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review                Odd Taxi: In the Woods   Apr 17, 00:00                 anime    By cleverly reframing its narrative around a series of interviews with the supporting cast, Odd Taxi: In the Woods succeeds where most recap films fail: it's an artistically cohesive film in its own right. ― Odd Taxi was 2021's sleeper anime hit, telling an intricate, original mystery that kept viewers guessing every week.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These Gekitotsu   Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 25 of Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision (movies) ?                     Community score: 4.5              What is this?   Following the resolution of their respective civil wars, the conflict between the Free Planets Alliance and the Galactic Empire has resumed in earnest. Julian Mintz, adopted son of Yang Wen-Li, enlists in the Alliance military and, while being trained during a routine patrol, finds himself caught up in a conflict with a passing Empire fleet. Under the command of Dusty Attenborough, the Alliance soldiers struggle to hold their ground until Yang can send reinforcements, as Julian and his fellow recruits struggle to adapt to the realities of being thrust into real combat for the first time.    Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These Gekitotsu is the third season of the new anime of Yoshiki Tanaka's epic science fiction novel and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?    Christopher Farris  Rating:                Three years later we're back with another set of new Legend of the Galactic Heroes movies, with Crunchyroll once again chopping them up and releasing them as weekly episodes. Granted, it's more likely the other way around, as just with the pacing of the previous 'season', this first episode pretty clearly functions as an isolated half-hour that is connected with a greater whole as any piece of serialized storytelling. And it means there's enough focus in this premiere episode to bring us back into the story of all these Galactic Heroes, with just enough passing remarks on the status quo to remind us of how we got here (Though given the storied history-book density of LOGH, it might not hurt to at least go back and peruse some synopses for the preceding plot. It has been three actual years after all).    Helping to ease us into all that is the fact that this one has a relatively narrower, smaller-scale focus than LOGH adventures previously tended to end up with. The real-world-style march of time in this galaxy sees Yang's young ward Julian formally enlist in the Alliance military, and it's through his eyes that we get back to engaging with the focal conflict of this series. It comes off as a brisk, concentrated re-introduction to things, where instead of focusing on Reinhard or his consolidations in the Empire, we get a bunch of flashbacks to Julian's training and details of what he's been put through up until this first battle he finds himself in. They do also throw in some informational setup for future long-term developments of this arc (there's a reason a class question prompts a whole spiel from Julian about warp technology), but otherwise this is firmly a story about seeing the war through the fresh eyes of a rookie and their feelings of contrast with the various flavors of veteran we know exist in the LOGH ranks.    That's all well and good in terms of directly defining Julian as we follow him in this new stage of his life and the show's plot, but it does also have the side effect of the series feeling given to over-explaining its tones at every turn. There's basically no time to see Julian reflect on his situation on his own; each point has to be punctuated by a conversation with someone else in this establishment. For instance, the episode sends Dusty down to just have this detailed, emotional conversation with Julian in-between fighting where the kid directly exposits all his thoughts and feelings about the battle he was just in. The episode ends with Julian's rookie-in-arms Peter rambling about the complexities of experience and survivor's guilt in relation to the deaths of their more experienced comrades, when the following simple, solemn shot of Julian looking up at his instructor's name on the listing of the deceased communicates that same impact much more effectively in a moment. If you've been keeping up with this LOGH adaptation this long, these kinds of overt sensibilities aren't really surprising, but it's still mildly annoying to see them still in place, even as the series shows inklings of knowing how to do more with less.    Thankfully, a lot of the appreciable little touches of LOGH persist here. I love the bit where Dusty relates a funny anecdote to the bridge crew and they all laugh, despite being in the middle of a heated battle. Similarly, the idea that ostensibly-inexperienced fighter-pilot movements would cause Empire officers to second-guess their approaches because they're used to going up against Yang's galaxy-brain strategies is a fun acknowledgement of how far reputation for the main characters has come at this point in the story. And it's all presented with the now-expected glossy finish of this modern animated adaptation, making the most of the opportunity to open with an episode that features a bunch of zippy space-ship dogfights. Some of its less-welcome adaptational flourishes persist, but this is still recognizably Legend of the Galactic Heroes, and it's still nice to have more of it.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                One of the great things about space operas is the size of their stories. Here we have the start of a new season, with one of our warring protagonists suffering from the tragic death of a close friend and the other having just crushed a rebellion full of people he respected. Yet this episode touches on none of that—our main characters barely even make an appearance. Rather, it is a largely self-contained “boots on the ground” story from the front lines centering on the first deployment of Yang Wen-li's adoptive son, Julian.    Julain is in a unique position. While he is intelligent and brave, he stands in the shadow of the Alliance's greatest hero. Instead of being jealous of this fact, he is humbled and wants to be of use to his adopted father. But how do you support a man like that? By becoming a fighter pilot, Julain has decided to be Yang's eyes on the front. His personal struggle over the episode is one of ego, learning to accept the victories and the losses without letting them go to his head or force him into despair.    At the same time, the whole episode is a graphic example of the futility of war. What we watch is a meaningless battle: two patrolling fleets that run into each other and start fighting. Then both sides call in reinforcements and it just snowballs. It's a pointless meatgrinder of a battle. Nothing will change based on who wins or loses. By the time Yang shows up with a fleet so massive that retreat is the only option for the Empire, pretty much every fighter pilot besides Julian is dead—and the one other newbie who made it through is on the edge of a mental break.    It's great stuff full of drama that explores the nature of the human soul—or to put it another way, it's an average episode of The Legend of Galactic Heroes.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review                Odd Taxi: In the Woods   Apr 17, 00:00                 anime    By cleverly reframing its narrative around a series of interviews with the supporting cast, Odd Taxi: In the Woods succeeds where most recap films fail: it's an artistically cohesive film in its own right. ― Odd Taxi was 2021's sleeper anime hit, telling an intricate, original mystery that kept viewers guessing every week.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These Gekitotsu   Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 25 of Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision (movies) ?                     Community score: 4.5              What is this?   Following the resolution of their respective civil wars, the conflict between the Free Planets Alliance and the Galactic Empire has resumed in earnest. Julian Mintz, adopted son of Yang Wen-Li, enlists in the Alliance military and, while being trained during a routine patrol, finds himself caught up in a conflict with a passing Empire fleet. Under the command of Dusty Attenborough, the Alliance soldiers struggle to hold their ground until Yang can send reinforcements, as Julian and his fellow recruits struggle to adapt to the realities of being thrust into real combat for the first time.    Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These Gekitotsu is the third season of the new anime of Yoshiki Tanaka's epic science fiction novel and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?    Christopher Farris  Rating:                Three years later we're back with another set of new Legend of the Galactic Heroes movies, with Crunchyroll once again chopping them up and releasing them as weekly episodes. Granted, it's more likely the other way around, as just with the pacing of the previous 'season', this first episode pretty clearly functions as an isolated half-hour that is connected with a greater whole as any piece of serialized storytelling. And it means there's enough focus in this premiere episode to bring us back into the story of all these Galactic Heroes, with just enough passing remarks on the status quo to remind us of how we got here (Though given the storied history-book density of LOGH, it might not hurt to at least go back and peruse some synopses for the preceding plot. It has been three actual years after all).    Helping to ease us into all that is the fact that this one has a relatively narrower, smaller-scale focus than LOGH adventures previously tended to end up with. The real-world-style march of time in this galaxy sees Yang's young ward Julian formally enlist in the Alliance military, and it's through his eyes that we get back to engaging with the focal conflict of this series. It comes off as a brisk, concentrated re-introduction to things, where instead of focusing on Reinhard or his consolidations in the Empire, we get a bunch of flashbacks to Julian's training and details of what he's been put through up until this first battle he finds himself in. They do also throw in some informational setup for future long-term developments of this arc (there's a reason a class question prompts a whole spiel from Julian about warp technology), but otherwise this is firmly a story about seeing the war through the fresh eyes of a rookie and their feelings of contrast with the various flavors of veteran we know exist in the LOGH ranks.    That's all well and good in terms of directly defining Julian as we follow him in this new stage of his life and the show's plot, but it does also have the side effect of the series feeling given to over-explaining its tones at every turn. There's basically no time to see Julian reflect on his situation on his own; each point has to be punctuated by a conversation with someone else in this establishment. For instance, the episode sends Dusty down to just have this detailed, emotional conversation with Julian in-between fighting where the kid directly exposits all his thoughts and feelings about the battle he was just in. The episode ends with Julian's rookie-in-arms Peter rambling about the complexities of experience and survivor's guilt in relation to the deaths of their more experienced comrades, when the following simple, solemn shot of Julian looking up at his instructor's name on the listing of the deceased communicates that same impact much more effectively in a moment. If you've been keeping up with this LOGH adaptation this long, these kinds of overt sensibilities aren't really surprising, but it's still mildly annoying to see them still in place, even as the series shows inklings of knowing how to do more with less.    Thankfully, a lot of the appreciable little touches of LOGH persist here. I love the bit where Dusty relates a funny anecdote to the bridge crew and they all laugh, despite being in the middle of a heated battle. Similarly, the idea that ostensibly-inexperienced fighter-pilot movements would cause Empire officers to second-guess their approaches because they're used to going up against Yang's galaxy-brain strategies is a fun acknowledgement of how far reputation for the main characters has come at this point in the story. And it's all presented with the now-expected glossy finish of this modern animated adaptation, making the most of the opportunity to open with an episode that features a bunch of zippy space-ship dogfights. Some of its less-welcome adaptational flourishes persist, but this is still recognizably Legend of the Galactic Heroes, and it's still nice to have more of it.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                One of the great things about space operas is the size of their stories. Here we have the start of a new season, with one of our warring protagonists suffering from the tragic death of a close friend and the other having just crushed a rebellion full of people he respected. Yet this episode touches on none of that—our main characters barely even make an appearance. Rather, it is a largely self-contained “boots on the ground” story from the front lines centering on the first deployment of Yang Wen-li's adoptive son, Julian.    Julain is in a unique position. While he is intelligent and brave, he stands in the shadow of the Alliance's greatest hero. Instead of being jealous of this fact, he is humbled and wants to be of use to his adopted father. But how do you support a man like that? By becoming a fighter pilot, Julain has decided to be Yang's eyes on the front. His personal struggle over the episode is one of ego, learning to accept the victories and the losses without letting them go to his head or force him into despair.    At the same time, the whole episode is a graphic example of the futility of war. What we watch is a meaningless battle: two patrolling fleets that run into each other and start fighting. Then both sides call in reinforcements and it just snowballs. It's a pointless meatgrinder of a battle. Nothing will change based on who wins or loses. By the time Yang shows up with a fleet so massive that retreat is the only option for the Empire, pretty much every fighter pilot besides Julian is dead—and the one other newbie who made it through is on the edge of a mental break.    It's great stuff full of drama that explores the nature of the human soul—or to put it another way, it's an average episode of The Legend of Galactic Heroes.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review                Odd Taxi: In the Woods   Apr 17, 00:00                 anime    By cleverly reframing its narrative around a series of interviews with the supporting cast, Odd Taxi: In the Woods succeeds where most recap films fail: it's an artistically cohesive film in its own right. ― Odd Taxi was 2021's sleeper anime hit, telling an intricate, original mystery that kept viewers guessing every week.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These Gekitotsu   Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 25 of Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision (movies) ?                     Community score: 4.5              What is this?   Following the resolution of their respective civil wars, the conflict between the Free Planets Alliance and the Galactic Empire has resumed in earnest. Julian Mintz, adopted son of Yang Wen-Li, enlists in the Alliance military and, while being trained during a routine patrol, finds himself caught up in a conflict with a passing Empire fleet. Under the command of Dusty Attenborough, the Alliance soldiers struggle to hold their ground until Yang can send reinforcements, as Julian and his fellow recruits struggle to adapt to the realities of being thrust into real combat for the first time.    Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These Gekitotsu is the third season of the new anime of Yoshiki Tanaka's epic science fiction novel and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?    Christopher Farris  Rating:                Three years later we're back with another set of new Legend of the Galactic Heroes movies, with Crunchyroll once again chopping them up and releasing them as weekly episodes. Granted, it's more likely the other way around, as just with the pacing of the previous 'season', this first episode pretty clearly functions as an isolated half-hour that is connected with a greater whole as any piece of serialized storytelling. And it means there's enough focus in this premiere episode to bring us back into the story of all these Galactic Heroes, with just enough passing remarks on the status quo to remind us of how we got here (Though given the storied history-book density of LOGH, it might not hurt to at least go back and peruse some synopses for the preceding plot. It has been three actual years after all).    Helping to ease us into all that is the fact that this one has a relatively narrower, smaller-scale focus than LOGH adventures previously tended to end up with. The real-world-style march of time in this galaxy sees Yang's young ward Julian formally enlist in the Alliance military, and it's through his eyes that we get back to engaging with the focal conflict of this series. It comes off as a brisk, concentrated re-introduction to things, where instead of focusing on Reinhard or his consolidations in the Empire, we get a bunch of flashbacks to Julian's training and details of what he's been put through up until this first battle he finds himself in. They do also throw in some informational setup for future long-term developments of this arc (there's a reason a class question prompts a whole spiel from Julian about warp technology), but otherwise this is firmly a story about seeing the war through the fresh eyes of a rookie and their feelings of contrast with the various flavors of veteran we know exist in the LOGH ranks.    That's all well and good in terms of directly defining Julian as we follow him in this new stage of his life and the show's plot, but it does also have the side effect of the series feeling given to over-explaining its tones at every turn. There's basically no time to see Julian reflect on his situation on his own; each point has to be punctuated by a conversation with someone else in this establishment. For instance, the episode sends Dusty down to just have this detailed, emotional conversation with Julian in-between fighting where the kid directly exposits all his thoughts and feelings about the battle he was just in. The episode ends with Julian's rookie-in-arms Peter rambling about the complexities of experience and survivor's guilt in relation to the deaths of their more experienced comrades, when the following simple, solemn shot of Julian looking up at his instructor's name on the listing of the deceased communicates that same impact much more effectively in a moment. If you've been keeping up with this LOGH adaptation this long, these kinds of overt sensibilities aren't really surprising, but it's still mildly annoying to see them still in place, even as the series shows inklings of knowing how to do more with less.    Thankfully, a lot of the appreciable little touches of LOGH persist here. I love the bit where Dusty relates a funny anecdote to the bridge crew and they all laugh, despite being in the middle of a heated battle. Similarly, the idea that ostensibly-inexperienced fighter-pilot movements would cause Empire officers to second-guess their approaches because they're used to going up against Yang's galaxy-brain strategies is a fun acknowledgement of how far reputation for the main characters has come at this point in the story. And it's all presented with the now-expected glossy finish of this modern animated adaptation, making the most of the opportunity to open with an episode that features a bunch of zippy space-ship dogfights. Some of its less-welcome adaptational flourishes persist, but this is still recognizably Legend of the Galactic Heroes, and it's still nice to have more of it.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                One of the great things about space operas is the size of their stories. Here we have the start of a new season, with one of our warring protagonists suffering from the tragic death of a close friend and the other having just crushed a rebellion full of people he respected. Yet this episode touches on none of that—our main characters barely even make an appearance. Rather, it is a largely self-contained “boots on the ground” story from the front lines centering on the first deployment of Yang Wen-li's adoptive son, Julian.    Julain is in a unique position. While he is intelligent and brave, he stands in the shadow of the Alliance's greatest hero. Instead of being jealous of this fact, he is humbled and wants to be of use to his adopted father. But how do you support a man like that? By becoming a fighter pilot, Julain has decided to be Yang's eyes on the front. His personal struggle over the episode is one of ego, learning to accept the victories and the losses without letting them go to his head or force him into despair.    At the same time, the whole episode is a graphic example of the futility of war. What we watch is a meaningless battle: two patrolling fleets that run into each other and start fighting. Then both sides call in reinforcements and it just snowballs. It's a pointless meatgrinder of a battle. Nothing will change based on who wins or loses. By the time Yang shows up with a fleet so massive that retreat is the only option for the Empire, pretty much every fighter pilot besides Julian is dead—and the one other newbie who made it through is on the edge of a mental break.    It's great stuff full of drama that explores the nature of the human soul—or to put it another way, it's an average episode of The Legend of Galactic Heroes.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review                Odd Taxi: In the Woods   Apr 17, 00:00                 anime    By cleverly reframing its narrative around a series of interviews with the supporting cast, Odd Taxi: In the Woods succeeds where most recap films fail: it's an artistically cohesive film in its own right. ― Odd Taxi was 2021's sleeper anime hit, telling an intricate, original mystery that kept viewers guessing every week.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These Gekitotsu   Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 25 of Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision (movies) ?                     Community score: 4.5              What is this?   Following the resolution of their respective civil wars, the conflict between the Free Planets Alliance and the Galactic Empire has resumed in earnest. Julian Mintz, adopted son of Yang Wen-Li, enlists in the Alliance military and, while being trained during a routine patrol, finds himself caught up in a conflict with a passing Empire fleet. Under the command of Dusty Attenborough, the Alliance soldiers struggle to hold their ground until Yang can send reinforcements, as Julian and his fellow recruits struggle to adapt to the realities of being thrust into real combat for the first time.    Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These Gekitotsu is the third season of the new anime of Yoshiki Tanaka's epic science fiction novel and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?    Christopher Farris  Rating:                Three years later we're back with another set of new Legend of the Galactic Heroes movies, with Crunchyroll once again chopping them up and releasing them as weekly episodes. Granted, it's more likely the other way around, as just with the pacing of the previous 'season', this first episode pretty clearly functions as an isolated half-hour that is connected with a greater whole as any piece of serialized storytelling. And it means there's enough focus in this premiere episode to bring us back into the story of all these Galactic Heroes, with just enough passing remarks on the status quo to remind us of how we got here (Though given the storied history-book density of LOGH, it might not hurt to at least go back and peruse some synopses for the preceding plot. It has been three actual years after all).    Helping to ease us into all that is the fact that this one has a relatively narrower, smaller-scale focus than LOGH adventures previously tended to end up with. The real-world-style march of time in this galaxy sees Yang's young ward Julian formally enlist in the Alliance military, and it's through his eyes that we get back to engaging with the focal conflict of this series. It comes off as a brisk, concentrated re-introduction to things, where instead of focusing on Reinhard or his consolidations in the Empire, we get a bunch of flashbacks to Julian's training and details of what he's been put through up until this first battle he finds himself in. They do also throw in some informational setup for future long-term developments of this arc (there's a reason a class question prompts a whole spiel from Julian about warp technology), but otherwise this is firmly a story about seeing the war through the fresh eyes of a rookie and their feelings of contrast with the various flavors of veteran we know exist in the LOGH ranks.    That's all well and good in terms of directly defining Julian as we follow him in this new stage of his life and the show's plot, but it does also have the side effect of the series feeling given to over-explaining its tones at every turn. There's basically no time to see Julian reflect on his situation on his own; each point has to be punctuated by a conversation with someone else in this establishment. For instance, the episode sends Dusty down to just have this detailed, emotional conversation with Julian in-between fighting where the kid directly exposits all his thoughts and feelings about the battle he was just in. The episode ends with Julian's rookie-in-arms Peter rambling about the complexities of experience and survivor's guilt in relation to the deaths of their more experienced comrades, when the following simple, solemn shot of Julian looking up at his instructor's name on the listing of the deceased communicates that same impact much more effectively in a moment. If you've been keeping up with this LOGH adaptation this long, these kinds of overt sensibilities aren't really surprising, but it's still mildly annoying to see them still in place, even as the series shows inklings of knowing how to do more with less.    Thankfully, a lot of the appreciable little touches of LOGH persist here. I love the bit where Dusty relates a funny anecdote to the bridge crew and they all laugh, despite being in the middle of a heated battle. Similarly, the idea that ostensibly-inexperienced fighter-pilot movements would cause Empire officers to second-guess their approaches because they're used to going up against Yang's galaxy-brain strategies is a fun acknowledgement of how far reputation for the main characters has come at this point in the story. And it's all presented with the now-expected glossy finish of this modern animated adaptation, making the most of the opportunity to open with an episode that features a bunch of zippy space-ship dogfights. Some of its less-welcome adaptational flourishes persist, but this is still recognizably Legend of the Galactic Heroes, and it's still nice to have more of it.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                One of the great things about space operas is the size of their stories. Here we have the start of a new season, with one of our warring protagonists suffering from the tragic death of a close friend and the other having just crushed a rebellion full of people he respected. Yet this episode touches on none of that—our main characters barely even make an appearance. Rather, it is a largely self-contained “boots on the ground” story from the front lines centering on the first deployment of Yang Wen-li's adoptive son, Julian.    Julain is in a unique position. While he is intelligent and brave, he stands in the shadow of the Alliance's greatest hero. Instead of being jealous of this fact, he is humbled and wants to be of use to his adopted father. But how do you support a man like that? By becoming a fighter pilot, Julain has decided to be Yang's eyes on the front. His personal struggle over the episode is one of ego, learning to accept the victories and the losses without letting them go to his head or force him into despair.    At the same time, the whole episode is a graphic example of the futility of war. What we watch is a meaningless battle: two patrolling fleets that run into each other and start fighting. Then both sides call in reinforcements and it just snowballs. It's a pointless meatgrinder of a battle. Nothing will change based on who wins or loses. By the time Yang shows up with a fleet so massive that retreat is the only option for the Empire, pretty much every fighter pilot besides Julian is dead—and the one other newbie who made it through is on the edge of a mental break.

Community score: 4.5              What is this?   Following the resolution of their respective civil wars, the conflict between the Free Planets Alliance and the Galactic Empire has resumed in earnest. Julian Mintz, adopted son of Yang Wen-Li, enlists in the Alliance military and, while being trained during a routine patrol, finds himself caught up in a conflict with a passing Empire fleet. Under the command of Dusty Attenborough, the Alliance soldiers struggle to hold their ground until Yang can send reinforcements, as Julian and his fellow recruits struggle to adapt to the realities of being thrust into real combat for the first time.    Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These Gekitotsu is the third season of the new anime of Yoshiki Tanaka's epic science fiction novel and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?    Christopher Farris  Rating:                Three years later we're back with another set of new Legend of the Galactic Heroes movies, with Crunchyroll once again chopping them up and releasing them as weekly episodes. Granted, it's more likely the other way around, as just with the pacing of the previous 'season', this first episode pretty clearly functions as an isolated half-hour that is connected with a greater whole as any piece of serialized storytelling. And it means there's enough focus in this premiere episode to bring us back into the story of all these Galactic Heroes, with just enough passing remarks on the status quo to remind us of how we got here (Though given the storied history-book density of LOGH, it might not hurt to at least go back and peruse some synopses for the preceding plot. It has been three actual years after all).    Helping to ease us into all that is the fact that this one has a relatively narrower, smaller-scale focus than LOGH adventures previously tended to end up with. The real-world-style march of time in this galaxy sees Yang's young ward Julian formally enlist in the Alliance military, and it's through his eyes that we get back to engaging with the focal conflict of this series. It comes off as a brisk, concentrated re-introduction to things, where instead of focusing on Reinhard or his consolidations in the Empire, we get a bunch of flashbacks to Julian's training and details of what he's been put through up until this first battle he finds himself in. They do also throw in some informational setup for future long-term developments of this arc (there's a reason a class question prompts a whole spiel from Julian about warp technology), but otherwise this is firmly a story about seeing the war through the fresh eyes of a rookie and their feelings of contrast with the various flavors of veteran we know exist in the LOGH ranks.    That's all well and good in terms of directly defining Julian as we follow him in this new stage of his life and the show's plot, but it does also have the side effect of the series feeling given to over-explaining its tones at every turn. There's basically no time to see Julian reflect on his situation on his own; each point has to be punctuated by a conversation with someone else in this establishment. For instance, the episode sends Dusty down to just have this detailed, emotional conversation with Julian in-between fighting where the kid directly exposits all his thoughts and feelings about the battle he was just in. The episode ends with Julian's rookie-in-arms Peter rambling about the complexities of experience and survivor's guilt in relation to the deaths of their more experienced comrades, when the following simple, solemn shot of Julian looking up at his instructor's name on the listing of the deceased communicates that same impact much more effectively in a moment. If you've been keeping up with this LOGH adaptation this long, these kinds of overt sensibilities aren't really surprising, but it's still mildly annoying to see them still in place, even as the series shows inklings of knowing how to do more with less.    Thankfully, a lot of the appreciable little touches of LOGH persist here. I love the bit where Dusty relates a funny anecdote to the bridge crew and they all laugh, despite being in the middle of a heated battle. Similarly, the idea that ostensibly-inexperienced fighter-pilot movements would cause Empire officers to second-guess their approaches because they're used to going up against Yang's galaxy-brain strategies is a fun acknowledgement of how far reputation for the main characters has come at this point in the story. And it's all presented with the now-expected glossy finish of this modern animated adaptation, making the most of the opportunity to open with an episode that features a bunch of zippy space-ship dogfights. Some of its less-welcome adaptational flourishes persist, but this is still recognizably Legend of the Galactic Heroes, and it's still nice to have more of it.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                One of the great things about space operas is the size of their stories. Here we have the start of a new season, with one of our warring protagonists suffering from the tragic death of a close friend and the other having just crushed a rebellion full of people he respected. Yet this episode touches on none of that—our main characters barely even make an appearance. Rather, it is a largely self-contained “boots on the ground” story from the front lines centering on the first deployment of Yang Wen-li's adoptive son, Julian.    Julain is in a unique position. While he is intelligent and brave, he stands in the shadow of the Alliance's greatest hero. Instead of being jealous of this fact, he is humbled and wants to be of use to his adopted father. But how do you support a man like that? By becoming a fighter pilot, Julain has decided to be Yang's eyes on the front. His personal struggle over the episode is one of ego, learning to accept the victories and the losses without letting them go to his head or force him into despair.    At the same time, the whole episode is a graphic example of the futility of war. What we watch is a meaningless battle: two patrolling fleets that run into each other and start fighting. Then both sides call in reinforcements and it just snowballs. It's a pointless meatgrinder of a battle. Nothing will change based on who wins or loses. By the time Yang shows up with a fleet so massive that retreat is the only option for the Empire, pretty much every fighter pilot besides Julian is dead—and the one other newbie who made it through is on the edge of a mental break.

News Odd Taxi Anime Film's Clip Featuring Daimon Brothers Streamed   posted on 2022-04-14 23:00 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         Film opened on April 1    The staff for Eiga Odd Taxi: In the Woods, the film project of the original anime Odd Taxi, began streaming a clip from the film on Thursday. The clip features a conversation between Odokawa and the Daimon Brothers about Dob.       The film opened on April 1 at #10 and earned 52 million yen (approximately US$4,23,685) in its first weekend.    The television anime's main cast and staff returned. ASMIK Ace is distributing. Crunchyroll will stream the film.    The film is a ""reconstruction"" of the television anime episodes, but it also depicts what happens after the television anime's finale.    The anime premiered in Japan in April 2021 and aired for 13 episodes. Crunchyroll streamed the anime in the West.    The story follows Odokawa, an eccentric, reticent 41-year-old taxi driver who has no relatives and does not have much to do with others. He does have conversations with his customers, including a college student who wants to go viral, a nurse hiding a secret, an unsuccessful comedian, a street rough, and an up-and-coming idol. These conversations lead him to a girl who has disappeared.    Manga creator Kadzuya Konomoto (Seto Utsumi) wrote the anime. Baku Kinoshita directed the anime with Norio Nitta as the assistant director. Kinoshita and Hiromi Nakayama designed the characters. Kohei Yoshida was the recording director at Pony Canyon Enterprise. PUNPEE VaVa OMSB were in charge of the music, and Pony Canyon was in charge of music production with collaboration by Summit, Inc. P.I.C.S. and OLM produced the anime. P.I.C.S. was also credited for the original work and planning. Skirt (singer-songwriter Wataru Sawabe's solo project) and rapper/DJ PUNPEE performed the show's opening theme song ""Odd Taxi,"" and Suzuko Mimori performed the ending theme song ""Sugarless Kiss.""    Takeichi Abaraya and Konomoto launched a manga adaptation of the anime in January 2021 on Shogakukan's digital manga label Superior Dalpana.

News Odd Taxi Anime Film's Clip Featuring Daimon Brothers Streamed   posted on 2022-04-14 23:00 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         Film opened on April 1    The staff for Eiga Odd Taxi: In the Woods, the film project of the original anime Odd Taxi, began streaming a clip from the film on Thursday. The clip features a conversation between Odokawa and the Daimon Brothers about Dob.       The film opened on April 1 at #10 and earned 52 million yen (approximately US$4,23,685) in its first weekend.    The television anime's main cast and staff returned. ASMIK Ace is distributing. Crunchyroll will stream the film.    The film is a ""reconstruction"" of the television anime episodes, but it also depicts what happens after the television anime's finale.    The anime premiered in Japan in April 2021 and aired for 13 episodes. Crunchyroll streamed the anime in the West.    The story follows Odokawa, an eccentric, reticent 41-year-old taxi driver who has no relatives and does not have much to do with others. He does have conversations with his customers, including a college student who wants to go viral, a nurse hiding a secret, an unsuccessful comedian, a street rough, and an up-and-coming idol. These conversations lead him to a girl who has disappeared.    Manga creator Kadzuya Konomoto (Seto Utsumi) wrote the anime. Baku Kinoshita directed the anime with Norio Nitta as the assistant director. Kinoshita and Hiromi Nakayama designed the characters. Kohei Yoshida was the recording director at Pony Canyon Enterprise. PUNPEE VaVa OMSB were in charge of the music, and Pony Canyon was in charge of music production with collaboration by Summit, Inc. P.I.C.S. and OLM produced the anime. P.I.C.S. was also credited for the original work and planning. Skirt (singer-songwriter Wataru Sawabe's solo project) and rapper/DJ PUNPEE performed the show's opening theme song ""Odd Taxi,"" and Suzuko Mimori performed the ending theme song ""Sugarless Kiss.""    Takeichi Abaraya and Konomoto launched a manga adaptation of the anime in January 2021 on Shogakukan's digital manga label Superior Dalpana.

News Odd Taxi Anime Film's Clip Featuring Daimon Brothers Streamed   posted on 2022-04-14 23:00 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         Film opened on April 1    The staff for Eiga Odd Taxi: In the Woods, the film project of the original anime Odd Taxi, began streaming a clip from the film on Thursday. The clip features a conversation between Odokawa and the Daimon Brothers about Dob.       The film opened on April 1 at #10 and earned 52 million yen (approximately US$4,23,685) in its first weekend.    The television anime's main cast and staff returned. ASMIK Ace is distributing. Crunchyroll will stream the film.    The film is a ""reconstruction"" of the television anime episodes, but it also depicts what happens after the television anime's finale.    The anime premiered in Japan in April 2021 and aired for 13 episodes. Crunchyroll streamed the anime in the West.    The story follows Odokawa, an eccentric, reticent 41-year-old taxi driver who has no relatives and does not have much to do with others. He does have conversations with his customers, including a college student who wants to go viral, a nurse hiding a secret, an unsuccessful comedian, a street rough, and an up-and-coming idol. These conversations lead him to a girl who has disappeared.    Manga creator Kadzuya Konomoto (Seto Utsumi) wrote the anime. Baku Kinoshita directed the anime with Norio Nitta as the assistant director. Kinoshita and Hiromi Nakayama designed the characters. Kohei Yoshida was the recording director at Pony Canyon Enterprise. PUNPEE VaVa OMSB were in charge of the music, and Pony Canyon was in charge of music production with collaboration by Summit, Inc. P.I.C.S. and OLM produced the anime. P.I.C.S. was also credited for the original work and planning. Skirt (singer-songwriter Wataru Sawabe's solo project) and rapper/DJ PUNPEE performed the show's opening theme song ""Odd Taxi,"" and Suzuko Mimori performed the ending theme song ""Sugarless Kiss.""    Takeichi Abaraya and Konomoto launched a manga adaptation of the anime in January 2021 on Shogakukan's digital manga label Superior Dalpana.

The clip features a conversation between Odokawa and the Daimon Brothers about Dob.       The film opened on April 1 at #10 and earned 52 million yen (approximately US$4,23,685) in its first weekend.    The television anime's main cast and staff returned. ASMIK Ace is distributing. Crunchyroll will stream the film.    The film is a ""reconstruction"" of the television anime episodes, but it also depicts what happens after the television anime's finale.    The anime premiered in Japan in April 2021 and aired for 13 episodes. Crunchyroll streamed the anime in the West.    The story follows Odokawa, an eccentric, reticent 41-year-old taxi driver who has no relatives and does not have much to do with others. He does have conversations with his customers, including a college student who wants to go viral, a nurse hiding a secret, an unsuccessful comedian, a street rough, and an up-and-coming idol. These conversations lead him to a girl who has disappeared.    Manga creator Kadzuya Konomoto (Seto Utsumi) wrote the anime. Baku Kinoshita directed the anime with Norio Nitta as the assistant director. Kinoshita and Hiromi Nakayama designed the characters. Kohei Yoshida was the recording director at Pony Canyon Enterprise. PUNPEE VaVa OMSB were in charge of the music, and Pony Canyon was in charge of music production with collaboration by Summit, Inc. P.I.C.S. and OLM produced the anime. P.I.C.S. was also credited for the original work and planning.
