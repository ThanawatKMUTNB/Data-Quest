How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom Part 2 Episode 13  by Grant Jones, Apr  5th 2022                   How would you rate episode 13 of How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.3            What a finale! I'm impressed, and I think it's a great note to end the season on regardless of whether or not we will get future entries. I'm curious how well-received this ending is on the whole as I think it addresses a lot of my issues with the series, but departs from prior episodes in so many ways that it feels like something else entirely.    As far as twists go, I think this was a good one. In my opinion, the best twists aren't necessarily about shock value as much as they are about recontextualizing prior events. The revelation that the former queen has a sort of memory-casting ability to allow her and the king's past selves to keep trying until they get things right is a good twist. As long as you don't mind a bit of paradox – and Lord knows I'll take all kinds of paradoxes if it makes for good storytelling – it's a great reveal that manages to convey some of the pain from past failures. This is a good way to attach consequences even though they can keep resetting, so to speak.    I also think it does a lot to alleviate some of my past concerns about the breezy way Souma has taken to politics. Souma's earlier exploits all felt a bit too clean, a bit too perfect, lacking in nuance and friction. That's because the actual realistic approach already happened once and it was a big messy affair that ended in tragedy. That's a good way to lampshade the wish-fulfillment aspects of the story. I also enjoyed that Souma wrestled with this for at least a little bit, wondering if his actions really mattered at all in this light. Even Liscia gets a lot of time to shine; having the king regret not trusting her in a past life and the really tender moment she and Souma had at the end are all great stuff.    Sadly, all these appreciable elements also make the warts stand out that much more. The wrap-up ending with all the other cast-members/wives only serves to highlight how flat and tropey these characters are, and undercuts some of the effectiveness that the rest of the episode had. Will future seasons – should they come to pass – direct the same kind of self-awareness that this episode had towards its harem elements, or will they continue to fall back on the same “omg Souma you're so great” ad nauseum? Only time will tell, but I think the nuance and creativity expressed in this episode is precisely the sort of energy I want to see going forward, and I would actually be excited to review more of the show in the future should it come to pass.

How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom Part 2 Episode 13  by Grant Jones, Apr  5th 2022                   How would you rate episode 13 of How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.3            What a finale! I'm impressed, and I think it's a great note to end the season on regardless of whether or not we will get future entries. I'm curious how well-received this ending is on the whole as I think it addresses a lot of my issues with the series, but departs from prior episodes in so many ways that it feels like something else entirely.    As far as twists go, I think this was a good one. In my opinion, the best twists aren't necessarily about shock value as much as they are about recontextualizing prior events. The revelation that the former queen has a sort of memory-casting ability to allow her and the king's past selves to keep trying until they get things right is a good twist. As long as you don't mind a bit of paradox – and Lord knows I'll take all kinds of paradoxes if it makes for good storytelling – it's a great reveal that manages to convey some of the pain from past failures. This is a good way to attach consequences even though they can keep resetting, so to speak.    I also think it does a lot to alleviate some of my past concerns about the breezy way Souma has taken to politics. Souma's earlier exploits all felt a bit too clean, a bit too perfect, lacking in nuance and friction. That's because the actual realistic approach already happened once and it was a big messy affair that ended in tragedy. That's a good way to lampshade the wish-fulfillment aspects of the story. I also enjoyed that Souma wrestled with this for at least a little bit, wondering if his actions really mattered at all in this light. Even Liscia gets a lot of time to shine; having the king regret not trusting her in a past life and the really tender moment she and Souma had at the end are all great stuff.    Sadly, all these appreciable elements also make the warts stand out that much more. The wrap-up ending with all the other cast-members/wives only serves to highlight how flat and tropey these characters are, and undercuts some of the effectiveness that the rest of the episode had. Will future seasons – should they come to pass – direct the same kind of self-awareness that this episode had towards its harem elements, or will they continue to fall back on the same “omg Souma you're so great” ad nauseum? Only time will tell, but I think the nuance and creativity expressed in this episode is precisely the sort of energy I want to see going forward, and I would actually be excited to review more of the show in the future should it come to pass.

How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom Part 2 Episode 13  by Grant Jones, Apr  5th 2022                   How would you rate episode 13 of How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.3            What a finale! I'm impressed, and I think it's a great note to end the season on regardless of whether or not we will get future entries. I'm curious how well-received this ending is on the whole as I think it addresses a lot of my issues with the series, but departs from prior episodes in so many ways that it feels like something else entirely.    As far as twists go, I think this was a good one. In my opinion, the best twists aren't necessarily about shock value as much as they are about recontextualizing prior events. The revelation that the former queen has a sort of memory-casting ability to allow her and the king's past selves to keep trying until they get things right is a good twist. As long as you don't mind a bit of paradox – and Lord knows I'll take all kinds of paradoxes if it makes for good storytelling – it's a great reveal that manages to convey some of the pain from past failures. This is a good way to attach consequences even though they can keep resetting, so to speak.    I also think it does a lot to alleviate some of my past concerns about the breezy way Souma has taken to politics. Souma's earlier exploits all felt a bit too clean, a bit too perfect, lacking in nuance and friction. That's because the actual realistic approach already happened once and it was a big messy affair that ended in tragedy. That's a good way to lampshade the wish-fulfillment aspects of the story. I also enjoyed that Souma wrestled with this for at least a little bit, wondering if his actions really mattered at all in this light. Even Liscia gets a lot of time to shine; having the king regret not trusting her in a past life and the really tender moment she and Souma had at the end are all great stuff.    Sadly, all these appreciable elements also make the warts stand out that much more. The wrap-up ending with all the other cast-members/wives only serves to highlight how flat and tropey these characters are, and undercuts some of the effectiveness that the rest of the episode had. Will future seasons – should they come to pass – direct the same kind of self-awareness that this episode had towards its harem elements, or will they continue to fall back on the same “omg Souma you're so great” ad nauseum? Only time will tell, but I think the nuance and creativity expressed in this episode is precisely the sort of energy I want to see going forward, and I would actually be excited to review more of the show in the future should it come to pass.

How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom Part 2 Episode 13  by Grant Jones, Apr  5th 2022                   How would you rate episode 13 of How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.3            What a finale! I'm impressed, and I think it's a great note to end the season on regardless of whether or not we will get future entries. I'm curious how well-received this ending is on the whole as I think it addresses a lot of my issues with the series, but departs from prior episodes in so many ways that it feels like something else entirely.    As far as twists go, I think this was a good one. In my opinion, the best twists aren't necessarily about shock value as much as they are about recontextualizing prior events. The revelation that the former queen has a sort of memory-casting ability to allow her and the king's past selves to keep trying until they get things right is a good twist. As long as you don't mind a bit of paradox – and Lord knows I'll take all kinds of paradoxes if it makes for good storytelling – it's a great reveal that manages to convey some of the pain from past failures. This is a good way to attach consequences even though they can keep resetting, so to speak.    I also think it does a lot to alleviate some of my past concerns about the breezy way Souma has taken to politics. Souma's earlier exploits all felt a bit too clean, a bit too perfect, lacking in nuance and friction. That's because the actual realistic approach already happened once and it was a big messy affair that ended in tragedy. That's a good way to lampshade the wish-fulfillment aspects of the story. I also enjoyed that Souma wrestled with this for at least a little bit, wondering if his actions really mattered at all in this light. Even Liscia gets a lot of time to shine; having the king regret not trusting her in a past life and the really tender moment she and Souma had at the end are all great stuff.    Sadly, all these appreciable elements also make the warts stand out that much more. The wrap-up ending with all the other cast-members/wives only serves to highlight how flat and tropey these characters are, and undercuts some of the effectiveness that the rest of the episode had. Will future seasons – should they come to pass – direct the same kind of self-awareness that this episode had towards its harem elements, or will they continue to fall back on the same “omg Souma you're so great” ad nauseum? Only time will tell, but I think the nuance and creativity expressed in this episode is precisely the sort of energy I want to see going forward, and I would actually be excited to review more of the show in the future should it come to pass.

Review   by Rebecca Silverman, Apr 16th 2022       My Happy Marriage Novel 1                     Synopsis:             Miyo Saimori is the eldest daughter of the noble Saimori family, but as the un-Gifted daughter of her father's despised first wife, she's treated like a servant by her stepmother and half-sister. When escape comes in the form of being offered in marriage to the infamously cold Kiyoka Kudou, Miyo barely has enough left in her to hope, assuming that because she lacks Spirit-Sight she'll be rejected and die on the streets as her parents intended. But contrary to everyone's expectations, Miyo is not universally loathed, and her betrothal offers her the most precious chance of all: to learn to stop hating herself.      Review:         Synopsis:        Miyo Saimori is the eldest daughter of the noble Saimori family, but as the un-Gifted daughter of her father's despised first wife, she's treated like a servant by her stepmother and half-sister. When escape comes in the form of being offered in marriage to the infamously cold Kiyoka Kudou, Miyo barely has enough left in her to hope, assuming that because she lacks Spirit-Sight she'll be rejected and die on the streets as her parents intended. But contrary to everyone's expectations, Miyo is not universally loathed, and her betrothal offers her the most precious chance of all: to learn to stop hating herself.     Review:            Set in an alternate version of the late Meiji or early Taisho era, My Happy Marriage is a fairly classic take on the Cinderella story – especially if you remember that in many, if not most, variants of that tale Cinderella's father is alive and well and just watching his second wife abuse his daughter. That's the life that Miyo Saimori has been living for almost all of her nineteen years; her parents were forced into an arranged marriage despite her father being in love with another woman, and when her mother died, her father quickly married his first love, upon which both he and his second wife transferred their anger onto Miyo. To make matters even worse, Miyo lacked the one quality that her parents were married for in the first place: a special power known as the Gift of Spirit-Sight. The birth of their child, Miyo's three-years-younger half-sister Kaya, certainly didn't help, and by the time Miyo turned ten she was more or less kicked out of a family circle that barely accepted her to begin with.    Plenty of light novel heroines start life in a similar fashion, with recent (in translation) examples being I'll Never Set Foot in That House Again! and A Fairy Tale for Wizards, but in most cases the torment ends the moment the heroine is rescued. That is not the case for this story, and Miyo's PTSD from the treatment she received at her family home is a major theme of the novel; just because she's no longer under the Saimori roof doesn't mean that she's magically cured of the trauma caused by years of emotional and physical abuse. While that can be hard to read, it's also a point in the book's favor because it gives Miyo something real to develop as a character. There's no magical fix for her emotional issues, as her fiancé and his elderly servant quickly find out. The only things that will help Miyo to heal are kindness and time, and while this doesn't necessarily make her the most engaging protagonist, it lends an appreciable thread of reality to this story of Grotesqueries (spirits and demons). Not that fantasy romances are strictly required to be realistic, but it's a good way to set My Happy Marriage apart from its brethren.    And it does have plenty of the hallmarks of fantasy romance that readers of the genre have come to expect. Mostly those are concentrated in Kiyoka Kudou, Miyo's fiancé. Physically gorgeous, Kiyoka has a reputation for being incredibly cold and possibly cruel. The most talented Gifted of his generation, he heads up a special army unit for Gifted soldiers, and his hard-working personality is often misinterpreted as curmudgeonly. Naturally, that's not the case – he's just really not good at things like “emotions” and “not working,” but his personality is such that few of the spoiled young noblewomen his father has affianced him to are bothered to see that. Since Miyo doesn't expect anyone to be nice to her, she's not bothered by his attitude – but he is upset by hers, which is cringing and fearful in every single interaction they have. Fortunately for the story, he's not stupid, and neither is Yurie, his longtime servant. The two of them quickly figure out that something was very wrong in the Saimori household when Miyo was living there, and from there they begin to take steps to help Miyo regain a sense of self-worth and confidence.    To say it's an uphill battle would be understating the matter, and in some ways this can feel like a very long short book. (It's under 200 pages.) While Miyo's beaten-down reactions and personality make absolutely perfect sense, they can be very difficult to read about because she is so damaged by her experiences. Whether you feel sorry for her, frustrated with all of the characters, or furious with her family (or all three with some bonus emotions thrown in for good measure), there are definitely times when putting down the book and walking away is the best way to finish reading it. It's a good, well-written story (despite the odd fact that the title and chapter titles are in first person while the text is in third person), but it's also as far from light and fluffy as you can get in a romance, and both the cheery title and the gorgeous cover illustration can make the darkness of the plot difficult to realize. It's worth sticking it out, but it's not always easy to do so.    That cover image is also the only illustration in the book. Author Akumi Agitogi is good enough that the novel is plenty visual even without the assistance of illustrations, and it's also not difficult to figure out the rough time period from clues given within the text, so this doesn't actually hinder reading. The world-building is also well done, with a familiar early twentieth century feel nicely offset by the few fantasy trappings that are worked in. Gifts are strictly psychic in nature, and there are some hints that Miyo may not be as Giftless as she is thought to be based on her mother's peculiar bloodline talents. There are also interesting ideas of Grotesqueries being a product of a pre-industrial society and Gifts being on their way out in a world that now has automobiles and other similar modern features, which is something that will hopefully continue to be developed in the next book(s).    My Happy Marriage isn't always an easy book, but it is a good one. Miyo's treatment at the hands of her family is appropriately horrible, Kiyoka is quietly dashing, and Miyo's slow growth into someone who knows she's not garbage is heartening, even if it is occasionally difficult to read about. It's not a light romance, but if you don't mind that, it's worth checking out.             Grade:      Overall : B Story : B  + Beautiful cover, story has interesting world building and doesn't pull punches on the abuse Miyo undergoes. − Can be difficult to read at times because of Miyo's abuse.            discuss this in the forum (8 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                  				Add this manga to 				               Production Info:        Story: Akumi Agitogi   Full encyclopedia details aboutMy Happy Marriage (light novel)        Review homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review                Odd Taxi: In the Woods   Apr 17, 00:00                 anime    By cleverly reframing its narrative around a series of interviews with the supporting cast, Odd Taxi: In the Woods succeeds where most recap films fail: it's an artistically cohesive film in its own right. ― Odd Taxi was 2021's sleeper anime hit, telling an intricate, original mystery that kept viewers guessing every week.

Review   by Rebecca Silverman, Apr 16th 2022       My Happy Marriage Novel 1                     Synopsis:             Miyo Saimori is the eldest daughter of the noble Saimori family, but as the un-Gifted daughter of her father's despised first wife, she's treated like a servant by her stepmother and half-sister. When escape comes in the form of being offered in marriage to the infamously cold Kiyoka Kudou, Miyo barely has enough left in her to hope, assuming that because she lacks Spirit-Sight she'll be rejected and die on the streets as her parents intended. But contrary to everyone's expectations, Miyo is not universally loathed, and her betrothal offers her the most precious chance of all: to learn to stop hating herself.      Review:         Synopsis:        Miyo Saimori is the eldest daughter of the noble Saimori family, but as the un-Gifted daughter of her father's despised first wife, she's treated like a servant by her stepmother and half-sister. When escape comes in the form of being offered in marriage to the infamously cold Kiyoka Kudou, Miyo barely has enough left in her to hope, assuming that because she lacks Spirit-Sight she'll be rejected and die on the streets as her parents intended. But contrary to everyone's expectations, Miyo is not universally loathed, and her betrothal offers her the most precious chance of all: to learn to stop hating herself.     Review:            Set in an alternate version of the late Meiji or early Taisho era, My Happy Marriage is a fairly classic take on the Cinderella story – especially if you remember that in many, if not most, variants of that tale Cinderella's father is alive and well and just watching his second wife abuse his daughter. That's the life that Miyo Saimori has been living for almost all of her nineteen years; her parents were forced into an arranged marriage despite her father being in love with another woman, and when her mother died, her father quickly married his first love, upon which both he and his second wife transferred their anger onto Miyo. To make matters even worse, Miyo lacked the one quality that her parents were married for in the first place: a special power known as the Gift of Spirit-Sight. The birth of their child, Miyo's three-years-younger half-sister Kaya, certainly didn't help, and by the time Miyo turned ten she was more or less kicked out of a family circle that barely accepted her to begin with.    Plenty of light novel heroines start life in a similar fashion, with recent (in translation) examples being I'll Never Set Foot in That House Again! and A Fairy Tale for Wizards, but in most cases the torment ends the moment the heroine is rescued. That is not the case for this story, and Miyo's PTSD from the treatment she received at her family home is a major theme of the novel; just because she's no longer under the Saimori roof doesn't mean that she's magically cured of the trauma caused by years of emotional and physical abuse. While that can be hard to read, it's also a point in the book's favor because it gives Miyo something real to develop as a character. There's no magical fix for her emotional issues, as her fiancé and his elderly servant quickly find out. The only things that will help Miyo to heal are kindness and time, and while this doesn't necessarily make her the most engaging protagonist, it lends an appreciable thread of reality to this story of Grotesqueries (spirits and demons). Not that fantasy romances are strictly required to be realistic, but it's a good way to set My Happy Marriage apart from its brethren.    And it does have plenty of the hallmarks of fantasy romance that readers of the genre have come to expect. Mostly those are concentrated in Kiyoka Kudou, Miyo's fiancé. Physically gorgeous, Kiyoka has a reputation for being incredibly cold and possibly cruel. The most talented Gifted of his generation, he heads up a special army unit for Gifted soldiers, and his hard-working personality is often misinterpreted as curmudgeonly. Naturally, that's not the case – he's just really not good at things like “emotions” and “not working,” but his personality is such that few of the spoiled young noblewomen his father has affianced him to are bothered to see that. Since Miyo doesn't expect anyone to be nice to her, she's not bothered by his attitude – but he is upset by hers, which is cringing and fearful in every single interaction they have. Fortunately for the story, he's not stupid, and neither is Yurie, his longtime servant. The two of them quickly figure out that something was very wrong in the Saimori household when Miyo was living there, and from there they begin to take steps to help Miyo regain a sense of self-worth and confidence.    To say it's an uphill battle would be understating the matter, and in some ways this can feel like a very long short book. (It's under 200 pages.) While Miyo's beaten-down reactions and personality make absolutely perfect sense, they can be very difficult to read about because she is so damaged by her experiences. Whether you feel sorry for her, frustrated with all of the characters, or furious with her family (or all three with some bonus emotions thrown in for good measure), there are definitely times when putting down the book and walking away is the best way to finish reading it. It's a good, well-written story (despite the odd fact that the title and chapter titles are in first person while the text is in third person), but it's also as far from light and fluffy as you can get in a romance, and both the cheery title and the gorgeous cover illustration can make the darkness of the plot difficult to realize. It's worth sticking it out, but it's not always easy to do so.    That cover image is also the only illustration in the book. Author Akumi Agitogi is good enough that the novel is plenty visual even without the assistance of illustrations, and it's also not difficult to figure out the rough time period from clues given within the text, so this doesn't actually hinder reading. The world-building is also well done, with a familiar early twentieth century feel nicely offset by the few fantasy trappings that are worked in. Gifts are strictly psychic in nature, and there are some hints that Miyo may not be as Giftless as she is thought to be based on her mother's peculiar bloodline talents. There are also interesting ideas of Grotesqueries being a product of a pre-industrial society and Gifts being on their way out in a world that now has automobiles and other similar modern features, which is something that will hopefully continue to be developed in the next book(s).    My Happy Marriage isn't always an easy book, but it is a good one. Miyo's treatment at the hands of her family is appropriately horrible, Kiyoka is quietly dashing, and Miyo's slow growth into someone who knows she's not garbage is heartening, even if it is occasionally difficult to read about. It's not a light romance, but if you don't mind that, it's worth checking out.             Grade:      Overall : B Story : B  + Beautiful cover, story has interesting world building and doesn't pull punches on the abuse Miyo undergoes. − Can be difficult to read at times because of Miyo's abuse.            discuss this in the forum (8 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                  				Add this manga to 				               Production Info:        Story: Akumi Agitogi   Full encyclopedia details aboutMy Happy Marriage (light novel)        Review homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review                Odd Taxi: In the Woods   Apr 17, 00:00                 anime    By cleverly reframing its narrative around a series of interviews with the supporting cast, Odd Taxi: In the Woods succeeds where most recap films fail: it's an artistically cohesive film in its own right. ― Odd Taxi was 2021's sleeper anime hit, telling an intricate, original mystery that kept viewers guessing every week.

Review   by Rebecca Silverman, Apr 16th 2022       My Happy Marriage Novel 1                     Synopsis:             Miyo Saimori is the eldest daughter of the noble Saimori family, but as the un-Gifted daughter of her father's despised first wife, she's treated like a servant by her stepmother and half-sister. When escape comes in the form of being offered in marriage to the infamously cold Kiyoka Kudou, Miyo barely has enough left in her to hope, assuming that because she lacks Spirit-Sight she'll be rejected and die on the streets as her parents intended. But contrary to everyone's expectations, Miyo is not universally loathed, and her betrothal offers her the most precious chance of all: to learn to stop hating herself.      Review:         Synopsis:        Miyo Saimori is the eldest daughter of the noble Saimori family, but as the un-Gifted daughter of her father's despised first wife, she's treated like a servant by her stepmother and half-sister. When escape comes in the form of being offered in marriage to the infamously cold Kiyoka Kudou, Miyo barely has enough left in her to hope, assuming that because she lacks Spirit-Sight she'll be rejected and die on the streets as her parents intended. But contrary to everyone's expectations, Miyo is not universally loathed, and her betrothal offers her the most precious chance of all: to learn to stop hating herself.     Review:            Set in an alternate version of the late Meiji or early Taisho era, My Happy Marriage is a fairly classic take on the Cinderella story – especially if you remember that in many, if not most, variants of that tale Cinderella's father is alive and well and just watching his second wife abuse his daughter. That's the life that Miyo Saimori has been living for almost all of her nineteen years; her parents were forced into an arranged marriage despite her father being in love with another woman, and when her mother died, her father quickly married his first love, upon which both he and his second wife transferred their anger onto Miyo. To make matters even worse, Miyo lacked the one quality that her parents were married for in the first place: a special power known as the Gift of Spirit-Sight. The birth of their child, Miyo's three-years-younger half-sister Kaya, certainly didn't help, and by the time Miyo turned ten she was more or less kicked out of a family circle that barely accepted her to begin with.    Plenty of light novel heroines start life in a similar fashion, with recent (in translation) examples being I'll Never Set Foot in That House Again! and A Fairy Tale for Wizards, but in most cases the torment ends the moment the heroine is rescued. That is not the case for this story, and Miyo's PTSD from the treatment she received at her family home is a major theme of the novel; just because she's no longer under the Saimori roof doesn't mean that she's magically cured of the trauma caused by years of emotional and physical abuse. While that can be hard to read, it's also a point in the book's favor because it gives Miyo something real to develop as a character. There's no magical fix for her emotional issues, as her fiancé and his elderly servant quickly find out. The only things that will help Miyo to heal are kindness and time, and while this doesn't necessarily make her the most engaging protagonist, it lends an appreciable thread of reality to this story of Grotesqueries (spirits and demons). Not that fantasy romances are strictly required to be realistic, but it's a good way to set My Happy Marriage apart from its brethren.    And it does have plenty of the hallmarks of fantasy romance that readers of the genre have come to expect. Mostly those are concentrated in Kiyoka Kudou, Miyo's fiancé. Physically gorgeous, Kiyoka has a reputation for being incredibly cold and possibly cruel. The most talented Gifted of his generation, he heads up a special army unit for Gifted soldiers, and his hard-working personality is often misinterpreted as curmudgeonly. Naturally, that's not the case – he's just really not good at things like “emotions” and “not working,” but his personality is such that few of the spoiled young noblewomen his father has affianced him to are bothered to see that. Since Miyo doesn't expect anyone to be nice to her, she's not bothered by his attitude – but he is upset by hers, which is cringing and fearful in every single interaction they have. Fortunately for the story, he's not stupid, and neither is Yurie, his longtime servant. The two of them quickly figure out that something was very wrong in the Saimori household when Miyo was living there, and from there they begin to take steps to help Miyo regain a sense of self-worth and confidence.    To say it's an uphill battle would be understating the matter, and in some ways this can feel like a very long short book. (It's under 200 pages.) While Miyo's beaten-down reactions and personality make absolutely perfect sense, they can be very difficult to read about because she is so damaged by her experiences. Whether you feel sorry for her, frustrated with all of the characters, or furious with her family (or all three with some bonus emotions thrown in for good measure), there are definitely times when putting down the book and walking away is the best way to finish reading it. It's a good, well-written story (despite the odd fact that the title and chapter titles are in first person while the text is in third person), but it's also as far from light and fluffy as you can get in a romance, and both the cheery title and the gorgeous cover illustration can make the darkness of the plot difficult to realize. It's worth sticking it out, but it's not always easy to do so.    That cover image is also the only illustration in the book. Author Akumi Agitogi is good enough that the novel is plenty visual even without the assistance of illustrations, and it's also not difficult to figure out the rough time period from clues given within the text, so this doesn't actually hinder reading. The world-building is also well done, with a familiar early twentieth century feel nicely offset by the few fantasy trappings that are worked in. Gifts are strictly psychic in nature, and there are some hints that Miyo may not be as Giftless as she is thought to be based on her mother's peculiar bloodline talents. There are also interesting ideas of Grotesqueries being a product of a pre-industrial society and Gifts being on their way out in a world that now has automobiles and other similar modern features, which is something that will hopefully continue to be developed in the next book(s).    My Happy Marriage isn't always an easy book, but it is a good one. Miyo's treatment at the hands of her family is appropriately horrible, Kiyoka is quietly dashing, and Miyo's slow growth into someone who knows she's not garbage is heartening, even if it is occasionally difficult to read about. It's not a light romance, but if you don't mind that, it's worth checking out.

Review   by Rebecca Silverman, Apr 16th 2022       My Happy Marriage Novel 1                     Synopsis:             Miyo Saimori is the eldest daughter of the noble Saimori family, but as the un-Gifted daughter of her father's despised first wife, she's treated like a servant by her stepmother and half-sister. When escape comes in the form of being offered in marriage to the infamously cold Kiyoka Kudou, Miyo barely has enough left in her to hope, assuming that because she lacks Spirit-Sight she'll be rejected and die on the streets as her parents intended. But contrary to everyone's expectations, Miyo is not universally loathed, and her betrothal offers her the most precious chance of all: to learn to stop hating herself.      Review:         Synopsis:        Miyo Saimori is the eldest daughter of the noble Saimori family, but as the un-Gifted daughter of her father's despised first wife, she's treated like a servant by her stepmother and half-sister. When escape comes in the form of being offered in marriage to the infamously cold Kiyoka Kudou, Miyo barely has enough left in her to hope, assuming that because she lacks Spirit-Sight she'll be rejected and die on the streets as her parents intended. But contrary to everyone's expectations, Miyo is not universally loathed, and her betrothal offers her the most precious chance of all: to learn to stop hating herself.     Review:            Set in an alternate version of the late Meiji or early Taisho era, My Happy Marriage is a fairly classic take on the Cinderella story – especially if you remember that in many, if not most, variants of that tale Cinderella's father is alive and well and just watching his second wife abuse his daughter. That's the life that Miyo Saimori has been living for almost all of her nineteen years; her parents were forced into an arranged marriage despite her father being in love with another woman, and when her mother died, her father quickly married his first love, upon which both he and his second wife transferred their anger onto Miyo. To make matters even worse, Miyo lacked the one quality that her parents were married for in the first place: a special power known as the Gift of Spirit-Sight. The birth of their child, Miyo's three-years-younger half-sister Kaya, certainly didn't help, and by the time Miyo turned ten she was more or less kicked out of a family circle that barely accepted her to begin with.    Plenty of light novel heroines start life in a similar fashion, with recent (in translation) examples being I'll Never Set Foot in That House Again! and A Fairy Tale for Wizards, but in most cases the torment ends the moment the heroine is rescued. That is not the case for this story, and Miyo's PTSD from the treatment she received at her family home is a major theme of the novel; just because she's no longer under the Saimori roof doesn't mean that she's magically cured of the trauma caused by years of emotional and physical abuse. While that can be hard to read, it's also a point in the book's favor because it gives Miyo something real to develop as a character. There's no magical fix for her emotional issues, as her fiancé and his elderly servant quickly find out. The only things that will help Miyo to heal are kindness and time, and while this doesn't necessarily make her the most engaging protagonist, it lends an appreciable thread of reality to this story of Grotesqueries (spirits and demons). Not that fantasy romances are strictly required to be realistic, but it's a good way to set My Happy Marriage apart from its brethren.    And it does have plenty of the hallmarks of fantasy romance that readers of the genre have come to expect. Mostly those are concentrated in Kiyoka Kudou, Miyo's fiancé. Physically gorgeous, Kiyoka has a reputation for being incredibly cold and possibly cruel. The most talented Gifted of his generation, he heads up a special army unit for Gifted soldiers, and his hard-working personality is often misinterpreted as curmudgeonly. Naturally, that's not the case – he's just really not good at things like “emotions” and “not working,” but his personality is such that few of the spoiled young noblewomen his father has affianced him to are bothered to see that. Since Miyo doesn't expect anyone to be nice to her, she's not bothered by his attitude – but he is upset by hers, which is cringing and fearful in every single interaction they have. Fortunately for the story, he's not stupid, and neither is Yurie, his longtime servant. The two of them quickly figure out that something was very wrong in the Saimori household when Miyo was living there, and from there they begin to take steps to help Miyo regain a sense of self-worth and confidence.    To say it's an uphill battle would be understating the matter, and in some ways this can feel like a very long short book. (It's under 200 pages.) While Miyo's beaten-down reactions and personality make absolutely perfect sense, they can be very difficult to read about because she is so damaged by her experiences. Whether you feel sorry for her, frustrated with all of the characters, or furious with her family (or all three with some bonus emotions thrown in for good measure), there are definitely times when putting down the book and walking away is the best way to finish reading it. It's a good, well-written story (despite the odd fact that the title and chapter titles are in first person while the text is in third person), but it's also as far from light and fluffy as you can get in a romance, and both the cheery title and the gorgeous cover illustration can make the darkness of the plot difficult to realize. It's worth sticking it out, but it's not always easy to do so.    That cover image is also the only illustration in the book. Author Akumi Agitogi is good enough that the novel is plenty visual even without the assistance of illustrations, and it's also not difficult to figure out the rough time period from clues given within the text, so this doesn't actually hinder reading. The world-building is also well done, with a familiar early twentieth century feel nicely offset by the few fantasy trappings that are worked in. Gifts are strictly psychic in nature, and there are some hints that Miyo may not be as Giftless as she is thought to be based on her mother's peculiar bloodline talents. There are also interesting ideas of Grotesqueries being a product of a pre-industrial society and Gifts being on their way out in a world that now has automobiles and other similar modern features, which is something that will hopefully continue to be developed in the next book(s).    My Happy Marriage isn't always an easy book, but it is a good one. Miyo's treatment at the hands of her family is appropriately horrible, Kiyoka is quietly dashing, and Miyo's slow growth into someone who knows she's not garbage is heartening, even if it is occasionally difficult to read about.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Tomodachi Game   Apr  6th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Tomodachi Game ?                     Community score: 2.9              What is this?   Yūichi Katagiri, a young man with a perfect student life who has four friends with difficult lives. His peaceful daily life comes to an end when 2 million yen (about US$20,000) in school trip fees goes missing. Riddles unfold as Yūichi gets caught up in a mysterious game for money and must decide whether friendship or money matters more.    Tomodachi Game is based on Yuki Sato's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                Any time a survival game anime pops up during Preview Guide, I get a little anxious. Not because I dislike the genre or anything—Danganronpa is one of my favorite franchises, as it so happens. The problem is that, for every smash hit like Danganronpa, it feels like there are a dozen would-be imitators that keep trying (and failing) to find new and fresh ways to mess with murder/betrayal/escape-room formula. To put it bluntly, a lot of survival game anime kind of suck. Tomodachi Game doesn't exactly suck, and there are even elements of this premiere that I find fairly interesting, but the overall package is just so wrapped up in tired clichés and mediocre presentation that it's hard to muster up enough energy to care one way or the other.    I'll give it this, though: It's nice that Yuichi and all of the other contestants of this weird game were all friends first. There's no amnesia, no cadre of bizarrely coifed and cartoonishly rendered strangers who all have to monologue about their backstories one after the other. The angle that Tomodachi Game is exploring is a tried and true one, but it's effective nonetheless. It asks, “How well do you really know your best friends? And how much pressure would it take, financial or otherwise, before the masks come off and even the closest of companions turn on each other?”    It's just a shame the game being used to exploit this premise is so ludicrously overcomplicated, not to mention heavy-handed as all hell. You know what makes an interesting thriller premise like the one above a lot less interesting? When a cast of vaguely defined characters are forced to participate in an inane game-show that is designed to have every single element of their experience literally scream, over and over, “CAN YOU TRUST YOUR FRIENDS? HUH? I BETCHA CAN'T!!” It kind of ruins the experience.    Don't get me started on the knockoff Monokuma, either. I get that all of these survival game anime feel obligated to include a “wacky"" mascot character, but they really shouldn't try so goddamned hard just because Danganronpa and Assassination Classroom made bank on the concept. And no, I don't even care that Manabu-kun is actually voiced by the actress who played actual Danganronpa protagonist Hajime Hinata. I hate the little creep. He's goofy-looking and obnoxious, and the show does a terrible job of blending the interactions of the CG character model with his 2D counterparts. Every time Manabu was onscreen, I wanted to see someone toss him straight out of a window and into oncoming traffic.    Worst of all, I feel like I'm going to see most of the “shocking"" and “edgy"" twists of this story coming well in advance, so, unless something positively wild and unheard of is yet to come in this story, I'm happy to give Tomodachi Game a pass. There have been other, better riffs on this formula over the years, and I'd rather revisit those than stick it out with a mediocre-seeming also-ran like this one. I'm going to call it right now, though, with absolutely no prior knowledge of the series or anything: It was the meek girl that got all of the friends roped into the game. I bet she's also secretly a psycho yandere. Hit me up in a few weeks if it turns out that I'm right.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               In general, I enjoy anime that focus on high-stakes, psychological games—be they death games or more gambling-focused ones. However, Tomodachi Game didn't excite me at all. When watching an anime set in a well-established genre, there is one question always at the back of my mind: What sets this show apart?  In the case of Tomodachi Game, the answer is ""nothing."" It's totally bland.    The characters, at this point, are surface layer clichés. We have the uptight beauty, the cute girl, the serious one, and the frivolous playboy. Even the main character is little more than ""the poor kid."" The result is Kakegurui without a Yumeko—a show with drama but no one for the audience to care about on a personal level.    Yet, even that drama is lackluster. Not only does the show reveal the masterminds behind the curtain way too easily, but their lackluster commentary in no way replaces the tension that comes from having no idea what is going on behind the scenes. Then there are the constant blink-and-you'll-miss-it text dumps on screen that require you to pause to read. This effectively hamstrings the show's pacing. But even worse, it obliterates the audience's sense of immersion. You can't just sit back and lose yourself in the world Tomodachi Game is trying to create: you've got to be ready to hit pause and read exposition at a moment's notice or miss out on vital information—like the literal rules of the game they are playing!    All that and the episode doesn't even manage to stick the landing. While the game itself is easy enough to understand, the lack of resolution within the first episode is a hindrance. After all, a cliffhanger only works if you care enough about the characters or story to want to come back next week. I don't.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Ah, emotional manipulation. Such a charming premise for any show, so why not make it even more lovely by throwing in a couple of random evil high school girls running a death game for groups of, specifically, five friends? Bonus points if it turns out that the entire thing was set up to point out the shoddy, self-serving nature of friendship, but it's the girls running the game who learn a little something about true friendship along the way instead!    Despite that opening paragraph, my main issue with Tomodachi Game really isn't its premise. Survival games have been a staple of fiction since at LEAST The Most Dangerous Game, and very likely before then if I could be bothered to remember any. Likewise the idea of how trustworthy your so-called friends are is one of the founding principles of certain YA subgenres, so the show is on fairly solid ground with its group of five pals who are tased into a strange white space that turns out to be someone's twisted playground. Starting things off with stolen money for a field trip also works decently well, even if one of the group was the one who's most likely to suffer for the loss and two others are among those most likely to have taken it in the first place. (In reality, I suspect that the girls running the game are responsible.) Where things falter is in the execution of the story, which seems to be a bit of a theme for today's episodes. The main problem is that we barely know these kids and no effort is expended to remedy that situation. In fact, a card with their names and their basic stereotypes is displayed at one point, letting us know precisely which genre trope everyone fits into. (That I then spent the rest of the episode being disturbed that baby-voiced, utterly helpless Kokorogi was labeled “the sexy one” is an entirely different issue.) This makes the matter of who survives and who dies not all that compelling of an issue, because not only do we not like any of them, we don't KNOW any of them. At this point I'm voting for Tenoji to go first because his hair looks like someone took a bite out of it and that annoys me unreasonably.    The survival game genre isn't impossible to do well. It's perhaps not even particularly difficult to do well. But Tomodachi Game seems hellbent on getting in its own way as much as possible with its paltry introductions, explanations that go between “too much” and “not enough,” and some very lackluster visuals. Unless you love the genre and will consume all forms of it, maybe give this a pass.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               I give isekai shows a lot of guff for being simultaneously ubiquitous and dull, but if there's one genre that can eclipse even that otherworldly monolith in pure tedium, it's death games. One of my biggest worries is the massive success of Squid Game bringing this already over-saturated story idea to the big stage. And while this show isn't strictly a death game – all that's currently at stake is money – it's just as much of a slog to get through as every other hackney edgelord parade that tries to come up with a new spin on the prisoner's dilemma.    The biggest reason for that is just how undercooked the “Tomodachi” part of its title is. This is meant to be a dark and gritty look at how five dear and loving friends can be pushed to betray each other for money, but the central friendships of the group are basically nonexistent. We get all of one scene of the five characters talking before they're thrown into this low-rent Kakegurui ripoff, so watching their tenuous friendship fall apart while they play the most obviously rigged game on the planet just isn't dramatic. These are people we've gotten to know mainly through a single screen of text explaining their personalities to us, and none of them have strong enough personalities to overcome that and make this whole ordeal interesting. When they start betraying each other it doesn't mean anything because none of them are real characters, so the entire tension of this game falls flat.    I'm also just so, so tired of every one of these having to bark up the same tree. Every single one of these things thinks they need their own Monokuma, but once you've seen a couple creepy-cute mascot characters who are secretly ~evil~ it loses its impact. As such, all the CG anime mascot character amounts to is a squeaky-voiced exposition machine with zero impact. Add in the random overseer girls who have to comment on everything from their surveillance room, smugly laughing about how their totally devious mind games will ruin another friendship and you have a story that's so insufferably impressed with its cut-rate edginess that finishing the episode is a feat of endurance.    The one and only bright spot of this premiere is in the very final moments, where it seems like our hapless protagonist has come up with some kind of plan to outsmart the Kokkuri-san game that his friends have all purposefully bought into. That, at least, could be a novel twist to this whole setup – our hero having to 4D-Chess his way into making his friends all play fair so they can clear their debts together, forcing a happy ending in the face of obvious psychological manipulation. I have very little faith that's where the show will actually go, but it would at least be a spin on this scenario that I haven't seen done a million times. It's still not enough to make watch more of this charmless bore, but it's something, I guess.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review                Odd Taxi: In the Woods   Apr 17, 00:00                 anime    By cleverly reframing its narrative around a series of interviews with the supporting cast, Odd Taxi: In the Woods succeeds where most recap films fail: it's an artistically cohesive film in its own right. ― Odd Taxi was 2021's sleeper anime hit, telling an intricate, original mystery that kept viewers guessing every week.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Tomodachi Game   Apr  6th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Tomodachi Game ?                     Community score: 2.9              What is this?   Yūichi Katagiri, a young man with a perfect student life who has four friends with difficult lives. His peaceful daily life comes to an end when 2 million yen (about US$20,000) in school trip fees goes missing. Riddles unfold as Yūichi gets caught up in a mysterious game for money and must decide whether friendship or money matters more.    Tomodachi Game is based on Yuki Sato's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                Any time a survival game anime pops up during Preview Guide, I get a little anxious. Not because I dislike the genre or anything—Danganronpa is one of my favorite franchises, as it so happens. The problem is that, for every smash hit like Danganronpa, it feels like there are a dozen would-be imitators that keep trying (and failing) to find new and fresh ways to mess with murder/betrayal/escape-room formula. To put it bluntly, a lot of survival game anime kind of suck. Tomodachi Game doesn't exactly suck, and there are even elements of this premiere that I find fairly interesting, but the overall package is just so wrapped up in tired clichés and mediocre presentation that it's hard to muster up enough energy to care one way or the other.    I'll give it this, though: It's nice that Yuichi and all of the other contestants of this weird game were all friends first. There's no amnesia, no cadre of bizarrely coifed and cartoonishly rendered strangers who all have to monologue about their backstories one after the other. The angle that Tomodachi Game is exploring is a tried and true one, but it's effective nonetheless. It asks, “How well do you really know your best friends? And how much pressure would it take, financial or otherwise, before the masks come off and even the closest of companions turn on each other?”    It's just a shame the game being used to exploit this premise is so ludicrously overcomplicated, not to mention heavy-handed as all hell. You know what makes an interesting thriller premise like the one above a lot less interesting? When a cast of vaguely defined characters are forced to participate in an inane game-show that is designed to have every single element of their experience literally scream, over and over, “CAN YOU TRUST YOUR FRIENDS? HUH? I BETCHA CAN'T!!” It kind of ruins the experience.    Don't get me started on the knockoff Monokuma, either. I get that all of these survival game anime feel obligated to include a “wacky"" mascot character, but they really shouldn't try so goddamned hard just because Danganronpa and Assassination Classroom made bank on the concept. And no, I don't even care that Manabu-kun is actually voiced by the actress who played actual Danganronpa protagonist Hajime Hinata. I hate the little creep. He's goofy-looking and obnoxious, and the show does a terrible job of blending the interactions of the CG character model with his 2D counterparts. Every time Manabu was onscreen, I wanted to see someone toss him straight out of a window and into oncoming traffic.    Worst of all, I feel like I'm going to see most of the “shocking"" and “edgy"" twists of this story coming well in advance, so, unless something positively wild and unheard of is yet to come in this story, I'm happy to give Tomodachi Game a pass. There have been other, better riffs on this formula over the years, and I'd rather revisit those than stick it out with a mediocre-seeming also-ran like this one. I'm going to call it right now, though, with absolutely no prior knowledge of the series or anything: It was the meek girl that got all of the friends roped into the game. I bet she's also secretly a psycho yandere. Hit me up in a few weeks if it turns out that I'm right.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               In general, I enjoy anime that focus on high-stakes, psychological games—be they death games or more gambling-focused ones. However, Tomodachi Game didn't excite me at all. When watching an anime set in a well-established genre, there is one question always at the back of my mind: What sets this show apart?  In the case of Tomodachi Game, the answer is ""nothing."" It's totally bland.    The characters, at this point, are surface layer clichés. We have the uptight beauty, the cute girl, the serious one, and the frivolous playboy. Even the main character is little more than ""the poor kid."" The result is Kakegurui without a Yumeko—a show with drama but no one for the audience to care about on a personal level.    Yet, even that drama is lackluster. Not only does the show reveal the masterminds behind the curtain way too easily, but their lackluster commentary in no way replaces the tension that comes from having no idea what is going on behind the scenes. Then there are the constant blink-and-you'll-miss-it text dumps on screen that require you to pause to read. This effectively hamstrings the show's pacing. But even worse, it obliterates the audience's sense of immersion. You can't just sit back and lose yourself in the world Tomodachi Game is trying to create: you've got to be ready to hit pause and read exposition at a moment's notice or miss out on vital information—like the literal rules of the game they are playing!    All that and the episode doesn't even manage to stick the landing. While the game itself is easy enough to understand, the lack of resolution within the first episode is a hindrance. After all, a cliffhanger only works if you care enough about the characters or story to want to come back next week. I don't.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Ah, emotional manipulation. Such a charming premise for any show, so why not make it even more lovely by throwing in a couple of random evil high school girls running a death game for groups of, specifically, five friends? Bonus points if it turns out that the entire thing was set up to point out the shoddy, self-serving nature of friendship, but it's the girls running the game who learn a little something about true friendship along the way instead!    Despite that opening paragraph, my main issue with Tomodachi Game really isn't its premise. Survival games have been a staple of fiction since at LEAST The Most Dangerous Game, and very likely before then if I could be bothered to remember any. Likewise the idea of how trustworthy your so-called friends are is one of the founding principles of certain YA subgenres, so the show is on fairly solid ground with its group of five pals who are tased into a strange white space that turns out to be someone's twisted playground. Starting things off with stolen money for a field trip also works decently well, even if one of the group was the one who's most likely to suffer for the loss and two others are among those most likely to have taken it in the first place. (In reality, I suspect that the girls running the game are responsible.) Where things falter is in the execution of the story, which seems to be a bit of a theme for today's episodes. The main problem is that we barely know these kids and no effort is expended to remedy that situation. In fact, a card with their names and their basic stereotypes is displayed at one point, letting us know precisely which genre trope everyone fits into. (That I then spent the rest of the episode being disturbed that baby-voiced, utterly helpless Kokorogi was labeled “the sexy one” is an entirely different issue.) This makes the matter of who survives and who dies not all that compelling of an issue, because not only do we not like any of them, we don't KNOW any of them. At this point I'm voting for Tenoji to go first because his hair looks like someone took a bite out of it and that annoys me unreasonably.    The survival game genre isn't impossible to do well. It's perhaps not even particularly difficult to do well. But Tomodachi Game seems hellbent on getting in its own way as much as possible with its paltry introductions, explanations that go between “too much” and “not enough,” and some very lackluster visuals. Unless you love the genre and will consume all forms of it, maybe give this a pass.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               I give isekai shows a lot of guff for being simultaneously ubiquitous and dull, but if there's one genre that can eclipse even that otherworldly monolith in pure tedium, it's death games. One of my biggest worries is the massive success of Squid Game bringing this already over-saturated story idea to the big stage. And while this show isn't strictly a death game – all that's currently at stake is money – it's just as much of a slog to get through as every other hackney edgelord parade that tries to come up with a new spin on the prisoner's dilemma.    The biggest reason for that is just how undercooked the “Tomodachi” part of its title is. This is meant to be a dark and gritty look at how five dear and loving friends can be pushed to betray each other for money, but the central friendships of the group are basically nonexistent. We get all of one scene of the five characters talking before they're thrown into this low-rent Kakegurui ripoff, so watching their tenuous friendship fall apart while they play the most obviously rigged game on the planet just isn't dramatic. These are people we've gotten to know mainly through a single screen of text explaining their personalities to us, and none of them have strong enough personalities to overcome that and make this whole ordeal interesting. When they start betraying each other it doesn't mean anything because none of them are real characters, so the entire tension of this game falls flat.    I'm also just so, so tired of every one of these having to bark up the same tree. Every single one of these things thinks they need their own Monokuma, but once you've seen a couple creepy-cute mascot characters who are secretly ~evil~ it loses its impact. As such, all the CG anime mascot character amounts to is a squeaky-voiced exposition machine with zero impact. Add in the random overseer girls who have to comment on everything from their surveillance room, smugly laughing about how their totally devious mind games will ruin another friendship and you have a story that's so insufferably impressed with its cut-rate edginess that finishing the episode is a feat of endurance.    The one and only bright spot of this premiere is in the very final moments, where it seems like our hapless protagonist has come up with some kind of plan to outsmart the Kokkuri-san game that his friends have all purposefully bought into. That, at least, could be a novel twist to this whole setup – our hero having to 4D-Chess his way into making his friends all play fair so they can clear their debts together, forcing a happy ending in the face of obvious psychological manipulation. I have very little faith that's where the show will actually go, but it would at least be a spin on this scenario that I haven't seen done a million times. It's still not enough to make watch more of this charmless bore, but it's something, I guess.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review                Odd Taxi: In the Woods   Apr 17, 00:00                 anime    By cleverly reframing its narrative around a series of interviews with the supporting cast, Odd Taxi: In the Woods succeeds where most recap films fail: it's an artistically cohesive film in its own right. ― Odd Taxi was 2021's sleeper anime hit, telling an intricate, original mystery that kept viewers guessing every week.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Tomodachi Game   Apr  6th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Tomodachi Game ?                     Community score: 2.9              What is this?   Yūichi Katagiri, a young man with a perfect student life who has four friends with difficult lives. His peaceful daily life comes to an end when 2 million yen (about US$20,000) in school trip fees goes missing. Riddles unfold as Yūichi gets caught up in a mysterious game for money and must decide whether friendship or money matters more.    Tomodachi Game is based on Yuki Sato's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                Any time a survival game anime pops up during Preview Guide, I get a little anxious. Not because I dislike the genre or anything—Danganronpa is one of my favorite franchises, as it so happens. The problem is that, for every smash hit like Danganronpa, it feels like there are a dozen would-be imitators that keep trying (and failing) to find new and fresh ways to mess with murder/betrayal/escape-room formula. To put it bluntly, a lot of survival game anime kind of suck. Tomodachi Game doesn't exactly suck, and there are even elements of this premiere that I find fairly interesting, but the overall package is just so wrapped up in tired clichés and mediocre presentation that it's hard to muster up enough energy to care one way or the other.    I'll give it this, though: It's nice that Yuichi and all of the other contestants of this weird game were all friends first. There's no amnesia, no cadre of bizarrely coifed and cartoonishly rendered strangers who all have to monologue about their backstories one after the other. The angle that Tomodachi Game is exploring is a tried and true one, but it's effective nonetheless. It asks, “How well do you really know your best friends? And how much pressure would it take, financial or otherwise, before the masks come off and even the closest of companions turn on each other?”    It's just a shame the game being used to exploit this premise is so ludicrously overcomplicated, not to mention heavy-handed as all hell. You know what makes an interesting thriller premise like the one above a lot less interesting? When a cast of vaguely defined characters are forced to participate in an inane game-show that is designed to have every single element of their experience literally scream, over and over, “CAN YOU TRUST YOUR FRIENDS? HUH? I BETCHA CAN'T!!” It kind of ruins the experience.    Don't get me started on the knockoff Monokuma, either. I get that all of these survival game anime feel obligated to include a “wacky"" mascot character, but they really shouldn't try so goddamned hard just because Danganronpa and Assassination Classroom made bank on the concept. And no, I don't even care that Manabu-kun is actually voiced by the actress who played actual Danganronpa protagonist Hajime Hinata. I hate the little creep. He's goofy-looking and obnoxious, and the show does a terrible job of blending the interactions of the CG character model with his 2D counterparts. Every time Manabu was onscreen, I wanted to see someone toss him straight out of a window and into oncoming traffic.    Worst of all, I feel like I'm going to see most of the “shocking"" and “edgy"" twists of this story coming well in advance, so, unless something positively wild and unheard of is yet to come in this story, I'm happy to give Tomodachi Game a pass. There have been other, better riffs on this formula over the years, and I'd rather revisit those than stick it out with a mediocre-seeming also-ran like this one. I'm going to call it right now, though, with absolutely no prior knowledge of the series or anything: It was the meek girl that got all of the friends roped into the game. I bet she's also secretly a psycho yandere. Hit me up in a few weeks if it turns out that I'm right.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               In general, I enjoy anime that focus on high-stakes, psychological games—be they death games or more gambling-focused ones. However, Tomodachi Game didn't excite me at all. When watching an anime set in a well-established genre, there is one question always at the back of my mind: What sets this show apart?  In the case of Tomodachi Game, the answer is ""nothing."" It's totally bland.    The characters, at this point, are surface layer clichés. We have the uptight beauty, the cute girl, the serious one, and the frivolous playboy. Even the main character is little more than ""the poor kid."" The result is Kakegurui without a Yumeko—a show with drama but no one for the audience to care about on a personal level.    Yet, even that drama is lackluster. Not only does the show reveal the masterminds behind the curtain way too easily, but their lackluster commentary in no way replaces the tension that comes from having no idea what is going on behind the scenes. Then there are the constant blink-and-you'll-miss-it text dumps on screen that require you to pause to read. This effectively hamstrings the show's pacing. But even worse, it obliterates the audience's sense of immersion. You can't just sit back and lose yourself in the world Tomodachi Game is trying to create: you've got to be ready to hit pause and read exposition at a moment's notice or miss out on vital information—like the literal rules of the game they are playing!    All that and the episode doesn't even manage to stick the landing. While the game itself is easy enough to understand, the lack of resolution within the first episode is a hindrance. After all, a cliffhanger only works if you care enough about the characters or story to want to come back next week. I don't.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Ah, emotional manipulation. Such a charming premise for any show, so why not make it even more lovely by throwing in a couple of random evil high school girls running a death game for groups of, specifically, five friends? Bonus points if it turns out that the entire thing was set up to point out the shoddy, self-serving nature of friendship, but it's the girls running the game who learn a little something about true friendship along the way instead!    Despite that opening paragraph, my main issue with Tomodachi Game really isn't its premise. Survival games have been a staple of fiction since at LEAST The Most Dangerous Game, and very likely before then if I could be bothered to remember any. Likewise the idea of how trustworthy your so-called friends are is one of the founding principles of certain YA subgenres, so the show is on fairly solid ground with its group of five pals who are tased into a strange white space that turns out to be someone's twisted playground. Starting things off with stolen money for a field trip also works decently well, even if one of the group was the one who's most likely to suffer for the loss and two others are among those most likely to have taken it in the first place. (In reality, I suspect that the girls running the game are responsible.) Where things falter is in the execution of the story, which seems to be a bit of a theme for today's episodes. The main problem is that we barely know these kids and no effort is expended to remedy that situation. In fact, a card with their names and their basic stereotypes is displayed at one point, letting us know precisely which genre trope everyone fits into. (That I then spent the rest of the episode being disturbed that baby-voiced, utterly helpless Kokorogi was labeled “the sexy one” is an entirely different issue.) This makes the matter of who survives and who dies not all that compelling of an issue, because not only do we not like any of them, we don't KNOW any of them. At this point I'm voting for Tenoji to go first because his hair looks like someone took a bite out of it and that annoys me unreasonably.    The survival game genre isn't impossible to do well. It's perhaps not even particularly difficult to do well. But Tomodachi Game seems hellbent on getting in its own way as much as possible with its paltry introductions, explanations that go between “too much” and “not enough,” and some very lackluster visuals. Unless you love the genre and will consume all forms of it, maybe give this a pass.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               I give isekai shows a lot of guff for being simultaneously ubiquitous and dull, but if there's one genre that can eclipse even that otherworldly monolith in pure tedium, it's death games. One of my biggest worries is the massive success of Squid Game bringing this already over-saturated story idea to the big stage. And while this show isn't strictly a death game – all that's currently at stake is money – it's just as much of a slog to get through as every other hackney edgelord parade that tries to come up with a new spin on the prisoner's dilemma.    The biggest reason for that is just how undercooked the “Tomodachi” part of its title is. This is meant to be a dark and gritty look at how five dear and loving friends can be pushed to betray each other for money, but the central friendships of the group are basically nonexistent. We get all of one scene of the five characters talking before they're thrown into this low-rent Kakegurui ripoff, so watching their tenuous friendship fall apart while they play the most obviously rigged game on the planet just isn't dramatic. These are people we've gotten to know mainly through a single screen of text explaining their personalities to us, and none of them have strong enough personalities to overcome that and make this whole ordeal interesting. When they start betraying each other it doesn't mean anything because none of them are real characters, so the entire tension of this game falls flat.    I'm also just so, so tired of every one of these having to bark up the same tree. Every single one of these things thinks they need their own Monokuma, but once you've seen a couple creepy-cute mascot characters who are secretly ~evil~ it loses its impact. As such, all the CG anime mascot character amounts to is a squeaky-voiced exposition machine with zero impact. Add in the random overseer girls who have to comment on everything from their surveillance room, smugly laughing about how their totally devious mind games will ruin another friendship and you have a story that's so insufferably impressed with its cut-rate edginess that finishing the episode is a feat of endurance.    The one and only bright spot of this premiere is in the very final moments, where it seems like our hapless protagonist has come up with some kind of plan to outsmart the Kokkuri-san game that his friends have all purposefully bought into. That, at least, could be a novel twist to this whole setup – our hero having to 4D-Chess his way into making his friends all play fair so they can clear their debts together, forcing a happy ending in the face of obvious psychological manipulation. I have very little faith that's where the show will actually go, but it would at least be a spin on this scenario that I haven't seen done a million times. It's still not enough to make watch more of this charmless bore, but it's something, I guess.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review                Odd Taxi: In the Woods   Apr 17, 00:00                 anime    By cleverly reframing its narrative around a series of interviews with the supporting cast, Odd Taxi: In the Woods succeeds where most recap films fail: it's an artistically cohesive film in its own right. ― Odd Taxi was 2021's sleeper anime hit, telling an intricate, original mystery that kept viewers guessing every week.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Tomodachi Game   Apr  6th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Tomodachi Game ?                     Community score: 2.9              What is this?   Yūichi Katagiri, a young man with a perfect student life who has four friends with difficult lives. His peaceful daily life comes to an end when 2 million yen (about US$20,000) in school trip fees goes missing. Riddles unfold as Yūichi gets caught up in a mysterious game for money and must decide whether friendship or money matters more.    Tomodachi Game is based on Yuki Sato's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                Any time a survival game anime pops up during Preview Guide, I get a little anxious. Not because I dislike the genre or anything—Danganronpa is one of my favorite franchises, as it so happens. The problem is that, for every smash hit like Danganronpa, it feels like there are a dozen would-be imitators that keep trying (and failing) to find new and fresh ways to mess with murder/betrayal/escape-room formula. To put it bluntly, a lot of survival game anime kind of suck. Tomodachi Game doesn't exactly suck, and there are even elements of this premiere that I find fairly interesting, but the overall package is just so wrapped up in tired clichés and mediocre presentation that it's hard to muster up enough energy to care one way or the other.    I'll give it this, though: It's nice that Yuichi and all of the other contestants of this weird game were all friends first. There's no amnesia, no cadre of bizarrely coifed and cartoonishly rendered strangers who all have to monologue about their backstories one after the other. The angle that Tomodachi Game is exploring is a tried and true one, but it's effective nonetheless. It asks, “How well do you really know your best friends? And how much pressure would it take, financial or otherwise, before the masks come off and even the closest of companions turn on each other?”    It's just a shame the game being used to exploit this premise is so ludicrously overcomplicated, not to mention heavy-handed as all hell. You know what makes an interesting thriller premise like the one above a lot less interesting? When a cast of vaguely defined characters are forced to participate in an inane game-show that is designed to have every single element of their experience literally scream, over and over, “CAN YOU TRUST YOUR FRIENDS? HUH? I BETCHA CAN'T!!” It kind of ruins the experience.    Don't get me started on the knockoff Monokuma, either. I get that all of these survival game anime feel obligated to include a “wacky"" mascot character, but they really shouldn't try so goddamned hard just because Danganronpa and Assassination Classroom made bank on the concept. And no, I don't even care that Manabu-kun is actually voiced by the actress who played actual Danganronpa protagonist Hajime Hinata. I hate the little creep. He's goofy-looking and obnoxious, and the show does a terrible job of blending the interactions of the CG character model with his 2D counterparts. Every time Manabu was onscreen, I wanted to see someone toss him straight out of a window and into oncoming traffic.    Worst of all, I feel like I'm going to see most of the “shocking"" and “edgy"" twists of this story coming well in advance, so, unless something positively wild and unheard of is yet to come in this story, I'm happy to give Tomodachi Game a pass. There have been other, better riffs on this formula over the years, and I'd rather revisit those than stick it out with a mediocre-seeming also-ran like this one. I'm going to call it right now, though, with absolutely no prior knowledge of the series or anything: It was the meek girl that got all of the friends roped into the game. I bet she's also secretly a psycho yandere. Hit me up in a few weeks if it turns out that I'm right.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               In general, I enjoy anime that focus on high-stakes, psychological games—be they death games or more gambling-focused ones. However, Tomodachi Game didn't excite me at all. When watching an anime set in a well-established genre, there is one question always at the back of my mind: What sets this show apart?  In the case of Tomodachi Game, the answer is ""nothing."" It's totally bland.    The characters, at this point, are surface layer clichés. We have the uptight beauty, the cute girl, the serious one, and the frivolous playboy. Even the main character is little more than ""the poor kid."" The result is Kakegurui without a Yumeko—a show with drama but no one for the audience to care about on a personal level.    Yet, even that drama is lackluster. Not only does the show reveal the masterminds behind the curtain way too easily, but their lackluster commentary in no way replaces the tension that comes from having no idea what is going on behind the scenes. Then there are the constant blink-and-you'll-miss-it text dumps on screen that require you to pause to read. This effectively hamstrings the show's pacing. But even worse, it obliterates the audience's sense of immersion. You can't just sit back and lose yourself in the world Tomodachi Game is trying to create: you've got to be ready to hit pause and read exposition at a moment's notice or miss out on vital information—like the literal rules of the game they are playing!    All that and the episode doesn't even manage to stick the landing. While the game itself is easy enough to understand, the lack of resolution within the first episode is a hindrance. After all, a cliffhanger only works if you care enough about the characters or story to want to come back next week. I don't.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Ah, emotional manipulation. Such a charming premise for any show, so why not make it even more lovely by throwing in a couple of random evil high school girls running a death game for groups of, specifically, five friends? Bonus points if it turns out that the entire thing was set up to point out the shoddy, self-serving nature of friendship, but it's the girls running the game who learn a little something about true friendship along the way instead!    Despite that opening paragraph, my main issue with Tomodachi Game really isn't its premise. Survival games have been a staple of fiction since at LEAST The Most Dangerous Game, and very likely before then if I could be bothered to remember any. Likewise the idea of how trustworthy your so-called friends are is one of the founding principles of certain YA subgenres, so the show is on fairly solid ground with its group of five pals who are tased into a strange white space that turns out to be someone's twisted playground. Starting things off with stolen money for a field trip also works decently well, even if one of the group was the one who's most likely to suffer for the loss and two others are among those most likely to have taken it in the first place. (In reality, I suspect that the girls running the game are responsible.) Where things falter is in the execution of the story, which seems to be a bit of a theme for today's episodes. The main problem is that we barely know these kids and no effort is expended to remedy that situation. In fact, a card with their names and their basic stereotypes is displayed at one point, letting us know precisely which genre trope everyone fits into. (That I then spent the rest of the episode being disturbed that baby-voiced, utterly helpless Kokorogi was labeled “the sexy one” is an entirely different issue.) This makes the matter of who survives and who dies not all that compelling of an issue, because not only do we not like any of them, we don't KNOW any of them. At this point I'm voting for Tenoji to go first because his hair looks like someone took a bite out of it and that annoys me unreasonably.    The survival game genre isn't impossible to do well. It's perhaps not even particularly difficult to do well. But Tomodachi Game seems hellbent on getting in its own way as much as possible with its paltry introductions, explanations that go between “too much” and “not enough,” and some very lackluster visuals. Unless you love the genre and will consume all forms of it, maybe give this a pass.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               I give isekai shows a lot of guff for being simultaneously ubiquitous and dull, but if there's one genre that can eclipse even that otherworldly monolith in pure tedium, it's death games. One of my biggest worries is the massive success of Squid Game bringing this already over-saturated story idea to the big stage. And while this show isn't strictly a death game – all that's currently at stake is money – it's just as much of a slog to get through as every other hackney edgelord parade that tries to come up with a new spin on the prisoner's dilemma.    The biggest reason for that is just how undercooked the “Tomodachi” part of its title is. This is meant to be a dark and gritty look at how five dear and loving friends can be pushed to betray each other for money, but the central friendships of the group are basically nonexistent. We get all of one scene of the five characters talking before they're thrown into this low-rent Kakegurui ripoff, so watching their tenuous friendship fall apart while they play the most obviously rigged game on the planet just isn't dramatic. These are people we've gotten to know mainly through a single screen of text explaining their personalities to us, and none of them have strong enough personalities to overcome that and make this whole ordeal interesting. When they start betraying each other it doesn't mean anything because none of them are real characters, so the entire tension of this game falls flat.    I'm also just so, so tired of every one of these having to bark up the same tree. Every single one of these things thinks they need their own Monokuma, but once you've seen a couple creepy-cute mascot characters who are secretly ~evil~ it loses its impact. As such, all the CG anime mascot character amounts to is a squeaky-voiced exposition machine with zero impact. Add in the random overseer girls who have to comment on everything from their surveillance room, smugly laughing about how their totally devious mind games will ruin another friendship and you have a story that's so insufferably impressed with its cut-rate edginess that finishing the episode is a feat of endurance.    The one and only bright spot of this premiere is in the very final moments, where it seems like our hapless protagonist has come up with some kind of plan to outsmart the Kokkuri-san game that his friends have all purposefully bought into. That, at least, could be a novel twist to this whole setup – our hero having to 4D-Chess his way into making his friends all play fair so they can clear their debts together, forcing a happy ending in the face of obvious psychological manipulation. I have very little faith that's where the show will actually go, but it would at least be a spin on this scenario that I haven't seen done a million times. It's still not enough to make watch more of this charmless bore, but it's something, I guess.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review                Odd Taxi: In the Woods   Apr 17, 00:00                 anime    By cleverly reframing its narrative around a series of interviews with the supporting cast, Odd Taxi: In the Woods succeeds where most recap films fail: it's an artistically cohesive film in its own right. ― Odd Taxi was 2021's sleeper anime hit, telling an intricate, original mystery that kept viewers guessing every week.

And no, I don't even care that Manabu-kun is actually voiced by the actress who played actual Danganronpa protagonist Hajime Hinata. I hate the little creep. He's goofy-looking and obnoxious, and the show does a terrible job of blending the interactions of the CG character model with his 2D counterparts. Every time Manabu was onscreen, I wanted to see someone toss him straight out of a window and into oncoming traffic.    Worst of all, I feel like I'm going to see most of the “shocking"" and “edgy"" twists of this story coming well in advance, so, unless something positively wild and unheard of is yet to come in this story, I'm happy to give Tomodachi Game a pass. There have been other, better riffs on this formula over the years, and I'd rather revisit those than stick it out with a mediocre-seeming also-ran like this one. I'm going to call it right now, though, with absolutely no prior knowledge of the series or anything: It was the meek girl that got all of the friends roped into the game. I bet she's also secretly a psycho yandere. Hit me up in a few weeks if it turns out that I'm right.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               In general, I enjoy anime that focus on high-stakes, psychological games—be they death games or more gambling-focused ones. However, Tomodachi Game didn't excite me at all. When watching an anime set in a well-established genre, there is one question always at the back of my mind: What sets this show apart?  In the case of Tomodachi Game, the answer is ""nothing."" It's totally bland.    The characters, at this point, are surface layer clichés. We have the uptight beauty, the cute girl, the serious one, and the frivolous playboy. Even the main character is little more than ""the poor kid."" The result is Kakegurui without a Yumeko—a show with drama but no one for the audience to care about on a personal level.    Yet, even that drama is lackluster. Not only does the show reveal the masterminds behind the curtain way too easily, but their lackluster commentary in no way replaces the tension that comes from having no idea what is going on behind the scenes. Then there are the constant blink-and-you'll-miss-it text dumps on screen that require you to pause to read. This effectively hamstrings the show's pacing. But even worse, it obliterates the audience's sense of immersion. You can't just sit back and lose yourself in the world Tomodachi Game is trying to create: you've got to be ready to hit pause and read exposition at a moment's notice or miss out on vital information—like the literal rules of the game they are playing!    All that and the episode doesn't even manage to stick the landing. While the game itself is easy enough to understand, the lack of resolution within the first episode is a hindrance. After all, a cliffhanger only works if you care enough about the characters or story to want to come back next week. I don't.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Ah, emotional manipulation. Such a charming premise for any show, so why not make it even more lovely by throwing in a couple of random evil high school girls running a death game for groups of, specifically, five friends? Bonus points if it turns out that the entire thing was set up to point out the shoddy, self-serving nature of friendship, but it's the girls running the game who learn a little something about true friendship along the way instead!    Despite that opening paragraph, my main issue with Tomodachi Game really isn't its premise. Survival games have been a staple of fiction since at LEAST The Most Dangerous Game, and very likely before then if I could be bothered to remember any. Likewise the idea of how trustworthy your so-called friends are is one of the founding principles of certain YA subgenres, so the show is on fairly solid ground with its group of five pals who are tased into a strange white space that turns out to be someone's twisted playground. Starting things off with stolen money for a field trip also works decently well, even if one of the group was the one who's most likely to suffer for the loss and two others are among those most likely to have taken it in the first place. (In reality, I suspect that the girls running the game are responsible.) Where things falter is in the execution of the story, which seems to be a bit of a theme for today's episodes. The main problem is that we barely know these kids and no effort is expended to remedy that situation. In fact, a card with their names and their basic stereotypes is displayed at one point, letting us know precisely which genre trope everyone fits into. (That I then spent the rest of the episode being disturbed that baby-voiced, utterly helpless Kokorogi was labeled “the sexy one” is an entirely different issue.) This makes the matter of who survives and who dies not all that compelling of an issue, because not only do we not like any of them, we don't KNOW any of them. At this point I'm voting for Tenoji to go first because his hair looks like someone took a bite out of it and that annoys me unreasonably.    The survival game genre isn't impossible to do well. It's perhaps not even particularly difficult to do well. But Tomodachi Game seems hellbent on getting in its own way as much as possible with its paltry introductions, explanations that go between “too much” and “not enough,” and some very lackluster visuals. Unless you love the genre and will consume all forms of it, maybe give this a pass.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               I give isekai shows a lot of guff for being simultaneously ubiquitous and dull, but if there's one genre that can eclipse even that otherworldly monolith in pure tedium, it's death games. One of my biggest worries is the massive success of Squid Game bringing this already over-saturated story idea to the big stage. And while this show isn't strictly a death game – all that's currently at stake is money – it's just as much of a slog to get through as every other hackney edgelord parade that tries to come up with a new spin on the prisoner's dilemma.    The biggest reason for that is just how undercooked the “Tomodachi” part of its title is. This is meant to be a dark and gritty look at how five dear and loving friends can be pushed to betray each other for money, but the central friendships of the group are basically nonexistent. We get all of one scene of the five characters talking before they're thrown into this low-rent Kakegurui ripoff, so watching their tenuous friendship fall apart while they play the most obviously rigged game on the planet just isn't dramatic. These are people we've gotten to know mainly through a single screen of text explaining their personalities to us, and none of them have strong enough personalities to overcome that and make this whole ordeal interesting. When they start betraying each other it doesn't mean anything because none of them are real characters, so the entire tension of this game falls flat.    I'm also just so, so tired of every one of these having to bark up the same tree. Every single one of these things thinks they need their own Monokuma, but once you've seen a couple creepy-cute mascot characters who are secretly ~evil~ it loses its impact. As such, all the CG anime mascot character amounts to is a squeaky-voiced exposition machine with zero impact. Add in the random overseer girls who have to comment on everything from their surveillance room, smugly laughing about how their totally devious mind games will ruin another friendship and you have a story that's so insufferably impressed with its cut-rate edginess that finishing the episode is a feat of endurance.    The one and only bright spot of this premiere is in the very final moments, where it seems like our hapless protagonist has come up with some kind of plan to outsmart the Kokkuri-san game that his friends have all purposefully bought into. That, at least, could be a novel twist to this whole setup – our hero having to 4D-Chess his way into making his friends all play fair so they can clear their debts together, forcing a happy ending in the face of obvious psychological manipulation. I have very little faith that's where the show will actually go, but it would at least be a spin on this scenario that I haven't seen done a million times. It's still not enough to make watch more of this charmless bore, but it's something, I guess.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Tomodachi Game   Apr  6th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Tomodachi Game ?                     Community score: 2.9              What is this?   Yūichi Katagiri, a young man with a perfect student life who has four friends with difficult lives. His peaceful daily life comes to an end when 2 million yen (about US$20,000) in school trip fees goes missing. Riddles unfold as Yūichi gets caught up in a mysterious game for money and must decide whether friendship or money matters more.    Tomodachi Game is based on Yuki Sato's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                Any time a survival game anime pops up during Preview Guide, I get a little anxious. Not because I dislike the genre or anything—Danganronpa is one of my favorite franchises, as it so happens. The problem is that, for every smash hit like Danganronpa, it feels like there are a dozen would-be imitators that keep trying (and failing) to find new and fresh ways to mess with murder/betrayal/escape-room formula. To put it bluntly, a lot of survival game anime kind of suck. Tomodachi Game doesn't exactly suck, and there are even elements of this premiere that I find fairly interesting, but the overall package is just so wrapped up in tired clichés and mediocre presentation that it's hard to muster up enough energy to care one way or the other.    I'll give it this, though: It's nice that Yuichi and all of the other contestants of this weird game were all friends first. There's no amnesia, no cadre of bizarrely coifed and cartoonishly rendered strangers who all have to monologue about their backstories one after the other. The angle that Tomodachi Game is exploring is a tried and true one, but it's effective nonetheless. It asks, “How well do you really know your best friends? And how much pressure would it take, financial or otherwise, before the masks come off and even the closest of companions turn on each other?”    It's just a shame the game being used to exploit this premise is so ludicrously overcomplicated, not to mention heavy-handed as all hell. You know what makes an interesting thriller premise like the one above a lot less interesting? When a cast of vaguely defined characters are forced to participate in an inane game-show that is designed to have every single element of their experience literally scream, over and over, “CAN YOU TRUST YOUR FRIENDS? HUH? I BETCHA CAN'T!!” It kind of ruins the experience.    Don't get me started on the knockoff Monokuma, either. I get that all of these survival game anime feel obligated to include a “wacky"" mascot character, but they really shouldn't try so goddamned hard just because Danganronpa and Assassination Classroom made bank on the concept.

Community score: 2.9              What is this?   Yūichi Katagiri, a young man with a perfect student life who has four friends with difficult lives. His peaceful daily life comes to an end when 2 million yen (about US$20,000) in school trip fees goes missing. Riddles unfold as Yūichi gets caught up in a mysterious game for money and must decide whether friendship or money matters more.    Tomodachi Game is based on Yuki Sato's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                Any time a survival game anime pops up during Preview Guide, I get a little anxious. Not because I dislike the genre or anything—Danganronpa is one of my favorite franchises, as it so happens. The problem is that, for every smash hit like Danganronpa, it feels like there are a dozen would-be imitators that keep trying (and failing) to find new and fresh ways to mess with murder/betrayal/escape-room formula. To put it bluntly, a lot of survival game anime kind of suck. Tomodachi Game doesn't exactly suck, and there are even elements of this premiere that I find fairly interesting, but the overall package is just so wrapped up in tired clichés and mediocre presentation that it's hard to muster up enough energy to care one way or the other.    I'll give it this, though: It's nice that Yuichi and all of the other contestants of this weird game were all friends first. There's no amnesia, no cadre of bizarrely coifed and cartoonishly rendered strangers who all have to monologue about their backstories one after the other. The angle that Tomodachi Game is exploring is a tried and true one, but it's effective nonetheless. It asks, “How well do you really know your best friends? And how much pressure would it take, financial or otherwise, before the masks come off and even the closest of companions turn on each other?”    It's just a shame the game being used to exploit this premise is so ludicrously overcomplicated, not to mention heavy-handed as all hell. You know what makes an interesting thriller premise like the one above a lot less interesting? When a cast of vaguely defined characters are forced to participate in an inane game-show that is designed to have every single element of their experience literally scream, over and over, “CAN YOU TRUST YOUR FRIENDS? HUH? I BETCHA CAN'T!!” It kind of ruins the experience.    Don't get me started on the knockoff Monokuma, either. I get that all of these survival game anime feel obligated to include a “wacky"" mascot character, but they really shouldn't try so goddamned hard just because Danganronpa and Assassination Classroom made bank on the concept. And no, I don't even care that Manabu-kun is actually voiced by the actress who played actual Danganronpa protagonist Hajime Hinata. I hate the little creep. He's goofy-looking and obnoxious, and the show does a terrible job of blending the interactions of the CG character model with his 2D counterparts. Every time Manabu was onscreen, I wanted to see someone toss him straight out of a window and into oncoming traffic.    Worst of all, I feel like I'm going to see most of the “shocking"" and “edgy"" twists of this story coming well in advance, so, unless something positively wild and unheard of is yet to come in this story, I'm happy to give Tomodachi Game a pass. There have been other, better riffs on this formula over the years, and I'd rather revisit those than stick it out with a mediocre-seeming also-ran like this one. I'm going to call it right now, though, with absolutely no prior knowledge of the series or anything: It was the meek girl that got all of the friends roped into the game. I bet she's also secretly a psycho yandere. Hit me up in a few weeks if it turns out that I'm right.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               In general, I enjoy anime that focus on high-stakes, psychological games—be they death games or more gambling-focused ones. However, Tomodachi Game didn't excite me at all. When watching an anime set in a well-established genre, there is one question always at the back of my mind: What sets this show apart?  In the case of Tomodachi Game, the answer is ""nothing."" It's totally bland.    The characters, at this point, are surface layer clichés. We have the uptight beauty, the cute girl, the serious one, and the frivolous playboy. Even the main character is little more than ""the poor kid."" The result is Kakegurui without a Yumeko—a show with drama but no one for the audience to care about on a personal level.    Yet, even that drama is lackluster. Not only does the show reveal the masterminds behind the curtain way too easily, but their lackluster commentary in no way replaces the tension that comes from having no idea what is going on behind the scenes. Then there are the constant blink-and-you'll-miss-it text dumps on screen that require you to pause to read. This effectively hamstrings the show's pacing. But even worse, it obliterates the audience's sense of immersion. You can't just sit back and lose yourself in the world Tomodachi Game is trying to create: you've got to be ready to hit pause and read exposition at a moment's notice or miss out on vital information—like the literal rules of the game they are playing!    All that and the episode doesn't even manage to stick the landing. While the game itself is easy enough to understand, the lack of resolution within the first episode is a hindrance. After all, a cliffhanger only works if you care enough about the characters or story to want to come back next week. I don't.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Ah, emotional manipulation. Such a charming premise for any show, so why not make it even more lovely by throwing in a couple of random evil high school girls running a death game for groups of, specifically, five friends? Bonus points if it turns out that the entire thing was set up to point out the shoddy, self-serving nature of friendship, but it's the girls running the game who learn a little something about true friendship along the way instead!    Despite that opening paragraph, my main issue with Tomodachi Game really isn't its premise. Survival games have been a staple of fiction since at LEAST The Most Dangerous Game, and very likely before then if I could be bothered to remember any. Likewise the idea of how trustworthy your so-called friends are is one of the founding principles of certain YA subgenres, so the show is on fairly solid ground with its group of five pals who are tased into a strange white space that turns out to be someone's twisted playground. Starting things off with stolen money for a field trip also works decently well, even if one of the group was the one who's most likely to suffer for the loss and two others are among those most likely to have taken it in the first place. (In reality, I suspect that the girls running the game are responsible.) Where things falter is in the execution of the story, which seems to be a bit of a theme for today's episodes. The main problem is that we barely know these kids and no effort is expended to remedy that situation. In fact, a card with their names and their basic stereotypes is displayed at one point, letting us know precisely which genre trope everyone fits into. (That I then spent the rest of the episode being disturbed that baby-voiced, utterly helpless Kokorogi was labeled “the sexy one” is an entirely different issue.) This makes the matter of who survives and who dies not all that compelling of an issue, because not only do we not like any of them, we don't KNOW any of them. At this point I'm voting for Tenoji to go first because his hair looks like someone took a bite out of it and that annoys me unreasonably.    The survival game genre isn't impossible to do well. It's perhaps not even particularly difficult to do well. But Tomodachi Game seems hellbent on getting in its own way as much as possible with its paltry introductions, explanations that go between “too much” and “not enough,” and some very lackluster visuals. Unless you love the genre and will consume all forms of it, maybe give this a pass.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               I give isekai shows a lot of guff for being simultaneously ubiquitous and dull, but if there's one genre that can eclipse even that otherworldly monolith in pure tedium, it's death games. One of my biggest worries is the massive success of Squid Game bringing this already over-saturated story idea to the big stage. And while this show isn't strictly a death game – all that's currently at stake is money – it's just as much of a slog to get through as every other hackney edgelord parade that tries to come up with a new spin on the prisoner's dilemma.    The biggest reason for that is just how undercooked the “Tomodachi” part of its title is. This is meant to be a dark and gritty look at how five dear and loving friends can be pushed to betray each other for money, but the central friendships of the group are basically nonexistent. We get all of one scene of the five characters talking before they're thrown into this low-rent Kakegurui ripoff, so watching their tenuous friendship fall apart while they play the most obviously rigged game on the planet just isn't dramatic. These are people we've gotten to know mainly through a single screen of text explaining their personalities to us, and none of them have strong enough personalities to overcome that and make this whole ordeal interesting. When they start betraying each other it doesn't mean anything because none of them are real characters, so the entire tension of this game falls flat.    I'm also just so, so tired of every one of these having to bark up the same tree. Every single one of these things thinks they need their own Monokuma, but once you've seen a couple creepy-cute mascot characters who are secretly ~evil~ it loses its impact. As such, all the CG anime mascot character amounts to is a squeaky-voiced exposition machine with zero impact.

Despite that opening paragraph, my main issue with Tomodachi Game really isn't its premise. Survival games have been a staple of fiction since at LEAST The Most Dangerous Game, and very likely before then if I could be bothered to remember any. Likewise the idea of how trustworthy your so-called friends are is one of the founding principles of certain YA subgenres, so the show is on fairly solid ground with its group of five pals who are tased into a strange white space that turns out to be someone's twisted playground. Starting things off with stolen money for a field trip also works decently well, even if one of the group was the one who's most likely to suffer for the loss and two others are among those most likely to have taken it in the first place. (In reality, I suspect that the girls running the game are responsible.) Where things falter is in the execution of the story, which seems to be a bit of a theme for today's episodes. The main problem is that we barely know these kids and no effort is expended to remedy that situation. In fact, a card with their names and their basic stereotypes is displayed at one point, letting us know precisely which genre trope everyone fits into. (That I then spent the rest of the episode being disturbed that baby-voiced, utterly helpless Kokorogi was labeled “the sexy one” is an entirely different issue.) This makes the matter of who survives and who dies not all that compelling of an issue, because not only do we not like any of them, we don't KNOW any of them. At this point I'm voting for Tenoji to go first because his hair looks like someone took a bite out of it and that annoys me unreasonably.    The survival game genre isn't impossible to do well. It's perhaps not even particularly difficult to do well. But Tomodachi Game seems hellbent on getting in its own way as much as possible with its paltry introductions, explanations that go between “too much” and “not enough,” and some very lackluster visuals. Unless you love the genre and will consume all forms of it, maybe give this a pass.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               I give isekai shows a lot of guff for being simultaneously ubiquitous and dull, but if there's one genre that can eclipse even that otherworldly monolith in pure tedium, it's death games. One of my biggest worries is the massive success of Squid Game bringing this already over-saturated story idea to the big stage. And while this show isn't strictly a death game – all that's currently at stake is money – it's just as much of a slog to get through as every other hackney edgelord parade that tries to come up with a new spin on the prisoner's dilemma.    The biggest reason for that is just how undercooked the “Tomodachi” part of its title is. This is meant to be a dark and gritty look at how five dear and loving friends can be pushed to betray each other for money, but the central friendships of the group are basically nonexistent. We get all of one scene of the five characters talking before they're thrown into this low-rent Kakegurui ripoff, so watching their tenuous friendship fall apart while they play the most obviously rigged game on the planet just isn't dramatic. These are people we've gotten to know mainly through a single screen of text explaining their personalities to us, and none of them have strong enough personalities to overcome that and make this whole ordeal interesting. When they start betraying each other it doesn't mean anything because none of them are real characters, so the entire tension of this game falls flat.    I'm also just so, so tired of every one of these having to bark up the same tree. Every single one of these things thinks they need their own Monokuma, but once you've seen a couple creepy-cute mascot characters who are secretly ~evil~ it loses its impact. As such, all the CG anime mascot character amounts to is a squeaky-voiced exposition machine with zero impact. Add in the random overseer girls who have to comment on everything from their surveillance room, smugly laughing about how their totally devious mind games will ruin another friendship and you have a story that's so insufferably impressed with its cut-rate edginess that finishing the episode is a feat of endurance.    The one and only bright spot of this premiere is in the very final moments, where it seems like our hapless protagonist has come up with some kind of plan to outsmart the Kokkuri-san game that his friends have all purposefully bought into. That, at least, could be a novel twist to this whole setup – our hero having to 4D-Chess his way into making his friends all play fair so they can clear their debts together, forcing a happy ending in the face of obvious psychological manipulation. I have very little faith that's where the show will actually go, but it would at least be a spin on this scenario that I haven't seen done a million times. It's still not enough to make watch more of this charmless bore, but it's something, I guess.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives   ",negative,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 2.9              What is this?   Yūichi Katagiri, a young man with a perfect student life who has four friends with difficult lives. His peaceful daily life comes to an end when 2 million yen (about US$20,000) in school trip fees goes missing. Riddles unfold as Yūichi gets caught up in a mysterious game for money and must decide whether friendship or money matters more.    Tomodachi Game is based on Yuki Sato's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                Any time a survival game anime pops up during Preview Guide, I get a little anxious. Not because I dislike the genre or anything—Danganronpa is one of my favorite franchises, as it so happens. The problem is that, for every smash hit like Danganronpa, it feels like there are a dozen would-be imitators that keep trying (and failing) to find new and fresh ways to mess with murder/betrayal/escape-room formula. To put it bluntly, a lot of survival game anime kind of suck. Tomodachi Game doesn't exactly suck, and there are even elements of this premiere that I find fairly interesting, but the overall package is just so wrapped up in tired clichés and mediocre presentation that it's hard to muster up enough energy to care one way or the other.    I'll give it this, though: It's nice that Yuichi and all of the other contestants of this weird game were all friends first. There's no amnesia, no cadre of bizarrely coifed and cartoonishly rendered strangers who all have to monologue about their backstories one after the other. The angle that Tomodachi Game is exploring is a tried and true one, but it's effective nonetheless. It asks, “How well do you really know your best friends? And how much pressure would it take, financial or otherwise, before the masks come off and even the closest of companions turn on each other?”    It's just a shame the game being used to exploit this premise is so ludicrously overcomplicated, not to mention heavy-handed as all hell. You know what makes an interesting thriller premise like the one above a lot less interesting? When a cast of vaguely defined characters are forced to participate in an inane game-show that is designed to have every single element of their experience literally scream, over and over, “CAN YOU TRUST YOUR FRIENDS? HUH? I BETCHA CAN'T!!” It kind of ruins the experience.    Don't get me started on the knockoff Monokuma, either. I get that all of these survival game anime feel obligated to include a “wacky"" mascot character, but they really shouldn't try so goddamned hard just because Danganronpa and Assassination Classroom made bank on the concept. And no, I don't even care that Manabu-kun is actually voiced by the actress who played actual Danganronpa protagonist Hajime Hinata. I hate the little creep. He's goofy-looking and obnoxious, and the show does a terrible job of blending the interactions of the CG character model with his 2D counterparts. Every time Manabu was onscreen, I wanted to see someone toss him straight out of a window and into oncoming traffic.    Worst of all, I feel like I'm going to see most of the “shocking"" and “edgy"" twists of this story coming well in advance, so, unless something positively wild and unheard of is yet to come in this story, I'm happy to give Tomodachi Game a pass. There have been other, better riffs on this formula over the years, and I'd rather revisit those than stick it out with a mediocre-seeming also-ran like this one. I'm going to call it right now, though, with absolutely no prior knowledge of the series or anything: It was the meek girl that got all of the friends roped into the game. I bet she's also secretly a psycho yandere. Hit me up in a few weeks if it turns out that I'm right.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               In general, I enjoy anime that focus on high-stakes, psychological games—be they death games or more gambling-focused ones. However, Tomodachi Game didn't excite me at all. When watching an anime set in a well-established genre, there is one question always at the back of my mind: What sets this show apart?  In the case of Tomodachi Game, the answer is ""nothing."" It's totally bland.    The characters, at this point, are surface layer clichés. We have the uptight beauty, the cute girl, the serious one, and the frivolous playboy. Even the main character is little more than ""the poor kid."" The result is Kakegurui without a Yumeko—a show with drama but no one for the audience to care about on a personal level.    Yet, even that drama is lackluster. Not only does the show reveal the masterminds behind the curtain way too easily, but their lackluster commentary in no way replaces the tension that comes from having no idea what is going on behind the scenes. Then there are the constant blink-and-you'll-miss-it text dumps on screen that require you to pause to read. This effectively hamstrings the show's pacing. But even worse, it obliterates the audience's sense of immersion. You can't just sit back and lose yourself in the world Tomodachi Game is trying to create: you've got to be ready to hit pause and read exposition at a moment's notice or miss out on vital information—like the literal rules of the game they are playing!    All that and the episode doesn't even manage to stick the landing. While the game itself is easy enough to understand, the lack of resolution within the first episode is a hindrance. After all, a cliffhanger only works if you care enough about the characters or story to want to come back next week. I don't.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Ah, emotional manipulation.

Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest Season 2 Episode 12  by Christopher Farris, Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.4            I'd hardly call it the comeback of the century or anything, but it still seems pretty impressive how far the Arifureta anime has come since its incredibly iffy inception. After multiple studio switchovers and a first-season opening that seemed to misrepresent the tonal appeal of the series, here we've arrived at the wrap party for its second season, finishing in a mostly satisfying, effective way. While it's fine for me, I guess I mostly find myself hoping this has worked well for fans of the original work, ending up with a solid adaptation that supplements their appreciation for the novel after all. This isn't even the actual end for Arifureta either, as we've already got confirmation that there's an OVA coming later this year. Which makes sense, given that the story is hardly over by the point of this season finale. But much like Hajime's growth from a 'commonplace' weakling to an overpowered edgelord badass, the anime's glow-up from the murky, shambling mess it originally was into a perfectly serviceable little fantasy cartoon makes for an appreciable journey all its own.    Simply taking stock of the state of the product is appropriate enough at this stopping point, since so much of this season finale similarly spends its time consolidating the leftover pieces of the big blowout of the last few episodes. The biggest dangling thread is almost certainly the fate of Kaori, but as I was last week, the storyline is so assured that she'll be 'fine' that the characters straight-up turn to the camera and tell us that before sending Hajime over on a few other personal diversions. Instead, the actual biggest return on an emotional investment comes from Ai-Chan-Sensei, which probably isn't that surprising to anyone who's been paying attention through this arc, but is still nice to see just for a sense of completion.    Part of Ai-Sensei's focus here is necessarily on her processing the guilt over the people killed around and as a result of her in this battle. So she's got to come to terms with the church full of people she leveled, or the fact that Hiyama's demise, played somewhat flippantly as it occurred last episode, was still an instance of one of her students dying, so she's a bit tore up by that as well. What's nice here is that Hajime's contribution to talking Sensei through these feelings isn't to insist on his personal method of burying any trauma beneath a badass facade, but instead advising her to hold onto the weight and importance of that guilt. The association he asks for on it could come off like Hajime basically asking Sensei to perform emotional labor for him, but to hear him tell it, his experiences thus far have left him unsure if he even can still experience those human extremes of emotions anymore. Of course, our boy's actions regarding his teammates, friends, and the likes of Myu indicate that he's handling things more healthily than he's giving himself credit for, but the concern being there at all still rings true, and fits with Hajime's desire to have a 'way back' for himself, both in terms of physically returning to Japan and living therein apart from his current vengeful disposition.    It's that long-term mission statement I've always appreciated about Arifureta, a power-fantasy makeover isekai that nonetheless sets its hero's ultimate goal of getting back to his original life after all. And given Sensei's long-standing willingness to shoulder these kinds of burdens for all her students, it fits, and continues the unique reciprocal relationship between her and Hajime. Where her presence and faith in him has comforted Hajime in the background of his struggles so far, he gets to return the favor here by turning his back on her only to allow her to cry into it in the event of being overwhelmed by her own struggles. That alone speaks to Hajime not being as callous as he'd like everyone to think he is. How moe.    I'm glad this closer can provide that kind of emotional closure, as the rest is more mechanical plot stuff getting sorted out for future stories. Kaori does indeed survive, with the outlandish side-effect of having her soul moved into the defeated Noint's body in the process, in a power-up acquisition so out there I absolutely didn't see it coming from this story. They even expressly detail that the move was entirely Kaori's desire and her old body is fine in stasis and ready for her to migrate back to once everything's taken care of. I kind of appreciate how buck-wild this is just as an expression of the lengths Kaori is now willing to go to in service of Hajime's adventuring harem. Something to be said for conviction, I suppose, and the animation here does a decent job of communicating it's still Kaori through facial expressions and the like, so it mostly works.    The other big shift that happens at this stage in the story comes from Hajime finally bringing everyone else up on that whole ""The gods are evil jerks"" thing, and a huge collection of the classmate crew resultantly deciding to tag along with him on the next leg of his adventures. I'm rather more apprehensive about this development, least of all because of the crowd factor involved (how are they all going to fit in the Hummvee?!), even if I can see the reasoning for it within the storytelling. For one thing, most of these people are going to have way more basis to interact with Eri the next time she pops up as a dedicated villain. Plus it's another point that acts with Hajime's arc from his original forced ousting from the group. Yes there's something a bit obvious about him suddenly finding that everyone thinks he is cool and wants to be his friend, but so long as the story isn't leaning too hard on Hajime reveling in vengeful vindication over the turnaround and is instead simply acting adorably tsundere over the whole affair, I think it's fine. I guess we'll just have to wait until that OVA (and who knows what other anime extensions) to see how this setup is actually going to shake out.    To the end, Arifureta is still Arifureta, so even among all its emotional satisfaction and interesting status-quo shakeups, this finale still can't finish without, say, a scene where all of Hajime's wives feed him or Tio, as she always does, returning to the bit about dragon sodomy. ""I've never been so uncomfortable"" indeed. But while I don't know if 'respectable' is a term I'd associate with all of that, it still all feels assured enough. I left the first season of Arifureta with a surprising amount of hope for its future, and I now leave the second season reasonably satisfied with the fulfillment of that hope. It's hardly the ""World's Strongest"", but I don't think there's any shame in going from Commonplace to Decently Entertaining.

Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest Season 2 Episode 12  by Christopher Farris, Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.4            I'd hardly call it the comeback of the century or anything, but it still seems pretty impressive how far the Arifureta anime has come since its incredibly iffy inception. After multiple studio switchovers and a first-season opening that seemed to misrepresent the tonal appeal of the series, here we've arrived at the wrap party for its second season, finishing in a mostly satisfying, effective way. While it's fine for me, I guess I mostly find myself hoping this has worked well for fans of the original work, ending up with a solid adaptation that supplements their appreciation for the novel after all. This isn't even the actual end for Arifureta either, as we've already got confirmation that there's an OVA coming later this year. Which makes sense, given that the story is hardly over by the point of this season finale. But much like Hajime's growth from a 'commonplace' weakling to an overpowered edgelord badass, the anime's glow-up from the murky, shambling mess it originally was into a perfectly serviceable little fantasy cartoon makes for an appreciable journey all its own.    Simply taking stock of the state of the product is appropriate enough at this stopping point, since so much of this season finale similarly spends its time consolidating the leftover pieces of the big blowout of the last few episodes. The biggest dangling thread is almost certainly the fate of Kaori, but as I was last week, the storyline is so assured that she'll be 'fine' that the characters straight-up turn to the camera and tell us that before sending Hajime over on a few other personal diversions. Instead, the actual biggest return on an emotional investment comes from Ai-Chan-Sensei, which probably isn't that surprising to anyone who's been paying attention through this arc, but is still nice to see just for a sense of completion.    Part of Ai-Sensei's focus here is necessarily on her processing the guilt over the people killed around and as a result of her in this battle. So she's got to come to terms with the church full of people she leveled, or the fact that Hiyama's demise, played somewhat flippantly as it occurred last episode, was still an instance of one of her students dying, so she's a bit tore up by that as well. What's nice here is that Hajime's contribution to talking Sensei through these feelings isn't to insist on his personal method of burying any trauma beneath a badass facade, but instead advising her to hold onto the weight and importance of that guilt. The association he asks for on it could come off like Hajime basically asking Sensei to perform emotional labor for him, but to hear him tell it, his experiences thus far have left him unsure if he even can still experience those human extremes of emotions anymore. Of course, our boy's actions regarding his teammates, friends, and the likes of Myu indicate that he's handling things more healthily than he's giving himself credit for, but the concern being there at all still rings true, and fits with Hajime's desire to have a 'way back' for himself, both in terms of physically returning to Japan and living therein apart from his current vengeful disposition.    It's that long-term mission statement I've always appreciated about Arifureta, a power-fantasy makeover isekai that nonetheless sets its hero's ultimate goal of getting back to his original life after all. And given Sensei's long-standing willingness to shoulder these kinds of burdens for all her students, it fits, and continues the unique reciprocal relationship between her and Hajime. Where her presence and faith in him has comforted Hajime in the background of his struggles so far, he gets to return the favor here by turning his back on her only to allow her to cry into it in the event of being overwhelmed by her own struggles. That alone speaks to Hajime not being as callous as he'd like everyone to think he is. How moe.    I'm glad this closer can provide that kind of emotional closure, as the rest is more mechanical plot stuff getting sorted out for future stories. Kaori does indeed survive, with the outlandish side-effect of having her soul moved into the defeated Noint's body in the process, in a power-up acquisition so out there I absolutely didn't see it coming from this story. They even expressly detail that the move was entirely Kaori's desire and her old body is fine in stasis and ready for her to migrate back to once everything's taken care of. I kind of appreciate how buck-wild this is just as an expression of the lengths Kaori is now willing to go to in service of Hajime's adventuring harem. Something to be said for conviction, I suppose, and the animation here does a decent job of communicating it's still Kaori through facial expressions and the like, so it mostly works.    The other big shift that happens at this stage in the story comes from Hajime finally bringing everyone else up on that whole ""The gods are evil jerks"" thing, and a huge collection of the classmate crew resultantly deciding to tag along with him on the next leg of his adventures. I'm rather more apprehensive about this development, least of all because of the crowd factor involved (how are they all going to fit in the Hummvee?!), even if I can see the reasoning for it within the storytelling. For one thing, most of these people are going to have way more basis to interact with Eri the next time she pops up as a dedicated villain. Plus it's another point that acts with Hajime's arc from his original forced ousting from the group. Yes there's something a bit obvious about him suddenly finding that everyone thinks he is cool and wants to be his friend, but so long as the story isn't leaning too hard on Hajime reveling in vengeful vindication over the turnaround and is instead simply acting adorably tsundere over the whole affair, I think it's fine. I guess we'll just have to wait until that OVA (and who knows what other anime extensions) to see how this setup is actually going to shake out.    To the end, Arifureta is still Arifureta, so even among all its emotional satisfaction and interesting status-quo shakeups, this finale still can't finish without, say, a scene where all of Hajime's wives feed him or Tio, as she always does, returning to the bit about dragon sodomy. ""I've never been so uncomfortable"" indeed. But while I don't know if 'respectable' is a term I'd associate with all of that, it still all feels assured enough. I left the first season of Arifureta with a surprising amount of hope for its future, and I now leave the second season reasonably satisfied with the fulfillment of that hope. It's hardly the ""World's Strongest"", but I don't think there's any shame in going from Commonplace to Decently Entertaining.

Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest Season 2 Episode 12  by Christopher Farris, Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.4            I'd hardly call it the comeback of the century or anything, but it still seems pretty impressive how far the Arifureta anime has come since its incredibly iffy inception. After multiple studio switchovers and a first-season opening that seemed to misrepresent the tonal appeal of the series, here we've arrived at the wrap party for its second season, finishing in a mostly satisfying, effective way. While it's fine for me, I guess I mostly find myself hoping this has worked well for fans of the original work, ending up with a solid adaptation that supplements their appreciation for the novel after all. This isn't even the actual end for Arifureta either, as we've already got confirmation that there's an OVA coming later this year. Which makes sense, given that the story is hardly over by the point of this season finale. But much like Hajime's growth from a 'commonplace' weakling to an overpowered edgelord badass, the anime's glow-up from the murky, shambling mess it originally was into a perfectly serviceable little fantasy cartoon makes for an appreciable journey all its own.    Simply taking stock of the state of the product is appropriate enough at this stopping point, since so much of this season finale similarly spends its time consolidating the leftover pieces of the big blowout of the last few episodes. The biggest dangling thread is almost certainly the fate of Kaori, but as I was last week, the storyline is so assured that she'll be 'fine' that the characters straight-up turn to the camera and tell us that before sending Hajime over on a few other personal diversions. Instead, the actual biggest return on an emotional investment comes from Ai-Chan-Sensei, which probably isn't that surprising to anyone who's been paying attention through this arc, but is still nice to see just for a sense of completion.    Part of Ai-Sensei's focus here is necessarily on her processing the guilt over the people killed around and as a result of her in this battle. So she's got to come to terms with the church full of people she leveled, or the fact that Hiyama's demise, played somewhat flippantly as it occurred last episode, was still an instance of one of her students dying, so she's a bit tore up by that as well. What's nice here is that Hajime's contribution to talking Sensei through these feelings isn't to insist on his personal method of burying any trauma beneath a badass facade, but instead advising her to hold onto the weight and importance of that guilt. The association he asks for on it could come off like Hajime basically asking Sensei to perform emotional labor for him, but to hear him tell it, his experiences thus far have left him unsure if he even can still experience those human extremes of emotions anymore. Of course, our boy's actions regarding his teammates, friends, and the likes of Myu indicate that he's handling things more healthily than he's giving himself credit for, but the concern being there at all still rings true, and fits with Hajime's desire to have a 'way back' for himself, both in terms of physically returning to Japan and living therein apart from his current vengeful disposition.    It's that long-term mission statement I've always appreciated about Arifureta, a power-fantasy makeover isekai that nonetheless sets its hero's ultimate goal of getting back to his original life after all. And given Sensei's long-standing willingness to shoulder these kinds of burdens for all her students, it fits, and continues the unique reciprocal relationship between her and Hajime. Where her presence and faith in him has comforted Hajime in the background of his struggles so far, he gets to return the favor here by turning his back on her only to allow her to cry into it in the event of being overwhelmed by her own struggles. That alone speaks to Hajime not being as callous as he'd like everyone to think he is. How moe.    I'm glad this closer can provide that kind of emotional closure, as the rest is more mechanical plot stuff getting sorted out for future stories. Kaori does indeed survive, with the outlandish side-effect of having her soul moved into the defeated Noint's body in the process, in a power-up acquisition so out there I absolutely didn't see it coming from this story. They even expressly detail that the move was entirely Kaori's desire and her old body is fine in stasis and ready for her to migrate back to once everything's taken care of. I kind of appreciate how buck-wild this is just as an expression of the lengths Kaori is now willing to go to in service of Hajime's adventuring harem. Something to be said for conviction, I suppose, and the animation here does a decent job of communicating it's still Kaori through facial expressions and the like, so it mostly works.    The other big shift that happens at this stage in the story comes from Hajime finally bringing everyone else up on that whole ""The gods are evil jerks"" thing, and a huge collection of the classmate crew resultantly deciding to tag along with him on the next leg of his adventures. I'm rather more apprehensive about this development, least of all because of the crowd factor involved (how are they all going to fit in the Hummvee?!), even if I can see the reasoning for it within the storytelling. For one thing, most of these people are going to have way more basis to interact with Eri the next time she pops up as a dedicated villain. Plus it's another point that acts with Hajime's arc from his original forced ousting from the group. Yes there's something a bit obvious about him suddenly finding that everyone thinks he is cool and wants to be his friend, but so long as the story isn't leaning too hard on Hajime reveling in vengeful vindication over the turnaround and is instead simply acting adorably tsundere over the whole affair, I think it's fine. I guess we'll just have to wait until that OVA (and who knows what other anime extensions) to see how this setup is actually going to shake out.    To the end, Arifureta is still Arifureta, so even among all its emotional satisfaction and interesting status-quo shakeups, this finale still can't finish without, say, a scene where all of Hajime's wives feed him or Tio, as she always does, returning to the bit about dragon sodomy. ""I've never been so uncomfortable"" indeed. But while I don't know if 'respectable' is a term I'd associate with all of that, it still all feels assured enough. I left the first season of Arifureta with a surprising amount of hope for its future, and I now leave the second season reasonably satisfied with the fulfillment of that hope. It's hardly the ""World's Strongest"", but I don't think there's any shame in going from Commonplace to Decently Entertaining.

Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest Season 2 Episode 12  by Christopher Farris, Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.4            I'd hardly call it the comeback of the century or anything, but it still seems pretty impressive how far the Arifureta anime has come since its incredibly iffy inception. After multiple studio switchovers and a first-season opening that seemed to misrepresent the tonal appeal of the series, here we've arrived at the wrap party for its second season, finishing in a mostly satisfying, effective way. While it's fine for me, I guess I mostly find myself hoping this has worked well for fans of the original work, ending up with a solid adaptation that supplements their appreciation for the novel after all. This isn't even the actual end for Arifureta either, as we've already got confirmation that there's an OVA coming later this year. Which makes sense, given that the story is hardly over by the point of this season finale. But much like Hajime's growth from a 'commonplace' weakling to an overpowered edgelord badass, the anime's glow-up from the murky, shambling mess it originally was into a perfectly serviceable little fantasy cartoon makes for an appreciable journey all its own.    Simply taking stock of the state of the product is appropriate enough at this stopping point, since so much of this season finale similarly spends its time consolidating the leftover pieces of the big blowout of the last few episodes. The biggest dangling thread is almost certainly the fate of Kaori, but as I was last week, the storyline is so assured that she'll be 'fine' that the characters straight-up turn to the camera and tell us that before sending Hajime over on a few other personal diversions. Instead, the actual biggest return on an emotional investment comes from Ai-Chan-Sensei, which probably isn't that surprising to anyone who's been paying attention through this arc, but is still nice to see just for a sense of completion.    Part of Ai-Sensei's focus here is necessarily on her processing the guilt over the people killed around and as a result of her in this battle. So she's got to come to terms with the church full of people she leveled, or the fact that Hiyama's demise, played somewhat flippantly as it occurred last episode, was still an instance of one of her students dying, so she's a bit tore up by that as well. What's nice here is that Hajime's contribution to talking Sensei through these feelings isn't to insist on his personal method of burying any trauma beneath a badass facade, but instead advising her to hold onto the weight and importance of that guilt. The association he asks for on it could come off like Hajime basically asking Sensei to perform emotional labor for him, but to hear him tell it, his experiences thus far have left him unsure if he even can still experience those human extremes of emotions anymore. Of course, our boy's actions regarding his teammates, friends, and the likes of Myu indicate that he's handling things more healthily than he's giving himself credit for, but the concern being there at all still rings true, and fits with Hajime's desire to have a 'way back' for himself, both in terms of physically returning to Japan and living therein apart from his current vengeful disposition.    It's that long-term mission statement I've always appreciated about Arifureta, a power-fantasy makeover isekai that nonetheless sets its hero's ultimate goal of getting back to his original life after all. And given Sensei's long-standing willingness to shoulder these kinds of burdens for all her students, it fits, and continues the unique reciprocal relationship between her and Hajime. Where her presence and faith in him has comforted Hajime in the background of his struggles so far, he gets to return the favor here by turning his back on her only to allow her to cry into it in the event of being overwhelmed by her own struggles. That alone speaks to Hajime not being as callous as he'd like everyone to think he is. How moe.    I'm glad this closer can provide that kind of emotional closure, as the rest is more mechanical plot stuff getting sorted out for future stories. Kaori does indeed survive, with the outlandish side-effect of having her soul moved into the defeated Noint's body in the process, in a power-up acquisition so out there I absolutely didn't see it coming from this story. They even expressly detail that the move was entirely Kaori's desire and her old body is fine in stasis and ready for her to migrate back to once everything's taken care of. I kind of appreciate how buck-wild this is just as an expression of the lengths Kaori is now willing to go to in service of Hajime's adventuring harem. Something to be said for conviction, I suppose, and the animation here does a decent job of communicating it's still Kaori through facial expressions and the like, so it mostly works.    The other big shift that happens at this stage in the story comes from Hajime finally bringing everyone else up on that whole ""The gods are evil jerks"" thing, and a huge collection of the classmate crew resultantly deciding to tag along with him on the next leg of his adventures. I'm rather more apprehensive about this development, least of all because of the crowd factor involved (how are they all going to fit in the Hummvee?!), even if I can see the reasoning for it within the storytelling. For one thing, most of these people are going to have way more basis to interact with Eri the next time she pops up as a dedicated villain. Plus it's another point that acts with Hajime's arc from his original forced ousting from the group. Yes there's something a bit obvious about him suddenly finding that everyone thinks he is cool and wants to be his friend, but so long as the story isn't leaning too hard on Hajime reveling in vengeful vindication over the turnaround and is instead simply acting adorably tsundere over the whole affair, I think it's fine. I guess we'll just have to wait until that OVA (and who knows what other anime extensions) to see how this setup is actually going to shake out.    To the end, Arifureta is still Arifureta, so even among all its emotional satisfaction and interesting status-quo shakeups, this finale still can't finish without, say, a scene where all of Hajime's wives feed him or Tio, as she always does, returning to the bit about dragon sodomy. ""I've never been so uncomfortable"" indeed. But while I don't know if 'respectable' is a term I'd associate with all of that, it still all feels assured enough. I left the first season of Arifureta with a surprising amount of hope for its future, and I now leave the second season reasonably satisfied with the fulfillment of that hope. It's hardly the ""World's Strongest"", but I don't think there's any shame in going from Commonplace to Decently Entertaining.

While it's fine for me, I guess I mostly find myself hoping this has worked well for fans of the original work, ending up with a solid adaptation that supplements their appreciation for the novel after all. This isn't even the actual end for Arifureta either, as we've already got confirmation that there's an OVA coming later this year. Which makes sense, given that the story is hardly over by the point of this season finale. But much like Hajime's growth from a 'commonplace' weakling to an overpowered edgelord badass, the anime's glow-up from the murky, shambling mess it originally was into a perfectly serviceable little fantasy cartoon makes for an appreciable journey all its own.    Simply taking stock of the state of the product is appropriate enough at this stopping point, since so much of this season finale similarly spends its time consolidating the leftover pieces of the big blowout of the last few episodes. The biggest dangling thread is almost certainly the fate of Kaori, but as I was last week, the storyline is so assured that she'll be 'fine' that the characters straight-up turn to the camera and tell us that before sending Hajime over on a few other personal diversions. Instead, the actual biggest return on an emotional investment comes from Ai-Chan-Sensei, which probably isn't that surprising to anyone who's been paying attention through this arc, but is still nice to see just for a sense of completion.    Part of Ai-Sensei's focus here is necessarily on her processing the guilt over the people killed around and as a result of her in this battle. So she's got to come to terms with the church full of people she leveled, or the fact that Hiyama's demise, played somewhat flippantly as it occurred last episode, was still an instance of one of her students dying, so she's a bit tore up by that as well. What's nice here is that Hajime's contribution to talking Sensei through these feelings isn't to insist on his personal method of burying any trauma beneath a badass facade, but instead advising her to hold onto the weight and importance of that guilt. The association he asks for on it could come off like Hajime basically asking Sensei to perform emotional labor for him, but to hear him tell it, his experiences thus far have left him unsure if he even can still experience those human extremes of emotions anymore. Of course, our boy's actions regarding his teammates, friends, and the likes of Myu indicate that he's handling things more healthily than he's giving himself credit for, but the concern being there at all still rings true, and fits with Hajime's desire to have a 'way back' for himself, both in terms of physically returning to Japan and living therein apart from his current vengeful disposition.    It's that long-term mission statement I've always appreciated about Arifureta, a power-fantasy makeover isekai that nonetheless sets its hero's ultimate goal of getting back to his original life after all. And given Sensei's long-standing willingness to shoulder these kinds of burdens for all her students, it fits, and continues the unique reciprocal relationship between her and Hajime. Where her presence and faith in him has comforted Hajime in the background of his struggles so far, he gets to return the favor here by turning his back on her only to allow her to cry into it in the event of being overwhelmed by her own struggles. That alone speaks to Hajime not being as callous as he'd like everyone to think he is. How moe.    I'm glad this closer can provide that kind of emotional closure, as the rest is more mechanical plot stuff getting sorted out for future stories. Kaori does indeed survive, with the outlandish side-effect of having her soul moved into the defeated Noint's body in the process, in a power-up acquisition so out there I absolutely didn't see it coming from this story. They even expressly detail that the move was entirely Kaori's desire and her old body is fine in stasis and ready for her to migrate back to once everything's taken care of. I kind of appreciate how buck-wild this is just as an expression of the lengths Kaori is now willing to go to in service of Hajime's adventuring harem. Something to be said for conviction, I suppose, and the animation here does a decent job of communicating it's still Kaori through facial expressions and the like, so it mostly works.    The other big shift that happens at this stage in the story comes from Hajime finally bringing everyone else up on that whole ""The gods are evil jerks"" thing, and a huge collection of the classmate crew resultantly deciding to tag along with him on the next leg of his adventures. I'm rather more apprehensive about this development, least of all because of the crowd factor involved (how are they all going to fit in the Hummvee?!), even if I can see the reasoning for it within the storytelling. For one thing, most of these people are going to have way more basis to interact with Eri the next time she pops up as a dedicated villain. Plus it's another point that acts with Hajime's arc from his original forced ousting from the group. Yes there's something a bit obvious about him suddenly finding that everyone thinks he is cool and wants to be his friend, but so long as the story isn't leaning too hard on Hajime reveling in vengeful vindication over the turnaround and is instead simply acting adorably tsundere over the whole affair, I think it's fine. I guess we'll just have to wait until that OVA (and who knows what other anime extensions) to see how this setup is actually going to shake out.    To the end, Arifureta is still Arifureta, so even among all its emotional satisfaction and interesting status-quo shakeups, this finale still can't finish without, say, a scene where all of Hajime's wives feed him or Tio, as she always does, returning to the bit about dragon sodomy. ""I've never been so uncomfortable"" indeed. But while I don't know if 'respectable' is a term I'd associate with all of that, it still all feels assured enough. I left the first season of Arifureta with a surprising amount of hope for its future, and I now leave the second season reasonably satisfied with the fulfillment of that hope. It's hardly the ""World's Strongest"", but I don't think there's any shame in going from Commonplace to Decently Entertaining.

Community score: 4.4            I'd hardly call it the comeback of the century or anything, but it still seems pretty impressive how far the Arifureta anime has come since its incredibly iffy inception. After multiple studio switchovers and a first-season opening that seemed to misrepresent the tonal appeal of the series, here we've arrived at the wrap party for its second season, finishing in a mostly satisfying, effective way. While it's fine for me, I guess I mostly find myself hoping this has worked well for fans of the original work, ending up with a solid adaptation that supplements their appreciation for the novel after all. This isn't even the actual end for Arifureta either, as we've already got confirmation that there's an OVA coming later this year. Which makes sense, given that the story is hardly over by the point of this season finale. But much like Hajime's growth from a 'commonplace' weakling to an overpowered edgelord badass, the anime's glow-up from the murky, shambling mess it originally was into a perfectly serviceable little fantasy cartoon makes for an appreciable journey all its own.    Simply taking stock of the state of the product is appropriate enough at this stopping point, since so much of this season finale similarly spends its time consolidating the leftover pieces of the big blowout of the last few episodes. The biggest dangling thread is almost certainly the fate of Kaori, but as I was last week, the storyline is so assured that she'll be 'fine' that the characters straight-up turn to the camera and tell us that before sending Hajime over on a few other personal diversions. Instead, the actual biggest return on an emotional investment comes from Ai-Chan-Sensei, which probably isn't that surprising to anyone who's been paying attention through this arc, but is still nice to see just for a sense of completion.    Part of Ai-Sensei's focus here is necessarily on her processing the guilt over the people killed around and as a result of her in this battle. So she's got to come to terms with the church full of people she leveled, or the fact that Hiyama's demise, played somewhat flippantly as it occurred last episode, was still an instance of one of her students dying, so she's a bit tore up by that as well. What's nice here is that Hajime's contribution to talking Sensei through these feelings isn't to insist on his personal method of burying any trauma beneath a badass facade, but instead advising her to hold onto the weight and importance of that guilt. The association he asks for on it could come off like Hajime basically asking Sensei to perform emotional labor for him, but to hear him tell it, his experiences thus far have left him unsure if he even can still experience those human extremes of emotions anymore. Of course, our boy's actions regarding his teammates, friends, and the likes of Myu indicate that he's handling things more healthily than he's giving himself credit for, but the concern being there at all still rings true, and fits with Hajime's desire to have a 'way back' for himself, both in terms of physically returning to Japan and living therein apart from his current vengeful disposition.    It's that long-term mission statement I've always appreciated about Arifureta, a power-fantasy makeover isekai that nonetheless sets its hero's ultimate goal of getting back to his original life after all. And given Sensei's long-standing willingness to shoulder these kinds of burdens for all her students, it fits, and continues the unique reciprocal relationship between her and Hajime. Where her presence and faith in him has comforted Hajime in the background of his struggles so far, he gets to return the favor here by turning his back on her only to allow her to cry into it in the event of being overwhelmed by her own struggles. That alone speaks to Hajime not being as callous as he'd like everyone to think he is. How moe.    I'm glad this closer can provide that kind of emotional closure, as the rest is more mechanical plot stuff getting sorted out for future stories. Kaori does indeed survive, with the outlandish side-effect of having her soul moved into the defeated Noint's body in the process, in a power-up acquisition so out there I absolutely didn't see it coming from this story. They even expressly detail that the move was entirely Kaori's desire and her old body is fine in stasis and ready for her to migrate back to once everything's taken care of. I kind of appreciate how buck-wild this is just as an expression of the lengths Kaori is now willing to go to in service of Hajime's adventuring harem. Something to be said for conviction, I suppose, and the animation here does a decent job of communicating it's still Kaori through facial expressions and the like, so it mostly works.    The other big shift that happens at this stage in the story comes from Hajime finally bringing everyone else up on that whole ""The gods are evil jerks"" thing, and a huge collection of the classmate crew resultantly deciding to tag along with him on the next leg of his adventures. I'm rather more apprehensive about this development, least of all because of the crowd factor involved (how are they all going to fit in the Hummvee?!), even if I can see the reasoning for it within the storytelling. For one thing, most of these people are going to have way more basis to interact with Eri the next time she pops up as a dedicated villain. Plus it's another point that acts with Hajime's arc from his original forced ousting from the group. Yes there's something a bit obvious about him suddenly finding that everyone thinks he is cool and wants to be his friend, but so long as the story isn't leaning too hard on Hajime reveling in vengeful vindication over the turnaround and is instead simply acting adorably tsundere over the whole affair, I think it's fine. I guess we'll just have to wait until that OVA (and who knows what other anime extensions) to see how this setup is actually going to shake out.    To the end, Arifureta is still Arifureta, so even among all its emotional satisfaction and interesting status-quo shakeups, this finale still can't finish without, say, a scene where all of Hajime's wives feed him or Tio, as she always does, returning to the bit about dragon sodomy. ""I've never been so uncomfortable"" indeed. But while I don't know if 'respectable' is a term I'd associate with all of that, it still all feels assured enough. I left the first season of Arifureta with a surprising amount of hope for its future, and I now leave the second season reasonably satisfied with the fulfillment of that hope. It's hardly the ""World's Strongest"", but I don't think there's any shame in going from Commonplace to Decently Entertaining.

Cast members Yūto Uemura (Minato Narumiya) and Shintarō Asanuma (Masaki Takigawa) narrate the teaser.       Participating theaters and the retail site Major will begin offering the second batch of advance tickets — MoviTicke Cards, each in a bundle with one of five randomly distributed ""flower visual portrait"" illustrated by characer designer  Miku Kadowaki:       Takuya Yamamura is returning to direct the film at Kyoto Animation. Yamamura is also writing the script, with supervision by the television anime's scriptwriter Michiko Yokote. Miku Kadowaki is returning as character designer. Masaru Yokoyama (new Fruits Basket anime, Your Lie in April) is replacing Harumi Fuuki as the composer.    The other staff members include:    Chief Animation Director: Nobuaki Maruki  Art Director: Shōko Ochiai  3D Art: Mutsuo Shinohara  Color Key Artist: Azumi Hata  3D Director: Rin Yamamoto  Prop Setting: Hiroshi Karata  Director of Photography: Kōhei Funamoto  Sound Director: Yota Tsuruoka    The film will open in Japan on August 19.    The television anime premiered in Japan on the NHK-General channel in October 2018. Sentai Filmworks licensed the anime and streamed the series on Crunchyroll and HIDIVE (with an English dub) as it aired in Japan. Sentai Filmworks released the anime on home video in January 2020. The release included an original video anime, an unaired 14th episode.    Pony Canyon USA describes the show's story:   The story opens with Minato Narumiya beginning his freshman year at the local Kazemai High School.  Mr. Tommy, advisor to the Japanese archery Club, is keen to recruit Minato, as well as his childhood friends Seiya Takehaya and Ryohei Yamanouchi. Ryohei convinces the reluctant Minato to attend the Club's orientation, where he also meets Kaito Onogi and Nanao Kisaragi. Singling Minato out, Mr. Tommy introduces him as a rare Japanese archery talent and asks him to demonstrate in front of everyone. However, Minato's arrow fails to hit the mark because he is afflicted by a serious condition… Minato, Seiya, Ryohei, Nanao and Kaito. Japanese archery brings them together. What will they attain as they struggle through their beautiful, yet “bitter” youth?   The anime is based on Kotoko Ayano's novel of the same name.
