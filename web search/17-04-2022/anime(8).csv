From the anime, Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba, the Sound Hashira, Tengen Uzui, comes to life in a dynamic pose, slicing down his enemies.         The ends of his hair and clothes on his back flutter in the wind, with the wrinkles of his uniform reflecting his body's movements, creating a more impactful appearance.       The detailed design of his headband and Nichirin Sword have also been faithfully reproduced.

More so even than Trigger, owing a lot to presentation and a much more somber tone that I connect to better. It definitely has its issues- way too many characters, weird character speech patterns, and an honestly good narrative that falls apart in the final stretch. I think calling the narrative shallow is incorrect, personally- but the plot and characters certainly aren't good at expressing themselves. So I see why the game could be divisive. But I adore its ambition- the absolute defiance of complacency that would have been so easy to succumb to, narratively and mechanically.    Its not a game for everyone. It is, to some extent, an rpg for those that find the blind optimism of a bunch of kids with a time machine to be alarming. Its a game about ugly consequences that can't be undone, and picking up those pieces to move forward. It's about confronting ""what could have been"" to make peace with ""what is"". At its best, it could be uncharitably described as ""Mid-Life Crisis: the Game"". And the extent to which any individual finds these concepts appealing is going to vary. But there isn't anything quite like it, so I do want to recommend fans of the genre to at least try it. Which makes its poor remaster quality a crying shame.

CC music is imo one of the best soundtrack in video game land.   Cross is definitely interesting but saying it never really gel together into a satisfying game is spot on. There's a large cast but it just feel like they took the standard 5-8 interesting character cast of a JRPG and split their personality/quirk and backstory across 45 so the game strangely feel like it's lacking characters. Combat system never really work, giving the player a ton of magic doesn't make it interesting, at best it feel like a dumb down version of FF7 materia, at worse its just annoying to sort trough all those. The two world system just makes everything confusing, neither world has a real identity to latch onto, there just slightly different version of the same world so you constantly wonder if you were supposed to go to regular world or alternate world to continue the quest.    So while I'm glad SE is continuing to port older game on PC (since I had to mothball all my retro console/game) CC feel a bit like a waste and I'll be skipping it and hoping they do more interesting stuff next (I can't complain much, they did seiken densetsu 3 not too long ago and are doing live-a-live soon).

A game could have been made portraying more complicated and nuanced complications to the 100% fantastical notion of time travel (and indeed, one was, and it was called Final Fantasy XIII-2). What we got with Cross is Masato Kato's edgy, petulant fan-fic sequel to a story originally drafted by absolute legend (and stubborn idealist) Yuji Horii. I was totally on-board with spoiler[the time-crashed future manifesting at the point where the timeline was broken], I was a lot less thrilled with spoiler[the completely unnecessary slasher-flick nightmare the 1000 A.D. cast was subjected to off-screen in the intervening years]. Like, what the man, hell? CC could have been remembered an interesting conceptual sequel (space vs. time), but that last bit sealed it's fate as one of the most polarizing sequels ever.    meiam wrote:    B for music, dammmmmn! CC music is imo one of the best soundtrack in video game land.         I would give it a B too, honestly, but that's because I'm petty and feel like we were robbed with the omission of a standard boss battle theme. Seriously.  I feel the same way about Mitsuda's Xenosaga: Episode 1 soundtrack, and that even had the perfect track for boss fights relegated to cutscene use only (with a remix of said track used for the final boss just for spite points). His Inazuma Eleven OST is an underrated classic, though.   Really a shame about the port quality, though. I do feel that everyone deserves to play this after Chrono Trigger so they, too, can be mad about it (one way or the other), but not like this.

The Chrono Trigger bits do feel pretty forced and I feel the game overall would benefit more from it not trying to pretend it's a sequel to it.    It is sad to hear about the censorship and performance issues in the remaster.  It seems to be a common trend with these things.  It's so sad companies with such iconic and legendary games give them such half-baked low-effort remasters.

That's...completely wrong; Kato was the main writer for Trigger as well. In fact, Kato might as well have been the director considering that Tokita and Kitase were late-development additions to the team. Horii came up with a basic outline, but Kato was the one who fleshed out most of the story. Hell, Kato made the original designs for the characters before Toriyama was brought on!   https://twitter.com/Dreamboum/status/1496693999045943297   So yeah. the whole ""dream team"" label was mostly just marketing. Supposedly Horii and Sakaguchi had a falling out over the game and it wouldn't surprise me considering how much of a mess Trigger's development was. So yeah, Kato is pretty much the Chrono architect whether people like it or not.   Anyway, having finished the game I can attest that it definitely has issues. The new character models are good (though Doc looks a bit off) and Nobuteru Yuuki's new portraits are welcome. Frame rate can chug, especially during combat, and it's clear the FMV's are in their late 90s resolution glory. Bit of a shame, especially considering how unique Cross is and how it really had the guts to do a deconstruction of time travel itself and the repercussions it entails, about how choices have ripple effects, and that things could go drastically different at the drop of a hat. There's an argument to be made about trimming the roster, but I'm not gonna complain about having a skeleton clown, an alien, a fairy, and a luchador in the selection. Hopefully they patch it in the coming months because I'm definitely going to go through to get more of the endings      Back to top                  wolf10    Joined: 23 Jan 2016 		    Posts: 697       Posted: Thu Apr 14, 2022 7:07 am              AiddonValentine wrote:    Kato was the main writer for Trigger as well.

It was great... until it devolved into the usual ""you just don't get it"" that always pops up in Chrono Cross discussions. I have a screenwriting degree, I quite literally do get ""it,"" and there's no narrative justification for certain developments except as some kind of mean-spirited attack on the preceding work, whoever wrote it first. (As it happens, it was also a hook for a sequel that was never developed, so at least Kato didn't intend it as spoiler[the end of Chrono, Lucca, and Marle's story].)   For what it's worth, Kato has mellowed out considerably in the years since, and has even acknowledged he could have shown more empathy to players of the original. He's even put out another Chrono game! (Which is to say, Another Eden, and it even got a Chrono Cross-over.)

It's not really a deconstruction, though. That word gets used a lot to describe ""darker"" works that invent new consequences for lighter material, but it's not the same as actually interrogating existing implications and finding something darker once you peel back a few layers. A ""deconstruction"" of CT's time travel would be more like, since time travel was shown to not have any sort of consequences, there's no actual proof that the current world isn't already a product of temporal meddling. But that's just food for thought.

I just got too overwhelmed by all the characters and kept worrying I was making the wrong choices and missing out on the good characters or building up the ""wrong"" ones.

There's not really any wrong choice, the difference between character is insignificant and once you've recruited them they essentially stop existing for the most part.

Yeah, definitely a rough job there and it's a damn shame too considering they did add little improvements like turning encounters off, adding an option to make fights easier, that sort of thing. Another thing I wonder is the frame rate hits when at normal speed, but not when in turbo mode so I wonder if they didn't properly optimize it for normal speed.

The Chrono Trigger bits do feel pretty forced and I feel the game overall would benefit more from it not trying to pretend it's a sequel to it.    It is sad to hear about the censorship and performance issues in the remaster.  It seems to be a common trend with these things.  It's so sad companies with such iconic and legendary games give them such half-baked low-effort remasters.            What was censored?    It sucks that it seems like there just wasn't a certain level of care put into this release. Overall it's a game I really love, just not so much as a CT sequel. The music will always be A+ for me.

You can remove this by switching to the original graphics mode though since it's only the new models that were changed.   -Most strange is Mojo's accent being removed for his initial appearance but strangely shows up later on in the game during character-specific dialog.  Which seems like an oversight and an sign the release was a rushed product that didn't go through much testing.

More so even than Trigger, owing a lot to presentation and a much more somber tone that I connect to better. It definitely has its issues- way too many characters, weird character speech patterns, and an honestly good narrative that falls apart in the final stretch. I think calling the narrative shallow is incorrect, personally- but the plot and characters certainly aren't good at expressing themselves. So I see why the game could be divisive. But I adore its ambition- the absolute defiance of complacency that would have been so easy to succumb to, narratively and mechanically.    Its not a game for everyone. It is, to some extent, an rpg for those that find the blind optimism of a bunch of kids with a time machine to be alarming. Its a game about ugly consequences that can't be undone, and picking up those pieces to move forward. It's about confronting ""what could have been"" to make peace with ""what is"". At its best, it could be uncharitably described as ""Mid-Life Crisis: the Game"". And the extent to which any individual finds these concepts appealing is going to vary. But there isn't anything quite like it, so I do want to recommend fans of the genre to at least try it. Which makes its poor remaster quality a crying shame.

CC music is imo one of the best soundtrack in video game land.   Cross is definitely interesting but saying it never really gel together into a satisfying game is spot on. There's a large cast but it just feel like they took the standard 5-8 interesting character cast of a JRPG and split their personality/quirk and backstory across 45 so the game strangely feel like it's lacking characters. Combat system never really work, giving the player a ton of magic doesn't make it interesting, at best it feel like a dumb down version of FF7 materia, at worse its just annoying to sort trough all those. The two world system just makes everything confusing, neither world has a real identity to latch onto, there just slightly different version of the same world so you constantly wonder if you were supposed to go to regular world or alternate world to continue the quest.    So while I'm glad SE is continuing to port older game on PC (since I had to mothball all my retro console/game) CC feel a bit like a waste and I'll be skipping it and hoping they do more interesting stuff next (I can't complain much, they did seiken densetsu 3 not too long ago and are doing live-a-live soon).

A game could have been made portraying more complicated and nuanced complications to the 100% fantastical notion of time travel (and indeed, one was, and it was called Final Fantasy XIII-2). What we got with Cross is Masato Kato's edgy, petulant fan-fic sequel to a story originally drafted by absolute legend (and stubborn idealist) Yuji Horii. I was totally on-board with spoiler[the time-crashed future manifesting at the point where the timeline was broken], I was a lot less thrilled with spoiler[the completely unnecessary slasher-flick nightmare the 1000 A.D. cast was subjected to off-screen in the intervening years]. Like, what the man, hell? CC could have been remembered an interesting conceptual sequel (space vs. time), but that last bit sealed it's fate as one of the most polarizing sequels ever.    meiam wrote:    B for music, dammmmmn! CC music is imo one of the best soundtrack in video game land.         I would give it a B too, honestly, but that's because I'm petty and feel like we were robbed with the omission of a standard boss battle theme. Seriously.  I feel the same way about Mitsuda's Xenosaga: Episode 1 soundtrack, and that even had the perfect track for boss fights relegated to cutscene use only (with a remix of said track used for the final boss just for spite points). His Inazuma Eleven OST is an underrated classic, though.   Really a shame about the port quality, though. I do feel that everyone deserves to play this after Chrono Trigger so they, too, can be mad about it (one way or the other), but not like this.

Supposedly Horii and Sakaguchi had a falling out over the game and it wouldn't surprise me considering how much of a mess Trigger's development was. So yeah, Kato is pretty much the Chrono architect whether people like it or not.   Anyway, having finished the game I can attest that it definitely has issues. The new character models are good (though Doc looks a bit off) and Nobuteru Yuuki's new portraits are welcome. Frame rate can chug, especially during combat, and it's clear the FMV's are in their late 90s resolution glory. Bit of a shame, especially considering how unique Cross is and how it really had the guts to do a deconstruction of time travel itself and the repercussions it entails, about how choices have ripple effects, and that things could go drastically different at the drop of a hat. There's an argument to be made about trimming the roster, but I'm not gonna complain about having a skeleton clown, an alien, a fairy, and a luchador in the selection. Hopefully they patch it in the coming months because I'm definitely going to go through to get more of the endings      Back to top                  wolf10    Joined: 23 Jan 2016 		    Posts: 697       Posted: Thu Apr 14, 2022 7:07 am              AiddonValentine wrote:    Kato was the main writer for Trigger as well.

So yeah, Kato is pretty much the Chrono architect whether people like it or not.           Thanks for the clarifying link! It was great... until it devolved into the usual ""you just don't get it"" that always pops up in Chrono Cross discussions. I have a screenwriting degree, I quite literally do get ""it,"" and there's no narrative justification for certain developments except as some kind of mean-spirited attack on the preceding work, whoever wrote it first. (As it happens, it was also a hook for a sequel that was never developed, so at least Kato didn't intend it as spoiler[the end of Chrono, Lucca, and Marle's story].)   For what it's worth, Kato has mellowed out considerably in the years since, and has even acknowledged he could have shown more empathy to players of the original. He's even put out another Chrono game! (Which is to say, Another Eden, and it even got a Chrono Cross-over.)

It's not really a deconstruction, though. That word gets used a lot to describe ""darker"" works that invent new consequences for lighter material, but it's not the same as actually interrogating existing implications and finding something darker once you peel back a few layers. A ""deconstruction"" of CT's time travel would be more like, since time travel was shown to not have any sort of consequences, there's no actual proof that the current world isn't already a product of temporal meddling. But that's just food for thought.

Yeah, definitely a rough job there and it's a damn shame too considering they did add little improvements like turning encounters off, adding an option to make fights easier, that sort of thing. Another thing I wonder is the frame rate hits when at normal speed, but not when in turbo mode so I wonder if they didn't properly optimize it for normal speed.

You can remove this by switching to the original graphics mode though since it's only the new models that were changed.   -Most strange is Mojo's accent being removed for his initial appearance but strangely shows up later on in the game during character-specific dialog.

More so even than Trigger, owing a lot to presentation and a much more somber tone that I connect to better. It definitely has its issues- way too many characters, weird character speech patterns, and an honestly good narrative that falls apart in the final stretch. I think calling the narrative shallow is incorrect, personally- but the plot and characters certainly aren't good at expressing themselves. So I see why the game could be divisive. But I adore its ambition- the absolute defiance of complacency that would have been so easy to succumb to, narratively and mechanically.    Its not a game for everyone. It is, to some extent, an rpg for those that find the blind optimism of a bunch of kids with a time machine to be alarming. Its a game about ugly consequences that can't be undone, and picking up those pieces to move forward. It's about confronting ""what could have been"" to make peace with ""what is"". At its best, it could be uncharitably described as ""Mid-Life Crisis: the Game"". And the extent to which any individual finds these concepts appealing is going to vary. But there isn't anything quite like it, so I do want to recommend fans of the genre to at least try it. Which makes its poor remaster quality a crying shame.

CC music is imo one of the best soundtrack in video game land.   Cross is definitely interesting but saying it never really gel together into a satisfying game is spot on. There's a large cast but it just feel like they took the standard 5-8 interesting character cast of a JRPG and split their personality/quirk and backstory across 45 so the game strangely feel like it's lacking characters. Combat system never really work, giving the player a ton of magic doesn't make it interesting, at best it feel like a dumb down version of FF7 materia, at worse its just annoying to sort trough all those. The two world system just makes everything confusing, neither world has a real identity to latch onto, there just slightly different version of the same world so you constantly wonder if you were supposed to go to regular world or alternate world to continue the quest.    So while I'm glad SE is continuing to port older game on PC (since I had to mothball all my retro console/game) CC feel a bit like a waste and I'll be skipping it and hoping they do more interesting stuff next (I can't complain much, they did seiken densetsu 3 not too long ago and are doing live-a-live soon).

A game could have been made portraying more complicated and nuanced complications to the 100% fantastical notion of time travel (and indeed, one was, and it was called Final Fantasy XIII-2). What we got with Cross is Masato Kato's edgy, petulant fan-fic sequel to a story originally drafted by absolute legend (and stubborn idealist) Yuji Horii. I was totally on-board with spoiler[the time-crashed future manifesting at the point where the timeline was broken], I was a lot less thrilled with spoiler[the completely unnecessary slasher-flick nightmare the 1000 A.D. cast was subjected to off-screen in the intervening years]. Like, what the man, hell? CC could have been remembered an interesting conceptual sequel (space vs. time), but that last bit sealed it's fate as one of the most polarizing sequels ever.    meiam wrote:    B for music, dammmmmn! CC music is imo one of the best soundtrack in video game land.         I would give it a B too, honestly, but that's because I'm petty and feel like we were robbed with the omission of a standard boss battle theme. Seriously.  I feel the same way about Mitsuda's Xenosaga: Episode 1 soundtrack, and that even had the perfect track for boss fights relegated to cutscene use only (with a remix of said track used for the final boss just for spite points). His Inazuma Eleven OST is an underrated classic, though.   Really a shame about the port quality, though. I do feel that everyone deserves to play this after Chrono Trigger so they, too, can be mad about it (one way or the other), but not like this.

It is sad to hear about the censorship and performance issues in the remaster.  It seems to be a common trend with these things.  It's so sad companies with such iconic and legendary games give them such half-baked low-effort remasters.

That's...completely wrong; Kato was the main writer for Trigger as well. In fact, Kato might as well have been the director considering that Tokita and Kitase were late-development additions to the team. Horii came up with a basic outline, but Kato was the one who fleshed out most of the story. Hell, Kato made the original designs for the characters before Toriyama was brought on!   https://twitter.com/Dreamboum/status/1496693999045943297   So yeah. the whole ""dream team"" label was mostly just marketing. Supposedly Horii and Sakaguchi had a falling out over the game and it wouldn't surprise me considering how much of a mess Trigger's development was. So yeah, Kato is pretty much the Chrono architect whether people like it or not.   Anyway, having finished the game I can attest that it definitely has issues. The new character models are good (though Doc looks a bit off) and Nobuteru Yuuki's new portraits are welcome. Frame rate can chug, especially during combat, and it's clear the FMV's are in their late 90s resolution glory. Bit of a shame, especially considering how unique Cross is and how it really had the guts to do a deconstruction of time travel itself and the repercussions it entails, about how choices have ripple effects, and that things could go drastically different at the drop of a hat. There's an argument to be made about trimming the roster, but I'm not gonna complain about having a skeleton clown, an alien, a fairy, and a luchador in the selection. Hopefully they patch it in the coming months because I'm definitely going to go through to get more of the endings      Back to top                  wolf10    Joined: 23 Jan 2016 		    Posts: 697       Posted: Thu Apr 14, 2022 7:07 am              AiddonValentine wrote:    Kato was the main writer for Trigger as well.

It was great... until it devolved into the usual ""you just don't get it"" that always pops up in Chrono Cross discussions. I have a screenwriting degree, I quite literally do get ""it,"" and there's no narrative justification for certain developments except as some kind of mean-spirited attack on the preceding work, whoever wrote it first. (As it happens, it was also a hook for a sequel that was never developed, so at least Kato didn't intend it as spoiler[the end of Chrono, Lucca, and Marle's story].)   For what it's worth, Kato has mellowed out considerably in the years since, and has even acknowledged he could have shown more empathy to players of the original. He's even put out another Chrono game! (Which is to say, Another Eden, and it even got a Chrono Cross-over.)

It's not really a deconstruction, though. That word gets used a lot to describe ""darker"" works that invent new consequences for lighter material, but it's not the same as actually interrogating existing implications and finding something darker once you peel back a few layers. A ""deconstruction"" of CT's time travel would be more like, since time travel was shown to not have any sort of consequences, there's no actual proof that the current world isn't already a product of temporal meddling. But that's just food for thought.

Yeah, definitely a rough job there and it's a damn shame too considering they did add little improvements like turning encounters off, adding an option to make fights easier, that sort of thing. Another thing I wonder is the frame rate hits when at normal speed, but not when in turbo mode so I wonder if they didn't properly optimize it for normal speed.

You can remove this by switching to the original graphics mode though since it's only the new models that were changed.   -Most strange is Mojo's accent being removed for his initial appearance but strangely shows up later on in the game during character-specific dialog.

More so even than Trigger, owing a lot to presentation and a much more somber tone that I connect to better. It definitely has its issues- way too many characters, weird character speech patterns, and an honestly good narrative that falls apart in the final stretch. I think calling the narrative shallow is incorrect, personally- but the plot and characters certainly aren't good at expressing themselves. So I see why the game could be divisive. But I adore its ambition- the absolute defiance of complacency that would have been so easy to succumb to, narratively and mechanically.    Its not a game for everyone. It is, to some extent, an rpg for those that find the blind optimism of a bunch of kids with a time machine to be alarming. Its a game about ugly consequences that can't be undone, and picking up those pieces to move forward. It's about confronting ""what could have been"" to make peace with ""what is"". At its best, it could be uncharitably described as ""Mid-Life Crisis: the Game"". And the extent to which any individual finds these concepts appealing is going to vary. But there isn't anything quite like it, so I do want to recommend fans of the genre to at least try it. Which makes its poor remaster quality a crying shame.

CC music is imo one of the best soundtrack in video game land.   Cross is definitely interesting but saying it never really gel together into a satisfying game is spot on. There's a large cast but it just feel like they took the standard 5-8 interesting character cast of a JRPG and split their personality/quirk and backstory across 45 so the game strangely feel like it's lacking characters. Combat system never really work, giving the player a ton of magic doesn't make it interesting, at best it feel like a dumb down version of FF7 materia, at worse its just annoying to sort trough all those. The two world system just makes everything confusing, neither world has a real identity to latch onto, there just slightly different version of the same world so you constantly wonder if you were supposed to go to regular world or alternate world to continue the quest.    So while I'm glad SE is continuing to port older game on PC (since I had to mothball all my retro console/game) CC feel a bit like a waste and I'll be skipping it and hoping they do more interesting stuff next (I can't complain much, they did seiken densetsu 3 not too long ago and are doing live-a-live soon).

A game could have been made portraying more complicated and nuanced complications to the 100% fantastical notion of time travel (and indeed, one was, and it was called Final Fantasy XIII-2). What we got with Cross is Masato Kato's edgy, petulant fan-fic sequel to a story originally drafted by absolute legend (and stubborn idealist) Yuji Horii. I was totally on-board with spoiler[the time-crashed future manifesting at the point where the timeline was broken], I was a lot less thrilled with spoiler[the completely unnecessary slasher-flick nightmare the 1000 A.D. cast was subjected to off-screen in the intervening years]. Like, what the man, hell? CC could have been remembered an interesting conceptual sequel (space vs. time), but that last bit sealed it's fate as one of the most polarizing sequels ever.    meiam wrote:    B for music, dammmmmn! CC music is imo one of the best soundtrack in video game land.         I would give it a B too, honestly, but that's because I'm petty and feel like we were robbed with the omission of a standard boss battle theme. Seriously.  I feel the same way about Mitsuda's Xenosaga: Episode 1 soundtrack, and that even had the perfect track for boss fights relegated to cutscene use only (with a remix of said track used for the final boss just for spite points). His Inazuma Eleven OST is an underrated classic, though.   Really a shame about the port quality, though. I do feel that everyone deserves to play this after Chrono Trigger so they, too, can be mad about it (one way or the other), but not like this.

That's...completely wrong; Kato was the main writer for Trigger as well. In fact, Kato might as well have been the director considering that Tokita and Kitase were late-development additions to the team. Horii came up with a basic outline, but Kato was the one who fleshed out most of the story. Hell, Kato made the original designs for the characters before Toriyama was brought on!   https://twitter.com/Dreamboum/status/1496693999045943297   So yeah. the whole ""dream team"" label was mostly just marketing. Supposedly Horii and Sakaguchi had a falling out over the game and it wouldn't surprise me considering how much of a mess Trigger's development was. So yeah, Kato is pretty much the Chrono architect whether people like it or not.   Anyway, having finished the game I can attest that it definitely has issues. The new character models are good (though Doc looks a bit off) and Nobuteru Yuuki's new portraits are welcome. Frame rate can chug, especially during combat, and it's clear the FMV's are in their late 90s resolution glory. Bit of a shame, especially considering how unique Cross is and how it really had the guts to do a deconstruction of time travel itself and the repercussions it entails, about how choices have ripple effects, and that things could go drastically different at the drop of a hat. There's an argument to be made about trimming the roster, but I'm not gonna complain about having a skeleton clown, an alien, a fairy, and a luchador in the selection. Hopefully they patch it in the coming months because I'm definitely going to go through to get more of the endings      Back to top                  wolf10    Joined: 23 Jan 2016 		    Posts: 697       Posted: Thu Apr 14, 2022 7:07 am              AiddonValentine wrote:    Kato was the main writer for Trigger as well.

It was great... until it devolved into the usual ""you just don't get it"" that always pops up in Chrono Cross discussions. I have a screenwriting degree, I quite literally do get ""it,"" and there's no narrative justification for certain developments except as some kind of mean-spirited attack on the preceding work, whoever wrote it first. (As it happens, it was also a hook for a sequel that was never developed, so at least Kato didn't intend it as spoiler[the end of Chrono, Lucca, and Marle's story].)   For what it's worth, Kato has mellowed out considerably in the years since, and has even acknowledged he could have shown more empathy to players of the original. He's even put out another Chrono game! (Which is to say, Another Eden, and it even got a Chrono Cross-over.)

It's not really a deconstruction, though. That word gets used a lot to describe ""darker"" works that invent new consequences for lighter material, but it's not the same as actually interrogating existing implications and finding something darker once you peel back a few layers. A ""deconstruction"" of CT's time travel would be more like, since time travel was shown to not have any sort of consequences, there's no actual proof that the current world isn't already a product of temporal meddling. But that's just food for thought.

There's not really any wrong choice, the difference between character is insignificant and once you've recruited them they essentially stop existing for the most part.

Yeah, definitely a rough job there and it's a damn shame too considering they did add little improvements like turning encounters off, adding an option to make fights easier, that sort of thing. Another thing I wonder is the frame rate hits when at normal speed, but not when in turbo mode so I wonder if they didn't properly optimize it for normal speed.

You can remove this by switching to the original graphics mode though since it's only the new models that were changed.   -Most strange is Mojo's accent being removed for his initial appearance but strangely shows up later on in the game during character-specific dialog.  Which seems like an oversight and an sign the release was a rushed product that didn't go through much testing.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Summer Time Rendering   Apr 15th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Summer Time Rendering ?                     Community score: 4.2              What is this?   Upon hearing of Ushio's death, Shinpei returns to his hometown of Wakayama City on Hitogashima and reunites with his childhood friend's family. The funeral goes smoothly, but under the surface something strange is brewing on the island. (from manga)   Summer Time Rendering is based on Yasuki Tanaka's suspense manga and streams on Disney+ in Japan on Wednesdays.    Note: The series still isn't available for streaming worldwide. Richard Eisenbeis lives in Japan and was able to watch the first episode there, albeit without subtitles.     How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                To tell the truth, before today, I had never even heard of Summer Time Rendering. I went into it totally blind—and that is absolutely the way it should be experienced. In fact, if you're already planning to watch it whenever Disney+ decides to set it free in your corner of the world, you should stop reading this review. Just take my word that it's a fantastic 24 minutes and you won't regret keeping yourself in the dark.    As for the rest of you, whether it be those who have already read the manga or those who need to know more before setting aside your time, let's get into it. This first episode of Summer Time Rendering is a master class at playing with tone, making you question what you are watching. At the start it could be any genre of show: we have a kid, Shinpei, going back to his hometown after several years away for the funeral of one of his closest friends, Ushio. But no sooner has he set foot on the island than things seem subtly off: he has strange dreams, there are a ton of well-dressed tourists all about, and his sister Mio seems more excited about his return than sad over the death of her sister. Then things swerve into the suspenseful, as we learn that there are signs Ushio was murdered, before it goes straight into horror when we start hearing about doppelgangers—and how people who have seen them soon disappear without a trace. And then comes the out-of-left-field cliffhanger where things suddenly go full sci-fi.    As all this is going on, there are a ton of things in the background hinting to what is truly going on. Some of these come across in random conversations. Others are visual, brought to life by the show's beautiful animation and its focus on intricate detail. It's a show that you'll want to rewatch even as the credits roll.    All in all, this first episode of Summer Time Rendering is an absolute roller-coaster. It's the best kind of premiere: one that makes it impossible to not want to come back for more. If you enjoy anime like Steins;Gate, ERASED, Sakurada Reset, or Re:Zero, you'll definitely be intrigued. And as for anyone else, well, you should definitely give it a chance.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review                Odd Taxi: In the Woods   Apr 17, 00:00                 anime    By cleverly reframing its narrative around a series of interviews with the supporting cast, Odd Taxi: In the Woods succeeds where most recap films fail: it's an artistically cohesive film in its own right. ― Odd Taxi was 2021's sleeper anime hit, telling an intricate, original mystery that kept viewers guessing every week.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Summer Time Rendering   Apr 15th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Summer Time Rendering ?                     Community score: 4.2              What is this?   Upon hearing of Ushio's death, Shinpei returns to his hometown of Wakayama City on Hitogashima and reunites with his childhood friend's family. The funeral goes smoothly, but under the surface something strange is brewing on the island. (from manga)   Summer Time Rendering is based on Yasuki Tanaka's suspense manga and streams on Disney+ in Japan on Wednesdays.    Note: The series still isn't available for streaming worldwide. Richard Eisenbeis lives in Japan and was able to watch the first episode there, albeit without subtitles.     How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                To tell the truth, before today, I had never even heard of Summer Time Rendering. I went into it totally blind—and that is absolutely the way it should be experienced. In fact, if you're already planning to watch it whenever Disney+ decides to set it free in your corner of the world, you should stop reading this review. Just take my word that it's a fantastic 24 minutes and you won't regret keeping yourself in the dark.    As for the rest of you, whether it be those who have already read the manga or those who need to know more before setting aside your time, let's get into it. This first episode of Summer Time Rendering is a master class at playing with tone, making you question what you are watching. At the start it could be any genre of show: we have a kid, Shinpei, going back to his hometown after several years away for the funeral of one of his closest friends, Ushio. But no sooner has he set foot on the island than things seem subtly off: he has strange dreams, there are a ton of well-dressed tourists all about, and his sister Mio seems more excited about his return than sad over the death of her sister. Then things swerve into the suspenseful, as we learn that there are signs Ushio was murdered, before it goes straight into horror when we start hearing about doppelgangers—and how people who have seen them soon disappear without a trace. And then comes the out-of-left-field cliffhanger where things suddenly go full sci-fi.    As all this is going on, there are a ton of things in the background hinting to what is truly going on. Some of these come across in random conversations. Others are visual, brought to life by the show's beautiful animation and its focus on intricate detail. It's a show that you'll want to rewatch even as the credits roll.    All in all, this first episode of Summer Time Rendering is an absolute roller-coaster. It's the best kind of premiere: one that makes it impossible to not want to come back for more. If you enjoy anime like Steins;Gate, ERASED, Sakurada Reset, or Re:Zero, you'll definitely be intrigued. And as for anyone else, well, you should definitely give it a chance.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review                Odd Taxi: In the Woods   Apr 17, 00:00                 anime    By cleverly reframing its narrative around a series of interviews with the supporting cast, Odd Taxi: In the Woods succeeds where most recap films fail: it's an artistically cohesive film in its own right. ― Odd Taxi was 2021's sleeper anime hit, telling an intricate, original mystery that kept viewers guessing every week.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Summer Time Rendering   Apr 15th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Summer Time Rendering ?                     Community score: 4.2              What is this?   Upon hearing of Ushio's death, Shinpei returns to his hometown of Wakayama City on Hitogashima and reunites with his childhood friend's family. The funeral goes smoothly, but under the surface something strange is brewing on the island. (from manga)   Summer Time Rendering is based on Yasuki Tanaka's suspense manga and streams on Disney+ in Japan on Wednesdays.    Note: The series still isn't available for streaming worldwide. Richard Eisenbeis lives in Japan and was able to watch the first episode there, albeit without subtitles.     How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                To tell the truth, before today, I had never even heard of Summer Time Rendering. I went into it totally blind—and that is absolutely the way it should be experienced. In fact, if you're already planning to watch it whenever Disney+ decides to set it free in your corner of the world, you should stop reading this review. Just take my word that it's a fantastic 24 minutes and you won't regret keeping yourself in the dark.    As for the rest of you, whether it be those who have already read the manga or those who need to know more before setting aside your time, let's get into it. This first episode of Summer Time Rendering is a master class at playing with tone, making you question what you are watching. At the start it could be any genre of show: we have a kid, Shinpei, going back to his hometown after several years away for the funeral of one of his closest friends, Ushio. But no sooner has he set foot on the island than things seem subtly off: he has strange dreams, there are a ton of well-dressed tourists all about, and his sister Mio seems more excited about his return than sad over the death of her sister. Then things swerve into the suspenseful, as we learn that there are signs Ushio was murdered, before it goes straight into horror when we start hearing about doppelgangers—and how people who have seen them soon disappear without a trace. And then comes the out-of-left-field cliffhanger where things suddenly go full sci-fi.    As all this is going on, there are a ton of things in the background hinting to what is truly going on. Some of these come across in random conversations. Others are visual, brought to life by the show's beautiful animation and its focus on intricate detail. It's a show that you'll want to rewatch even as the credits roll.    All in all, this first episode of Summer Time Rendering is an absolute roller-coaster. It's the best kind of premiere: one that makes it impossible to not want to come back for more. If you enjoy anime like Steins;Gate, ERASED, Sakurada Reset, or Re:Zero, you'll definitely be intrigued. And as for anyone else, well, you should definitely give it a chance.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review                Odd Taxi: In the Woods   Apr 17, 00:00                 anime    By cleverly reframing its narrative around a series of interviews with the supporting cast, Odd Taxi: In the Woods succeeds where most recap films fail: it's an artistically cohesive film in its own right. ― Odd Taxi was 2021's sleeper anime hit, telling an intricate, original mystery that kept viewers guessing every week.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Summer Time Rendering   Apr 15th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Summer Time Rendering ?                     Community score: 4.2              What is this?   Upon hearing of Ushio's death, Shinpei returns to his hometown of Wakayama City on Hitogashima and reunites with his childhood friend's family. The funeral goes smoothly, but under the surface something strange is brewing on the island. (from manga)   Summer Time Rendering is based on Yasuki Tanaka's suspense manga and streams on Disney+ in Japan on Wednesdays.    Note: The series still isn't available for streaming worldwide. Richard Eisenbeis lives in Japan and was able to watch the first episode there, albeit without subtitles.     How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                To tell the truth, before today, I had never even heard of Summer Time Rendering. I went into it totally blind—and that is absolutely the way it should be experienced. In fact, if you're already planning to watch it whenever Disney+ decides to set it free in your corner of the world, you should stop reading this review. Just take my word that it's a fantastic 24 minutes and you won't regret keeping yourself in the dark.    As for the rest of you, whether it be those who have already read the manga or those who need to know more before setting aside your time, let's get into it. This first episode of Summer Time Rendering is a master class at playing with tone, making you question what you are watching. At the start it could be any genre of show: we have a kid, Shinpei, going back to his hometown after several years away for the funeral of one of his closest friends, Ushio. But no sooner has he set foot on the island than things seem subtly off: he has strange dreams, there are a ton of well-dressed tourists all about, and his sister Mio seems more excited about his return than sad over the death of her sister. Then things swerve into the suspenseful, as we learn that there are signs Ushio was murdered, before it goes straight into horror when we start hearing about doppelgangers—and how people who have seen them soon disappear without a trace. And then comes the out-of-left-field cliffhanger where things suddenly go full sci-fi.    As all this is going on, there are a ton of things in the background hinting to what is truly going on. Some of these come across in random conversations. Others are visual, brought to life by the show's beautiful animation and its focus on intricate detail. It's a show that you'll want to rewatch even as the credits roll.    All in all, this first episode of Summer Time Rendering is an absolute roller-coaster. It's the best kind of premiere: one that makes it impossible to not want to come back for more. If you enjoy anime like Steins;Gate, ERASED, Sakurada Reset, or Re:Zero, you'll definitely be intrigued.

Then things swerve into the suspenseful, as we learn that there are signs Ushio was murdered, before it goes straight into horror when we start hearing about doppelgangers—and how people who have seen them soon disappear without a trace. And then comes the out-of-left-field cliffhanger where things suddenly go full sci-fi.    As all this is going on, there are a ton of things in the background hinting to what is truly going on. Some of these come across in random conversations. Others are visual, brought to life by the show's beautiful animation and its focus on intricate detail. It's a show that you'll want to rewatch even as the credits roll.    All in all, this first episode of Summer Time Rendering is an absolute roller-coaster. It's the best kind of premiere: one that makes it impossible to not want to come back for more. If you enjoy anime like Steins;Gate, ERASED, Sakurada Reset, or Re:Zero, you'll definitely be intrigued.

News Jujutsu Kaisen Stage Play's Video Introduces Cast in Costume   posted on 2022-04-14 12:32 UTC-8 by Egan Loo          Ryūji Satō, Ryosuke Miura star in July-August play    A press conference for the stage play of Gege Akutami's Jujutsu Kaisen manga introduced the production's promotional video, main cast, and other details on Wednesday.         The cast members are:    Ryūji Satō as Yūji Itadori    Kazuaki Yasue as Megumi Fushiguro    Erika Toyohara as Nobara Kugisaki    Sara Takatsuki as Maki Zenin    Fūma Sadamoto as Toge Inumaki    Takeshi Terayama as Panda    Masanari Wada as Kento Nanami    Hosaki Tanaka as Kiyotaka Ijichi    Mikako Ishii as Shoko Ieiri    Motohiro Ōta as Mahito    Noa Fukuzawa (Watwing) as Junpei Yoshino    Rei Fujita as Suguru Getou    Mondo Yamagishi as Jogou    Yoshihiro Minami as Hanami    Tact Igarashi as Ryōmen Sukuna    Ryōsuke Miura as Satoru Gojo     The production will run in The Galaxy Theatre at Tokyo's Tennōzu from July 15 to July 31 and then move to Mielparque Hall Osaka from August 4 to August 14. Kensaku Kobayashi is directing the play off a script by Kōhei Kiyasu.    Akutami launched the manga in Shueisha's Weekly Shonen Jump magazine in March 2018. Shueisha published the manga's 19th compiled book volume on April 4. The manga has over 65 million copies in circulation (including print and digital copies, as well as copies not yet sold) as of that volume's release date.    Viz Media published the manga's first three chapters in English simultaneously with Japan as part of its Jump Start initiative. When Viz then switched to its new Shonen Jump model in December 2018, the company began publishing new chapters of the manga digitally. Shueisha is also publishing the manga on its MANGA Plus website.    Viz Media describes the story:    In a world where demons feed on unsuspecting humans, fragments of the legendary and feared demon Ryoma Sukuna were lost and scattered about. Should any demon consume Sukuna's body parts, the power they gain could destroy the world as we know it. Fortunately, there exists a mysterious school of Jujutsu Sorcerers who exist to protect the precarious existence of the living from the supernatural!   Yuji Itadori is high schooler who spends his days visiting his bedridden grandfather. Although he looks like your average teenager, his immense physical strength is something to behold! Every sports club wants him to join, but Itadori would rather hang out with the school outcasts in the Occult Club. One day, the club manages to get their hands on a sealed cursed object, but little do they know the terror they'll unleash when they break the seal...    The Jujutsu Kaisen anime premiered in October 2020, and it had 24 episodes. The anime will get a second season in 2023. Jujutsu Kaisen 0 opened in Japan on December 24 and is currently the 18th highest-grossing film in Japan of all time. The film is based on Gege Akutami's Jujutsu Kaisen 0 Tokyo Toritsu Jujutsu Kōtō Senmon Gakkō (Jujutsu Kaisen 0: Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School) manga prequel story.

News Jujutsu Kaisen Stage Play's Video Introduces Cast in Costume   posted on 2022-04-14 12:32 UTC-8 by Egan Loo          Ryūji Satō, Ryosuke Miura star in July-August play    A press conference for the stage play of Gege Akutami's Jujutsu Kaisen manga introduced the production's promotional video, main cast, and other details on Wednesday.         The cast members are:    Ryūji Satō as Yūji Itadori    Kazuaki Yasue as Megumi Fushiguro    Erika Toyohara as Nobara Kugisaki    Sara Takatsuki as Maki Zenin    Fūma Sadamoto as Toge Inumaki    Takeshi Terayama as Panda    Masanari Wada as Kento Nanami    Hosaki Tanaka as Kiyotaka Ijichi    Mikako Ishii as Shoko Ieiri    Motohiro Ōta as Mahito    Noa Fukuzawa (Watwing) as Junpei Yoshino    Rei Fujita as Suguru Getou    Mondo Yamagishi as Jogou    Yoshihiro Minami as Hanami    Tact Igarashi as Ryōmen Sukuna    Ryōsuke Miura as Satoru Gojo     The production will run in The Galaxy Theatre at Tokyo's Tennōzu from July 15 to July 31 and then move to Mielparque Hall Osaka from August 4 to August 14. Kensaku Kobayashi is directing the play off a script by Kōhei Kiyasu.    Akutami launched the manga in Shueisha's Weekly Shonen Jump magazine in March 2018. Shueisha published the manga's 19th compiled book volume on April 4. The manga has over 65 million copies in circulation (including print and digital copies, as well as copies not yet sold) as of that volume's release date.    Viz Media published the manga's first three chapters in English simultaneously with Japan as part of its Jump Start initiative. When Viz then switched to its new Shonen Jump model in December 2018, the company began publishing new chapters of the manga digitally. Shueisha is also publishing the manga on its MANGA Plus website.    Viz Media describes the story:    In a world where demons feed on unsuspecting humans, fragments of the legendary and feared demon Ryoma Sukuna were lost and scattered about. Should any demon consume Sukuna's body parts, the power they gain could destroy the world as we know it. Fortunately, there exists a mysterious school of Jujutsu Sorcerers who exist to protect the precarious existence of the living from the supernatural!   Yuji Itadori is high schooler who spends his days visiting his bedridden grandfather. Although he looks like your average teenager, his immense physical strength is something to behold! Every sports club wants him to join, but Itadori would rather hang out with the school outcasts in the Occult Club. One day, the club manages to get their hands on a sealed cursed object, but little do they know the terror they'll unleash when they break the seal...    The Jujutsu Kaisen anime premiered in October 2020, and it had 24 episodes. The anime will get a second season in 2023. Jujutsu Kaisen 0 opened in Japan on December 24 and is currently the 18th highest-grossing film in Japan of all time. The film is based on Gege Akutami's Jujutsu Kaisen 0 Tokyo Toritsu Jujutsu Kōtō Senmon Gakkō (Jujutsu Kaisen 0: Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School) manga prequel story.

News Key, Ryukishi07's Loopers Kinetic Novel Launches for Switch on June 2   posted on 2022-04-15 20:15 UTC-8 by Adriana Hazra          Visual Arts, Key launched game for PC in Japan in May 2021    Prototype began streaming the opening movie for the Nintendo Switch release of Visual Arts and Key's LOOPERS kinetic novel on Friday. The video reveals that the Nintendo Switch version will launch on June 2.      sana (sajou no hana) performs the theme song ""Senya Ichiya VORTEX"" (A Thousand Nights One Night Vortex).    The game will be priced at US$24.99 in the United States, CA$33.24 in Canada, and €24.99 in Europe. The release will feature Japanese voices and text in Japanese, English, and Simplified Chinese.    Visual Arts and Key released the all-ages game on PC in May 2021, and stated later that month that the game will get an overseas release. Prototype announced the Nintendo Switch version on February 3. A smartphone version of the game is also in development.    Ryukishi07 (Higurashi: When They Cry, Umineko - When They Cry franchises) wrote the scenario for the game, and Kei Mochizuki was in charge of illustration. Kazuma Takata directed the game. The companies revealed the kinetic novel along with two other novels in October 2020. Visual Arts and Key describe the story of LOOPERS:   Let's set out to find a real treasure. Tyler is a high school student who is obsessed with geocaching, a GPS-based treasure hunting game. One day during summer vacation, Tyler and his friends get drawn into a mysterious incident while out treasure-hunting. The real and imagined become interconnected. Thoughts are thrown into chaos. Tomorrow becomes today.   Swallowed up by a time vortex, they are trapped in a never-ending time loop, repeating ""today"" again and again.    Then they meet other ""loopers."" Simon, the leader, and the mysterious girl Mia. If they join forces, will they be able to break out from this eternal prison...?   The game stars: Sayaka Kaneko as Mia, Tomohito Takatsuka as Tyler, Hiyori Kono as Hilda, Shiori Izawa as Leona, Ryohei Kimura as Simon, Yōsuke Etō as Joe, Hina Kino as Holly, and Anna Yamaki as Ritapon.

News Key, Ryukishi07's Loopers Kinetic Novel Launches for Switch on June 2   posted on 2022-04-15 20:15 UTC-8 by Adriana Hazra          Visual Arts, Key launched game for PC in Japan in May 2021    Prototype began streaming the opening movie for the Nintendo Switch release of Visual Arts and Key's LOOPERS kinetic novel on Friday. The video reveals that the Nintendo Switch version will launch on June 2.      sana (sajou no hana) performs the theme song ""Senya Ichiya VORTEX"" (A Thousand Nights One Night Vortex).    The game will be priced at US$24.99 in the United States, CA$33.24 in Canada, and €24.99 in Europe. The release will feature Japanese voices and text in Japanese, English, and Simplified Chinese.    Visual Arts and Key released the all-ages game on PC in May 2021, and stated later that month that the game will get an overseas release. Prototype announced the Nintendo Switch version on February 3. A smartphone version of the game is also in development.    Ryukishi07 (Higurashi: When They Cry, Umineko - When They Cry franchises) wrote the scenario for the game, and Kei Mochizuki was in charge of illustration. Kazuma Takata directed the game. The companies revealed the kinetic novel along with two other novels in October 2020. Visual Arts and Key describe the story of LOOPERS:   Let's set out to find a real treasure. Tyler is a high school student who is obsessed with geocaching, a GPS-based treasure hunting game. One day during summer vacation, Tyler and his friends get drawn into a mysterious incident while out treasure-hunting. The real and imagined become interconnected. Thoughts are thrown into chaos. Tomorrow becomes today.   Swallowed up by a time vortex, they are trapped in a never-ending time loop, repeating ""today"" again and again.    Then they meet other ""loopers."" Simon, the leader, and the mysterious girl Mia. If they join forces, will they be able to break out from this eternal prison...?   The game stars: Sayaka Kaneko as Mia, Tomohito Takatsuka as Tyler, Hiyori Kono as Hilda, Shiori Izawa as Leona, Ryohei Kimura as Simon, Yōsuke Etō as Joe, Hina Kino as Holly, and Anna Yamaki as Ritapon.

I thought for sure that an amazing series that's ran for a decade would be covered.         Must not have gotten enough votes.            Honestly i think it might be more because none of the reviewers are caught up or aren't familiar with DAL at all, because it wasn't covered on the Preview Guide at all. Which I thought was a little surprising.   And I believe it's a bit of a shame. DAL has a spotty adaptation history but this latest season looks to be very promising. And the series as a whole is a lot of fun.    Aside from that, only other shows I care about are Ya Boy Kongming and Kaguya-sama, so this season is looking more sparse than I thought it would be Last edited by ThatGuyWhoLikesThings on Fri Apr 15, 2022 9:05 am; edited 1 time in total     Back to top                  andramus    Joined: 19 Apr 2020 		    Posts: 103       Posted: Fri Apr 15, 2022 8:57 am            I was hoping ESTAB Life would get a look in but most of the shows I wanted to see reviewed seem to have been picked up.   I haven't seen the latest episode of ESTAB but something about it has kept me coming back. I don't know if there is an overarcing story for the season or if state of the world will ever be fully be explained but so far the series has kept me intrigued.

She was clearly very passionate about the source material (or is it source’s source material?), and that was always a treat to read.      I second this. It was an inevitable casualty, much like most of it's cast, but the weekly analysis/read-along companion will still be missed. I'm glad Precure survived, all things considered.   Also glad none of the reviewers got stuck with a hate-watch this season, and hopefully nothing that got picked will become one.

I thought for sure that an amazing series that's ran for a decade would be covered.         Must not have gotten enough votes.            Honestly i think it might be more because none of the reviewers are caught up or aren't familiar with DAL at all, because it wasn't covered on the Preview Guide at all. Which I thought was a little surprising.   And I believe it's a bit of a shame. DAL has a spotty adaptation history but this latest season looks to be very promising. And the series as a whole is a lot of fun.    Aside from that, only other shows I care about are Ya Boy Kongming and Kaguya-sama, so this season is looking more sparse than I thought it would be Last edited by ThatGuyWhoLikesThings on Fri Apr 15, 2022 9:05 am; edited 1 time in total     Back to top                  andramus    Joined: 19 Apr 2020 		    Posts: 103       Posted: Fri Apr 15, 2022 8:57 am            I was hoping ESTAB Life would get a look in but most of the shows I wanted to see reviewed seem to have been picked up.   I haven't seen the latest episode of ESTAB but something about it has kept me coming back. I don't know if there is an overarcing story for the season or if state of the world will ever be fully be explained but so far the series has kept me intrigued.

She was clearly very passionate about the source material (or is it source’s source material?), and that was always a treat to read.      I second this. It was an inevitable casualty, much like most of it's cast, but the weekly analysis/read-along companion will still be missed. I'm glad Precure survived, all things considered.   Also glad none of the reviewers got stuck with a hate-watch this season, and hopefully nothing that got picked will become one.

Honestly i think it might be more because none of the reviewers are caught up or aren't familiar with DAL at all, because it wasn't covered on the Preview Guide at all. Which I thought was a little surprising.   And I believe it's a bit of a shame. DAL has a spotty adaptation history but this latest season looks to be very promising. And the series as a whole is a lot of fun.    Aside from that, only other shows I care about are Ya Boy Kongming and Kaguya-sama, so this season is looking more sparse than I thought it would be Last edited by ThatGuyWhoLikesThings on Fri Apr 15, 2022 9:05 am; edited 1 time in total     Back to top                  andramus    Joined: 19 Apr 2020 		    Posts: 103       Posted: Fri Apr 15, 2022 8:57 am            I was hoping ESTAB Life would get a look in but most of the shows I wanted to see reviewed seem to have been picked up.   I haven't seen the latest episode of ESTAB but something about it has kept me coming back. I don't know if there is an overarcing story for the season or if state of the world will ever be fully be explained but so far the series has kept me intrigued.

I thought for sure that an amazing series that's ran for a decade would be covered.         Must not have gotten enough votes.            Honestly i think it might be more because none of the reviewers are caught up or aren't familiar with DAL at all, because it wasn't covered on the Preview Guide at all. Which I thought was a little surprising.   And I believe it's a bit of a shame. DAL has a spotty adaptation history but this latest season looks to be very promising. And the series as a whole is a lot of fun.    Aside from that, only other shows I care about are Ya Boy Kongming and Kaguya-sama, so this season is looking more sparse than I thought it would be Last edited by ThatGuyWhoLikesThings on Fri Apr 15, 2022 9:05 am; edited 1 time in total     Back to top                  andramus    Joined: 19 Apr 2020 		    Posts: 103       Posted: Fri Apr 15, 2022 8:57 am            I was hoping ESTAB Life would get a look in but most of the shows I wanted to see reviewed seem to have been picked up.   I haven't seen the latest episode of ESTAB but something about it has kept me coming back. I don't know if there is an overarcing story for the season or if state of the world will ever be fully be explained but so far the series has kept me intrigued.
