Review:         Synopsis:        Through a culmination of years of personal research on cosplay, author Frenchy Lunning combines the fascinating viewpoints of cosplayers with observational, in-depth research on cosplay history, its practices, and a deep dive into critical theory involving the modes of fictional existence, in order to understand its global expansion. Who was the first cosplayer? How has cosplay's relationship with popular culture changed throughout the decades? What are the different ways the practice is executed and celebrated throughout the world? Cosplay: The Fictional Mode of Existence is an interesting examination of identity, performance, play, and otaku fandom in its relation to the growing art of cosplay.     Review:            Cosplay is one of the cornerstones of pop culture celebration. Whether it's science-fiction, fantasy, western, or eastern animation, it feels like you don't have to go far nowadays to come across people that wear their love for these mediums on their sleeves in a very literal way. Granted, in my passive research, a lot of media use cosplay as an extension of nerd fandom or otaku culture, but very rarely is it seen as a focus of cultural significance in and of itself. So as someone who has cosplayed for roughly the past decade with a fluctuating involvement in the larger cosplay community, do I think the text accomplishes that goal of proper focus and attention? Yes I do and with flying colors to boot.    The best way to describe Cosplay: The Fictional Mode of Existence would be that it is an amazing outline for a cosplay 101 class that could be taught in a college semester. Yes, I understand that to some people that might sound silly because there can't possibly be that much informed history and social analysis to actually teach a class over an extended period of time…right? I will admit I was one of those people. Of course I knew cosplay had to have started somewhere and that the way things are now probably wasn't the way they were 20 or 30 years ago. However, the sheer extent to which things have evolved that got us to this point shocked me to my very core with questions that I didn't even think could be asked. A speculative yet thorough look at the origins of cosplay and spaces that celebrate them? Oftentimes across different cultures and locations? Check. An extensive breakdown on the parasocial relationship that cosplayers have with their performances as well as the costumes they wear as a form of love and artistic expression? Check. How the evolution of cosplay as a social construct correlates to how collective people evolve as a culture? Check.    This is the most scholarly and straightforward approach to the idea of cosplay that I have ever seen. Granted, I didn't look very far for media like this, but I feel like this book covers so much ground and then some, you could walk away feeling like you just took an extensive course on how interesting this medium is from an angle where you don't even have to cosplay yourself. I feel like I could write half a dozen pages on some of the interesting passive and direct influences that the very concept of cosplaying has had on society and vice versa. I don't feel confident in proclaiming whether or not Lunning considers themselves a cosplayer or as a part of the larger cosplay community. But the sheer love and respect displayed right out the gate in this book feels like it also deserves equal recognition.    Although I will say I'm curious if the author had an extra year or two to include how recent difficult events have affected the cosplay community as well, as COVID-19 not only shut down a majority of the events that are discussed in this book, but in my personal experience, it has also given life to a much more prominent online culture born from people who shoot from home. That's the funny thing, things are always changing and cosplay has always sort of adapted and grown with the times dating back to before the term cosplay was even developed. There was one sentence towards the end of the book that really stood out to me “Cosplay, then, is an art form that may or may not last, but even if it does not, it will always-as it does now-evolve”.    Thankfully the book doesn't try to present itself as some kind of definitive Bible on how cosplay works. It also avoids purporting any definitions revolving around the culture or history above others as some accounts of events can be conflicting and different places might consider different angles. If anything, the book makes it apparent very early on that it is the culmination of various different thoughts, opinions, and definitions from dozens upon dozens of people who could give even a passive insight into this evolving culture. This didn't just include cosplayers old and young but also photographers, historians, scholars, performers, writers etc. all of these are very well cited and documented at the end of the book in a way that is easy to refer to with proper citations (although I will admit reading this in PDF form was a little difficult since I had to constantly scroll back-and-forth. Definitely get a physical copy.) The book is even filled with pictures from the variety of different conventions, plays, and countries in order to add further context to some of the key examples that are talked about.    Unfortunately, that overall thoroughness and passion for detail might end up doubling as the book's greatest weakness. This is not a book that I think most people could reasonably absorb in a short amount of time. Not only does the text cover a wide spectrum of times, cultures and fandoms, but it also presents that information in an extremely direct and scholarly way. Obviously given the overall intention and subject matter, such density is to be expected. However, this even bleeds into the sentence by sentence prose. Granted, I do not have the most astute attention span, but when certain sections can be filled with sentences that go on for 5 to 6 lines at a time, it's easy to get lost and not properly absorb the sheer amount of detail without a couple of rereads. None of this is helped by the fact that reading this as a cosplayer can sort of be a double-edged sword because while you can appreciate the information that is not commonly known to a lot of people, some sections can feel redundant in how they explain or set up events that are already obvious to those who have had those experiences. Looking back, I do think some sections could've been a bit more condensed or perhaps there could've been a more efficient way of easing readers into the sheer bulk of history that is about to be dropped on them.    However, the fact that I found a historical and cultural analysis of cosplay overwhelming is kind of an accomplishment in and of itself. Every section was filled with new information that only made me grow more and more respect for the medium. It was amazing seeing this almost logical progression of cosplay culture from the early days until present day and a culture that is still evolving as I am writing this review now. If anything, this book made me feel proud to be a cosplayer at a time when circumstances make certain forms of expression more difficult than they used to be. I have nothing but respect and appreciation for the amount of love, thought, and care that went into this book.

Review:         Synopsis:        Through a culmination of years of personal research on cosplay, author Frenchy Lunning combines the fascinating viewpoints of cosplayers with observational, in-depth research on cosplay history, its practices, and a deep dive into critical theory involving the modes of fictional existence, in order to understand its global expansion. Who was the first cosplayer? How has cosplay's relationship with popular culture changed throughout the decades? What are the different ways the practice is executed and celebrated throughout the world? Cosplay: The Fictional Mode of Existence is an interesting examination of identity, performance, play, and otaku fandom in its relation to the growing art of cosplay.     Review:            Cosplay is one of the cornerstones of pop culture celebration. Whether it's science-fiction, fantasy, western, or eastern animation, it feels like you don't have to go far nowadays to come across people that wear their love for these mediums on their sleeves in a very literal way. Granted, in my passive research, a lot of media use cosplay as an extension of nerd fandom or otaku culture, but very rarely is it seen as a focus of cultural significance in and of itself. So as someone who has cosplayed for roughly the past decade with a fluctuating involvement in the larger cosplay community, do I think the text accomplishes that goal of proper focus and attention? Yes I do and with flying colors to boot.    The best way to describe Cosplay: The Fictional Mode of Existence would be that it is an amazing outline for a cosplay 101 class that could be taught in a college semester. Yes, I understand that to some people that might sound silly because there can't possibly be that much informed history and social analysis to actually teach a class over an extended period of time…right? I will admit I was one of those people. Of course I knew cosplay had to have started somewhere and that the way things are now probably wasn't the way they were 20 or 30 years ago. However, the sheer extent to which things have evolved that got us to this point shocked me to my very core with questions that I didn't even think could be asked. A speculative yet thorough look at the origins of cosplay and spaces that celebrate them? Oftentimes across different cultures and locations? Check. An extensive breakdown on the parasocial relationship that cosplayers have with their performances as well as the costumes they wear as a form of love and artistic expression? Check. How the evolution of cosplay as a social construct correlates to how collective people evolve as a culture? Check.    This is the most scholarly and straightforward approach to the idea of cosplay that I have ever seen. Granted, I didn't look very far for media like this, but I feel like this book covers so much ground and then some, you could walk away feeling like you just took an extensive course on how interesting this medium is from an angle where you don't even have to cosplay yourself. I feel like I could write half a dozen pages on some of the interesting passive and direct influences that the very concept of cosplaying has had on society and vice versa. I don't feel confident in proclaiming whether or not Lunning considers themselves a cosplayer or as a part of the larger cosplay community. But the sheer love and respect displayed right out the gate in this book feels like it also deserves equal recognition.    Although I will say I'm curious if the author had an extra year or two to include how recent difficult events have affected the cosplay community as well, as COVID-19 not only shut down a majority of the events that are discussed in this book, but in my personal experience, it has also given life to a much more prominent online culture born from people who shoot from home. That's the funny thing, things are always changing and cosplay has always sort of adapted and grown with the times dating back to before the term cosplay was even developed. There was one sentence towards the end of the book that really stood out to me “Cosplay, then, is an art form that may or may not last, but even if it does not, it will always-as it does now-evolve”.    Thankfully the book doesn't try to present itself as some kind of definitive Bible on how cosplay works. It also avoids purporting any definitions revolving around the culture or history above others as some accounts of events can be conflicting and different places might consider different angles. If anything, the book makes it apparent very early on that it is the culmination of various different thoughts, opinions, and definitions from dozens upon dozens of people who could give even a passive insight into this evolving culture. This didn't just include cosplayers old and young but also photographers, historians, scholars, performers, writers etc. all of these are very well cited and documented at the end of the book in a way that is easy to refer to with proper citations (although I will admit reading this in PDF form was a little difficult since I had to constantly scroll back-and-forth. Definitely get a physical copy.) The book is even filled with pictures from the variety of different conventions, plays, and countries in order to add further context to some of the key examples that are talked about.    Unfortunately, that overall thoroughness and passion for detail might end up doubling as the book's greatest weakness. This is not a book that I think most people could reasonably absorb in a short amount of time. Not only does the text cover a wide spectrum of times, cultures and fandoms, but it also presents that information in an extremely direct and scholarly way. Obviously given the overall intention and subject matter, such density is to be expected. However, this even bleeds into the sentence by sentence prose. Granted, I do not have the most astute attention span, but when certain sections can be filled with sentences that go on for 5 to 6 lines at a time, it's easy to get lost and not properly absorb the sheer amount of detail without a couple of rereads. None of this is helped by the fact that reading this as a cosplayer can sort of be a double-edged sword because while you can appreciate the information that is not commonly known to a lot of people, some sections can feel redundant in how they explain or set up events that are already obvious to those who have had those experiences. Looking back, I do think some sections could've been a bit more condensed or perhaps there could've been a more efficient way of easing readers into the sheer bulk of history that is about to be dropped on them.    However, the fact that I found a historical and cultural analysis of cosplay overwhelming is kind of an accomplishment in and of itself. Every section was filled with new information that only made me grow more and more respect for the medium. It was amazing seeing this almost logical progression of cosplay culture from the early days until present day and a culture that is still evolving as I am writing this review now. If anything, this book made me feel proud to be a cosplayer at a time when circumstances make certain forms of expression more difficult than they used to be.

Review:         Synopsis:        Through a culmination of years of personal research on cosplay, author Frenchy Lunning combines the fascinating viewpoints of cosplayers with observational, in-depth research on cosplay history, its practices, and a deep dive into critical theory involving the modes of fictional existence, in order to understand its global expansion. Who was the first cosplayer? How has cosplay's relationship with popular culture changed throughout the decades? What are the different ways the practice is executed and celebrated throughout the world? Cosplay: The Fictional Mode of Existence is an interesting examination of identity, performance, play, and otaku fandom in its relation to the growing art of cosplay.     Review:            Cosplay is one of the cornerstones of pop culture celebration. Whether it's science-fiction, fantasy, western, or eastern animation, it feels like you don't have to go far nowadays to come across people that wear their love for these mediums on their sleeves in a very literal way. Granted, in my passive research, a lot of media use cosplay as an extension of nerd fandom or otaku culture, but very rarely is it seen as a focus of cultural significance in and of itself. So as someone who has cosplayed for roughly the past decade with a fluctuating involvement in the larger cosplay community, do I think the text accomplishes that goal of proper focus and attention? Yes I do and with flying colors to boot.    The best way to describe Cosplay: The Fictional Mode of Existence would be that it is an amazing outline for a cosplay 101 class that could be taught in a college semester. Yes, I understand that to some people that might sound silly because there can't possibly be that much informed history and social analysis to actually teach a class over an extended period of time…right? I will admit I was one of those people. Of course I knew cosplay had to have started somewhere and that the way things are now probably wasn't the way they were 20 or 30 years ago. However, the sheer extent to which things have evolved that got us to this point shocked me to my very core with questions that I didn't even think could be asked. A speculative yet thorough look at the origins of cosplay and spaces that celebrate them? Oftentimes across different cultures and locations? Check. An extensive breakdown on the parasocial relationship that cosplayers have with their performances as well as the costumes they wear as a form of love and artistic expression? Check. How the evolution of cosplay as a social construct correlates to how collective people evolve as a culture? Check.    This is the most scholarly and straightforward approach to the idea of cosplay that I have ever seen. Granted, I didn't look very far for media like this, but I feel like this book covers so much ground and then some, you could walk away feeling like you just took an extensive course on how interesting this medium is from an angle where you don't even have to cosplay yourself. I feel like I could write half a dozen pages on some of the interesting passive and direct influences that the very concept of cosplaying has had on society and vice versa. I don't feel confident in proclaiming whether or not Lunning considers themselves a cosplayer or as a part of the larger cosplay community. But the sheer love and respect displayed right out the gate in this book feels like it also deserves equal recognition.    Although I will say I'm curious if the author had an extra year or two to include how recent difficult events have affected the cosplay community as well, as COVID-19 not only shut down a majority of the events that are discussed in this book, but in my personal experience, it has also given life to a much more prominent online culture born from people who shoot from home. That's the funny thing, things are always changing and cosplay has always sort of adapted and grown with the times dating back to before the term cosplay was even developed. There was one sentence towards the end of the book that really stood out to me “Cosplay, then, is an art form that may or may not last, but even if it does not, it will always-as it does now-evolve”.    Thankfully the book doesn't try to present itself as some kind of definitive Bible on how cosplay works. It also avoids purporting any definitions revolving around the culture or history above others as some accounts of events can be conflicting and different places might consider different angles. If anything, the book makes it apparent very early on that it is the culmination of various different thoughts, opinions, and definitions from dozens upon dozens of people who could give even a passive insight into this evolving culture. This didn't just include cosplayers old and young but also photographers, historians, scholars, performers, writers etc. all of these are very well cited and documented at the end of the book in a way that is easy to refer to with proper citations (although I will admit reading this in PDF form was a little difficult since I had to constantly scroll back-and-forth. Definitely get a physical copy.) The book is even filled with pictures from the variety of different conventions, plays, and countries in order to add further context to some of the key examples that are talked about.    Unfortunately, that overall thoroughness and passion for detail might end up doubling as the book's greatest weakness. This is not a book that I think most people could reasonably absorb in a short amount of time. Not only does the text cover a wide spectrum of times, cultures and fandoms, but it also presents that information in an extremely direct and scholarly way. Obviously given the overall intention and subject matter, such density is to be expected. However, this even bleeds into the sentence by sentence prose. Granted, I do not have the most astute attention span, but when certain sections can be filled with sentences that go on for 5 to 6 lines at a time, it's easy to get lost and not properly absorb the sheer amount of detail without a couple of rereads. None of this is helped by the fact that reading this as a cosplayer can sort of be a double-edged sword because while you can appreciate the information that is not commonly known to a lot of people, some sections can feel redundant in how they explain or set up events that are already obvious to those who have had those experiences. Looking back, I do think some sections could've been a bit more condensed or perhaps there could've been a more efficient way of easing readers into the sheer bulk of history that is about to be dropped on them.    However, the fact that I found a historical and cultural analysis of cosplay overwhelming is kind of an accomplishment in and of itself. Every section was filled with new information that only made me grow more and more respect for the medium. It was amazing seeing this almost logical progression of cosplay culture from the early days until present day and a culture that is still evolving as I am writing this review now. If anything, this book made me feel proud to be a cosplayer at a time when circumstances make certain forms of expression more difficult than they used to be. I have nothing but respect and appreciation for the amount of love, thought, and care that went into this book.

Review:         Synopsis:        Through a culmination of years of personal research on cosplay, author Frenchy Lunning combines the fascinating viewpoints of cosplayers with observational, in-depth research on cosplay history, its practices, and a deep dive into critical theory involving the modes of fictional existence, in order to understand its global expansion. Who was the first cosplayer? How has cosplay's relationship with popular culture changed throughout the decades? What are the different ways the practice is executed and celebrated throughout the world? Cosplay: The Fictional Mode of Existence is an interesting examination of identity, performance, play, and otaku fandom in its relation to the growing art of cosplay.     Review:            Cosplay is one of the cornerstones of pop culture celebration. Whether it's science-fiction, fantasy, western, or eastern animation, it feels like you don't have to go far nowadays to come across people that wear their love for these mediums on their sleeves in a very literal way. Granted, in my passive research, a lot of media use cosplay as an extension of nerd fandom or otaku culture, but very rarely is it seen as a focus of cultural significance in and of itself. So as someone who has cosplayed for roughly the past decade with a fluctuating involvement in the larger cosplay community, do I think the text accomplishes that goal of proper focus and attention? Yes I do and with flying colors to boot.    The best way to describe Cosplay: The Fictional Mode of Existence would be that it is an amazing outline for a cosplay 101 class that could be taught in a college semester. Yes, I understand that to some people that might sound silly because there can't possibly be that much informed history and social analysis to actually teach a class over an extended period of time…right? I will admit I was one of those people. Of course I knew cosplay had to have started somewhere and that the way things are now probably wasn't the way they were 20 or 30 years ago. However, the sheer extent to which things have evolved that got us to this point shocked me to my very core with questions that I didn't even think could be asked. A speculative yet thorough look at the origins of cosplay and spaces that celebrate them? Oftentimes across different cultures and locations? Check. An extensive breakdown on the parasocial relationship that cosplayers have with their performances as well as the costumes they wear as a form of love and artistic expression? Check. How the evolution of cosplay as a social construct correlates to how collective people evolve as a culture? Check.    This is the most scholarly and straightforward approach to the idea of cosplay that I have ever seen. Granted, I didn't look very far for media like this, but I feel like this book covers so much ground and then some, you could walk away feeling like you just took an extensive course on how interesting this medium is from an angle where you don't even have to cosplay yourself. I feel like I could write half a dozen pages on some of the interesting passive and direct influences that the very concept of cosplaying has had on society and vice versa. I don't feel confident in proclaiming whether or not Lunning considers themselves a cosplayer or as a part of the larger cosplay community. But the sheer love and respect displayed right out the gate in this book feels like it also deserves equal recognition.    Although I will say I'm curious if the author had an extra year or two to include how recent difficult events have affected the cosplay community as well, as COVID-19 not only shut down a majority of the events that are discussed in this book, but in my personal experience, it has also given life to a much more prominent online culture born from people who shoot from home. That's the funny thing, things are always changing and cosplay has always sort of adapted and grown with the times dating back to before the term cosplay was even developed. There was one sentence towards the end of the book that really stood out to me “Cosplay, then, is an art form that may or may not last, but even if it does not, it will always-as it does now-evolve”.    Thankfully the book doesn't try to present itself as some kind of definitive Bible on how cosplay works. It also avoids purporting any definitions revolving around the culture or history above others as some accounts of events can be conflicting and different places might consider different angles. If anything, the book makes it apparent very early on that it is the culmination of various different thoughts, opinions, and definitions from dozens upon dozens of people who could give even a passive insight into this evolving culture. This didn't just include cosplayers old and young but also photographers, historians, scholars, performers, writers etc. all of these are very well cited and documented at the end of the book in a way that is easy to refer to with proper citations (although I will admit reading this in PDF form was a little difficult since I had to constantly scroll back-and-forth. Definitely get a physical copy.) The book is even filled with pictures from the variety of different conventions, plays, and countries in order to add further context to some of the key examples that are talked about.    Unfortunately, that overall thoroughness and passion for detail might end up doubling as the book's greatest weakness. This is not a book that I think most people could reasonably absorb in a short amount of time. Not only does the text cover a wide spectrum of times, cultures and fandoms, but it also presents that information in an extremely direct and scholarly way. Obviously given the overall intention and subject matter, such density is to be expected. However, this even bleeds into the sentence by sentence prose. Granted, I do not have the most astute attention span, but when certain sections can be filled with sentences that go on for 5 to 6 lines at a time, it's easy to get lost and not properly absorb the sheer amount of detail without a couple of rereads. None of this is helped by the fact that reading this as a cosplayer can sort of be a double-edged sword because while you can appreciate the information that is not commonly known to a lot of people, some sections can feel redundant in how they explain or set up events that are already obvious to those who have had those experiences. Looking back, I do think some sections could've been a bit more condensed or perhaps there could've been a more efficient way of easing readers into the sheer bulk of history that is about to be dropped on them.    However, the fact that I found a historical and cultural analysis of cosplay overwhelming is kind of an accomplishment in and of itself. Every section was filled with new information that only made me grow more and more respect for the medium. It was amazing seeing this almost logical progression of cosplay culture from the early days until present day and a culture that is still evolving as I am writing this review now. If anything, this book made me feel proud to be a cosplayer at a time when circumstances make certain forms of expression more difficult than they used to be. I have nothing but respect and appreciation for the amount of love, thought, and care that went into this book. You might have to set aside a good amount of time to go through it, but I definitely think this is a must read for those curious about cosplay or for those who are at all interested in where things got started or want to theorize on where things might go next.

Review   by Lynzee Loveridge, Apr  1st 2022       Project A-ko Perfect Edition Blu-ray                     Synopsis:               When super-powered school girl A-ko isn't rushing to class with her cry-baby friend C-ko, she's destroying school property in her battles with B-ko. Her carefree days of wanton destruction are about to get a serious wrench thrown in them however, when an alien menace descends on her futuristic hometown of Graviton City.    We're revisiting the 1986 classic from Discotek, issued in high-definition for the first time with all the bells and whistles!       Review:         Synopsis:          When super-powered school girl A-ko isn't rushing to class with her cry-baby friend C-ko, she's destroying school property in her battles with B-ko. Her carefree days of wanton destruction are about to get a serious wrench thrown in them however, when an alien menace descends on her futuristic hometown of Graviton City.    We're revisiting the 1986 classic from Discotek, issued in high-definition for the first time with all the bells and whistles!      Review:            I'm here to answer three questions looming over this release. Is Project A-ko worth watching for newcomers? If you have seen it before, is this edition worth your time? Lastly, what are the special features that make this the ""perfect edition?""    For the uninitiated, Project A-ko is a 1986 anime film that was widely successful in Japan and groundbreaking for the U.S. market. This isn't a piece of quaint retro media; it was formative to early English-language fandom as one of the first anime fans could (legally) get on tape. It was initially pitched as a direct-to-video release as part of the Cream Lemon erotica series, but producers must have seen its potential for wider appeal, and it was reworked as a mainstream title with a bit of spicy content left in. By and large though, Project A-ko is a sci-fi comedy full of impressive action set pieces, mechanical designs, and physical humor that surprisingly still holds up over 30 years later.    The film's premise is pretty straightforward: Super-powered A-ko lives in Graviton City, a place in the near future that has experienced a surge in technological development after recovering from a meteor strike. She and her childhood friend C-ko are new high school students and perpetually late for class. The crybaby C-ko immediately catches the attention of the wealthy queen bee and part-time inventor B-ko who makes it her mission to defeat A-ko and claim B-ko for herself. In the background, an alien ship is approaching Graviton City in search of their missing princess.    Much of the film's charm is thanks to its commitment to the bit. If that means five slightly varying sequences of A-ko thundering through a neighborhood and crashing into the alien spy D, so be it. Will she ever lose to B-ko in their quickly escalating face offs? Probably not, but director Katsuhiko Nishijima (who was only 24 at the time) and the rest of the animation crew know how to defy viewer's expectations. A build-up to a fight is just as likely to end in a quick leg sweep as it is to turn into a full-out brawl.    If I had to levy any criticisms at the queer-charged narrative, it's that the pacing can be a bit all over the place. There are a few beats that feel like the story is drawing out for time until it finally gets to the explosive climax, but Project A-ko runs on spectacle. Just as the audience feels inclined to groan at yet another ""race to school before the bell"" sequence, the movie changes it up with a different diversion. My other primary complaint is that the joke reveal that all the aliens are women hasn't aged well. It isn't malicious, but it does feel dated to a time when ""manly women"" (and all the baggage that came with it) were a common punchline.    Visually, this is the best Project A-ko has ever (and perhaps will ever) look. There's a great feature over on Crunchyroll by Paul Chapman that discusses the wild story of how Discotek pulled off this remaster. The condensed version, as was told to me by Justin Sevakis, is that the team was remastering the film manually through a new process (referred to on Discotek releases as AstroRes) that was pitched to them out of the UK. At that time, the original 35mm film was considered lost. As the restoration process marched on, Robert Woodhead, the founder and owner of AnimEigo, would become the unsung hero of the release. Through what was discovered to be a filing error, Woodhead found the original 35mm film elements of Project A-ko.    The results are fantastic. I had seen the the CPM release of A-ko back in the early aughts and was lucky enough to be at the Otakon viewing last year. Watching it again at home, the clean-up work and color correction are stellar. From A-ko's hair to the giant spaceships, there's a deeper richness to the hues that create a superior and more enjoyable experience. At the risk of sounding like I'm repeating my praises from Discotek's Memories release, this is worth viewing just for the animation alone. But it's the special features that really sell it.    Project A-ko's unique history extends to its musical score. The anime features three vocal tracks and a score composed and produced by Joey Carbone and Richie Zito with performances by Anne Livingston, Samantha Newark, Valerie Stevenson, and George Doering. There's a great 30-minute documentary with Carbone, Zito, Livingston, and Newark that discusses how they were brought on to the project and their specific places in music history. I'm not an 80s pop music buff, so consider how surprised I was to learn that besides some bopping tracks, the creators were heavily influential in mainstream music. The special features are full of interesting insights like this, whether it's a 1980s behind-the-scenes doc shot by a Japanese film crew in Los Angeles or a quick playthrough of an abandoned CD-Rom game. These are features that aren't just nice to have but provide a full context of why Project A-ko has its place as a seminal part of anime history.    Project A-ko is a good romp. Personally, I recommend watching it with friends while eating fried chicken to get the perfect vibes. Throw it in when the world feels a little too much and let A-ko's physical hijinks clear up your bad day.

Review   by Lynzee Loveridge, Apr  1st 2022       Project A-ko Perfect Edition Blu-ray                     Synopsis:               When super-powered school girl A-ko isn't rushing to class with her cry-baby friend C-ko, she's destroying school property in her battles with B-ko. Her carefree days of wanton destruction are about to get a serious wrench thrown in them however, when an alien menace descends on her futuristic hometown of Graviton City.    We're revisiting the 1986 classic from Discotek, issued in high-definition for the first time with all the bells and whistles!       Review:         Synopsis:          When super-powered school girl A-ko isn't rushing to class with her cry-baby friend C-ko, she's destroying school property in her battles with B-ko. Her carefree days of wanton destruction are about to get a serious wrench thrown in them however, when an alien menace descends on her futuristic hometown of Graviton City.    We're revisiting the 1986 classic from Discotek, issued in high-definition for the first time with all the bells and whistles!      Review:            I'm here to answer three questions looming over this release. Is Project A-ko worth watching for newcomers? If you have seen it before, is this edition worth your time? Lastly, what are the special features that make this the ""perfect edition?""    For the uninitiated, Project A-ko is a 1986 anime film that was widely successful in Japan and groundbreaking for the U.S. market. This isn't a piece of quaint retro media; it was formative to early English-language fandom as one of the first anime fans could (legally) get on tape. It was initially pitched as a direct-to-video release as part of the Cream Lemon erotica series, but producers must have seen its potential for wider appeal, and it was reworked as a mainstream title with a bit of spicy content left in. By and large though, Project A-ko is a sci-fi comedy full of impressive action set pieces, mechanical designs, and physical humor that surprisingly still holds up over 30 years later.    The film's premise is pretty straightforward: Super-powered A-ko lives in Graviton City, a place in the near future that has experienced a surge in technological development after recovering from a meteor strike. She and her childhood friend C-ko are new high school students and perpetually late for class. The crybaby C-ko immediately catches the attention of the wealthy queen bee and part-time inventor B-ko who makes it her mission to defeat A-ko and claim B-ko for herself. In the background, an alien ship is approaching Graviton City in search of their missing princess.    Much of the film's charm is thanks to its commitment to the bit. If that means five slightly varying sequences of A-ko thundering through a neighborhood and crashing into the alien spy D, so be it. Will she ever lose to B-ko in their quickly escalating face offs? Probably not, but director Katsuhiko Nishijima (who was only 24 at the time) and the rest of the animation crew know how to defy viewer's expectations. A build-up to a fight is just as likely to end in a quick leg sweep as it is to turn into a full-out brawl.    If I had to levy any criticisms at the queer-charged narrative, it's that the pacing can be a bit all over the place. There are a few beats that feel like the story is drawing out for time until it finally gets to the explosive climax, but Project A-ko runs on spectacle. Just as the audience feels inclined to groan at yet another ""race to school before the bell"" sequence, the movie changes it up with a different diversion. My other primary complaint is that the joke reveal that all the aliens are women hasn't aged well. It isn't malicious, but it does feel dated to a time when ""manly women"" (and all the baggage that came with it) were a common punchline.    Visually, this is the best Project A-ko has ever (and perhaps will ever) look. There's a great feature over on Crunchyroll by Paul Chapman that discusses the wild story of how Discotek pulled off this remaster. The condensed version, as was told to me by Justin Sevakis, is that the team was remastering the film manually through a new process (referred to on Discotek releases as AstroRes) that was pitched to them out of the UK. At that time, the original 35mm film was considered lost. As the restoration process marched on, Robert Woodhead, the founder and owner of AnimEigo, would become the unsung hero of the release. Through what was discovered to be a filing error, Woodhead found the original 35mm film elements of Project A-ko.    The results are fantastic. I had seen the the CPM release of A-ko back in the early aughts and was lucky enough to be at the Otakon viewing last year. Watching it again at home, the clean-up work and color correction are stellar. From A-ko's hair to the giant spaceships, there's a deeper richness to the hues that create a superior and more enjoyable experience. At the risk of sounding like I'm repeating my praises from Discotek's Memories release, this is worth viewing just for the animation alone. But it's the special features that really sell it.    Project A-ko's unique history extends to its musical score. The anime features three vocal tracks and a score composed and produced by Joey Carbone and Richie Zito with performances by Anne Livingston, Samantha Newark, Valerie Stevenson, and George Doering. There's a great 30-minute documentary with Carbone, Zito, Livingston, and Newark that discusses how they were brought on to the project and their specific places in music history. I'm not an 80s pop music buff, so consider how surprised I was to learn that besides some bopping tracks, the creators were heavily influential in mainstream music. The special features are full of interesting insights like this, whether it's a 1980s behind-the-scenes doc shot by a Japanese film crew in Los Angeles or a quick playthrough of an abandoned CD-Rom game. These are features that aren't just nice to have but provide a full context of why Project A-ko has its place as a seminal part of anime history.    Project A-ko is a good romp. Personally, I recommend watching it with friends while eating fried chicken to get the perfect vibes. Throw it in when the world feels a little too much and let A-ko's physical hijinks clear up your bad day.

Review   by Lynzee Loveridge, Apr  1st 2022       Project A-ko Perfect Edition Blu-ray                     Synopsis:               When super-powered school girl A-ko isn't rushing to class with her cry-baby friend C-ko, she's destroying school property in her battles with B-ko. Her carefree days of wanton destruction are about to get a serious wrench thrown in them however, when an alien menace descends on her futuristic hometown of Graviton City.    We're revisiting the 1986 classic from Discotek, issued in high-definition for the first time with all the bells and whistles!       Review:         Synopsis:          When super-powered school girl A-ko isn't rushing to class with her cry-baby friend C-ko, she's destroying school property in her battles with B-ko. Her carefree days of wanton destruction are about to get a serious wrench thrown in them however, when an alien menace descends on her futuristic hometown of Graviton City.    We're revisiting the 1986 classic from Discotek, issued in high-definition for the first time with all the bells and whistles!      Review:            I'm here to answer three questions looming over this release. Is Project A-ko worth watching for newcomers? If you have seen it before, is this edition worth your time? Lastly, what are the special features that make this the ""perfect edition?""    For the uninitiated, Project A-ko is a 1986 anime film that was widely successful in Japan and groundbreaking for the U.S. market. This isn't a piece of quaint retro media; it was formative to early English-language fandom as one of the first anime fans could (legally) get on tape. It was initially pitched as a direct-to-video release as part of the Cream Lemon erotica series, but producers must have seen its potential for wider appeal, and it was reworked as a mainstream title with a bit of spicy content left in. By and large though, Project A-ko is a sci-fi comedy full of impressive action set pieces, mechanical designs, and physical humor that surprisingly still holds up over 30 years later.    The film's premise is pretty straightforward: Super-powered A-ko lives in Graviton City, a place in the near future that has experienced a surge in technological development after recovering from a meteor strike. She and her childhood friend C-ko are new high school students and perpetually late for class. The crybaby C-ko immediately catches the attention of the wealthy queen bee and part-time inventor B-ko who makes it her mission to defeat A-ko and claim B-ko for herself. In the background, an alien ship is approaching Graviton City in search of their missing princess.    Much of the film's charm is thanks to its commitment to the bit. If that means five slightly varying sequences of A-ko thundering through a neighborhood and crashing into the alien spy D, so be it. Will she ever lose to B-ko in their quickly escalating face offs? Probably not, but director Katsuhiko Nishijima (who was only 24 at the time) and the rest of the animation crew know how to defy viewer's expectations. A build-up to a fight is just as likely to end in a quick leg sweep as it is to turn into a full-out brawl.    If I had to levy any criticisms at the queer-charged narrative, it's that the pacing can be a bit all over the place. There are a few beats that feel like the story is drawing out for time until it finally gets to the explosive climax, but Project A-ko runs on spectacle. Just as the audience feels inclined to groan at yet another ""race to school before the bell"" sequence, the movie changes it up with a different diversion. My other primary complaint is that the joke reveal that all the aliens are women hasn't aged well. It isn't malicious, but it does feel dated to a time when ""manly women"" (and all the baggage that came with it) were a common punchline.    Visually, this is the best Project A-ko has ever (and perhaps will ever) look. There's a great feature over on Crunchyroll by Paul Chapman that discusses the wild story of how Discotek pulled off this remaster. The condensed version, as was told to me by Justin Sevakis, is that the team was remastering the film manually through a new process (referred to on Discotek releases as AstroRes) that was pitched to them out of the UK. At that time, the original 35mm film was considered lost. As the restoration process marched on, Robert Woodhead, the founder and owner of AnimEigo, would become the unsung hero of the release. Through what was discovered to be a filing error, Woodhead found the original 35mm film elements of Project A-ko.    The results are fantastic. I had seen the the CPM release of A-ko back in the early aughts and was lucky enough to be at the Otakon viewing last year. Watching it again at home, the clean-up work and color correction are stellar. From A-ko's hair to the giant spaceships, there's a deeper richness to the hues that create a superior and more enjoyable experience. At the risk of sounding like I'm repeating my praises from Discotek's Memories release, this is worth viewing just for the animation alone. But it's the special features that really sell it.    Project A-ko's unique history extends to its musical score. The anime features three vocal tracks and a score composed and produced by Joey Carbone and Richie Zito with performances by Anne Livingston, Samantha Newark, Valerie Stevenson, and George Doering. There's a great 30-minute documentary with Carbone, Zito, Livingston, and Newark that discusses how they were brought on to the project and their specific places in music history. I'm not an 80s pop music buff, so consider how surprised I was to learn that besides some bopping tracks, the creators were heavily influential in mainstream music. The special features are full of interesting insights like this, whether it's a 1980s behind-the-scenes doc shot by a Japanese film crew in Los Angeles or a quick playthrough of an abandoned CD-Rom game. These are features that aren't just nice to have but provide a full context of why Project A-ko has its place as a seminal part of anime history.    Project A-ko is a good romp. Personally, I recommend watching it with friends while eating fried chicken to get the perfect vibes. Throw it in when the world feels a little too much and let A-ko's physical hijinks clear up your bad day.

Review   by Lynzee Loveridge, Apr  1st 2022       Project A-ko Perfect Edition Blu-ray                     Synopsis:               When super-powered school girl A-ko isn't rushing to class with her cry-baby friend C-ko, she's destroying school property in her battles with B-ko. Her carefree days of wanton destruction are about to get a serious wrench thrown in them however, when an alien menace descends on her futuristic hometown of Graviton City.    We're revisiting the 1986 classic from Discotek, issued in high-definition for the first time with all the bells and whistles!       Review:         Synopsis:          When super-powered school girl A-ko isn't rushing to class with her cry-baby friend C-ko, she's destroying school property in her battles with B-ko. Her carefree days of wanton destruction are about to get a serious wrench thrown in them however, when an alien menace descends on her futuristic hometown of Graviton City.    We're revisiting the 1986 classic from Discotek, issued in high-definition for the first time with all the bells and whistles!      Review:            I'm here to answer three questions looming over this release. Is Project A-ko worth watching for newcomers? If you have seen it before, is this edition worth your time? Lastly, what are the special features that make this the ""perfect edition?""    For the uninitiated, Project A-ko is a 1986 anime film that was widely successful in Japan and groundbreaking for the U.S. market. This isn't a piece of quaint retro media; it was formative to early English-language fandom as one of the first anime fans could (legally) get on tape. It was initially pitched as a direct-to-video release as part of the Cream Lemon erotica series, but producers must have seen its potential for wider appeal, and it was reworked as a mainstream title with a bit of spicy content left in. By and large though, Project A-ko is a sci-fi comedy full of impressive action set pieces, mechanical designs, and physical humor that surprisingly still holds up over 30 years later.    The film's premise is pretty straightforward: Super-powered A-ko lives in Graviton City, a place in the near future that has experienced a surge in technological development after recovering from a meteor strike. She and her childhood friend C-ko are new high school students and perpetually late for class. The crybaby C-ko immediately catches the attention of the wealthy queen bee and part-time inventor B-ko who makes it her mission to defeat A-ko and claim B-ko for herself. In the background, an alien ship is approaching Graviton City in search of their missing princess.    Much of the film's charm is thanks to its commitment to the bit. If that means five slightly varying sequences of A-ko thundering through a neighborhood and crashing into the alien spy D, so be it. Will she ever lose to B-ko in their quickly escalating face offs? Probably not, but director Katsuhiko Nishijima (who was only 24 at the time) and the rest of the animation crew know how to defy viewer's expectations. A build-up to a fight is just as likely to end in a quick leg sweep as it is to turn into a full-out brawl.    If I had to levy any criticisms at the queer-charged narrative, it's that the pacing can be a bit all over the place. There are a few beats that feel like the story is drawing out for time until it finally gets to the explosive climax, but Project A-ko runs on spectacle. Just as the audience feels inclined to groan at yet another ""race to school before the bell"" sequence, the movie changes it up with a different diversion. My other primary complaint is that the joke reveal that all the aliens are women hasn't aged well. It isn't malicious, but it does feel dated to a time when ""manly women"" (and all the baggage that came with it) were a common punchline.    Visually, this is the best Project A-ko has ever (and perhaps will ever) look. There's a great feature over on Crunchyroll by Paul Chapman that discusses the wild story of how Discotek pulled off this remaster. The condensed version, as was told to me by Justin Sevakis, is that the team was remastering the film manually through a new process (referred to on Discotek releases as AstroRes) that was pitched to them out of the UK. At that time, the original 35mm film was considered lost. As the restoration process marched on, Robert Woodhead, the founder and owner of AnimEigo, would become the unsung hero of the release. Through what was discovered to be a filing error, Woodhead found the original 35mm film elements of Project A-ko.    The results are fantastic. I had seen the the CPM release of A-ko back in the early aughts and was lucky enough to be at the Otakon viewing last year. Watching it again at home, the clean-up work and color correction are stellar. From A-ko's hair to the giant spaceships, there's a deeper richness to the hues that create a superior and more enjoyable experience. At the risk of sounding like I'm repeating my praises from Discotek's Memories release, this is worth viewing just for the animation alone. But it's the special features that really sell it.    Project A-ko's unique history extends to its musical score. The anime features three vocal tracks and a score composed and produced by Joey Carbone and Richie Zito with performances by Anne Livingston, Samantha Newark, Valerie Stevenson, and George Doering. There's a great 30-minute documentary with Carbone, Zito, Livingston, and Newark that discusses how they were brought on to the project and their specific places in music history. I'm not an 80s pop music buff, so consider how surprised I was to learn that besides some bopping tracks, the creators were heavily influential in mainstream music. The special features are full of interesting insights like this, whether it's a 1980s behind-the-scenes doc shot by a Japanese film crew in Los Angeles or a quick playthrough of an abandoned CD-Rom game. These are features that aren't just nice to have but provide a full context of why Project A-ko has its place as a seminal part of anime history.    Project A-ko is a good romp. Personally, I recommend watching it with friends while eating fried chicken to get the perfect vibes. Throw it in when the world feels a little too much and let A-ko's physical hijinks clear up your bad day.

Her carefree days of wanton destruction are about to get a serious wrench thrown in them however, when an alien menace descends on her futuristic hometown of Graviton City.    We're revisiting the 1986 classic from Discotek, issued in high-definition for the first time with all the bells and whistles!      Review:            I'm here to answer three questions looming over this release. Is Project A-ko worth watching for newcomers? If you have seen it before, is this edition worth your time? Lastly, what are the special features that make this the ""perfect edition?""    For the uninitiated, Project A-ko is a 1986 anime film that was widely successful in Japan and groundbreaking for the U.S. market. This isn't a piece of quaint retro media; it was formative to early English-language fandom as one of the first anime fans could (legally) get on tape. It was initially pitched as a direct-to-video release as part of the Cream Lemon erotica series, but producers must have seen its potential for wider appeal, and it was reworked as a mainstream title with a bit of spicy content left in. By and large though, Project A-ko is a sci-fi comedy full of impressive action set pieces, mechanical designs, and physical humor that surprisingly still holds up over 30 years later.    The film's premise is pretty straightforward: Super-powered A-ko lives in Graviton City, a place in the near future that has experienced a surge in technological development after recovering from a meteor strike. She and her childhood friend C-ko are new high school students and perpetually late for class. The crybaby C-ko immediately catches the attention of the wealthy queen bee and part-time inventor B-ko who makes it her mission to defeat A-ko and claim B-ko for herself. In the background, an alien ship is approaching Graviton City in search of their missing princess.    Much of the film's charm is thanks to its commitment to the bit. If that means five slightly varying sequences of A-ko thundering through a neighborhood and crashing into the alien spy D, so be it. Will she ever lose to B-ko in their quickly escalating face offs? Probably not, but director Katsuhiko Nishijima (who was only 24 at the time) and the rest of the animation crew know how to defy viewer's expectations. A build-up to a fight is just as likely to end in a quick leg sweep as it is to turn into a full-out brawl.    If I had to levy any criticisms at the queer-charged narrative, it's that the pacing can be a bit all over the place. There are a few beats that feel like the story is drawing out for time until it finally gets to the explosive climax, but Project A-ko runs on spectacle. Just as the audience feels inclined to groan at yet another ""race to school before the bell"" sequence, the movie changes it up with a different diversion. My other primary complaint is that the joke reveal that all the aliens are women hasn't aged well. It isn't malicious, but it does feel dated to a time when ""manly women"" (and all the baggage that came with it) were a common punchline.    Visually, this is the best Project A-ko has ever (and perhaps will ever) look. There's a great feature over on Crunchyroll by Paul Chapman that discusses the wild story of how Discotek pulled off this remaster. The condensed version, as was told to me by Justin Sevakis, is that the team was remastering the film manually through a new process (referred to on Discotek releases as AstroRes) that was pitched to them out of the UK. At that time, the original 35mm film was considered lost. As the restoration process marched on, Robert Woodhead, the founder and owner of AnimEigo, would become the unsung hero of the release. Through what was discovered to be a filing error, Woodhead found the original 35mm film elements of Project A-ko.    The results are fantastic. I had seen the the CPM release of A-ko back in the early aughts and was lucky enough to be at the Otakon viewing last year. Watching it again at home, the clean-up work and color correction are stellar. From A-ko's hair to the giant spaceships, there's a deeper richness to the hues that create a superior and more enjoyable experience. At the risk of sounding like I'm repeating my praises from Discotek's Memories release, this is worth viewing just for the animation alone. But it's the special features that really sell it.    Project A-ko's unique history extends to its musical score. The anime features three vocal tracks and a score composed and produced by Joey Carbone and Richie Zito with performances by Anne Livingston, Samantha Newark, Valerie Stevenson, and George Doering. There's a great 30-minute documentary with Carbone, Zito, Livingston, and Newark that discusses how they were brought on to the project and their specific places in music history. I'm not an 80s pop music buff, so consider how surprised I was to learn that besides some bopping tracks, the creators were heavily influential in mainstream music. The special features are full of interesting insights like this, whether it's a 1980s behind-the-scenes doc shot by a Japanese film crew in Los Angeles or a quick playthrough of an abandoned CD-Rom game. These are features that aren't just nice to have but provide a full context of why Project A-ko has its place as a seminal part of anime history.    Project A-ko is a good romp. Personally, I recommend watching it with friends while eating fried chicken to get the perfect vibes. Throw it in when the world feels a little too much and let A-ko's physical hijinks clear up your bad day.

Her carefree days of wanton destruction are about to get a serious wrench thrown in them however, when an alien menace descends on her futuristic hometown of Graviton City.    We're revisiting the 1986 classic from Discotek, issued in high-definition for the first time with all the bells and whistles!      Review:            I'm here to answer three questions looming over this release. Is Project A-ko worth watching for newcomers? If you have seen it before, is this edition worth your time? Lastly, what are the special features that make this the ""perfect edition?""    For the uninitiated, Project A-ko is a 1986 anime film that was widely successful in Japan and groundbreaking for the U.S. market. This isn't a piece of quaint retro media; it was formative to early English-language fandom as one of the first anime fans could (legally) get on tape. It was initially pitched as a direct-to-video release as part of the Cream Lemon erotica series, but producers must have seen its potential for wider appeal, and it was reworked as a mainstream title with a bit of spicy content left in. By and large though, Project A-ko is a sci-fi comedy full of impressive action set pieces, mechanical designs, and physical humor that surprisingly still holds up over 30 years later.    The film's premise is pretty straightforward: Super-powered A-ko lives in Graviton City, a place in the near future that has experienced a surge in technological development after recovering from a meteor strike. She and her childhood friend C-ko are new high school students and perpetually late for class. The crybaby C-ko immediately catches the attention of the wealthy queen bee and part-time inventor B-ko who makes it her mission to defeat A-ko and claim B-ko for herself. In the background, an alien ship is approaching Graviton City in search of their missing princess.    Much of the film's charm is thanks to its commitment to the bit. If that means five slightly varying sequences of A-ko thundering through a neighborhood and crashing into the alien spy D, so be it. Will she ever lose to B-ko in their quickly escalating face offs? Probably not, but director Katsuhiko Nishijima (who was only 24 at the time) and the rest of the animation crew know how to defy viewer's expectations. A build-up to a fight is just as likely to end in a quick leg sweep as it is to turn into a full-out brawl.    If I had to levy any criticisms at the queer-charged narrative, it's that the pacing can be a bit all over the place. There are a few beats that feel like the story is drawing out for time until it finally gets to the explosive climax, but Project A-ko runs on spectacle. Just as the audience feels inclined to groan at yet another ""race to school before the bell"" sequence, the movie changes it up with a different diversion. My other primary complaint is that the joke reveal that all the aliens are women hasn't aged well. It isn't malicious, but it does feel dated to a time when ""manly women"" (and all the baggage that came with it) were a common punchline.    Visually, this is the best Project A-ko has ever (and perhaps will ever) look. There's a great feature over on Crunchyroll by Paul Chapman that discusses the wild story of how Discotek pulled off this remaster. The condensed version, as was told to me by Justin Sevakis, is that the team was remastering the film manually through a new process (referred to on Discotek releases as AstroRes) that was pitched to them out of the UK. At that time, the original 35mm film was considered lost. As the restoration process marched on, Robert Woodhead, the founder and owner of AnimEigo, would become the unsung hero of the release. Through what was discovered to be a filing error, Woodhead found the original 35mm film elements of Project A-ko.    The results are fantastic. I had seen the the CPM release of A-ko back in the early aughts and was lucky enough to be at the Otakon viewing last year. Watching it again at home, the clean-up work and color correction are stellar. From A-ko's hair to the giant spaceships, there's a deeper richness to the hues that create a superior and more enjoyable experience. At the risk of sounding like I'm repeating my praises from Discotek's Memories release, this is worth viewing just for the animation alone. But it's the special features that really sell it.    Project A-ko's unique history extends to its musical score. The anime features three vocal tracks and a score composed and produced by Joey Carbone and Richie Zito with performances by Anne Livingston, Samantha Newark, Valerie Stevenson, and George Doering. There's a great 30-minute documentary with Carbone, Zito, Livingston, and Newark that discusses how they were brought on to the project and their specific places in music history. I'm not an 80s pop music buff, so consider how surprised I was to learn that besides some bopping tracks, the creators were heavily influential in mainstream music. The special features are full of interesting insights like this, whether it's a 1980s behind-the-scenes doc shot by a Japanese film crew in Los Angeles or a quick playthrough of an abandoned CD-Rom game. These are features that aren't just nice to have but provide a full context of why Project A-ko has its place as a seminal part of anime history.    Project A-ko is a good romp. Personally, I recommend watching it with friends while eating fried chicken to get the perfect vibes.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Dance Dance Danseur   Apr  9th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Dance Dance Danseur ?                     Community score: 3.7              What is this?   Junpei Murao was fascinated with ballet as a child, but in his second year of middle school, his father passed away and he decided he needed to become more ""masculine,"" and he gave up on his aspirations. While still having an attachment to ballet, he takes up the martial art of Jeet Kune Do, and becomes popular in his class. Then one day, a new transfer student named Miyako Godai arrives in Junpei's class, and her mother runs a ballet studio. Miyako realizes that Junpei is interested in ballet, and invites him to do ballet together.    Dance Dance Danseur is based on George Asakura's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                 Hey, did you know that toxic masculinity really messes people up? It's insidious. It trickles down to others subconsciously, teaching men, even as children, to encourage those who follow the classical male ideal and shame those who do not. Dance Dance Danseur is like a case study showing how these commonly held beliefs can rob a child of his dream and destiny—and how he has to fight against his own ingrained worldview to get them back.    As a child, we see that Junpei was willing and able to follow his dream to become a ballet dancer. He was even willing to fight his friends when they disparaged it. However, what really messed him up was the death of his father. His father was a martial artist and stuntman; in other words, he was about as stereotypical of a manly man as you can get.    When Junpei brings up his dream to his father, his father initially tries to dissuade him and get him to do Jeet Kun Do instead. This is partly due to his own ingrained toxic masculinity, but it's also because he wants a shared interest through which he can connect with his son. But Junpei can't see that second bit. All he can see is that his father wanted him to do something more manly than ballet, an idea that is reinforced when his uncle (a likewise manly man) tells the young boy to be strong for his family after his father's passing. In his own way, he is trying to help Junpei through his grief by giving him a reason to fight on, but Junpei (being a literal child) only hears: manly=good, girly=bad.    Now, years later, Junpei has done everything he can to be the manliest man he can be. He sees it as his way of honoring his father, making his family and friends happy with how great he has become. The only problem is that in doing so, he has forgone his own chance at true happiness. Is it any surprise he's turned out to be such an angry young man? He forced his own desires deep down inside but they keep bubbling up. The loving support of his mother and sister isn't enough for him to accept his true self. What he needs is someone to confront him on a “masculine level”—to aggressively attack him right in the male ego and make doing ballet part of his manly pride. Its only through regaining his own inborn self-worth—by determining for himself what it means to be a man—that Junpei can find happiness. And while in this episode he has taken a step towards that, it is only the first step of many.    Dance Dance Danseur's first episode is a fantastic breakdown of toxic masculinity and the harm it subconsciously inflicts on children. Moreover, it has fantastic animation and a great moral. Honestly, there's not much here to dislike.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This is one of those premieres that's frustrating in good and bad ways. For the good, when this episode ended I seriously wanted the next one right away, which means this premiere did its job. For the bad, part of the reason I wanted another episode is because this one only feels like half a story.    On the one hand, that may be a good decision – plenty of otherwise good shows rush through their premieres in order to get to some kind of climax, sacrificing important character work to reach a suitably big moment to end on. So it may ultimately be good thing that Junpei's story feels like it's still stuck on the tarmac waiting for permission to take off. Because what we do get from him is really interesting, and tells us a lot about who this kid is and what the overall theme of this story will be. We see a kid who clearly wants to follow his passion, but a mixture of grief and toxic masculinity keeps him from pursuing it.    Those combative forces cause him to waffle a lot through this episode, insisting he's left ballet behind as a childhood whim while coming back to Miyako's studio every day once the offer's extended. It can be a little irksome to see him going back and forth like that, but it also builds anticipation for that moment when he'll finally let go of all that baggage and dance the way he so obviously wants to. But that moment is not coming now, and it does feel a little underwhelming when the episode just kind of stops, rather than ending. We've gotten the setup, but no payoff. There's enough good stuff here that I'm confident that payoff will deliver, but having to wait is, well, frustrating.    The other stumbling block for some will probably be the character designs. An admirable job has been done to translate George Asakura's lanky, limpid-eyed designs for animation. The dance scenes are also all-around solid, capturing the grace and precision that can make ballet such a delight to watch. It's everything that isn't a dance sequence that leaves some worries for me – there's a number of awkward still frames and edits that could just be a consequence of the brisk pace of this premiere, or be portents of a looming production collapse from an overburdened MAPPA. I'd like it to be the former, as there's a ton of potential for an anime that can really deliver on honest-to-goodness ballet performances, and it'd suck to see that fall apart.    Hangups aside, there's a lot of good here and it's a unique offering in an already packed season. That will hopefully make it stand out, and if nothing else I'll be hanging around until we get that big moment of catharsis for Junpei. Consider it a hesitant thumbs up.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                If you don't know, until I broke my left ankle in four places, I was a dancer. Primarily modern dance, but ballet as well, and I was serious about it that I would have, as the unpleasantly abrasive dance teacher says in this episode, given up everything else to pursue it. But that's not how life works, and it certainly gives me mixed feelings about Dance Dance Danseur's first episode. On the one hand, I absolutely agree with some of what the teacher says – to really excel in dance on a professional level, you do have to start early and you do have to give up most other things…and even then, it might not work out, as one of my cousins learned when she was told she didn't have the right body type to ever be a prima ballerina. But there are also ways to enjoy being a dancer without putting in that level of commitment, and there's nothing that says that Junpei can't perform and be a dancer while still keeping up with his other activities.    That of course is part of the conflict. Junpei's always wanted to do ballet, but the levels of fragile and toxic masculinity around him are astronomical, preventing him from pursuing what he loves. His dad's comment that people “already think he's a girl” because he plays piano made my skin crawl, because way to randomly gender music and dance, sir. Then when his uncle (who I suspect may be one of those family friend uncles rather than blood related) tells him after his father's death that Jumpei has to be the man in the family now, the damage is complete—Junpei has to be the man, dancing isn't manly, therefore, he can't be a dancer. It's terrible and all too familiar, and the poor kid is still busy lying to himself when he's a second year in middle school, fooling everyone except his older sister and Miyako, the newish girl at school. Miyako knows a dance move when she sees one, no matter what crap Junpei feeds everyone else about martial arts kicks, and she becomes the one person who's willing to support him—or at least to do so without being a jerk about it, like her mother.    Basically this episode was an exercise in frustration begging for relief that will almost certainly come in later episodes. Junpei is clearly working towards accepting himself and what he loves, and he's got a lot to work through, including being a fourteen-year-old boy who can't think of any reason why Miyako would want him to dance besides that she likes him. (More likely the reason is that there are so few male dancers that she's having a hard time finding a partner her age.) It's mostly a good frustration, because it does look to be in service of something rewarding, and the dancing is well enough animated that we can feel the muscles engaging, especially in the opening performance that hooks Jumpei on dance in the first place. Likewise we can see how Jumpei is self-taught in his movements, which is an excellent detail. I'll need to give it a couple more episodes before I decide, because this is a subject I could be very picky about, but since it seems to be as close to a Swan anime (or even getting the rest of the manga in English) as I'm likely to get, I suspect I'll end up taking it.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review                Odd Taxi: In the Woods   Apr 17, 00:00                 anime    By cleverly reframing its narrative around a series of interviews with the supporting cast, Odd Taxi: In the Woods succeeds where most recap films fail: it's an artistically cohesive film in its own right. ― Odd Taxi was 2021's sleeper anime hit, telling an intricate, original mystery that kept viewers guessing every week.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Dance Dance Danseur   Apr  9th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Dance Dance Danseur ?                     Community score: 3.7              What is this?   Junpei Murao was fascinated with ballet as a child, but in his second year of middle school, his father passed away and he decided he needed to become more ""masculine,"" and he gave up on his aspirations. While still having an attachment to ballet, he takes up the martial art of Jeet Kune Do, and becomes popular in his class. Then one day, a new transfer student named Miyako Godai arrives in Junpei's class, and her mother runs a ballet studio. Miyako realizes that Junpei is interested in ballet, and invites him to do ballet together.    Dance Dance Danseur is based on George Asakura's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                 Hey, did you know that toxic masculinity really messes people up? It's insidious. It trickles down to others subconsciously, teaching men, even as children, to encourage those who follow the classical male ideal and shame those who do not. Dance Dance Danseur is like a case study showing how these commonly held beliefs can rob a child of his dream and destiny—and how he has to fight against his own ingrained worldview to get them back.    As a child, we see that Junpei was willing and able to follow his dream to become a ballet dancer. He was even willing to fight his friends when they disparaged it. However, what really messed him up was the death of his father. His father was a martial artist and stuntman; in other words, he was about as stereotypical of a manly man as you can get.    When Junpei brings up his dream to his father, his father initially tries to dissuade him and get him to do Jeet Kun Do instead. This is partly due to his own ingrained toxic masculinity, but it's also because he wants a shared interest through which he can connect with his son. But Junpei can't see that second bit. All he can see is that his father wanted him to do something more manly than ballet, an idea that is reinforced when his uncle (a likewise manly man) tells the young boy to be strong for his family after his father's passing. In his own way, he is trying to help Junpei through his grief by giving him a reason to fight on, but Junpei (being a literal child) only hears: manly=good, girly=bad.    Now, years later, Junpei has done everything he can to be the manliest man he can be. He sees it as his way of honoring his father, making his family and friends happy with how great he has become. The only problem is that in doing so, he has forgone his own chance at true happiness. Is it any surprise he's turned out to be such an angry young man? He forced his own desires deep down inside but they keep bubbling up. The loving support of his mother and sister isn't enough for him to accept his true self. What he needs is someone to confront him on a “masculine level”—to aggressively attack him right in the male ego and make doing ballet part of his manly pride. Its only through regaining his own inborn self-worth—by determining for himself what it means to be a man—that Junpei can find happiness. And while in this episode he has taken a step towards that, it is only the first step of many.    Dance Dance Danseur's first episode is a fantastic breakdown of toxic masculinity and the harm it subconsciously inflicts on children. Moreover, it has fantastic animation and a great moral. Honestly, there's not much here to dislike.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This is one of those premieres that's frustrating in good and bad ways. For the good, when this episode ended I seriously wanted the next one right away, which means this premiere did its job. For the bad, part of the reason I wanted another episode is because this one only feels like half a story.    On the one hand, that may be a good decision – plenty of otherwise good shows rush through their premieres in order to get to some kind of climax, sacrificing important character work to reach a suitably big moment to end on. So it may ultimately be good thing that Junpei's story feels like it's still stuck on the tarmac waiting for permission to take off. Because what we do get from him is really interesting, and tells us a lot about who this kid is and what the overall theme of this story will be. We see a kid who clearly wants to follow his passion, but a mixture of grief and toxic masculinity keeps him from pursuing it.    Those combative forces cause him to waffle a lot through this episode, insisting he's left ballet behind as a childhood whim while coming back to Miyako's studio every day once the offer's extended. It can be a little irksome to see him going back and forth like that, but it also builds anticipation for that moment when he'll finally let go of all that baggage and dance the way he so obviously wants to. But that moment is not coming now, and it does feel a little underwhelming when the episode just kind of stops, rather than ending. We've gotten the setup, but no payoff. There's enough good stuff here that I'm confident that payoff will deliver, but having to wait is, well, frustrating.    The other stumbling block for some will probably be the character designs. An admirable job has been done to translate George Asakura's lanky, limpid-eyed designs for animation. The dance scenes are also all-around solid, capturing the grace and precision that can make ballet such a delight to watch. It's everything that isn't a dance sequence that leaves some worries for me – there's a number of awkward still frames and edits that could just be a consequence of the brisk pace of this premiere, or be portents of a looming production collapse from an overburdened MAPPA. I'd like it to be the former, as there's a ton of potential for an anime that can really deliver on honest-to-goodness ballet performances, and it'd suck to see that fall apart.    Hangups aside, there's a lot of good here and it's a unique offering in an already packed season. That will hopefully make it stand out, and if nothing else I'll be hanging around until we get that big moment of catharsis for Junpei. Consider it a hesitant thumbs up.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                If you don't know, until I broke my left ankle in four places, I was a dancer. Primarily modern dance, but ballet as well, and I was serious about it that I would have, as the unpleasantly abrasive dance teacher says in this episode, given up everything else to pursue it. But that's not how life works, and it certainly gives me mixed feelings about Dance Dance Danseur's first episode. On the one hand, I absolutely agree with some of what the teacher says – to really excel in dance on a professional level, you do have to start early and you do have to give up most other things…and even then, it might not work out, as one of my cousins learned when she was told she didn't have the right body type to ever be a prima ballerina. But there are also ways to enjoy being a dancer without putting in that level of commitment, and there's nothing that says that Junpei can't perform and be a dancer while still keeping up with his other activities.    That of course is part of the conflict. Junpei's always wanted to do ballet, but the levels of fragile and toxic masculinity around him are astronomical, preventing him from pursuing what he loves. His dad's comment that people “already think he's a girl” because he plays piano made my skin crawl, because way to randomly gender music and dance, sir. Then when his uncle (who I suspect may be one of those family friend uncles rather than blood related) tells him after his father's death that Jumpei has to be the man in the family now, the damage is complete—Junpei has to be the man, dancing isn't manly, therefore, he can't be a dancer. It's terrible and all too familiar, and the poor kid is still busy lying to himself when he's a second year in middle school, fooling everyone except his older sister and Miyako, the newish girl at school. Miyako knows a dance move when she sees one, no matter what crap Junpei feeds everyone else about martial arts kicks, and she becomes the one person who's willing to support him—or at least to do so without being a jerk about it, like her mother.    Basically this episode was an exercise in frustration begging for relief that will almost certainly come in later episodes. Junpei is clearly working towards accepting himself and what he loves, and he's got a lot to work through, including being a fourteen-year-old boy who can't think of any reason why Miyako would want him to dance besides that she likes him. (More likely the reason is that there are so few male dancers that she's having a hard time finding a partner her age.) It's mostly a good frustration, because it does look to be in service of something rewarding, and the dancing is well enough animated that we can feel the muscles engaging, especially in the opening performance that hooks Jumpei on dance in the first place. Likewise we can see how Jumpei is self-taught in his movements, which is an excellent detail. I'll need to give it a couple more episodes before I decide, because this is a subject I could be very picky about, but since it seems to be as close to a Swan anime (or even getting the rest of the manga in English) as I'm likely to get, I suspect I'll end up taking it.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review                Odd Taxi: In the Woods   Apr 17, 00:00                 anime    By cleverly reframing its narrative around a series of interviews with the supporting cast, Odd Taxi: In the Woods succeeds where most recap films fail: it's an artistically cohesive film in its own right. ― Odd Taxi was 2021's sleeper anime hit, telling an intricate, original mystery that kept viewers guessing every week.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Dance Dance Danseur   Apr  9th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Dance Dance Danseur ?                     Community score: 3.7              What is this?   Junpei Murao was fascinated with ballet as a child, but in his second year of middle school, his father passed away and he decided he needed to become more ""masculine,"" and he gave up on his aspirations. While still having an attachment to ballet, he takes up the martial art of Jeet Kune Do, and becomes popular in his class. Then one day, a new transfer student named Miyako Godai arrives in Junpei's class, and her mother runs a ballet studio. Miyako realizes that Junpei is interested in ballet, and invites him to do ballet together.    Dance Dance Danseur is based on George Asakura's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                 Hey, did you know that toxic masculinity really messes people up? It's insidious. It trickles down to others subconsciously, teaching men, even as children, to encourage those who follow the classical male ideal and shame those who do not. Dance Dance Danseur is like a case study showing how these commonly held beliefs can rob a child of his dream and destiny—and how he has to fight against his own ingrained worldview to get them back.    As a child, we see that Junpei was willing and able to follow his dream to become a ballet dancer. He was even willing to fight his friends when they disparaged it. However, what really messed him up was the death of his father. His father was a martial artist and stuntman; in other words, he was about as stereotypical of a manly man as you can get.    When Junpei brings up his dream to his father, his father initially tries to dissuade him and get him to do Jeet Kun Do instead. This is partly due to his own ingrained toxic masculinity, but it's also because he wants a shared interest through which he can connect with his son. But Junpei can't see that second bit. All he can see is that his father wanted him to do something more manly than ballet, an idea that is reinforced when his uncle (a likewise manly man) tells the young boy to be strong for his family after his father's passing. In his own way, he is trying to help Junpei through his grief by giving him a reason to fight on, but Junpei (being a literal child) only hears: manly=good, girly=bad.    Now, years later, Junpei has done everything he can to be the manliest man he can be. He sees it as his way of honoring his father, making his family and friends happy with how great he has become. The only problem is that in doing so, he has forgone his own chance at true happiness. Is it any surprise he's turned out to be such an angry young man? He forced his own desires deep down inside but they keep bubbling up. The loving support of his mother and sister isn't enough for him to accept his true self. What he needs is someone to confront him on a “masculine level”—to aggressively attack him right in the male ego and make doing ballet part of his manly pride. Its only through regaining his own inborn self-worth—by determining for himself what it means to be a man—that Junpei can find happiness. And while in this episode he has taken a step towards that, it is only the first step of many.    Dance Dance Danseur's first episode is a fantastic breakdown of toxic masculinity and the harm it subconsciously inflicts on children. Moreover, it has fantastic animation and a great moral. Honestly, there's not much here to dislike.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This is one of those premieres that's frustrating in good and bad ways. For the good, when this episode ended I seriously wanted the next one right away, which means this premiere did its job. For the bad, part of the reason I wanted another episode is because this one only feels like half a story.    On the one hand, that may be a good decision – plenty of otherwise good shows rush through their premieres in order to get to some kind of climax, sacrificing important character work to reach a suitably big moment to end on. So it may ultimately be good thing that Junpei's story feels like it's still stuck on the tarmac waiting for permission to take off. Because what we do get from him is really interesting, and tells us a lot about who this kid is and what the overall theme of this story will be. We see a kid who clearly wants to follow his passion, but a mixture of grief and toxic masculinity keeps him from pursuing it.    Those combative forces cause him to waffle a lot through this episode, insisting he's left ballet behind as a childhood whim while coming back to Miyako's studio every day once the offer's extended. It can be a little irksome to see him going back and forth like that, but it also builds anticipation for that moment when he'll finally let go of all that baggage and dance the way he so obviously wants to. But that moment is not coming now, and it does feel a little underwhelming when the episode just kind of stops, rather than ending. We've gotten the setup, but no payoff. There's enough good stuff here that I'm confident that payoff will deliver, but having to wait is, well, frustrating.    The other stumbling block for some will probably be the character designs. An admirable job has been done to translate George Asakura's lanky, limpid-eyed designs for animation. The dance scenes are also all-around solid, capturing the grace and precision that can make ballet such a delight to watch. It's everything that isn't a dance sequence that leaves some worries for me – there's a number of awkward still frames and edits that could just be a consequence of the brisk pace of this premiere, or be portents of a looming production collapse from an overburdened MAPPA. I'd like it to be the former, as there's a ton of potential for an anime that can really deliver on honest-to-goodness ballet performances, and it'd suck to see that fall apart.    Hangups aside, there's a lot of good here and it's a unique offering in an already packed season. That will hopefully make it stand out, and if nothing else I'll be hanging around until we get that big moment of catharsis for Junpei. Consider it a hesitant thumbs up.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                If you don't know, until I broke my left ankle in four places, I was a dancer. Primarily modern dance, but ballet as well, and I was serious about it that I would have, as the unpleasantly abrasive dance teacher says in this episode, given up everything else to pursue it. But that's not how life works, and it certainly gives me mixed feelings about Dance Dance Danseur's first episode. On the one hand, I absolutely agree with some of what the teacher says – to really excel in dance on a professional level, you do have to start early and you do have to give up most other things…and even then, it might not work out, as one of my cousins learned when she was told she didn't have the right body type to ever be a prima ballerina. But there are also ways to enjoy being a dancer without putting in that level of commitment, and there's nothing that says that Junpei can't perform and be a dancer while still keeping up with his other activities.    That of course is part of the conflict. Junpei's always wanted to do ballet, but the levels of fragile and toxic masculinity around him are astronomical, preventing him from pursuing what he loves. His dad's comment that people “already think he's a girl” because he plays piano made my skin crawl, because way to randomly gender music and dance, sir. Then when his uncle (who I suspect may be one of those family friend uncles rather than blood related) tells him after his father's death that Jumpei has to be the man in the family now, the damage is complete—Junpei has to be the man, dancing isn't manly, therefore, he can't be a dancer. It's terrible and all too familiar, and the poor kid is still busy lying to himself when he's a second year in middle school, fooling everyone except his older sister and Miyako, the newish girl at school. Miyako knows a dance move when she sees one, no matter what crap Junpei feeds everyone else about martial arts kicks, and she becomes the one person who's willing to support him—or at least to do so without being a jerk about it, like her mother.    Basically this episode was an exercise in frustration begging for relief that will almost certainly come in later episodes. Junpei is clearly working towards accepting himself and what he loves, and he's got a lot to work through, including being a fourteen-year-old boy who can't think of any reason why Miyako would want him to dance besides that she likes him. (More likely the reason is that there are so few male dancers that she's having a hard time finding a partner her age.) It's mostly a good frustration, because it does look to be in service of something rewarding, and the dancing is well enough animated that we can feel the muscles engaging, especially in the opening performance that hooks Jumpei on dance in the first place. Likewise we can see how Jumpei is self-taught in his movements, which is an excellent detail. I'll need to give it a couple more episodes before I decide, because this is a subject I could be very picky about, but since it seems to be as close to a Swan anime (or even getting the rest of the manga in English) as I'm likely to get, I suspect I'll end up taking it.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review                Odd Taxi: In the Woods   Apr 17, 00:00                 anime    By cleverly reframing its narrative around a series of interviews with the supporting cast, Odd Taxi: In the Woods succeeds where most recap films fail: it's an artistically cohesive film in its own right. ― Odd Taxi was 2021's sleeper anime hit, telling an intricate, original mystery that kept viewers guessing every week.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Dance Dance Danseur   Apr  9th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Dance Dance Danseur ?                     Community score: 3.7              What is this?   Junpei Murao was fascinated with ballet as a child, but in his second year of middle school, his father passed away and he decided he needed to become more ""masculine,"" and he gave up on his aspirations. While still having an attachment to ballet, he takes up the martial art of Jeet Kune Do, and becomes popular in his class. Then one day, a new transfer student named Miyako Godai arrives in Junpei's class, and her mother runs a ballet studio. Miyako realizes that Junpei is interested in ballet, and invites him to do ballet together.    Dance Dance Danseur is based on George Asakura's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                 Hey, did you know that toxic masculinity really messes people up? It's insidious. It trickles down to others subconsciously, teaching men, even as children, to encourage those who follow the classical male ideal and shame those who do not. Dance Dance Danseur is like a case study showing how these commonly held beliefs can rob a child of his dream and destiny—and how he has to fight against his own ingrained worldview to get them back.    As a child, we see that Junpei was willing and able to follow his dream to become a ballet dancer. He was even willing to fight his friends when they disparaged it. However, what really messed him up was the death of his father. His father was a martial artist and stuntman; in other words, he was about as stereotypical of a manly man as you can get.    When Junpei brings up his dream to his father, his father initially tries to dissuade him and get him to do Jeet Kun Do instead. This is partly due to his own ingrained toxic masculinity, but it's also because he wants a shared interest through which he can connect with his son. But Junpei can't see that second bit. All he can see is that his father wanted him to do something more manly than ballet, an idea that is reinforced when his uncle (a likewise manly man) tells the young boy to be strong for his family after his father's passing. In his own way, he is trying to help Junpei through his grief by giving him a reason to fight on, but Junpei (being a literal child) only hears: manly=good, girly=bad.    Now, years later, Junpei has done everything he can to be the manliest man he can be. He sees it as his way of honoring his father, making his family and friends happy with how great he has become. The only problem is that in doing so, he has forgone his own chance at true happiness. Is it any surprise he's turned out to be such an angry young man? He forced his own desires deep down inside but they keep bubbling up. The loving support of his mother and sister isn't enough for him to accept his true self. What he needs is someone to confront him on a “masculine level”—to aggressively attack him right in the male ego and make doing ballet part of his manly pride. Its only through regaining his own inborn self-worth—by determining for himself what it means to be a man—that Junpei can find happiness. And while in this episode he has taken a step towards that, it is only the first step of many.    Dance Dance Danseur's first episode is a fantastic breakdown of toxic masculinity and the harm it subconsciously inflicts on children. Moreover, it has fantastic animation and a great moral. Honestly, there's not much here to dislike.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This is one of those premieres that's frustrating in good and bad ways. For the good, when this episode ended I seriously wanted the next one right away, which means this premiere did its job. For the bad, part of the reason I wanted another episode is because this one only feels like half a story.    On the one hand, that may be a good decision – plenty of otherwise good shows rush through their premieres in order to get to some kind of climax, sacrificing important character work to reach a suitably big moment to end on. So it may ultimately be good thing that Junpei's story feels like it's still stuck on the tarmac waiting for permission to take off. Because what we do get from him is really interesting, and tells us a lot about who this kid is and what the overall theme of this story will be. We see a kid who clearly wants to follow his passion, but a mixture of grief and toxic masculinity keeps him from pursuing it.    Those combative forces cause him to waffle a lot through this episode, insisting he's left ballet behind as a childhood whim while coming back to Miyako's studio every day once the offer's extended. It can be a little irksome to see him going back and forth like that, but it also builds anticipation for that moment when he'll finally let go of all that baggage and dance the way he so obviously wants to. But that moment is not coming now, and it does feel a little underwhelming when the episode just kind of stops, rather than ending. We've gotten the setup, but no payoff. There's enough good stuff here that I'm confident that payoff will deliver, but having to wait is, well, frustrating.    The other stumbling block for some will probably be the character designs.

I'd like it to be the former, as there's a ton of potential for an anime that can really deliver on honest-to-goodness ballet performances, and it'd suck to see that fall apart.    Hangups aside, there's a lot of good here and it's a unique offering in an already packed season. That will hopefully make it stand out, and if nothing else I'll be hanging around until we get that big moment of catharsis for Junpei. Consider it a hesitant thumbs up.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Dance Dance Danseur   Apr  9th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Dance Dance Danseur ?                     Community score: 3.7              What is this?   Junpei Murao was fascinated with ballet as a child, but in his second year of middle school, his father passed away and he decided he needed to become more ""masculine,"" and he gave up on his aspirations. While still having an attachment to ballet, he takes up the martial art of Jeet Kune Do, and becomes popular in his class. Then one day, a new transfer student named Miyako Godai arrives in Junpei's class, and her mother runs a ballet studio. Miyako realizes that Junpei is interested in ballet, and invites him to do ballet together.    Dance Dance Danseur is based on George Asakura's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                 Hey, did you know that toxic masculinity really messes people up? It's insidious. It trickles down to others subconsciously, teaching men, even as children, to encourage those who follow the classical male ideal and shame those who do not. Dance Dance Danseur is like a case study showing how these commonly held beliefs can rob a child of his dream and destiny—and how he has to fight against his own ingrained worldview to get them back.    As a child, we see that Junpei was willing and able to follow his dream to become a ballet dancer. He was even willing to fight his friends when they disparaged it. However, what really messed him up was the death of his father. His father was a martial artist and stuntman; in other words, he was about as stereotypical of a manly man as you can get.    When Junpei brings up his dream to his father, his father initially tries to dissuade him and get him to do Jeet Kun Do instead. This is partly due to his own ingrained toxic masculinity, but it's also because he wants a shared interest through which he can connect with his son. But Junpei can't see that second bit. All he can see is that his father wanted him to do something more manly than ballet, an idea that is reinforced when his uncle (a likewise manly man) tells the young boy to be strong for his family after his father's passing. In his own way, he is trying to help Junpei through his grief by giving him a reason to fight on, but Junpei (being a literal child) only hears: manly=good, girly=bad.    Now, years later, Junpei has done everything he can to be the manliest man he can be. He sees it as his way of honoring his father, making his family and friends happy with how great he has become. The only problem is that in doing so, he has forgone his own chance at true happiness. Is it any surprise he's turned out to be such an angry young man? He forced his own desires deep down inside but they keep bubbling up. The loving support of his mother and sister isn't enough for him to accept his true self. What he needs is someone to confront him on a “masculine level”—to aggressively attack him right in the male ego and make doing ballet part of his manly pride. Its only through regaining his own inborn self-worth—by determining for himself what it means to be a man—that Junpei can find happiness. And while in this episode he has taken a step towards that, it is only the first step of many.    Dance Dance Danseur's first episode is a fantastic breakdown of toxic masculinity and the harm it subconsciously inflicts on children. Moreover, it has fantastic animation and a great moral. Honestly, there's not much here to dislike.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This is one of those premieres that's frustrating in good and bad ways. For the good, when this episode ended I seriously wanted the next one right away, which means this premiere did its job. For the bad, part of the reason I wanted another episode is because this one only feels like half a story.    On the one hand, that may be a good decision – plenty of otherwise good shows rush through their premieres in order to get to some kind of climax, sacrificing important character work to reach a suitably big moment to end on. So it may ultimately be good thing that Junpei's story feels like it's still stuck on the tarmac waiting for permission to take off. Because what we do get from him is really interesting, and tells us a lot about who this kid is and what the overall theme of this story will be. We see a kid who clearly wants to follow his passion, but a mixture of grief and toxic masculinity keeps him from pursuing it.    Those combative forces cause him to waffle a lot through this episode, insisting he's left ballet behind as a childhood whim while coming back to Miyako's studio every day once the offer's extended. It can be a little irksome to see him going back and forth like that, but it also builds anticipation for that moment when he'll finally let go of all that baggage and dance the way he so obviously wants to. But that moment is not coming now, and it does feel a little underwhelming when the episode just kind of stops, rather than ending. We've gotten the setup, but no payoff. There's enough good stuff here that I'm confident that payoff will deliver, but having to wait is, well, frustrating.    The other stumbling block for some will probably be the character designs. An admirable job has been done to translate George Asakura's lanky, limpid-eyed designs for animation. The dance scenes are also all-around solid, capturing the grace and precision that can make ballet such a delight to watch. It's everything that isn't a dance sequence that leaves some worries for me – there's a number of awkward still frames and edits that could just be a consequence of the brisk pace of this premiere, or be portents of a looming production collapse from an overburdened MAPPA. I'd like it to be the former, as there's a ton of potential for an anime that can really deliver on honest-to-goodness ballet performances, and it'd suck to see that fall apart.    Hangups aside, there's a lot of good here and it's a unique offering in an already packed season. That will hopefully make it stand out, and if nothing else I'll be hanging around until we get that big moment of catharsis for Junpei. Consider it a hesitant thumbs up.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                If you don't know, until I broke my left ankle in four places, I was a dancer. Primarily modern dance, but ballet as well, and I was serious about it that I would have, as the unpleasantly abrasive dance teacher says in this episode, given up everything else to pursue it. But that's not how life works, and it certainly gives me mixed feelings about Dance Dance Danseur's first episode. On the one hand, I absolutely agree with some of what the teacher says – to really excel in dance on a professional level, you do have to start early and you do have to give up most other things…and even then, it might not work out, as one of my cousins learned when she was told she didn't have the right body type to ever be a prima ballerina. But there are also ways to enjoy being a dancer without putting in that level of commitment, and there's nothing that says that Junpei can't perform and be a dancer while still keeping up with his other activities.    That of course is part of the conflict. Junpei's always wanted to do ballet, but the levels of fragile and toxic masculinity around him are astronomical, preventing him from pursuing what he loves. His dad's comment that people “already think he's a girl” because he plays piano made my skin crawl, because way to randomly gender music and dance, sir. Then when his uncle (who I suspect may be one of those family friend uncles rather than blood related) tells him after his father's death that Jumpei has to be the man in the family now, the damage is complete—Junpei has to be the man, dancing isn't manly, therefore, he can't be a dancer. It's terrible and all too familiar, and the poor kid is still busy lying to himself when he's a second year in middle school, fooling everyone except his older sister and Miyako, the newish girl at school. Miyako knows a dance move when she sees one, no matter what crap Junpei feeds everyone else about martial arts kicks, and she becomes the one person who's willing to support him—or at least to do so without being a jerk about it, like her mother.    Basically this episode was an exercise in frustration begging for relief that will almost certainly come in later episodes. Junpei is clearly working towards accepting himself and what he loves, and he's got a lot to work through, including being a fourteen-year-old boy who can't think of any reason why Miyako would want him to dance besides that she likes him. (More likely the reason is that there are so few male dancers that she's having a hard time finding a partner her age.) It's mostly a good frustration, because it does look to be in service of something rewarding, and the dancing is well enough animated that we can feel the muscles engaging, especially in the opening performance that hooks Jumpei on dance in the first place. Likewise we can see how Jumpei is self-taught in his movements, which is an excellent detail. I'll need to give it a couple more episodes before I decide, because this is a subject I could be very picky about, but since it seems to be as close to a Swan anime (or even getting the rest of the manga in English) as I'm likely to get, I suspect I'll end up taking it.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Then one day, a new transfer student named Miyako Godai arrives in Junpei's class, and her mother runs a ballet studio. Miyako realizes that Junpei is interested in ballet, and invites him to do ballet together.    Dance Dance Danseur is based on George Asakura's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                 Hey, did you know that toxic masculinity really messes people up? It's insidious. It trickles down to others subconsciously, teaching men, even as children, to encourage those who follow the classical male ideal and shame those who do not. Dance Dance Danseur is like a case study showing how these commonly held beliefs can rob a child of his dream and destiny—and how he has to fight against his own ingrained worldview to get them back.    As a child, we see that Junpei was willing and able to follow his dream to become a ballet dancer. He was even willing to fight his friends when they disparaged it. However, what really messed him up was the death of his father. His father was a martial artist and stuntman; in other words, he was about as stereotypical of a manly man as you can get.    When Junpei brings up his dream to his father, his father initially tries to dissuade him and get him to do Jeet Kun Do instead. This is partly due to his own ingrained toxic masculinity, but it's also because he wants a shared interest through which he can connect with his son. But Junpei can't see that second bit. All he can see is that his father wanted him to do something more manly than ballet, an idea that is reinforced when his uncle (a likewise manly man) tells the young boy to be strong for his family after his father's passing. In his own way, he is trying to help Junpei through his grief by giving him a reason to fight on, but Junpei (being a literal child) only hears: manly=good, girly=bad.    Now, years later, Junpei has done everything he can to be the manliest man he can be. He sees it as his way of honoring his father, making his family and friends happy with how great he has become. The only problem is that in doing so, he has forgone his own chance at true happiness. Is it any surprise he's turned out to be such an angry young man? He forced his own desires deep down inside but they keep bubbling up. The loving support of his mother and sister isn't enough for him to accept his true self. What he needs is someone to confront him on a “masculine level”—to aggressively attack him right in the male ego and make doing ballet part of his manly pride. Its only through regaining his own inborn self-worth—by determining for himself what it means to be a man—that Junpei can find happiness. And while in this episode he has taken a step towards that, it is only the first step of many.    Dance Dance Danseur's first episode is a fantastic breakdown of toxic masculinity and the harm it subconsciously inflicts on children. Moreover, it has fantastic animation and a great moral. Honestly, there's not much here to dislike.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This is one of those premieres that's frustrating in good and bad ways. For the good, when this episode ended I seriously wanted the next one right away, which means this premiere did its job. For the bad, part of the reason I wanted another episode is because this one only feels like half a story.    On the one hand, that may be a good decision – plenty of otherwise good shows rush through their premieres in order to get to some kind of climax, sacrificing important character work to reach a suitably big moment to end on. So it may ultimately be good thing that Junpei's story feels like it's still stuck on the tarmac waiting for permission to take off. Because what we do get from him is really interesting, and tells us a lot about who this kid is and what the overall theme of this story will be. We see a kid who clearly wants to follow his passion, but a mixture of grief and toxic masculinity keeps him from pursuing it.    Those combative forces cause him to waffle a lot through this episode, insisting he's left ballet behind as a childhood whim while coming back to Miyako's studio every day once the offer's extended. It can be a little irksome to see him going back and forth like that, but it also builds anticipation for that moment when he'll finally let go of all that baggage and dance the way he so obviously wants to. But that moment is not coming now, and it does feel a little underwhelming when the episode just kind of stops, rather than ending. We've gotten the setup, but no payoff. There's enough good stuff here that I'm confident that payoff will deliver, but having to wait is, well, frustrating.    The other stumbling block for some will probably be the character designs. An admirable job has been done to translate George Asakura's lanky, limpid-eyed designs for animation. The dance scenes are also all-around solid, capturing the grace and precision that can make ballet such a delight to watch. It's everything that isn't a dance sequence that leaves some worries for me – there's a number of awkward still frames and edits that could just be a consequence of the brisk pace of this premiere, or be portents of a looming production collapse from an overburdened MAPPA. I'd like it to be the former, as there's a ton of potential for an anime that can really deliver on honest-to-goodness ballet performances, and it'd suck to see that fall apart.    Hangups aside, there's a lot of good here and it's a unique offering in an already packed season. That will hopefully make it stand out, and if nothing else I'll be hanging around until we get that big moment of catharsis for Junpei. Consider it a hesitant thumbs up.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                If you don't know, until I broke my left ankle in four places, I was a dancer. Primarily modern dance, but ballet as well, and I was serious about it that I would have, as the unpleasantly abrasive dance teacher says in this episode, given up everything else to pursue it. But that's not how life works, and it certainly gives me mixed feelings about Dance Dance Danseur's first episode. On the one hand, I absolutely agree with some of what the teacher says – to really excel in dance on a professional level, you do have to start early and you do have to give up most other things…and even then, it might not work out, as one of my cousins learned when she was told she didn't have the right body type to ever be a prima ballerina. But there are also ways to enjoy being a dancer without putting in that level of commitment, and there's nothing that says that Junpei can't perform and be a dancer while still keeping up with his other activities.    That of course is part of the conflict. Junpei's always wanted to do ballet, but the levels of fragile and toxic masculinity around him are astronomical, preventing him from pursuing what he loves. His dad's comment that people “already think he's a girl” because he plays piano made my skin crawl, because way to randomly gender music and dance, sir. Then when his uncle (who I suspect may be one of those family friend uncles rather than blood related) tells him after his father's death that Jumpei has to be the man in the family now, the damage is complete—Junpei has to be the man, dancing isn't manly, therefore, he can't be a dancer. It's terrible and all too familiar, and the poor kid is still busy lying to himself when he's a second year in middle school, fooling everyone except his older sister and Miyako, the newish girl at school. Miyako knows a dance move when she sees one, no matter what crap Junpei feeds everyone else about martial arts kicks, and she becomes the one person who's willing to support him—or at least to do so without being a jerk about it, like her mother.    Basically this episode was an exercise in frustration begging for relief that will almost certainly come in later episodes. Junpei is clearly working towards accepting himself and what he loves, and he's got a lot to work through, including being a fourteen-year-old boy who can't think of any reason why Miyako would want him to dance besides that she likes him. (More likely the reason is that there are so few male dancers that she's having a hard time finding a partner her age.) It's mostly a good frustration, because it does look to be in service of something rewarding, and the dancing is well enough animated that we can feel the muscles engaging, especially in the opening performance that hooks Jumpei on dance in the first place. Likewise we can see how Jumpei is self-taught in his movements, which is an excellent detail. I'll need to give it a couple more episodes before I decide, because this is a subject I could be very picky about, but since it seems to be as close to a Swan anime (or even getting the rest of the manga in English) as I'm likely to get, I suspect I'll end up taking it.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

This is partly due to his own ingrained toxic masculinity, but it's also because he wants a shared interest through which he can connect with his son. But Junpei can't see that second bit. All he can see is that his father wanted him to do something more manly than ballet, an idea that is reinforced when his uncle (a likewise manly man) tells the young boy to be strong for his family after his father's passing. In his own way, he is trying to help Junpei through his grief by giving him a reason to fight on, but Junpei (being a literal child) only hears: manly=good, girly=bad.    Now, years later, Junpei has done everything he can to be the manliest man he can be. He sees it as his way of honoring his father, making his family and friends happy with how great he has become. The only problem is that in doing so, he has forgone his own chance at true happiness. Is it any surprise he's turned out to be such an angry young man? He forced his own desires deep down inside but they keep bubbling up. The loving support of his mother and sister isn't enough for him to accept his true self. What he needs is someone to confront him on a “masculine level”—to aggressively attack him right in the male ego and make doing ballet part of his manly pride. Its only through regaining his own inborn self-worth—by determining for himself what it means to be a man—that Junpei can find happiness. And while in this episode he has taken a step towards that, it is only the first step of many.    Dance Dance Danseur's first episode is a fantastic breakdown of toxic masculinity and the harm it subconsciously inflicts on children. Moreover, it has fantastic animation and a great moral. Honestly, there's not much here to dislike.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This is one of those premieres that's frustrating in good and bad ways. For the good, when this episode ended I seriously wanted the next one right away, which means this premiere did its job. For the bad, part of the reason I wanted another episode is because this one only feels like half a story.    On the one hand, that may be a good decision – plenty of otherwise good shows rush through their premieres in order to get to some kind of climax, sacrificing important character work to reach a suitably big moment to end on. So it may ultimately be good thing that Junpei's story feels like it's still stuck on the tarmac waiting for permission to take off. Because what we do get from him is really interesting, and tells us a lot about who this kid is and what the overall theme of this story will be. We see a kid who clearly wants to follow his passion, but a mixture of grief and toxic masculinity keeps him from pursuing it.    Those combative forces cause him to waffle a lot through this episode, insisting he's left ballet behind as a childhood whim while coming back to Miyako's studio every day once the offer's extended. It can be a little irksome to see him going back and forth like that, but it also builds anticipation for that moment when he'll finally let go of all that baggage and dance the way he so obviously wants to. But that moment is not coming now, and it does feel a little underwhelming when the episode just kind of stops, rather than ending. We've gotten the setup, but no payoff. There's enough good stuff here that I'm confident that payoff will deliver, but having to wait is, well, frustrating.    The other stumbling block for some will probably be the character designs. An admirable job has been done to translate George Asakura's lanky, limpid-eyed designs for animation. The dance scenes are also all-around solid, capturing the grace and precision that can make ballet such a delight to watch. It's everything that isn't a dance sequence that leaves some worries for me – there's a number of awkward still frames and edits that could just be a consequence of the brisk pace of this premiere, or be portents of a looming production collapse from an overburdened MAPPA. I'd like it to be the former, as there's a ton of potential for an anime that can really deliver on honest-to-goodness ballet performances, and it'd suck to see that fall apart.    Hangups aside, there's a lot of good here and it's a unique offering in an already packed season. That will hopefully make it stand out, and if nothing else I'll be hanging around until we get that big moment of catharsis for Junpei. Consider it a hesitant thumbs up.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                If you don't know, until I broke my left ankle in four places, I was a dancer. Primarily modern dance, but ballet as well, and I was serious about it that I would have, as the unpleasantly abrasive dance teacher says in this episode, given up everything else to pursue it. But that's not how life works, and it certainly gives me mixed feelings about Dance Dance Danseur's first episode. On the one hand, I absolutely agree with some of what the teacher says – to really excel in dance on a professional level, you do have to start early and you do have to give up most other things…and even then, it might not work out, as one of my cousins learned when she was told she didn't have the right body type to ever be a prima ballerina. But there are also ways to enjoy being a dancer without putting in that level of commitment, and there's nothing that says that Junpei can't perform and be a dancer while still keeping up with his other activities.    That of course is part of the conflict. Junpei's always wanted to do ballet, but the levels of fragile and toxic masculinity around him are astronomical, preventing him from pursuing what he loves. His dad's comment that people “already think he's a girl” because he plays piano made my skin crawl, because way to randomly gender music and dance, sir. Then when his uncle (who I suspect may be one of those family friend uncles rather than blood related) tells him after his father's death that Jumpei has to be the man in the family now, the damage is complete—Junpei has to be the man, dancing isn't manly, therefore, he can't be a dancer. It's terrible and all too familiar, and the poor kid is still busy lying to himself when he's a second year in middle school, fooling everyone except his older sister and Miyako, the newish girl at school. Miyako knows a dance move when she sees one, no matter what crap Junpei feeds everyone else about martial arts kicks, and she becomes the one person who's willing to support him—or at least to do so without being a jerk about it, like her mother.    Basically this episode was an exercise in frustration begging for relief that will almost certainly come in later episodes. Junpei is clearly working towards accepting himself and what he loves, and he's got a lot to work through, including being a fourteen-year-old boy who can't think of any reason why Miyako would want him to dance besides that she likes him. (More likely the reason is that there are so few male dancers that she's having a hard time finding a partner her age.) It's mostly a good frustration, because it does look to be in service of something rewarding, and the dancing is well enough animated that we can feel the muscles engaging, especially in the opening performance that hooks Jumpei on dance in the first place. Likewise we can see how Jumpei is self-taught in his movements, which is an excellent detail. I'll need to give it a couple more episodes before I decide, because this is a subject I could be very picky about, but since it seems to be as close to a Swan anime (or even getting the rest of the manga in English) as I'm likely to get, I suspect I'll end up taking it.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives   ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 3.7              What is this?   Junpei Murao was fascinated with ballet as a child, but in his second year of middle school, his father passed away and he decided he needed to become more ""masculine,"" and he gave up on his aspirations.

How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                 Hey, did you know that toxic masculinity really messes people up? It's insidious. It trickles down to others subconsciously, teaching men, even as children, to encourage those who follow the classical male ideal and shame those who do not.

Episodes 1-3  by Christopher Farris, Apr 16th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.2                  How would you rate episode 2 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.4                  How would you rate episode 3 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.5            The first episode of Ya Boy Kongming! does an effective (and delightful) job of laying out its establishing premise: Three Kingdoms-era strategist Kongming finds himself reincarnated into modern-day Japan, where he winds up tending both a bar and the career of aspiring songstress Eiko. It's fun, it's funny, and perhaps surprisingly cute in its wholesome handling of the whole affair and making clear just how moe ol' Zhuge Liang can be. Past the central time-travel gimmick, that first episode also clearly demonstrates just how instrumental the musical element of the story will be moving forward, featuring several performances from Eiko (including a lovingly-rendered and particularly moving one in her apartment halfway through the episode) and even sprinkling in some base knowledge of musical technicalities that it can work off going forward. It's just getting started, but it's still a good time.    But it's the second (and by extension, third) episode of this anime that better showcases the actual structure of the show and its further charms. Kongming formally takes on the role of Eiko's manager and we'll be following her path to stardom step by step, with each part punctuated by the strategist demonstrating his latest Zany Scheme™ in getting her there, potentially rooted in some famous or mythologized bit from Kongming's history. And that, I must tell you, is where I really fell in love with this show. Just seeing Kongming help Eiko out would be pleasant enough, since they're both so appealing and easy to root for, but couching those efforts in demonstrations of strategy and mind games gives things a narrative thrust as well. It's the sort of thing that makes any story based on competition (combat-based or otherwise) interesting, especially when structured on an episodic basis like this. It keeps us engaged as our own mental gears turn, theorizing about what it is that Kongming has actually done this time as we roll up to the revelation.    It definitely helps that a lot of the elements driving that are seeded by the writing even for those not particularly well-versed in Three Kingdoms history, which as the bar's owner laments, is a distressing amount of people these days. In fact, Kongming's discussions with the owner as they nerd out over those historical elements are there to serve that narrative purpose: It's in these conversations that Kongming's famous strategy of illusion and confusion is referenced before he deploys a variant of it in the second episode, and how he brings up his adherence to ""The Thirty-Six Stratagems"" in the third episode, as well as leading into more personal elements of his past. Like so much of this show, it's not just an entertaining characteristic element; it's also just dang effective storytelling overall.    This reliance on such a structured setup does bring up the potential issue that Ya Boy Kongming might wind up too bound by its own formula as it goes on. The third episode even has the characters call attention to the fact that the obstacle Eiko has to deal with – competing for an audience at the same time as a more well-known musical act – is effectively the same as that from the second episode. One wouldn't want a show like this, which thrives on keeping the audience engaged with increasing stakes and galaxy-brain managerial ploys from Kongming, to fall into such structural staleness. While that's a concern more for the future of the show, the way the setup works also rubs up against a potential thematic concern: The show's framing of competition and adversity. This angle does also make sense; Kongming is a military strategist, so his style specifically thrives off of outmaneuvering somebody else to the advantage of himself and his liege. But some aside comments by the rival band Jet Jacket in the third episode make the point of how other musicians in this structure are working for their big break as much as Eiko is, thus her 'victory' might need to come at the cost of someone else's. As cutthroat as the music industry is known to be, there's the possibility that said structure might feel too harshly adversarial for what is, at its heart, an earnest comedy.    Thankfully, the third episode does end up mitigating that tone in a heartening way by its end, with Kongming extending an olive branch to Jet Jacket in assisting with some of their troubles he previously leveraged to Eiko's success. It brings back the all-around good vibes of the series premiere, and also offers another follow-up on some of that conversational information we got on Kongming: The desire to appreciate the humanity of others and enjoy time spent with them as compensation for missing out on partying with the soldiers in his previous life. That ends up being the strongest new component from that episode; despite being a public-domain historical transplant who serves as this show's fundamental gimmick, we will be seeing some characterization and development for Kongming himself.    It forms a neat parallel with the show's overall structure that strengthens the cohesiveness of the whole thing. Just as Kongming's past strategizing exploits inform his efforts in the modern day, his personal experiences and regrets from his past life inform how he chooses to interact with people now. Kongming was already adorably effective just basically acting as this show's mascot, so confirming that he'll be receiving some of that all-important humanity only makes him more appealing.    Any other concerns for how this show might trend forward are firmly questions for the future. I'm not even entirely opposed to the idea of some adversarial elements. Mia, the rival musician introduced in the second episode, has her propensity for Dick Datastardly-style antics which I pretty well enjoy. Plus, come on, this is a show where the opening features everyone dancing around to ""Chikichiki Banban"" (in what's got to be a contender for opener of the year) – things are probably going to work out generally nicely overall. For now, these are opening episodes that immediately make the conceptual hooks clear for Ya Boy Kongming, a series that can seem like an oddly askew gimmick at first pass, but which I've kind of utterly fallen for by this point in its efforts of establishing itself.

Episodes 1-3  by Christopher Farris, Apr 16th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.2                  How would you rate episode 2 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.4                  How would you rate episode 3 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.5            The first episode of Ya Boy Kongming! does an effective (and delightful) job of laying out its establishing premise: Three Kingdoms-era strategist Kongming finds himself reincarnated into modern-day Japan, where he winds up tending both a bar and the career of aspiring songstress Eiko. It's fun, it's funny, and perhaps surprisingly cute in its wholesome handling of the whole affair and making clear just how moe ol' Zhuge Liang can be. Past the central time-travel gimmick, that first episode also clearly demonstrates just how instrumental the musical element of the story will be moving forward, featuring several performances from Eiko (including a lovingly-rendered and particularly moving one in her apartment halfway through the episode) and even sprinkling in some base knowledge of musical technicalities that it can work off going forward. It's just getting started, but it's still a good time.    But it's the second (and by extension, third) episode of this anime that better showcases the actual structure of the show and its further charms. Kongming formally takes on the role of Eiko's manager and we'll be following her path to stardom step by step, with each part punctuated by the strategist demonstrating his latest Zany Scheme™ in getting her there, potentially rooted in some famous or mythologized bit from Kongming's history. And that, I must tell you, is where I really fell in love with this show. Just seeing Kongming help Eiko out would be pleasant enough, since they're both so appealing and easy to root for, but couching those efforts in demonstrations of strategy and mind games gives things a narrative thrust as well. It's the sort of thing that makes any story based on competition (combat-based or otherwise) interesting, especially when structured on an episodic basis like this. It keeps us engaged as our own mental gears turn, theorizing about what it is that Kongming has actually done this time as we roll up to the revelation.    It definitely helps that a lot of the elements driving that are seeded by the writing even for those not particularly well-versed in Three Kingdoms history, which as the bar's owner laments, is a distressing amount of people these days. In fact, Kongming's discussions with the owner as they nerd out over those historical elements are there to serve that narrative purpose: It's in these conversations that Kongming's famous strategy of illusion and confusion is referenced before he deploys a variant of it in the second episode, and how he brings up his adherence to ""The Thirty-Six Stratagems"" in the third episode, as well as leading into more personal elements of his past. Like so much of this show, it's not just an entertaining characteristic element; it's also just dang effective storytelling overall.    This reliance on such a structured setup does bring up the potential issue that Ya Boy Kongming might wind up too bound by its own formula as it goes on. The third episode even has the characters call attention to the fact that the obstacle Eiko has to deal with – competing for an audience at the same time as a more well-known musical act – is effectively the same as that from the second episode. One wouldn't want a show like this, which thrives on keeping the audience engaged with increasing stakes and galaxy-brain managerial ploys from Kongming, to fall into such structural staleness. While that's a concern more for the future of the show, the way the setup works also rubs up against a potential thematic concern: The show's framing of competition and adversity. This angle does also make sense; Kongming is a military strategist, so his style specifically thrives off of outmaneuvering somebody else to the advantage of himself and his liege. But some aside comments by the rival band Jet Jacket in the third episode make the point of how other musicians in this structure are working for their big break as much as Eiko is, thus her 'victory' might need to come at the cost of someone else's. As cutthroat as the music industry is known to be, there's the possibility that said structure might feel too harshly adversarial for what is, at its heart, an earnest comedy.    Thankfully, the third episode does end up mitigating that tone in a heartening way by its end, with Kongming extending an olive branch to Jet Jacket in assisting with some of their troubles he previously leveraged to Eiko's success. It brings back the all-around good vibes of the series premiere, and also offers another follow-up on some of that conversational information we got on Kongming: The desire to appreciate the humanity of others and enjoy time spent with them as compensation for missing out on partying with the soldiers in his previous life. That ends up being the strongest new component from that episode; despite being a public-domain historical transplant who serves as this show's fundamental gimmick, we will be seeing some characterization and development for Kongming himself.    It forms a neat parallel with the show's overall structure that strengthens the cohesiveness of the whole thing. Just as Kongming's past strategizing exploits inform his efforts in the modern day, his personal experiences and regrets from his past life inform how he chooses to interact with people now. Kongming was already adorably effective just basically acting as this show's mascot, so confirming that he'll be receiving some of that all-important humanity only makes him more appealing.    Any other concerns for how this show might trend forward are firmly questions for the future. I'm not even entirely opposed to the idea of some adversarial elements. Mia, the rival musician introduced in the second episode, has her propensity for Dick Datastardly-style antics which I pretty well enjoy. Plus, come on, this is a show where the opening features everyone dancing around to ""Chikichiki Banban"" (in what's got to be a contender for opener of the year) – things are probably going to work out generally nicely overall. For now, these are opening episodes that immediately make the conceptual hooks clear for Ya Boy Kongming, a series that can seem like an oddly askew gimmick at first pass, but which I've kind of utterly fallen for by this point in its efforts of establishing itself.

Episodes 1-3  by Christopher Farris, Apr 16th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.2                  How would you rate episode 2 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.4                  How would you rate episode 3 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.5            The first episode of Ya Boy Kongming! does an effective (and delightful) job of laying out its establishing premise: Three Kingdoms-era strategist Kongming finds himself reincarnated into modern-day Japan, where he winds up tending both a bar and the career of aspiring songstress Eiko. It's fun, it's funny, and perhaps surprisingly cute in its wholesome handling of the whole affair and making clear just how moe ol' Zhuge Liang can be. Past the central time-travel gimmick, that first episode also clearly demonstrates just how instrumental the musical element of the story will be moving forward, featuring several performances from Eiko (including a lovingly-rendered and particularly moving one in her apartment halfway through the episode) and even sprinkling in some base knowledge of musical technicalities that it can work off going forward. It's just getting started, but it's still a good time.    But it's the second (and by extension, third) episode of this anime that better showcases the actual structure of the show and its further charms. Kongming formally takes on the role of Eiko's manager and we'll be following her path to stardom step by step, with each part punctuated by the strategist demonstrating his latest Zany Scheme™ in getting her there, potentially rooted in some famous or mythologized bit from Kongming's history. And that, I must tell you, is where I really fell in love with this show. Just seeing Kongming help Eiko out would be pleasant enough, since they're both so appealing and easy to root for, but couching those efforts in demonstrations of strategy and mind games gives things a narrative thrust as well. It's the sort of thing that makes any story based on competition (combat-based or otherwise) interesting, especially when structured on an episodic basis like this. It keeps us engaged as our own mental gears turn, theorizing about what it is that Kongming has actually done this time as we roll up to the revelation.    It definitely helps that a lot of the elements driving that are seeded by the writing even for those not particularly well-versed in Three Kingdoms history, which as the bar's owner laments, is a distressing amount of people these days. In fact, Kongming's discussions with the owner as they nerd out over those historical elements are there to serve that narrative purpose: It's in these conversations that Kongming's famous strategy of illusion and confusion is referenced before he deploys a variant of it in the second episode, and how he brings up his adherence to ""The Thirty-Six Stratagems"" in the third episode, as well as leading into more personal elements of his past. Like so much of this show, it's not just an entertaining characteristic element; it's also just dang effective storytelling overall.    This reliance on such a structured setup does bring up the potential issue that Ya Boy Kongming might wind up too bound by its own formula as it goes on. The third episode even has the characters call attention to the fact that the obstacle Eiko has to deal with – competing for an audience at the same time as a more well-known musical act – is effectively the same as that from the second episode. One wouldn't want a show like this, which thrives on keeping the audience engaged with increasing stakes and galaxy-brain managerial ploys from Kongming, to fall into such structural staleness. While that's a concern more for the future of the show, the way the setup works also rubs up against a potential thematic concern: The show's framing of competition and adversity. This angle does also make sense; Kongming is a military strategist, so his style specifically thrives off of outmaneuvering somebody else to the advantage of himself and his liege. But some aside comments by the rival band Jet Jacket in the third episode make the point of how other musicians in this structure are working for their big break as much as Eiko is, thus her 'victory' might need to come at the cost of someone else's. As cutthroat as the music industry is known to be, there's the possibility that said structure might feel too harshly adversarial for what is, at its heart, an earnest comedy.    Thankfully, the third episode does end up mitigating that tone in a heartening way by its end, with Kongming extending an olive branch to Jet Jacket in assisting with some of their troubles he previously leveraged to Eiko's success. It brings back the all-around good vibes of the series premiere, and also offers another follow-up on some of that conversational information we got on Kongming: The desire to appreciate the humanity of others and enjoy time spent with them as compensation for missing out on partying with the soldiers in his previous life. That ends up being the strongest new component from that episode; despite being a public-domain historical transplant who serves as this show's fundamental gimmick, we will be seeing some characterization and development for Kongming himself.    It forms a neat parallel with the show's overall structure that strengthens the cohesiveness of the whole thing. Just as Kongming's past strategizing exploits inform his efforts in the modern day, his personal experiences and regrets from his past life inform how he chooses to interact with people now. Kongming was already adorably effective just basically acting as this show's mascot, so confirming that he'll be receiving some of that all-important humanity only makes him more appealing.    Any other concerns for how this show might trend forward are firmly questions for the future. I'm not even entirely opposed to the idea of some adversarial elements. Mia, the rival musician introduced in the second episode, has her propensity for Dick Datastardly-style antics which I pretty well enjoy. Plus, come on, this is a show where the opening features everyone dancing around to ""Chikichiki Banban"" (in what's got to be a contender for opener of the year) – things are probably going to work out generally nicely overall. For now, these are opening episodes that immediately make the conceptual hooks clear for Ya Boy Kongming, a series that can seem like an oddly askew gimmick at first pass, but which I've kind of utterly fallen for by this point in its efforts of establishing itself.

Episodes 1-3  by Christopher Farris, Apr 16th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.2                  How would you rate episode 2 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.4                  How would you rate episode 3 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.5            The first episode of Ya Boy Kongming! does an effective (and delightful) job of laying out its establishing premise: Three Kingdoms-era strategist Kongming finds himself reincarnated into modern-day Japan, where he winds up tending both a bar and the career of aspiring songstress Eiko. It's fun, it's funny, and perhaps surprisingly cute in its wholesome handling of the whole affair and making clear just how moe ol' Zhuge Liang can be. Past the central time-travel gimmick, that first episode also clearly demonstrates just how instrumental the musical element of the story will be moving forward, featuring several performances from Eiko (including a lovingly-rendered and particularly moving one in her apartment halfway through the episode) and even sprinkling in some base knowledge of musical technicalities that it can work off going forward. It's just getting started, but it's still a good time.    But it's the second (and by extension, third) episode of this anime that better showcases the actual structure of the show and its further charms. Kongming formally takes on the role of Eiko's manager and we'll be following her path to stardom step by step, with each part punctuated by the strategist demonstrating his latest Zany Scheme™ in getting her there, potentially rooted in some famous or mythologized bit from Kongming's history. And that, I must tell you, is where I really fell in love with this show. Just seeing Kongming help Eiko out would be pleasant enough, since they're both so appealing and easy to root for, but couching those efforts in demonstrations of strategy and mind games gives things a narrative thrust as well. It's the sort of thing that makes any story based on competition (combat-based or otherwise) interesting, especially when structured on an episodic basis like this. It keeps us engaged as our own mental gears turn, theorizing about what it is that Kongming has actually done this time as we roll up to the revelation.    It definitely helps that a lot of the elements driving that are seeded by the writing even for those not particularly well-versed in Three Kingdoms history, which as the bar's owner laments, is a distressing amount of people these days. In fact, Kongming's discussions with the owner as they nerd out over those historical elements are there to serve that narrative purpose: It's in these conversations that Kongming's famous strategy of illusion and confusion is referenced before he deploys a variant of it in the second episode, and how he brings up his adherence to ""The Thirty-Six Stratagems"" in the third episode, as well as leading into more personal elements of his past. Like so much of this show, it's not just an entertaining characteristic element; it's also just dang effective storytelling overall.    This reliance on such a structured setup does bring up the potential issue that Ya Boy Kongming might wind up too bound by its own formula as it goes on. The third episode even has the characters call attention to the fact that the obstacle Eiko has to deal with – competing for an audience at the same time as a more well-known musical act – is effectively the same as that from the second episode. One wouldn't want a show like this, which thrives on keeping the audience engaged with increasing stakes and galaxy-brain managerial ploys from Kongming, to fall into such structural staleness. While that's a concern more for the future of the show, the way the setup works also rubs up against a potential thematic concern: The show's framing of competition and adversity. This angle does also make sense; Kongming is a military strategist, so his style specifically thrives off of outmaneuvering somebody else to the advantage of himself and his liege. But some aside comments by the rival band Jet Jacket in the third episode make the point of how other musicians in this structure are working for their big break as much as Eiko is, thus her 'victory' might need to come at the cost of someone else's. As cutthroat as the music industry is known to be, there's the possibility that said structure might feel too harshly adversarial for what is, at its heart, an earnest comedy.    Thankfully, the third episode does end up mitigating that tone in a heartening way by its end, with Kongming extending an olive branch to Jet Jacket in assisting with some of their troubles he previously leveraged to Eiko's success. It brings back the all-around good vibes of the series premiere, and also offers another follow-up on some of that conversational information we got on Kongming: The desire to appreciate the humanity of others and enjoy time spent with them as compensation for missing out on partying with the soldiers in his previous life. That ends up being the strongest new component from that episode; despite being a public-domain historical transplant who serves as this show's fundamental gimmick, we will be seeing some characterization and development for Kongming himself.    It forms a neat parallel with the show's overall structure that strengthens the cohesiveness of the whole thing. Just as Kongming's past strategizing exploits inform his efforts in the modern day, his personal experiences and regrets from his past life inform how he chooses to interact with people now. Kongming was already adorably effective just basically acting as this show's mascot, so confirming that he'll be receiving some of that all-important humanity only makes him more appealing.    Any other concerns for how this show might trend forward are firmly questions for the future. I'm not even entirely opposed to the idea of some adversarial elements. Mia, the rival musician introduced in the second episode, has her propensity for Dick Datastardly-style antics which I pretty well enjoy. Plus, come on, this is a show where the opening features everyone dancing around to ""Chikichiki Banban"" (in what's got to be a contender for opener of the year) – things are probably going to work out generally nicely overall. For now, these are opening episodes that immediately make the conceptual hooks clear for Ya Boy Kongming, a series that can seem like an oddly askew gimmick at first pass, but which I've kind of utterly fallen for by this point in its efforts of establishing itself.

It keeps us engaged as our own mental gears turn, theorizing about what it is that Kongming has actually done this time as we roll up to the revelation.    It definitely helps that a lot of the elements driving that are seeded by the writing even for those not particularly well-versed in Three Kingdoms history, which as the bar's owner laments, is a distressing amount of people these days. In fact, Kongming's discussions with the owner as they nerd out over those historical elements are there to serve that narrative purpose: It's in these conversations that Kongming's famous strategy of illusion and confusion is referenced before he deploys a variant of it in the second episode, and how he brings up his adherence to ""The Thirty-Six Stratagems"" in the third episode, as well as leading into more personal elements of his past. Like so much of this show, it's not just an entertaining characteristic element; it's also just dang effective storytelling overall.    This reliance on such a structured setup does bring up the potential issue that Ya Boy Kongming might wind up too bound by its own formula as it goes on. The third episode even has the characters call attention to the fact that the obstacle Eiko has to deal with – competing for an audience at the same time as a more well-known musical act – is effectively the same as that from the second episode. One wouldn't want a show like this, which thrives on keeping the audience engaged with increasing stakes and galaxy-brain managerial ploys from Kongming, to fall into such structural staleness. While that's a concern more for the future of the show, the way the setup works also rubs up against a potential thematic concern: The show's framing of competition and adversity. This angle does also make sense; Kongming is a military strategist, so his style specifically thrives off of outmaneuvering somebody else to the advantage of himself and his liege. But some aside comments by the rival band Jet Jacket in the third episode make the point of how other musicians in this structure are working for their big break as much as Eiko is, thus her 'victory' might need to come at the cost of someone else's. As cutthroat as the music industry is known to be, there's the possibility that said structure might feel too harshly adversarial for what is, at its heart, an earnest comedy.    Thankfully, the third episode does end up mitigating that tone in a heartening way by its end, with Kongming extending an olive branch to Jet Jacket in assisting with some of their troubles he previously leveraged to Eiko's success. It brings back the all-around good vibes of the series premiere, and also offers another follow-up on some of that conversational information we got on Kongming: The desire to appreciate the humanity of others and enjoy time spent with them as compensation for missing out on partying with the soldiers in his previous life. That ends up being the strongest new component from that episode; despite being a public-domain historical transplant who serves as this show's fundamental gimmick, we will be seeing some characterization and development for Kongming himself.    It forms a neat parallel with the show's overall structure that strengthens the cohesiveness of the whole thing. Just as Kongming's past strategizing exploits inform his efforts in the modern day, his personal experiences and regrets from his past life inform how he chooses to interact with people now. Kongming was already adorably effective just basically acting as this show's mascot, so confirming that he'll be receiving some of that all-important humanity only makes him more appealing.    Any other concerns for how this show might trend forward are firmly questions for the future. I'm not even entirely opposed to the idea of some adversarial elements. Mia, the rival musician introduced in the second episode, has her propensity for Dick Datastardly-style antics which I pretty well enjoy. Plus, come on, this is a show where the opening features everyone dancing around to ""Chikichiki Banban"" (in what's got to be a contender for opener of the year) – things are probably going to work out generally nicely overall. For now, these are opening episodes that immediately make the conceptual hooks clear for Ya Boy Kongming, a series that can seem like an oddly askew gimmick at first pass, but which I've kind of utterly fallen for by this point in its efforts of establishing itself.

Episodes 1-3  by Christopher Farris, Apr 16th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.2                  How would you rate episode 2 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.4                  How would you rate episode 3 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.5            The first episode of Ya Boy Kongming! does an effective (and delightful) job of laying out its establishing premise: Three Kingdoms-era strategist Kongming finds himself reincarnated into modern-day Japan, where he winds up tending both a bar and the career of aspiring songstress Eiko. It's fun, it's funny, and perhaps surprisingly cute in its wholesome handling of the whole affair and making clear just how moe ol' Zhuge Liang can be. Past the central time-travel gimmick, that first episode also clearly demonstrates just how instrumental the musical element of the story will be moving forward, featuring several performances from Eiko (including a lovingly-rendered and particularly moving one in her apartment halfway through the episode) and even sprinkling in some base knowledge of musical technicalities that it can work off going forward. It's just getting started, but it's still a good time.    But it's the second (and by extension, third) episode of this anime that better showcases the actual structure of the show and its further charms. Kongming formally takes on the role of Eiko's manager and we'll be following her path to stardom step by step, with each part punctuated by the strategist demonstrating his latest Zany Scheme™ in getting her there, potentially rooted in some famous or mythologized bit from Kongming's history. And that, I must tell you, is where I really fell in love with this show.

This angle does also make sense; Kongming is a military strategist, so his style specifically thrives off of outmaneuvering somebody else to the advantage of himself and his liege. But some aside comments by the rival band Jet Jacket in the third episode make the point of how other musicians in this structure are working for their big break as much as Eiko is, thus her 'victory' might need to come at the cost of someone else's. As cutthroat as the music industry is known to be, there's the possibility that said structure might feel too harshly adversarial for what is, at its heart, an earnest comedy.    Thankfully, the third episode does end up mitigating that tone in a heartening way by its end, with Kongming extending an olive branch to Jet Jacket in assisting with some of their troubles he previously leveraged to Eiko's success. It brings back the all-around good vibes of the series premiere, and also offers another follow-up on some of that conversational information we got on Kongming: The desire to appreciate the humanity of others and enjoy time spent with them as compensation for missing out on partying with the soldiers in his previous life. That ends up being the strongest new component from that episode; despite being a public-domain historical transplant who serves as this show's fundamental gimmick, we will be seeing some characterization and development for Kongming himself.    It forms a neat parallel with the show's overall structure that strengthens the cohesiveness of the whole thing. Just as Kongming's past strategizing exploits inform his efforts in the modern day, his personal experiences and regrets from his past life inform how he chooses to interact with people now. Kongming was already adorably effective just basically acting as this show's mascot, so confirming that he'll be receiving some of that all-important humanity only makes him more appealing.    Any other concerns for how this show might trend forward are firmly questions for the future. I'm not even entirely opposed to the idea of some adversarial elements. Mia, the rival musician introduced in the second episode, has her propensity for Dick Datastardly-style antics which I pretty well enjoy. Plus, come on, this is a show where the opening features everyone dancing around to ""Chikichiki Banban"" (in what's got to be a contender for opener of the year) – things are probably going to work out generally nicely overall. For now, these are opening episodes that immediately make the conceptual hooks clear for Ya Boy Kongming, a series that can seem like an oddly askew gimmick at first pass, but which I've kind of utterly fallen for by this point in its efforts of establishing itself.

17-04-2022,anime,1,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/ya-boy-kongming/episodes-1-3/.184658,Episodes 1-3 - Ya Boy Kongming! - Anime News Network:SEA,"            How would you rate episode 1 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.2                  How would you rate episode 2 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.4                  How would you rate episode 3 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.5            The first episode of Ya Boy Kongming! does an effective (and delightful) job of laying out its establishing premise: Three Kingdoms-era strategist Kongming finds himself reincarnated into modern-day Japan, where he winds up tending both a bar and the career of aspiring songstress Eiko. It's fun, it's funny, and perhaps surprisingly cute in its wholesome handling of the whole affair and making clear just how moe ol' Zhuge Liang can be. Past the central time-travel gimmick, that first episode also clearly demonstrates just how instrumental the musical element of the story will be moving forward, featuring several performances from Eiko (including a lovingly-rendered and particularly moving one in her apartment halfway through the episode) and even sprinkling in some base knowledge of musical technicalities that it can work off going forward. It's just getting started, but it's still a good time.    But it's the second (and by extension, third) episode of this anime that better showcases the actual structure of the show and its further charms. Kongming formally takes on the role of Eiko's manager and we'll be following her path to stardom step by step, with each part punctuated by the strategist demonstrating his latest Zany Scheme™ in getting her there, potentially rooted in some famous or mythologized bit from Kongming's history. And that, I must tell you, is where I really fell in love with this show. Just seeing Kongming help Eiko out would be pleasant enough, since they're both so appealing and easy to root for, but couching those efforts in demonstrations of strategy and mind games gives things a narrative thrust as well. It's the sort of thing that makes any story based on competition (combat-based or otherwise) interesting, especially when structured on an episodic basis like this. It keeps us engaged as our own mental gears turn, theorizing about what it is that Kongming has actually done this time as we roll up to the revelation.    It definitely helps that a lot of the elements driving that are seeded by the writing even for those not particularly well-versed in Three Kingdoms history, which as the bar's owner laments, is a distressing amount of people these days. In fact, Kongming's discussions with the owner as they nerd out over those historical elements are there to serve that narrative purpose: It's in these conversations that Kongming's famous strategy of illusion and confusion is referenced before he deploys a variant of it in the second episode, and how he brings up his adherence to ""The Thirty-Six Stratagems"" in the third episode, as well as leading into more personal elements of his past. Like so much of this show, it's not just an entertaining characteristic element; it's also just dang effective storytelling overall.    This reliance on such a structured setup does bring up the potential issue that Ya Boy Kongming might wind up too bound by its own formula as it goes on. The third episode even has the characters call attention to the fact that the obstacle Eiko has to deal with – competing for an audience at the same time as a more well-known musical act – is effectively the same as that from the second episode. One wouldn't want a show like this, which thrives on keeping the audience engaged with increasing stakes and galaxy-brain managerial ploys from Kongming, to fall into such structural staleness. While that's a concern more for the future of the show, the way the setup works also rubs up against a potential thematic concern: The show's framing of competition and adversity.
