The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Aharen-san wa Hakarenai   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Aharen-san wa Hakarenai ?                     Community score: 3.9              What is this?   Short, quiet Reina Aharen sits next to Raidō in class. Aharen is not so good at gauging the distance between people (or personal boundaries), and Raidō initially sensed some distance between the two of them. Then one day, when Raidō picked up the eraser that Aharen had dropped, the distance between them suddenly became uncomfortably close. From ""way too distant"" to ""way too close,"" Aharen is simply unpredictable.    Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is based on  Asato Mizu's romantic comedy manga series and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Romantic comedies about awkward turtles seem to be all the rage lately. Whether they be shy teens or emotionally immature adults, most anime romcoms come with more than a dash of fumbling and socially-stunted quirkiness. Not that I'm complaining; when I first got together with the man who would become my husband, our friend described our flirtation as “the world's most awkward swans honking at each other in distress from across the lake,” so you can probably guess that I find these kinds of series more relatable than love stories between two functional people. Still, as with any genre trends, there are going to be a whole lot of pale imitators to go alongside the creative and original.    Aharen-san wa Hakarenai lies somewhere in that middle ground. A lot of its tropes and plot devices are similar to other current, popular shows, if not lifted outright, but I found myself not minding at all. The chill mood reminded me of Tanaka-kun is Always Listless, a series I thoroughly enjoyed, even if it isn't necessarily a romance. Or maybe it was, depending on how you interpreted it. You know, these things are really best left up to audience interpretation. But I digress. Romance or not, Aharen-san's gentle comedy of two deadpan teens on similar wavelengths vibing together will either work for you or it won't.    Unlike a lot of gentle comedies, however, Aharen-san has actual jokes. Gags! Japes! And a lot of them are actually really funny! Humorous! They tickled my funny bone! The nice thing about Aharen and Raidou being so soft-spoken is that it means the humor can't lean on the characters CONSTANTLY YELLING and instead has to find other ways to make a joke land. This made me very happy, because I don't find headaches fun and humor-screeching is the fastest way to give me one. Instead, the physical comedy varies from making me smile to making me laugh out loud, because how could I not at the sight of a tiny girl throwing herself into her tall friend's skull like a purple-haired missile, shortly after pelting him with folded-up slips of paper all day?    So even if Aharen-san isn't the best or most original rom-com on the market, it's sweet and it's certainly funny enough to justify its own existence. Maybe it's because I watched it shortly after I got home from a truly exhausting work week that included two nights away from home, but the chill vibes were truly what I needed at the moment. Perhaps they're what you need too.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               There's nothing egregiously wrong with Aharen-san wa Hakarenai and I can see a lot of people liking it. The characters are cute, and their attempts to better themselves and the problems they face are easy to empathize with.    Raido is one of those kids who had their growth spurt early and has a mean “resting bitch face”  that makes him seem unapproachable. On the other side of the equation, we have the titular Aharen who speaks in an exceedingly soft voice and has trouble understanding personal distance. She's either up in people's personal space or so distant it seems like she's ignoring them. Luckily, the two freshman are keenly aware of their issues and want to overcome them through building a friendship with each other.    Watching them do their best, fail, and try again is cute. I mean, it seems to be the entire premise of the show. Some of the best gags in the show involve nothing more than Aharen shoving food in Raido's face or draping herself across him in an odd pose.    But just because it was cute that doesn't mean it can't be boring. The pacing in Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is painfully slow; the jokes just drag on seemingly forever and more than once I almost skipped ahead to the next scene—and I would, if I hadn't needed to write this review. So, all in all, this is one of those anime I want to like far more than I actually do. I won't be coming back for episode 2, but maybe on some lazy Sunday down the line I'll check out the manga where I control the pace of the story simply by how quickly I turn the pages.        James Beckett  Rating:               Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is one of those shows that I went into with literally know background knowledge of what the show was about, and since my Japanese is a little rusty, the very straightforward title didn't clue me in nearly quick enough. However, once our meek protagonist Raido got done catching the audience up on his meek and lonely existence, he starts desperately trying to make friends with his classmate, the titular Aharen, and it didn't take more than a minute or two for me to figure out the show's main gimmick. In the parlance of Seinfeld, the girl is a low-talker.    This is not unfamiliar territory, necessarily. Outside of classic 90s sitcoms, other anime have explored this exact same trope, and very recently, too. Komi Can't Communicate has a nearly identical setup, where a protagonist with no social circle to speak of befriends a girl who is so incapable of basic verbal communication that it is genuinely disturbing how no adult in her life has tried to seek professional medical help for the child. The main difference between Komi and Aharen-san, it would seem, is that instead of relying on incredibly boisterous humor and outstanding production values to get its audience's attention, Aharen-san is content to simply have its characters whittle away time while slowly learning how to understand one another. Very slowly.    I'll be honest: While I wanted to like Aharen-san, this premiere was tough to get through. It's not awful by any means, and some of its visual gags actually made me laugh out loud (I specifically loved any time that Aharen would take one of Raido's communication experiments way too literally and proceed to pelt him with paper notes and/or her own skull). However, in between the one or two scenes that elicited a chuckle out of me, I was agonizingly bored.    I totally get the appeal of watching two socially awkward youngsters learn to overcome their communication issues and all that. It's just difficult to become invested in this coming-of-age when both of the lead characters are literally designed to be unmemorable. I simply got nothing out of Raido's exceedingly underwhelming adventures with Aharen, because Raido is a big old nothingburger of a protagonist, and Aharen feels less like a real human person and more like a marketing guy's vision of a perfectly merchandisable plush doll come to life. A veritable Moe Golem. I can see how Aharen-san wa Hakarenai could easily become a crowd-pleasing favorite amongst its target audience, but I will be happy to leave it off of my Spring watchlist.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Aharen is my personal nightmare – someone with very little concept of personal space. She seems to come by it honestly enough; her voice is so astoundingly quiet that she almost has to get in someone's face in order to be heard. She's also carrying a bit of trauma from her middle school days, when she threw herself so wholeheartedly into friendships that she ended up scaring would-be friends away, and she claims to be afraid to repeat the same mistakes now that she's in high school. But…is she really? Because almost the moment Raido, who sits beside her and wants to remedy his own middle school issues, expresses interest, she's all over him with the boundless enthusiasm for physical closeness of your average pup. Even Raido's not quite sure what to make of it.    I can't quite decide if this is meant to be funny, sweet, or just soothing. Possibly my confusion stems from the fact that I found the episode's pacing glacial and the resulting viewing experience somewhat stultifying. I could easily see how Aharen's intended to be appealingly cute – she's physically tiny and has an endearing devotion to making her friendship with Raido work, even if she's not particularly good at it. Besides climbing up him, she also does things like pass/throw him notes while he's in the bathroom and spend hours carefully studying the angles of a crane game so that she can be sure to win plenty of creepy duck-face plushies for him. That he's also trying to win one for her is very sweet, too, and I could see this turning into a low-stakes romance that slice-of-life fans would find very enjoyable. It's clear that Aharen's heart is in the right place even if she doesn't have the experience to back up her good intentions, and really, since Raido doesn't seem to object to her sitting on his lap or draping herself across him to take a nap, we perhaps shouldn't either.    I admit to finding this dull. It could certainly improve from here as Raido learns more about Aharen, and the probable rival character who comes in at the tail end of this episode could shake the pacing up in a positive way. But with lackluster visuals and a dragging progression, I don't think I have the patience to wait this one out.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This is one of those shows where the title tells you everything you need to know going in. Or it would if the powers that be hadn't just left the title romanized for whatever reason. The gist of it is that Aharen-san is indecipherable, inscrutable, and just a god damn weirdo. Pretty much every joke or plot development across this episode is built around that single conceit. There's this tiny, impossibly soft-spoken girl in Raido's new high school class, he can never tell what's going on in her head no matter what he tries, hijinks ensue. It's the kind of premise that's so sparse and simple, it can only get by on pitch perfect execution. While this anime isn't quite there yet, it does, at least, hit the right notes more often than not across this episode.    It all comes down to tone and timing here, and while some segments of this episode don't quite coalesce, when they do it strikes a similar tone to Tanaka-kun is Always Listless, where the humor comes from the combination of laidback tone and absurd circumstances. The best is definitely Raido's escalating attempts to overcome Aharen's impossibly quiet voice through any means possible; notes, lip reading, something called “bone conduction”, and culminating in smoke signals and messenger pigeons. It's all very silly, and made funnier by Raido's unshakable stone face, looking deadly serious through every second of it and never so much as raising his voice.    That more than anything is what makes a lot of these gags work – they'd be ruined if Raido were a shouty straightman overreacting to every eccentricity from Aharen, but are made way funnier with how much he just rolls with it all. It works because both character are established to be awkward weirdos trying to force their way out of their shells, so no matter how bizarre their shenanigans get, they both seems to be having fun and genuinely want to be around each other. It doesn't hurt that Aharen's whole gimmick about misjudging personal space means that to all outside observers these two are already dating – going home together, sharing desks and textbooks, Aharen straight up sitting in Raido's lap when they share lunch, all classic romcom stuff that these two have walked blindly into in a very endearing way. It's all cute as the dickens, and while this joke could wear itself out, I'm hopeful that the series can build upon this solid foundation and make for a quiet, endearing little comedy.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review                Odd Taxi: In the Woods   Apr 17, 00:00                 anime    By cleverly reframing its narrative around a series of interviews with the supporting cast, Odd Taxi: In the Woods succeeds where most recap films fail: it's an artistically cohesive film in its own right. ― Odd Taxi was 2021's sleeper anime hit, telling an intricate, original mystery that kept viewers guessing every week.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Aharen-san wa Hakarenai   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Aharen-san wa Hakarenai ?                     Community score: 3.9              What is this?   Short, quiet Reina Aharen sits next to Raidō in class. Aharen is not so good at gauging the distance between people (or personal boundaries), and Raidō initially sensed some distance between the two of them. Then one day, when Raidō picked up the eraser that Aharen had dropped, the distance between them suddenly became uncomfortably close. From ""way too distant"" to ""way too close,"" Aharen is simply unpredictable.    Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is based on  Asato Mizu's romantic comedy manga series and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Romantic comedies about awkward turtles seem to be all the rage lately. Whether they be shy teens or emotionally immature adults, most anime romcoms come with more than a dash of fumbling and socially-stunted quirkiness. Not that I'm complaining; when I first got together with the man who would become my husband, our friend described our flirtation as “the world's most awkward swans honking at each other in distress from across the lake,” so you can probably guess that I find these kinds of series more relatable than love stories between two functional people. Still, as with any genre trends, there are going to be a whole lot of pale imitators to go alongside the creative and original.    Aharen-san wa Hakarenai lies somewhere in that middle ground. A lot of its tropes and plot devices are similar to other current, popular shows, if not lifted outright, but I found myself not minding at all. The chill mood reminded me of Tanaka-kun is Always Listless, a series I thoroughly enjoyed, even if it isn't necessarily a romance. Or maybe it was, depending on how you interpreted it. You know, these things are really best left up to audience interpretation. But I digress. Romance or not, Aharen-san's gentle comedy of two deadpan teens on similar wavelengths vibing together will either work for you or it won't.    Unlike a lot of gentle comedies, however, Aharen-san has actual jokes. Gags! Japes! And a lot of them are actually really funny! Humorous! They tickled my funny bone! The nice thing about Aharen and Raidou being so soft-spoken is that it means the humor can't lean on the characters CONSTANTLY YELLING and instead has to find other ways to make a joke land. This made me very happy, because I don't find headaches fun and humor-screeching is the fastest way to give me one. Instead, the physical comedy varies from making me smile to making me laugh out loud, because how could I not at the sight of a tiny girl throwing herself into her tall friend's skull like a purple-haired missile, shortly after pelting him with folded-up slips of paper all day?    So even if Aharen-san isn't the best or most original rom-com on the market, it's sweet and it's certainly funny enough to justify its own existence. Maybe it's because I watched it shortly after I got home from a truly exhausting work week that included two nights away from home, but the chill vibes were truly what I needed at the moment. Perhaps they're what you need too.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               There's nothing egregiously wrong with Aharen-san wa Hakarenai and I can see a lot of people liking it. The characters are cute, and their attempts to better themselves and the problems they face are easy to empathize with.    Raido is one of those kids who had their growth spurt early and has a mean “resting bitch face”  that makes him seem unapproachable. On the other side of the equation, we have the titular Aharen who speaks in an exceedingly soft voice and has trouble understanding personal distance. She's either up in people's personal space or so distant it seems like she's ignoring them. Luckily, the two freshman are keenly aware of their issues and want to overcome them through building a friendship with each other.    Watching them do their best, fail, and try again is cute. I mean, it seems to be the entire premise of the show. Some of the best gags in the show involve nothing more than Aharen shoving food in Raido's face or draping herself across him in an odd pose.    But just because it was cute that doesn't mean it can't be boring. The pacing in Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is painfully slow; the jokes just drag on seemingly forever and more than once I almost skipped ahead to the next scene—and I would, if I hadn't needed to write this review. So, all in all, this is one of those anime I want to like far more than I actually do. I won't be coming back for episode 2, but maybe on some lazy Sunday down the line I'll check out the manga where I control the pace of the story simply by how quickly I turn the pages.        James Beckett  Rating:               Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is one of those shows that I went into with literally know background knowledge of what the show was about, and since my Japanese is a little rusty, the very straightforward title didn't clue me in nearly quick enough. However, once our meek protagonist Raido got done catching the audience up on his meek and lonely existence, he starts desperately trying to make friends with his classmate, the titular Aharen, and it didn't take more than a minute or two for me to figure out the show's main gimmick. In the parlance of Seinfeld, the girl is a low-talker.    This is not unfamiliar territory, necessarily. Outside of classic 90s sitcoms, other anime have explored this exact same trope, and very recently, too. Komi Can't Communicate has a nearly identical setup, where a protagonist with no social circle to speak of befriends a girl who is so incapable of basic verbal communication that it is genuinely disturbing how no adult in her life has tried to seek professional medical help for the child. The main difference between Komi and Aharen-san, it would seem, is that instead of relying on incredibly boisterous humor and outstanding production values to get its audience's attention, Aharen-san is content to simply have its characters whittle away time while slowly learning how to understand one another. Very slowly.    I'll be honest: While I wanted to like Aharen-san, this premiere was tough to get through. It's not awful by any means, and some of its visual gags actually made me laugh out loud (I specifically loved any time that Aharen would take one of Raido's communication experiments way too literally and proceed to pelt him with paper notes and/or her own skull). However, in between the one or two scenes that elicited a chuckle out of me, I was agonizingly bored.    I totally get the appeal of watching two socially awkward youngsters learn to overcome their communication issues and all that. It's just difficult to become invested in this coming-of-age when both of the lead characters are literally designed to be unmemorable. I simply got nothing out of Raido's exceedingly underwhelming adventures with Aharen, because Raido is a big old nothingburger of a protagonist, and Aharen feels less like a real human person and more like a marketing guy's vision of a perfectly merchandisable plush doll come to life. A veritable Moe Golem. I can see how Aharen-san wa Hakarenai could easily become a crowd-pleasing favorite amongst its target audience, but I will be happy to leave it off of my Spring watchlist.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Aharen is my personal nightmare – someone with very little concept of personal space. She seems to come by it honestly enough; her voice is so astoundingly quiet that she almost has to get in someone's face in order to be heard. She's also carrying a bit of trauma from her middle school days, when she threw herself so wholeheartedly into friendships that she ended up scaring would-be friends away, and she claims to be afraid to repeat the same mistakes now that she's in high school. But…is she really? Because almost the moment Raido, who sits beside her and wants to remedy his own middle school issues, expresses interest, she's all over him with the boundless enthusiasm for physical closeness of your average pup. Even Raido's not quite sure what to make of it.    I can't quite decide if this is meant to be funny, sweet, or just soothing. Possibly my confusion stems from the fact that I found the episode's pacing glacial and the resulting viewing experience somewhat stultifying. I could easily see how Aharen's intended to be appealingly cute – she's physically tiny and has an endearing devotion to making her friendship with Raido work, even if she's not particularly good at it. Besides climbing up him, she also does things like pass/throw him notes while he's in the bathroom and spend hours carefully studying the angles of a crane game so that she can be sure to win plenty of creepy duck-face plushies for him. That he's also trying to win one for her is very sweet, too, and I could see this turning into a low-stakes romance that slice-of-life fans would find very enjoyable. It's clear that Aharen's heart is in the right place even if she doesn't have the experience to back up her good intentions, and really, since Raido doesn't seem to object to her sitting on his lap or draping herself across him to take a nap, we perhaps shouldn't either.    I admit to finding this dull. It could certainly improve from here as Raido learns more about Aharen, and the probable rival character who comes in at the tail end of this episode could shake the pacing up in a positive way. But with lackluster visuals and a dragging progression, I don't think I have the patience to wait this one out.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This is one of those shows where the title tells you everything you need to know going in. Or it would if the powers that be hadn't just left the title romanized for whatever reason. The gist of it is that Aharen-san is indecipherable, inscrutable, and just a god damn weirdo. Pretty much every joke or plot development across this episode is built around that single conceit. There's this tiny, impossibly soft-spoken girl in Raido's new high school class, he can never tell what's going on in her head no matter what he tries, hijinks ensue. It's the kind of premise that's so sparse and simple, it can only get by on pitch perfect execution. While this anime isn't quite there yet, it does, at least, hit the right notes more often than not across this episode.    It all comes down to tone and timing here, and while some segments of this episode don't quite coalesce, when they do it strikes a similar tone to Tanaka-kun is Always Listless, where the humor comes from the combination of laidback tone and absurd circumstances. The best is definitely Raido's escalating attempts to overcome Aharen's impossibly quiet voice through any means possible; notes, lip reading, something called “bone conduction”, and culminating in smoke signals and messenger pigeons. It's all very silly, and made funnier by Raido's unshakable stone face, looking deadly serious through every second of it and never so much as raising his voice.    That more than anything is what makes a lot of these gags work – they'd be ruined if Raido were a shouty straightman overreacting to every eccentricity from Aharen, but are made way funnier with how much he just rolls with it all. It works because both character are established to be awkward weirdos trying to force their way out of their shells, so no matter how bizarre their shenanigans get, they both seems to be having fun and genuinely want to be around each other. It doesn't hurt that Aharen's whole gimmick about misjudging personal space means that to all outside observers these two are already dating – going home together, sharing desks and textbooks, Aharen straight up sitting in Raido's lap when they share lunch, all classic romcom stuff that these two have walked blindly into in a very endearing way. It's all cute as the dickens, and while this joke could wear itself out, I'm hopeful that the series can build upon this solid foundation and make for a quiet, endearing little comedy.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review                Odd Taxi: In the Woods   Apr 17, 00:00                 anime    By cleverly reframing its narrative around a series of interviews with the supporting cast, Odd Taxi: In the Woods succeeds where most recap films fail: it's an artistically cohesive film in its own right. ― Odd Taxi was 2021's sleeper anime hit, telling an intricate, original mystery that kept viewers guessing every week.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Aharen-san wa Hakarenai   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Aharen-san wa Hakarenai ?                     Community score: 3.9              What is this?   Short, quiet Reina Aharen sits next to Raidō in class. Aharen is not so good at gauging the distance between people (or personal boundaries), and Raidō initially sensed some distance between the two of them. Then one day, when Raidō picked up the eraser that Aharen had dropped, the distance between them suddenly became uncomfortably close. From ""way too distant"" to ""way too close,"" Aharen is simply unpredictable.    Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is based on  Asato Mizu's romantic comedy manga series and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Romantic comedies about awkward turtles seem to be all the rage lately. Whether they be shy teens or emotionally immature adults, most anime romcoms come with more than a dash of fumbling and socially-stunted quirkiness. Not that I'm complaining; when I first got together with the man who would become my husband, our friend described our flirtation as “the world's most awkward swans honking at each other in distress from across the lake,” so you can probably guess that I find these kinds of series more relatable than love stories between two functional people. Still, as with any genre trends, there are going to be a whole lot of pale imitators to go alongside the creative and original.    Aharen-san wa Hakarenai lies somewhere in that middle ground. A lot of its tropes and plot devices are similar to other current, popular shows, if not lifted outright, but I found myself not minding at all. The chill mood reminded me of Tanaka-kun is Always Listless, a series I thoroughly enjoyed, even if it isn't necessarily a romance. Or maybe it was, depending on how you interpreted it. You know, these things are really best left up to audience interpretation. But I digress. Romance or not, Aharen-san's gentle comedy of two deadpan teens on similar wavelengths vibing together will either work for you or it won't.    Unlike a lot of gentle comedies, however, Aharen-san has actual jokes. Gags! Japes! And a lot of them are actually really funny! Humorous! They tickled my funny bone! The nice thing about Aharen and Raidou being so soft-spoken is that it means the humor can't lean on the characters CONSTANTLY YELLING and instead has to find other ways to make a joke land. This made me very happy, because I don't find headaches fun and humor-screeching is the fastest way to give me one. Instead, the physical comedy varies from making me smile to making me laugh out loud, because how could I not at the sight of a tiny girl throwing herself into her tall friend's skull like a purple-haired missile, shortly after pelting him with folded-up slips of paper all day?    So even if Aharen-san isn't the best or most original rom-com on the market, it's sweet and it's certainly funny enough to justify its own existence. Maybe it's because I watched it shortly after I got home from a truly exhausting work week that included two nights away from home, but the chill vibes were truly what I needed at the moment. Perhaps they're what you need too.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               There's nothing egregiously wrong with Aharen-san wa Hakarenai and I can see a lot of people liking it. The characters are cute, and their attempts to better themselves and the problems they face are easy to empathize with.    Raido is one of those kids who had their growth spurt early and has a mean “resting bitch face”  that makes him seem unapproachable. On the other side of the equation, we have the titular Aharen who speaks in an exceedingly soft voice and has trouble understanding personal distance. She's either up in people's personal space or so distant it seems like she's ignoring them. Luckily, the two freshman are keenly aware of their issues and want to overcome them through building a friendship with each other.    Watching them do their best, fail, and try again is cute. I mean, it seems to be the entire premise of the show. Some of the best gags in the show involve nothing more than Aharen shoving food in Raido's face or draping herself across him in an odd pose.    But just because it was cute that doesn't mean it can't be boring. The pacing in Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is painfully slow; the jokes just drag on seemingly forever and more than once I almost skipped ahead to the next scene—and I would, if I hadn't needed to write this review. So, all in all, this is one of those anime I want to like far more than I actually do. I won't be coming back for episode 2, but maybe on some lazy Sunday down the line I'll check out the manga where I control the pace of the story simply by how quickly I turn the pages.        James Beckett  Rating:               Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is one of those shows that I went into with literally know background knowledge of what the show was about, and since my Japanese is a little rusty, the very straightforward title didn't clue me in nearly quick enough. However, once our meek protagonist Raido got done catching the audience up on his meek and lonely existence, he starts desperately trying to make friends with his classmate, the titular Aharen, and it didn't take more than a minute or two for me to figure out the show's main gimmick. In the parlance of Seinfeld, the girl is a low-talker.    This is not unfamiliar territory, necessarily. Outside of classic 90s sitcoms, other anime have explored this exact same trope, and very recently, too. Komi Can't Communicate has a nearly identical setup, where a protagonist with no social circle to speak of befriends a girl who is so incapable of basic verbal communication that it is genuinely disturbing how no adult in her life has tried to seek professional medical help for the child. The main difference between Komi and Aharen-san, it would seem, is that instead of relying on incredibly boisterous humor and outstanding production values to get its audience's attention, Aharen-san is content to simply have its characters whittle away time while slowly learning how to understand one another. Very slowly.    I'll be honest: While I wanted to like Aharen-san, this premiere was tough to get through. It's not awful by any means, and some of its visual gags actually made me laugh out loud (I specifically loved any time that Aharen would take one of Raido's communication experiments way too literally and proceed to pelt him with paper notes and/or her own skull). However, in between the one or two scenes that elicited a chuckle out of me, I was agonizingly bored.    I totally get the appeal of watching two socially awkward youngsters learn to overcome their communication issues and all that. It's just difficult to become invested in this coming-of-age when both of the lead characters are literally designed to be unmemorable. I simply got nothing out of Raido's exceedingly underwhelming adventures with Aharen, because Raido is a big old nothingburger of a protagonist, and Aharen feels less like a real human person and more like a marketing guy's vision of a perfectly merchandisable plush doll come to life. A veritable Moe Golem. I can see how Aharen-san wa Hakarenai could easily become a crowd-pleasing favorite amongst its target audience, but I will be happy to leave it off of my Spring watchlist.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Aharen is my personal nightmare – someone with very little concept of personal space. She seems to come by it honestly enough; her voice is so astoundingly quiet that she almost has to get in someone's face in order to be heard. She's also carrying a bit of trauma from her middle school days, when she threw herself so wholeheartedly into friendships that she ended up scaring would-be friends away, and she claims to be afraid to repeat the same mistakes now that she's in high school. But…is she really? Because almost the moment Raido, who sits beside her and wants to remedy his own middle school issues, expresses interest, she's all over him with the boundless enthusiasm for physical closeness of your average pup. Even Raido's not quite sure what to make of it.    I can't quite decide if this is meant to be funny, sweet, or just soothing. Possibly my confusion stems from the fact that I found the episode's pacing glacial and the resulting viewing experience somewhat stultifying. I could easily see how Aharen's intended to be appealingly cute – she's physically tiny and has an endearing devotion to making her friendship with Raido work, even if she's not particularly good at it. Besides climbing up him, she also does things like pass/throw him notes while he's in the bathroom and spend hours carefully studying the angles of a crane game so that she can be sure to win plenty of creepy duck-face plushies for him. That he's also trying to win one for her is very sweet, too, and I could see this turning into a low-stakes romance that slice-of-life fans would find very enjoyable. It's clear that Aharen's heart is in the right place even if she doesn't have the experience to back up her good intentions, and really, since Raido doesn't seem to object to her sitting on his lap or draping herself across him to take a nap, we perhaps shouldn't either.    I admit to finding this dull. It could certainly improve from here as Raido learns more about Aharen, and the probable rival character who comes in at the tail end of this episode could shake the pacing up in a positive way. But with lackluster visuals and a dragging progression, I don't think I have the patience to wait this one out.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This is one of those shows where the title tells you everything you need to know going in. Or it would if the powers that be hadn't just left the title romanized for whatever reason. The gist of it is that Aharen-san is indecipherable, inscrutable, and just a god damn weirdo. Pretty much every joke or plot development across this episode is built around that single conceit. There's this tiny, impossibly soft-spoken girl in Raido's new high school class, he can never tell what's going on in her head no matter what he tries, hijinks ensue. It's the kind of premise that's so sparse and simple, it can only get by on pitch perfect execution. While this anime isn't quite there yet, it does, at least, hit the right notes more often than not across this episode.    It all comes down to tone and timing here, and while some segments of this episode don't quite coalesce, when they do it strikes a similar tone to Tanaka-kun is Always Listless, where the humor comes from the combination of laidback tone and absurd circumstances. The best is definitely Raido's escalating attempts to overcome Aharen's impossibly quiet voice through any means possible; notes, lip reading, something called “bone conduction”, and culminating in smoke signals and messenger pigeons. It's all very silly, and made funnier by Raido's unshakable stone face, looking deadly serious through every second of it and never so much as raising his voice.    That more than anything is what makes a lot of these gags work – they'd be ruined if Raido were a shouty straightman overreacting to every eccentricity from Aharen, but are made way funnier with how much he just rolls with it all. It works because both character are established to be awkward weirdos trying to force their way out of their shells, so no matter how bizarre their shenanigans get, they both seems to be having fun and genuinely want to be around each other. It doesn't hurt that Aharen's whole gimmick about misjudging personal space means that to all outside observers these two are already dating – going home together, sharing desks and textbooks, Aharen straight up sitting in Raido's lap when they share lunch, all classic romcom stuff that these two have walked blindly into in a very endearing way. It's all cute as the dickens, and while this joke could wear itself out, I'm hopeful that the series can build upon this solid foundation and make for a quiet, endearing little comedy.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review                Odd Taxi: In the Woods   Apr 17, 00:00                 anime    By cleverly reframing its narrative around a series of interviews with the supporting cast, Odd Taxi: In the Woods succeeds where most recap films fail: it's an artistically cohesive film in its own right. ― Odd Taxi was 2021's sleeper anime hit, telling an intricate, original mystery that kept viewers guessing every week.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Aharen-san wa Hakarenai   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Aharen-san wa Hakarenai ?                     Community score: 3.9              What is this?   Short, quiet Reina Aharen sits next to Raidō in class. Aharen is not so good at gauging the distance between people (or personal boundaries), and Raidō initially sensed some distance between the two of them. Then one day, when Raidō picked up the eraser that Aharen had dropped, the distance between them suddenly became uncomfortably close. From ""way too distant"" to ""way too close,"" Aharen is simply unpredictable.    Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is based on  Asato Mizu's romantic comedy manga series and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Romantic comedies about awkward turtles seem to be all the rage lately. Whether they be shy teens or emotionally immature adults, most anime romcoms come with more than a dash of fumbling and socially-stunted quirkiness. Not that I'm complaining; when I first got together with the man who would become my husband, our friend described our flirtation as “the world's most awkward swans honking at each other in distress from across the lake,” so you can probably guess that I find these kinds of series more relatable than love stories between two functional people. Still, as with any genre trends, there are going to be a whole lot of pale imitators to go alongside the creative and original.    Aharen-san wa Hakarenai lies somewhere in that middle ground. A lot of its tropes and plot devices are similar to other current, popular shows, if not lifted outright, but I found myself not minding at all. The chill mood reminded me of Tanaka-kun is Always Listless, a series I thoroughly enjoyed, even if it isn't necessarily a romance. Or maybe it was, depending on how you interpreted it. You know, these things are really best left up to audience interpretation. But I digress. Romance or not, Aharen-san's gentle comedy of two deadpan teens on similar wavelengths vibing together will either work for you or it won't.    Unlike a lot of gentle comedies, however, Aharen-san has actual jokes. Gags! Japes! And a lot of them are actually really funny! Humorous! They tickled my funny bone! The nice thing about Aharen and Raidou being so soft-spoken is that it means the humor can't lean on the characters CONSTANTLY YELLING and instead has to find other ways to make a joke land. This made me very happy, because I don't find headaches fun and humor-screeching is the fastest way to give me one. Instead, the physical comedy varies from making me smile to making me laugh out loud, because how could I not at the sight of a tiny girl throwing herself into her tall friend's skull like a purple-haired missile, shortly after pelting him with folded-up slips of paper all day?    So even if Aharen-san isn't the best or most original rom-com on the market, it's sweet and it's certainly funny enough to justify its own existence. Maybe it's because I watched it shortly after I got home from a truly exhausting work week that included two nights away from home, but the chill vibes were truly what I needed at the moment. Perhaps they're what you need too.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               There's nothing egregiously wrong with Aharen-san wa Hakarenai and I can see a lot of people liking it. The characters are cute, and their attempts to better themselves and the problems they face are easy to empathize with.    Raido is one of those kids who had their growth spurt early and has a mean “resting bitch face”  that makes him seem unapproachable. On the other side of the equation, we have the titular Aharen who speaks in an exceedingly soft voice and has trouble understanding personal distance. She's either up in people's personal space or so distant it seems like she's ignoring them. Luckily, the two freshman are keenly aware of their issues and want to overcome them through building a friendship with each other.    Watching them do their best, fail, and try again is cute. I mean, it seems to be the entire premise of the show. Some of the best gags in the show involve nothing more than Aharen shoving food in Raido's face or draping herself across him in an odd pose.    But just because it was cute that doesn't mean it can't be boring. The pacing in Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is painfully slow; the jokes just drag on seemingly forever and more than once I almost skipped ahead to the next scene—and I would, if I hadn't needed to write this review. So, all in all, this is one of those anime I want to like far more than I actually do. I won't be coming back for episode 2, but maybe on some lazy Sunday down the line I'll check out the manga where I control the pace of the story simply by how quickly I turn the pages.        James Beckett  Rating:               Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is one of those shows that I went into with literally know background knowledge of what the show was about, and since my Japanese is a little rusty, the very straightforward title didn't clue me in nearly quick enough. However, once our meek protagonist Raido got done catching the audience up on his meek and lonely existence, he starts desperately trying to make friends with his classmate, the titular Aharen, and it didn't take more than a minute or two for me to figure out the show's main gimmick. In the parlance of Seinfeld, the girl is a low-talker.    This is not unfamiliar territory, necessarily. Outside of classic 90s sitcoms, other anime have explored this exact same trope, and very recently, too. Komi Can't Communicate has a nearly identical setup, where a protagonist with no social circle to speak of befriends a girl who is so incapable of basic verbal communication that it is genuinely disturbing how no adult in her life has tried to seek professional medical help for the child. The main difference between Komi and Aharen-san, it would seem, is that instead of relying on incredibly boisterous humor and outstanding production values to get its audience's attention, Aharen-san is content to simply have its characters whittle away time while slowly learning how to understand one another. Very slowly.    I'll be honest: While I wanted to like Aharen-san, this premiere was tough to get through. It's not awful by any means, and some of its visual gags actually made me laugh out loud (I specifically loved any time that Aharen would take one of Raido's communication experiments way too literally and proceed to pelt him with paper notes and/or her own skull). However, in between the one or two scenes that elicited a chuckle out of me, I was agonizingly bored.    I totally get the appeal of watching two socially awkward youngsters learn to overcome their communication issues and all that. It's just difficult to become invested in this coming-of-age when both of the lead characters are literally designed to be unmemorable. I simply got nothing out of Raido's exceedingly underwhelming adventures with Aharen, because Raido is a big old nothingburger of a protagonist, and Aharen feels less like a real human person and more like a marketing guy's vision of a perfectly merchandisable plush doll come to life. A veritable Moe Golem. I can see how Aharen-san wa Hakarenai could easily become a crowd-pleasing favorite amongst its target audience, but I will be happy to leave it off of my Spring watchlist.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Aharen is my personal nightmare – someone with very little concept of personal space. She seems to come by it honestly enough; her voice is so astoundingly quiet that she almost has to get in someone's face in order to be heard. She's also carrying a bit of trauma from her middle school days, when she threw herself so wholeheartedly into friendships that she ended up scaring would-be friends away, and she claims to be afraid to repeat the same mistakes now that she's in high school. But…is she really? Because almost the moment Raido, who sits beside her and wants to remedy his own middle school issues, expresses interest, she's all over him with the boundless enthusiasm for physical closeness of your average pup. Even Raido's not quite sure what to make of it.    I can't quite decide if this is meant to be funny, sweet, or just soothing. Possibly my confusion stems from the fact that I found the episode's pacing glacial and the resulting viewing experience somewhat stultifying. I could easily see how Aharen's intended to be appealingly cute – she's physically tiny and has an endearing devotion to making her friendship with Raido work, even if she's not particularly good at it. Besides climbing up him, she also does things like pass/throw him notes while he's in the bathroom and spend hours carefully studying the angles of a crane game so that she can be sure to win plenty of creepy duck-face plushies for him. That he's also trying to win one for her is very sweet, too, and I could see this turning into a low-stakes romance that slice-of-life fans would find very enjoyable. It's clear that Aharen's heart is in the right place even if she doesn't have the experience to back up her good intentions, and really, since Raido doesn't seem to object to her sitting on his lap or draping herself across him to take a nap, we perhaps shouldn't either.    I admit to finding this dull. It could certainly improve from here as Raido learns more about Aharen, and the probable rival character who comes in at the tail end of this episode could shake the pacing up in a positive way. But with lackluster visuals and a dragging progression, I don't think I have the patience to wait this one out.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This is one of those shows where the title tells you everything you need to know going in. Or it would if the powers that be hadn't just left the title romanized for whatever reason. The gist of it is that Aharen-san is indecipherable, inscrutable, and just a god damn weirdo. Pretty much every joke or plot development across this episode is built around that single conceit. There's this tiny, impossibly soft-spoken girl in Raido's new high school class, he can never tell what's going on in her head no matter what he tries, hijinks ensue. It's the kind of premise that's so sparse and simple, it can only get by on pitch perfect execution. While this anime isn't quite there yet, it does, at least, hit the right notes more often than not across this episode.    It all comes down to tone and timing here, and while some segments of this episode don't quite coalesce, when they do it strikes a similar tone to Tanaka-kun is Always Listless, where the humor comes from the combination of laidback tone and absurd circumstances. The best is definitely Raido's escalating attempts to overcome Aharen's impossibly quiet voice through any means possible; notes, lip reading, something called “bone conduction”, and culminating in smoke signals and messenger pigeons. It's all very silly, and made funnier by Raido's unshakable stone face, looking deadly serious through every second of it and never so much as raising his voice.    That more than anything is what makes a lot of these gags work – they'd be ruined if Raido were a shouty straightman overreacting to every eccentricity from Aharen, but are made way funnier with how much he just rolls with it all. It works because both character are established to be awkward weirdos trying to force their way out of their shells, so no matter how bizarre their shenanigans get, they both seems to be having fun and genuinely want to be around each other. It doesn't hurt that Aharen's whole gimmick about misjudging personal space means that to all outside observers these two are already dating – going home together, sharing desks and textbooks, Aharen straight up sitting in Raido's lap when they share lunch, all classic romcom stuff that these two have walked blindly into in a very endearing way. It's all cute as the dickens, and while this joke could wear itself out, I'm hopeful that the series can build upon this solid foundation and make for a quiet, endearing little comedy.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review                Odd Taxi: In the Woods   Apr 17, 00:00                 anime    By cleverly reframing its narrative around a series of interviews with the supporting cast, Odd Taxi: In the Woods succeeds where most recap films fail: it's an artistically cohesive film in its own right. ― Odd Taxi was 2021's sleeper anime hit, telling an intricate, original mystery that kept viewers guessing every week.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Aharen-san wa Hakarenai   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Aharen-san wa Hakarenai ?                     Community score: 3.9              What is this?   Short, quiet Reina Aharen sits next to Raidō in class. Aharen is not so good at gauging the distance between people (or personal boundaries), and Raidō initially sensed some distance between the two of them. Then one day, when Raidō picked up the eraser that Aharen had dropped, the distance between them suddenly became uncomfortably close. From ""way too distant"" to ""way too close,"" Aharen is simply unpredictable.    Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is based on  Asato Mizu's romantic comedy manga series and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Romantic comedies about awkward turtles seem to be all the rage lately. Whether they be shy teens or emotionally immature adults, most anime romcoms come with more than a dash of fumbling and socially-stunted quirkiness. Not that I'm complaining; when I first got together with the man who would become my husband, our friend described our flirtation as “the world's most awkward swans honking at each other in distress from across the lake,” so you can probably guess that I find these kinds of series more relatable than love stories between two functional people. Still, as with any genre trends, there are going to be a whole lot of pale imitators to go alongside the creative and original.    Aharen-san wa Hakarenai lies somewhere in that middle ground. A lot of its tropes and plot devices are similar to other current, popular shows, if not lifted outright, but I found myself not minding at all. The chill mood reminded me of Tanaka-kun is Always Listless, a series I thoroughly enjoyed, even if it isn't necessarily a romance. Or maybe it was, depending on how you interpreted it. You know, these things are really best left up to audience interpretation. But I digress. Romance or not, Aharen-san's gentle comedy of two deadpan teens on similar wavelengths vibing together will either work for you or it won't.    Unlike a lot of gentle comedies, however, Aharen-san has actual jokes. Gags! Japes! And a lot of them are actually really funny! Humorous! They tickled my funny bone! The nice thing about Aharen and Raidou being so soft-spoken is that it means the humor can't lean on the characters CONSTANTLY YELLING and instead has to find other ways to make a joke land. This made me very happy, because I don't find headaches fun and humor-screeching is the fastest way to give me one. Instead, the physical comedy varies from making me smile to making me laugh out loud, because how could I not at the sight of a tiny girl throwing herself into her tall friend's skull like a purple-haired missile, shortly after pelting him with folded-up slips of paper all day?    So even if Aharen-san isn't the best or most original rom-com on the market, it's sweet and it's certainly funny enough to justify its own existence. Maybe it's because I watched it shortly after I got home from a truly exhausting work week that included two nights away from home, but the chill vibes were truly what I needed at the moment. Perhaps they're what you need too.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               There's nothing egregiously wrong with Aharen-san wa Hakarenai and I can see a lot of people liking it. The characters are cute, and their attempts to better themselves and the problems they face are easy to empathize with.    Raido is one of those kids who had their growth spurt early and has a mean “resting bitch face”  that makes him seem unapproachable. On the other side of the equation, we have the titular Aharen who speaks in an exceedingly soft voice and has trouble understanding personal distance. She's either up in people's personal space or so distant it seems like she's ignoring them. Luckily, the two freshman are keenly aware of their issues and want to overcome them through building a friendship with each other.    Watching them do their best, fail, and try again is cute. I mean, it seems to be the entire premise of the show. Some of the best gags in the show involve nothing more than Aharen shoving food in Raido's face or draping herself across him in an odd pose.    But just because it was cute that doesn't mean it can't be boring. The pacing in Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is painfully slow; the jokes just drag on seemingly forever and more than once I almost skipped ahead to the next scene—and I would, if I hadn't needed to write this review. So, all in all, this is one of those anime I want to like far more than I actually do. I won't be coming back for episode 2, but maybe on some lazy Sunday down the line I'll check out the manga where I control the pace of the story simply by how quickly I turn the pages.        James Beckett  Rating:               Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is one of those shows that I went into with literally know background knowledge of what the show was about, and since my Japanese is a little rusty, the very straightforward title didn't clue me in nearly quick enough. However, once our meek protagonist Raido got done catching the audience up on his meek and lonely existence, he starts desperately trying to make friends with his classmate, the titular Aharen, and it didn't take more than a minute or two for me to figure out the show's main gimmick. In the parlance of Seinfeld, the girl is a low-talker.    This is not unfamiliar territory, necessarily. Outside of classic 90s sitcoms, other anime have explored this exact same trope, and very recently, too. Komi Can't Communicate has a nearly identical setup, where a protagonist with no social circle to speak of befriends a girl who is so incapable of basic verbal communication that it is genuinely disturbing how no adult in her life has tried to seek professional medical help for the child. The main difference between Komi and Aharen-san, it would seem, is that instead of relying on incredibly boisterous humor and outstanding production values to get its audience's attention, Aharen-san is content to simply have its characters whittle away time while slowly learning how to understand one another. Very slowly.    I'll be honest: While I wanted to like Aharen-san, this premiere was tough to get through. It's not awful by any means, and some of its visual gags actually made me laugh out loud (I specifically loved any time that Aharen would take one of Raido's communication experiments way too literally and proceed to pelt him with paper notes and/or her own skull). However, in between the one or two scenes that elicited a chuckle out of me, I was agonizingly bored.    I totally get the appeal of watching two socially awkward youngsters learn to overcome their communication issues and all that. It's just difficult to become invested in this coming-of-age when both of the lead characters are literally designed to be unmemorable. I simply got nothing out of Raido's exceedingly underwhelming adventures with Aharen, because Raido is a big old nothingburger of a protagonist, and Aharen feels less like a real human person and more like a marketing guy's vision of a perfectly merchandisable plush doll come to life. A veritable Moe Golem. I can see how Aharen-san wa Hakarenai could easily become a crowd-pleasing favorite amongst its target audience, but I will be happy to leave it off of my Spring watchlist.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Aharen is my personal nightmare – someone with very little concept of personal space. She seems to come by it honestly enough; her voice is so astoundingly quiet that she almost has to get in someone's face in order to be heard. She's also carrying a bit of trauma from her middle school days, when she threw herself so wholeheartedly into friendships that she ended up scaring would-be friends away, and she claims to be afraid to repeat the same mistakes now that she's in high school. But…is she really? Because almost the moment Raido, who sits beside her and wants to remedy his own middle school issues, expresses interest, she's all over him with the boundless enthusiasm for physical closeness of your average pup. Even Raido's not quite sure what to make of it.    I can't quite decide if this is meant to be funny, sweet, or just soothing. Possibly my confusion stems from the fact that I found the episode's pacing glacial and the resulting viewing experience somewhat stultifying. I could easily see how Aharen's intended to be appealingly cute – she's physically tiny and has an endearing devotion to making her friendship with Raido work, even if she's not particularly good at it. Besides climbing up him, she also does things like pass/throw him notes while he's in the bathroom and spend hours carefully studying the angles of a crane game so that she can be sure to win plenty of creepy duck-face plushies for him. That he's also trying to win one for her is very sweet, too, and I could see this turning into a low-stakes romance that slice-of-life fans would find very enjoyable. It's clear that Aharen's heart is in the right place even if she doesn't have the experience to back up her good intentions, and really, since Raido doesn't seem to object to her sitting on his lap or draping herself across him to take a nap, we perhaps shouldn't either.    I admit to finding this dull. It could certainly improve from here as Raido learns more about Aharen, and the probable rival character who comes in at the tail end of this episode could shake the pacing up in a positive way. But with lackluster visuals and a dragging progression, I don't think I have the patience to wait this one out.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This is one of those shows where the title tells you everything you need to know going in. Or it would if the powers that be hadn't just left the title romanized for whatever reason. The gist of it is that Aharen-san is indecipherable, inscrutable, and just a god damn weirdo. Pretty much every joke or plot development across this episode is built around that single conceit. There's this tiny, impossibly soft-spoken girl in Raido's new high school class, he can never tell what's going on in her head no matter what he tries, hijinks ensue. It's the kind of premise that's so sparse and simple, it can only get by on pitch perfect execution. While this anime isn't quite there yet, it does, at least, hit the right notes more often than not across this episode.    It all comes down to tone and timing here, and while some segments of this episode don't quite coalesce, when they do it strikes a similar tone to Tanaka-kun is Always Listless, where the humor comes from the combination of laidback tone and absurd circumstances. The best is definitely Raido's escalating attempts to overcome Aharen's impossibly quiet voice through any means possible; notes, lip reading, something called “bone conduction”, and culminating in smoke signals and messenger pigeons. It's all very silly, and made funnier by Raido's unshakable stone face, looking deadly serious through every second of it and never so much as raising his voice.    That more than anything is what makes a lot of these gags work – they'd be ruined if Raido were a shouty straightman overreacting to every eccentricity from Aharen, but are made way funnier with how much he just rolls with it all. It works because both character are established to be awkward weirdos trying to force their way out of their shells, so no matter how bizarre their shenanigans get, they both seems to be having fun and genuinely want to be around each other. It doesn't hurt that Aharen's whole gimmick about misjudging personal space means that to all outside observers these two are already dating – going home together, sharing desks and textbooks, Aharen straight up sitting in Raido's lap when they share lunch, all classic romcom stuff that these two have walked blindly into in a very endearing way. It's all cute as the dickens, and while this joke could wear itself out, I'm hopeful that the series can build upon this solid foundation and make for a quiet, endearing little comedy.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

The characters are cute, and their attempts to better themselves and the problems they face are easy to empathize with.    Raido is one of those kids who had their growth spurt early and has a mean “resting bitch face”  that makes him seem unapproachable. On the other side of the equation, we have the titular Aharen who speaks in an exceedingly soft voice and has trouble understanding personal distance. She's either up in people's personal space or so distant it seems like she's ignoring them. Luckily, the two freshman are keenly aware of their issues and want to overcome them through building a friendship with each other.    Watching them do their best, fail, and try again is cute. I mean, it seems to be the entire premise of the show. Some of the best gags in the show involve nothing more than Aharen shoving food in Raido's face or draping herself across him in an odd pose.    But just because it was cute that doesn't mean it can't be boring. The pacing in Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is painfully slow; the jokes just drag on seemingly forever and more than once I almost skipped ahead to the next scene—and I would, if I hadn't needed to write this review. So, all in all, this is one of those anime I want to like far more than I actually do. I won't be coming back for episode 2, but maybe on some lazy Sunday down the line I'll check out the manga where I control the pace of the story simply by how quickly I turn the pages.        James Beckett  Rating:               Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is one of those shows that I went into with literally know background knowledge of what the show was about, and since my Japanese is a little rusty, the very straightforward title didn't clue me in nearly quick enough. However, once our meek protagonist Raido got done catching the audience up on his meek and lonely existence, he starts desperately trying to make friends with his classmate, the titular Aharen, and it didn't take more than a minute or two for me to figure out the show's main gimmick. In the parlance of Seinfeld, the girl is a low-talker.    This is not unfamiliar territory, necessarily. Outside of classic 90s sitcoms, other anime have explored this exact same trope, and very recently, too. Komi Can't Communicate has a nearly identical setup, where a protagonist with no social circle to speak of befriends a girl who is so incapable of basic verbal communication that it is genuinely disturbing how no adult in her life has tried to seek professional medical help for the child. The main difference between Komi and Aharen-san, it would seem, is that instead of relying on incredibly boisterous humor and outstanding production values to get its audience's attention, Aharen-san is content to simply have its characters whittle away time while slowly learning how to understand one another. Very slowly.    I'll be honest: While I wanted to like Aharen-san, this premiere was tough to get through. It's not awful by any means, and some of its visual gags actually made me laugh out loud (I specifically loved any time that Aharen would take one of Raido's communication experiments way too literally and proceed to pelt him with paper notes and/or her own skull). However, in between the one or two scenes that elicited a chuckle out of me, I was agonizingly bored.    I totally get the appeal of watching two socially awkward youngsters learn to overcome their communication issues and all that. It's just difficult to become invested in this coming-of-age when both of the lead characters are literally designed to be unmemorable. I simply got nothing out of Raido's exceedingly underwhelming adventures with Aharen, because Raido is a big old nothingburger of a protagonist, and Aharen feels less like a real human person and more like a marketing guy's vision of a perfectly merchandisable plush doll come to life. A veritable Moe Golem. I can see how Aharen-san wa Hakarenai could easily become a crowd-pleasing favorite amongst its target audience, but I will be happy to leave it off of my Spring watchlist.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Aharen is my personal nightmare – someone with very little concept of personal space. She seems to come by it honestly enough; her voice is so astoundingly quiet that she almost has to get in someone's face in order to be heard. She's also carrying a bit of trauma from her middle school days, when she threw herself so wholeheartedly into friendships that she ended up scaring would-be friends away, and she claims to be afraid to repeat the same mistakes now that she's in high school. But…is she really? Because almost the moment Raido, who sits beside her and wants to remedy his own middle school issues, expresses interest, she's all over him with the boundless enthusiasm for physical closeness of your average pup. Even Raido's not quite sure what to make of it.    I can't quite decide if this is meant to be funny, sweet, or just soothing. Possibly my confusion stems from the fact that I found the episode's pacing glacial and the resulting viewing experience somewhat stultifying. I could easily see how Aharen's intended to be appealingly cute – she's physically tiny and has an endearing devotion to making her friendship with Raido work, even if she's not particularly good at it. Besides climbing up him, she also does things like pass/throw him notes while he's in the bathroom and spend hours carefully studying the angles of a crane game so that she can be sure to win plenty of creepy duck-face plushies for him. That he's also trying to win one for her is very sweet, too, and I could see this turning into a low-stakes romance that slice-of-life fans would find very enjoyable. It's clear that Aharen's heart is in the right place even if she doesn't have the experience to back up her good intentions, and really, since Raido doesn't seem to object to her sitting on his lap or draping herself across him to take a nap, we perhaps shouldn't either.    I admit to finding this dull. It could certainly improve from here as Raido learns more about Aharen, and the probable rival character who comes in at the tail end of this episode could shake the pacing up in a positive way. But with lackluster visuals and a dragging progression, I don't think I have the patience to wait this one out.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This is one of those shows where the title tells you everything you need to know going in. Or it would if the powers that be hadn't just left the title romanized for whatever reason. The gist of it is that Aharen-san is indecipherable, inscrutable, and just a god damn weirdo. Pretty much every joke or plot development across this episode is built around that single conceit. There's this tiny, impossibly soft-spoken girl in Raido's new high school class, he can never tell what's going on in her head no matter what he tries, hijinks ensue. It's the kind of premise that's so sparse and simple, it can only get by on pitch perfect execution. While this anime isn't quite there yet, it does, at least, hit the right notes more often than not across this episode.    It all comes down to tone and timing here, and while some segments of this episode don't quite coalesce, when they do it strikes a similar tone to Tanaka-kun is Always Listless, where the humor comes from the combination of laidback tone and absurd circumstances. The best is definitely Raido's escalating attempts to overcome Aharen's impossibly quiet voice through any means possible; notes, lip reading, something called “bone conduction”, and culminating in smoke signals and messenger pigeons. It's all very silly, and made funnier by Raido's unshakable stone face, looking deadly serious through every second of it and never so much as raising his voice.    That more than anything is what makes a lot of these gags work – they'd be ruined if Raido were a shouty straightman overreacting to every eccentricity from Aharen, but are made way funnier with how much he just rolls with it all. It works because both character are established to be awkward weirdos trying to force their way out of their shells, so no matter how bizarre their shenanigans get, they both seems to be having fun and genuinely want to be around each other. It doesn't hurt that Aharen's whole gimmick about misjudging personal space means that to all outside observers these two are already dating – going home together, sharing desks and textbooks, Aharen straight up sitting in Raido's lap when they share lunch, all classic romcom stuff that these two have walked blindly into in a very endearing way. It's all cute as the dickens, and while this joke could wear itself out, I'm hopeful that the series can build upon this solid foundation and make for a quiet, endearing little comedy.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 3.9              What is this?   Short, quiet Reina Aharen sits next to Raidō in class. Aharen is not so good at gauging the distance between people (or personal boundaries), and Raidō initially sensed some distance between the two of them. Then one day, when Raidō picked up the eraser that Aharen had dropped, the distance between them suddenly became uncomfortably close. From ""way too distant"" to ""way too close,"" Aharen is simply unpredictable.    Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is based on  Asato Mizu's romantic comedy manga series and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Romantic comedies about awkward turtles seem to be all the rage lately. Whether they be shy teens or emotionally immature adults, most anime romcoms come with more than a dash of fumbling and socially-stunted quirkiness. Not that I'm complaining; when I first got together with the man who would become my husband, our friend described our flirtation as “the world's most awkward swans honking at each other in distress from across the lake,” so you can probably guess that I find these kinds of series more relatable than love stories between two functional people. Still, as with any genre trends, there are going to be a whole lot of pale imitators to go alongside the creative and original.    Aharen-san wa Hakarenai lies somewhere in that middle ground. A lot of its tropes and plot devices are similar to other current, popular shows, if not lifted outright, but I found myself not minding at all. The chill mood reminded me of Tanaka-kun is Always Listless, a series I thoroughly enjoyed, even if it isn't necessarily a romance. Or maybe it was, depending on how you interpreted it. You know, these things are really best left up to audience interpretation. But I digress. Romance or not, Aharen-san's gentle comedy of two deadpan teens on similar wavelengths vibing together will either work for you or it won't.    Unlike a lot of gentle comedies, however, Aharen-san has actual jokes. Gags! Japes! And a lot of them are actually really funny! Humorous! They tickled my funny bone! The nice thing about Aharen and Raidou being so soft-spoken is that it means the humor can't lean on the characters CONSTANTLY YELLING and instead has to find other ways to make a joke land. This made me very happy, because I don't find headaches fun and humor-screeching is the fastest way to give me one. Instead, the physical comedy varies from making me smile to making me laugh out loud, because how could I not at the sight of a tiny girl throwing herself into her tall friend's skull like a purple-haired missile, shortly after pelting him with folded-up slips of paper all day?    So even if Aharen-san isn't the best or most original rom-com on the market, it's sweet and it's certainly funny enough to justify its own existence. Maybe it's because I watched it shortly after I got home from a truly exhausting work week that included two nights away from home, but the chill vibes were truly what I needed at the moment. Perhaps they're what you need too.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               There's nothing egregiously wrong with Aharen-san wa Hakarenai and I can see a lot of people liking it.

But with lackluster visuals and a dragging progression, I don't think I have the patience to wait this one out.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This is one of those shows where the title tells you everything you need to know going in. Or it would if the powers that be hadn't just left the title romanized for whatever reason. The gist of it is that Aharen-san is indecipherable, inscrutable, and just a god damn weirdo. Pretty much every joke or plot development across this episode is built around that single conceit. There's this tiny, impossibly soft-spoken girl in Raido's new high school class, he can never tell what's going on in her head no matter what he tries, hijinks ensue. It's the kind of premise that's so sparse and simple, it can only get by on pitch perfect execution. While this anime isn't quite there yet, it does, at least, hit the right notes more often than not across this episode.    It all comes down to tone and timing here, and while some segments of this episode don't quite coalesce, when they do it strikes a similar tone to Tanaka-kun is Always Listless, where the humor comes from the combination of laidback tone and absurd circumstances. The best is definitely Raido's escalating attempts to overcome Aharen's impossibly quiet voice through any means possible; notes, lip reading, something called “bone conduction”, and culminating in smoke signals and messenger pigeons. It's all very silly, and made funnier by Raido's unshakable stone face, looking deadly serious through every second of it and never so much as raising his voice.    That more than anything is what makes a lot of these gags work – they'd be ruined if Raido were a shouty straightman overreacting to every eccentricity from Aharen, but are made way funnier with how much he just rolls with it all. It works because both character are established to be awkward weirdos trying to force their way out of their shells, so no matter how bizarre their shenanigans get, they both seems to be having fun and genuinely want to be around each other. It doesn't hurt that Aharen's whole gimmick about misjudging personal space means that to all outside observers these two are already dating – going home together, sharing desks and textbooks, Aharen straight up sitting in Raido's lap when they share lunch, all classic romcom stuff that these two have walked blindly into in a very endearing way. It's all cute as the dickens, and while this joke could wear itself out, I'm hopeful that the series can build upon this solid foundation and make for a quiet, endearing little comedy.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives    ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 3.9              What is this?   Short, quiet Reina Aharen sits next to Raidō in class. Aharen is not so good at gauging the distance between people (or personal boundaries), and Raidō initially sensed some distance between the two of them. Then one day, when Raidō picked up the eraser that Aharen had dropped, the distance between them suddenly became uncomfortably close. From ""way too distant"" to ""way too close,"" Aharen is simply unpredictable.    Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is based on  Asato Mizu's romantic comedy manga series and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Romantic comedies about awkward turtles seem to be all the rage lately. Whether they be shy teens or emotionally immature adults, most anime romcoms come with more than a dash of fumbling and socially-stunted quirkiness. Not that I'm complaining; when I first got together with the man who would become my husband, our friend described our flirtation as “the world's most awkward swans honking at each other in distress from across the lake,” so you can probably guess that I find these kinds of series more relatable than love stories between two functional people. Still, as with any genre trends, there are going to be a whole lot of pale imitators to go alongside the creative and original.    Aharen-san wa Hakarenai lies somewhere in that middle ground. A lot of its tropes and plot devices are similar to other current, popular shows, if not lifted outright, but I found myself not minding at all. The chill mood reminded me of Tanaka-kun is Always Listless, a series I thoroughly enjoyed, even if it isn't necessarily a romance. Or maybe it was, depending on how you interpreted it. You know, these things are really best left up to audience interpretation. But I digress. Romance or not, Aharen-san's gentle comedy of two deadpan teens on similar wavelengths vibing together will either work for you or it won't.    Unlike a lot of gentle comedies, however, Aharen-san has actual jokes. Gags! Japes! And a lot of them are actually really funny! Humorous! They tickled my funny bone! The nice thing about Aharen and Raidou being so soft-spoken is that it means the humor can't lean on the characters CONSTANTLY YELLING and instead has to find other ways to make a joke land. This made me very happy, because I don't find headaches fun and humor-screeching is the fastest way to give me one. Instead, the physical comedy varies from making me smile to making me laugh out loud, because how could I not at the sight of a tiny girl throwing herself into her tall friend's skull like a purple-haired missile, shortly after pelting him with folded-up slips of paper all day?    So even if Aharen-san isn't the best or most original rom-com on the market, it's sweet and it's certainly funny enough to justify its own existence. Maybe it's because I watched it shortly after I got home from a truly exhausting work week that included two nights away from home, but the chill vibes were truly what I needed at the moment. Perhaps they're what you need too.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               There's nothing egregiously wrong with Aharen-san wa Hakarenai and I can see a lot of people liking it. The characters are cute, and their attempts to better themselves and the problems they face are easy to empathize with.    Raido is one of those kids who had their growth spurt early and has a mean “resting bitch face”  that makes him seem unapproachable. On the other side of the equation, we have the titular Aharen who speaks in an exceedingly soft voice and has trouble understanding personal distance. She's either up in people's personal space or so distant it seems like she's ignoring them. Luckily, the two freshman are keenly aware of their issues and want to overcome them through building a friendship with each other.    Watching them do their best, fail, and try again is cute. I mean, it seems to be the entire premise of the show. Some of the best gags in the show involve nothing more than Aharen shoving food in Raido's face or draping herself across him in an odd pose.    But just because it was cute that doesn't mean it can't be boring. The pacing in Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is painfully slow; the jokes just drag on seemingly forever and more than once I almost skipped ahead to the next scene—and I would, if I hadn't needed to write this review. So, all in all, this is one of those anime I want to like far more than I actually do. I won't be coming back for episode 2, but maybe on some lazy Sunday down the line I'll check out the manga where I control the pace of the story simply by how quickly I turn the pages.        James Beckett  Rating:               Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is one of those shows that I went into with literally know background knowledge of what the show was about, and since my Japanese is a little rusty, the very straightforward title didn't clue me in nearly quick enough. However, once our meek protagonist Raido got done catching the audience up on his meek and lonely existence, he starts desperately trying to make friends with his classmate, the titular Aharen, and it didn't take more than a minute or two for me to figure out the show's main gimmick. In the parlance of Seinfeld, the girl is a low-talker.    This is not unfamiliar territory, necessarily. Outside of classic 90s sitcoms, other anime have explored this exact same trope, and very recently, too. Komi Can't Communicate has a nearly identical setup, where a protagonist with no social circle to speak of befriends a girl who is so incapable of basic verbal communication that it is genuinely disturbing how no adult in her life has tried to seek professional medical help for the child. The main difference between Komi and Aharen-san, it would seem, is that instead of relying on incredibly boisterous humor and outstanding production values to get its audience's attention, Aharen-san is content to simply have its characters whittle away time while slowly learning how to understand one another. Very slowly.    I'll be honest: While I wanted to like Aharen-san, this premiere was tough to get through. It's not awful by any means, and some of its visual gags actually made me laugh out loud (I specifically loved any time that Aharen would take one of Raido's communication experiments way too literally and proceed to pelt him with paper notes and/or her own skull). However, in between the one or two scenes that elicited a chuckle out of me, I was agonizingly bored.    I totally get the appeal of watching two socially awkward youngsters learn to overcome their communication issues and all that. It's just difficult to become invested in this coming-of-age when both of the lead characters are literally designed to be unmemorable. I simply got nothing out of Raido's exceedingly underwhelming adventures with Aharen, because Raido is a big old nothingburger of a protagonist, and Aharen feels less like a real human person and more like a marketing guy's vision of a perfectly merchandisable plush doll come to life. A veritable Moe Golem. I can see how Aharen-san wa Hakarenai could easily become a crowd-pleasing favorite amongst its target audience, but I will be happy to leave it off of my Spring watchlist.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Aharen is my personal nightmare – someone with very little concept of personal space. She seems to come by it honestly enough; her voice is so astoundingly quiet that she almost has to get in someone's face in order to be heard. She's also carrying a bit of trauma from her middle school days, when she threw herself so wholeheartedly into friendships that she ended up scaring would-be friends away, and she claims to be afraid to repeat the same mistakes now that she's in high school. But…is she really? Because almost the moment Raido, who sits beside her and wants to remedy his own middle school issues, expresses interest, she's all over him with the boundless enthusiasm for physical closeness of your average pup. Even Raido's not quite sure what to make of it.    I can't quite decide if this is meant to be funny, sweet, or just soothing. Possibly my confusion stems from the fact that I found the episode's pacing glacial and the resulting viewing experience somewhat stultifying. I could easily see how Aharen's intended to be appealingly cute – she's physically tiny and has an endearing devotion to making her friendship with Raido work, even if she's not particularly good at it. Besides climbing up him, she also does things like pass/throw him notes while he's in the bathroom and spend hours carefully studying the angles of a crane game so that she can be sure to win plenty of creepy duck-face plushies for him. That he's also trying to win one for her is very sweet, too, and I could see this turning into a low-stakes romance that slice-of-life fans would find very enjoyable. It's clear that Aharen's heart is in the right place even if she doesn't have the experience to back up her good intentions, and really, since Raido doesn't seem to object to her sitting on his lap or draping herself across him to take a nap, we perhaps shouldn't either.    I admit to finding this dull. It could certainly improve from here as Raido learns more about Aharen, and the probable rival character who comes in at the tail end of this episode could shake the pacing up in a positive way. But with lackluster visuals and a dragging progression, I don't think I have the patience to wait this one out.

Perhaps they're what you need too.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               There's nothing egregiously wrong with Aharen-san wa Hakarenai and I can see a lot of people liking it. The characters are cute, and their attempts to better themselves and the problems they face are easy to empathize with.    Raido is one of those kids who had their growth spurt early and has a mean “resting bitch face”  that makes him seem unapproachable. On the other side of the equation, we have the titular Aharen who speaks in an exceedingly soft voice and has trouble understanding personal distance. She's either up in people's personal space or so distant it seems like she's ignoring them. Luckily, the two freshman are keenly aware of their issues and want to overcome them through building a friendship with each other.    Watching them do their best, fail, and try again is cute. I mean, it seems to be the entire premise of the show. Some of the best gags in the show involve nothing more than Aharen shoving food in Raido's face or draping herself across him in an odd pose.    But just because it was cute that doesn't mean it can't be boring. The pacing in Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is painfully slow; the jokes just drag on seemingly forever and more than once I almost skipped ahead to the next scene—and I would, if I hadn't needed to write this review. So, all in all, this is one of those anime I want to like far more than I actually do. I won't be coming back for episode 2, but maybe on some lazy Sunday down the line I'll check out the manga where I control the pace of the story simply by how quickly I turn the pages.        James Beckett  Rating:               Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is one of those shows that I went into with literally know background knowledge of what the show was about, and since my Japanese is a little rusty, the very straightforward title didn't clue me in nearly quick enough. However, once our meek protagonist Raido got done catching the audience up on his meek and lonely existence, he starts desperately trying to make friends with his classmate, the titular Aharen, and it didn't take more than a minute or two for me to figure out the show's main gimmick. In the parlance of Seinfeld, the girl is a low-talker.    This is not unfamiliar territory, necessarily. Outside of classic 90s sitcoms, other anime have explored this exact same trope, and very recently, too. Komi Can't Communicate has a nearly identical setup, where a protagonist with no social circle to speak of befriends a girl who is so incapable of basic verbal communication that it is genuinely disturbing how no adult in her life has tried to seek professional medical help for the child. The main difference between Komi and Aharen-san, it would seem, is that instead of relying on incredibly boisterous humor and outstanding production values to get its audience's attention, Aharen-san is content to simply have its characters whittle away time while slowly learning how to understand one another. Very slowly.    I'll be honest: While I wanted to like Aharen-san, this premiere was tough to get through. It's not awful by any means, and some of its visual gags actually made me laugh out loud (I specifically loved any time that Aharen would take one of Raido's communication experiments way too literally and proceed to pelt him with paper notes and/or her own skull). However, in between the one or two scenes that elicited a chuckle out of me, I was agonizingly bored.    I totally get the appeal of watching two socially awkward youngsters learn to overcome their communication issues and all that. It's just difficult to become invested in this coming-of-age when both of the lead characters are literally designed to be unmemorable. I simply got nothing out of Raido's exceedingly underwhelming adventures with Aharen, because Raido is a big old nothingburger of a protagonist, and Aharen feels less like a real human person and more like a marketing guy's vision of a perfectly merchandisable plush doll come to life. A veritable Moe Golem. I can see how Aharen-san wa Hakarenai could easily become a crowd-pleasing favorite amongst its target audience, but I will be happy to leave it off of my Spring watchlist.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Aharen is my personal nightmare – someone with very little concept of personal space. She seems to come by it honestly enough; her voice is so astoundingly quiet that she almost has to get in someone's face in order to be heard. She's also carrying a bit of trauma from her middle school days, when she threw herself so wholeheartedly into friendships that she ended up scaring would-be friends away, and she claims to be afraid to repeat the same mistakes now that she's in high school. But…is she really? Because almost the moment Raido, who sits beside her and wants to remedy his own middle school issues, expresses interest, she's all over him with the boundless enthusiasm for physical closeness of your average pup. Even Raido's not quite sure what to make of it.    I can't quite decide if this is meant to be funny, sweet, or just soothing. Possibly my confusion stems from the fact that I found the episode's pacing glacial and the resulting viewing experience somewhat stultifying. I could easily see how Aharen's intended to be appealingly cute – she's physically tiny and has an endearing devotion to making her friendship with Raido work, even if she's not particularly good at it. Besides climbing up him, she also does things like pass/throw him notes while he's in the bathroom and spend hours carefully studying the angles of a crane game so that she can be sure to win plenty of creepy duck-face plushies for him. That he's also trying to win one for her is very sweet, too, and I could see this turning into a low-stakes romance that slice-of-life fans would find very enjoyable. It's clear that Aharen's heart is in the right place even if she doesn't have the experience to back up her good intentions, and really, since Raido doesn't seem to object to her sitting on his lap or draping herself across him to take a nap, we perhaps shouldn't either.    I admit to finding this dull. It could certainly improve from here as Raido learns more about Aharen, and the probable rival character who comes in at the tail end of this episode could shake the pacing up in a positive way. But with lackluster visuals and a dragging progression, I don't think I have the patience to wait this one out.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This is one of those shows where the title tells you everything you need to know going in. Or it would if the powers that be hadn't just left the title romanized for whatever reason. The gist of it is that Aharen-san is indecipherable, inscrutable, and just a god damn weirdo. Pretty much every joke or plot development across this episode is built around that single conceit. There's this tiny, impossibly soft-spoken girl in Raido's new high school class, he can never tell what's going on in her head no matter what he tries, hijinks ensue. It's the kind of premise that's so sparse and simple, it can only get by on pitch perfect execution. While this anime isn't quite there yet, it does, at least, hit the right notes more often than not across this episode.    It all comes down to tone and timing here, and while some segments of this episode don't quite coalesce, when they do it strikes a similar tone to Tanaka-kun is Always Listless, where the humor comes from the combination of laidback tone and absurd circumstances. The best is definitely Raido's escalating attempts to overcome Aharen's impossibly quiet voice through any means possible; notes, lip reading, something called “bone conduction”, and culminating in smoke signals and messenger pigeons. It's all very silly, and made funnier by Raido's unshakable stone face, looking deadly serious through every second of it and never so much as raising his voice.    That more than anything is what makes a lot of these gags work – they'd be ruined if Raido were a shouty straightman overreacting to every eccentricity from Aharen, but are made way funnier with how much he just rolls with it all. It works because both character are established to be awkward weirdos trying to force their way out of their shells, so no matter how bizarre their shenanigans get, they both seems to be having fun and genuinely want to be around each other. It doesn't hurt that Aharen's whole gimmick about misjudging personal space means that to all outside observers these two are already dating – going home together, sharing desks and textbooks, Aharen straight up sitting in Raido's lap when they share lunch, all classic romcom stuff that these two have walked blindly into in a very endearing way. It's all cute as the dickens, and while this joke could wear itself out, I'm hopeful that the series can build upon this solid foundation and make for a quiet, endearing little comedy.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide I'm Quitting Heroing   Apr  6th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of I'm Quitting Heroing ?                     Community score: 3.7              What is this?   Leo is a hero who once saved the world from a demon army's invasion. However, he was feared and ostracized by people afterward, and ended up with no job. Feeling that his skills would be better appreciated elsewhere, he joins the demon lord's army that he once fought. Now in a new work environment, Leo strives to use his skills and revive the demon army that is on the brink of collapse.    I'm Quitting Heroing is based on Quantum and Hana Amano's fantasy light novel series and streams on HIDIVE on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                You know, I have to give I'm Quitting Heroing some credit. It's not a premise I've encountered before, which can be very valuable when it feels like half the series that come out each season are variations on the same three themes. It also gets off to a strong start, with Leo marching himself into the Demon Lord's castle and proudly presenting his resume. His blunt, arrogant, and somewhat abrasive personality kind of sucks and he knows it, but he's also confident that his skills more than make up for his social deficiencies.    With the first few minutes dedicated to some solid physical comedy and character-based gags, I was ready to lean in and accept that hey, maybe this isn't the anime for me, but it's still pretty fun. The character designs are attractive and varied without being totally hackneyed; plus, one of them has very similar energy to Iskander from Fate/Zero, and I kind of love that. By the time Leo was meeting with the Four Generals in the boardroom, I had settled in for a good, solid 3.5 star premiere. Not my thing necessarily, but a solid recommendation for people who read the summary and think it sounds like something they'd enjoy.    But then the flashbacks start. Leo talks about how he defeated each of the Four Generals while black and white depictions of what he's describing play on screen. It's half showing, half telling, all redundancy, and it really sucks all the oxygen out of the room. It's too abbreviated for any kind of decent action, but there aren't really any jokes there either. It gives us a little information about each character, but mostly shows off what kind of archetype they are, along with reiterating that Leo is really, really strong. My eyes started to glaze over but hey, at least it handled Lily's crush on Leo without being really creepy about it.    And then! And then! It slides straight into melodrama as Leo tells the Four Generals how he ended up deciding to join them in yet another gray-tinged flashback and by now I am checked out. We've gone straight from “fun romp” to “whiny slog” in the space of less than an episode, and I need someone to go out and buy me a neck brace because I am seriously suffering from tonal whiplash. It's a real galaxy-brained choice to make the first episode almost entirely backstory, and I don't mean that in the good way. It stops the story in its tracks before it can even get going. It has the stink of an overly-faithful adaptation of an under-edited light novel to it, and I'm not holding my nose for it.        James Beckett  Rating:               Watching a premiere like the one we get with I'm Quitting Heroing is like eating a Hot Pocket for dinner. You know that it isn't going to be very healthy, or filling, or even very tasty. As you spend two-to-three minutes watching the little meat-and-cheese pastry spin around on the microwave plate, secure in its patented “crispy sleeve” or whatever the hell it's called,  you will have plenty of time to ask yourself the important questions: “Is this really what I'm going to settle for?” “Surely, there must have been something better to choose from than this?” “How many years is eating this mass-produced and possibly irradiated junk food going to take off my life, anyways?” Then you eat the thing, and it's…fine. It's technically food. It contains plenty of sugars and empty calories to keep your body functioning for a few hours more. It could have been worse, probably. It could have been a Lean Pocket.    Anyways, you all know the drill with these overlong food metaphors: They indicate that the subject being reviewed is too bland and featureless to inspire much thought-provoking criticism, so the writer in question had to reach just to find an interesting way of saying that they were mildly but not offensively bored by the whole experience. Also, I'm very hungry as I'm writing this.    I didn't hate I'm Quitting Heroing. It's just that, as a generic workplace comedy twist on even more generic anime fantasy tropes, there is literally nothing about the cast or the story that we haven't seen done ten thousand times before already. The main character is named “Leo Demonheart” for crying out loud. He and all of the Demon Queen's generals look and sound like they were yanked right out of the Default Templates folder you'd find on a vanilla install of RPG Maker.    A couple of the jokes in this episode made me laugh, and at no point did the main guy behave in a way that was creepy or irritating. The episode didn't feel any longer than its 23-minute runtime (though it didn't exactly breeze by, either). So, while I didn't like anything about I'm Quitting Heroing, I didn't actively hate my time with it either. It just sort of exists, designed to be consumed and immediately forgotten, like so many of the cheap frozen dinners that have come and gone throughout the college dorms of the world.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               The premise of this series boils down to a single question: “What happens to the hero after they win?” You may want the legendary hero around when there's an army of invading demons led by an all-powerful Demon Lord, but the moment the hero is triumphant, the whole situation changes. Now you have someone powerful enough to take down the ultimate evil—without the evil part of the equation. This begets fear in the general population which then turns to anger. Soon they will want him gone—if not dead then at least out of sight and out of mind.    This is doubly true in the case of Leo who is a hero so overpowered, he single-handedly took out not only the Demon Lord's army but the Demon Lord and her four generals as well. So what does he do when he is abandoned by all those he worked to save? He sets off to join the remnants of the Demon Lord's army. After all, they will surely accept him since they've seen how effective he is—won't they?    It's a solid premise with a lot of potential for both comedy and drama. But in setting it up, this whole episode becomes little more than a giant backstory dump. We meet the Demon Lord (however briefly) and get introduced to the four generals. Each of the four are walking fantasy stereotypes but this is played for comedy by showing how easily Leo beat them by exploiting their obvious weaknesses. Normally that alone is not enough to carry the episode, but thankfully Leo himself is able to pick up the slack.    Leo is a deeply flawed person. He has ungodly amounts of power and an ego to match. Because of this, he just expects things to work out in his favor and seems more than a little confused when they don't (though he rebounds quickly). But what makes Leo interesting is the simple fact that he doesn't seem to care about anything. He doesn't care about his fellow humans or the things they hold dear. He likewise doesn't care about the demons and all the pain and suffering he has personally put them through.    He doesn't even really seem to care about himself. Even when he is exiled, he doesn't get angry or go on a killing spree like the people fear, he just kind of becomes aimless. It's not like he forgives the people for casting him aside but it seems to roll off of him like something that can't be helped. This is equal parts intriguing and unsettling. Behind the jokes, we have this mystery of a broken man and what made him become this way. And for me, that's enough to give it another watch next week.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Even if you don't admire Leo's chutzpah for waltzing into the castle of the very demon lord he just defeated and asking for a job, you have to give him credit for realizing that he was fighting on the wrong side before. This wouldn't be the first title to posit that humans are the real monsters, and while it isn't necessarily going to be expanded upon here, that line of reasoning is very much open in this first episode. That Leo, after realizing that he wasn't doing great work with a party, took it upon himself to fight Echidna the Demon Queen and her four generals, only to be completely rejected by the very humans he was fighting for after defeating them, is a good demonstration of what's wrong with the story's world. In another show, I might say that it was an indication of what's wrong with the basic narrative of good versus evil, but I honestly don't think that's what this series is going for.    What it does appear to be working towards is a simple role reversal: Leo wasn't respected as a hero, so he's going to try his luck as a villain. He knows the road will be a tricky one, seeing as how he was the instrument of the demons' defeat, but he's also tired, emotionally wounded, and really, really sick of living in a cave since he was banished from the very kingdom he saved. I wouldn't blame him if he had a serious grudge; that he doesn't appear to seems to indicate that this is going to be more of a lighthearted piece – or at least as lighthearted as it can be when there's war involved. Not that anyone seems all that keen on attacking the humans again, Leo included. In part that may be due to the drubbing the demons took, but it's just as likely to be because absolutely nobody involved has any taste for logistics. Since Leo came equipped with handouts, graphs, and a resumé, I think we can assume that planning and other logistical tasks are in his wheelhouse.    Despite all of this relatively interesting information and a decent premise, the episode is kind of dull. Most of it is Leo explaining things, both to his prospective employers and to us in the audience, and while there's some animation, it's not very exciting. Lily's constantly wagging tail is cute, and the scene where Leo returns to town after defeating Echidna has the right uncomfortable balance, but if you don't love exposition, this may be a real slog. It has potential in Leo using his skills to turn things around for the people he previously defeated, but I could see the drag of this episode turning people off.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Just off the bat, I hate this title. Sure, it's succinct enough and doesn't have an overlong subtitle, but “Heroing” is such a clunky word that just never looks right when I read it. The show itself is perfectly alright so far – maybe a little too muddled on whether it wants to take its premise seriously or treat it entirely as a farce – but overall this premiere isn't a bad sit. But that title? Terrible. Awful. My phone keeps auto-correcting it to “I'm Quitting Heroin” and I don't need that kind of mistake in my work e-mails. As protest I'm going to call this one I Quit for the rest of time.    Anyway, the actual premise of I Quit is a solid enough one, though I can't shake the feeling of having seen so many parts of it done better in other shows. I'm also just really tired of over-powered heroes wallowing in how being a LVL 99 Übermensch isn't as fun as they always thought it would be. So Leo himself is kind of a bore throughout this premiere whenever he's supposed to be taken seriously. Thankfully he's a lot more charming when he's played as an obtuse jerk who can't stop talking about how he's so much stronger than the demon army he's trying to get a job at. He's a jerk, sure, but his casual ego gives him some personality and lets him bounce off the other characters in this episode in a way that's funny more often than not.    Though there aren't really any laugh-out-loud moments in this episode, mostly because a lot of it is used for building up the same joke four or five times in a row. Yep, Leo sure is way stronger than everyone else and he totally punked out the demon generals! We definitely needed to see that gag run through the wash multiple times across the episode. Doesn't help that while some of the Generals at least sass him back, a couple of them just roll with Leo's obnoxious personality. Jokes like this one need some real friction to be funny, and that's in short supply across too much of this premiere. I'm especially not a fan of the underage beast-girl who's declared she wants to marry him. The show hasn't yet used her for obvious fanservice, but the prospect of seeing more of that is a pretty good motivator to not watch another episode.    And it didn't really need more help in that endeavor. While there's nothing particularly bad about this premiere, it also just doesn't do much that's interesting or compelling. Maybe it's the generic art style and character designs, maybe it's just the show splitting itself too much between a wacky comedy and a serious story of a banished hero joining the “dark side” –  either way, not being bad or objectionable isn't the same as being good, and I can't give much enthusiasm for a show that leaves such little impression.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review                Odd Taxi: In the Woods   Apr 17, 00:00                 anime    By cleverly reframing its narrative around a series of interviews with the supporting cast, Odd Taxi: In the Woods succeeds where most recap films fail: it's an artistically cohesive film in its own right. ― Odd Taxi was 2021's sleeper anime hit, telling an intricate, original mystery that kept viewers guessing every week.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide I'm Quitting Heroing   Apr  6th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of I'm Quitting Heroing ?                     Community score: 3.7              What is this?   Leo is a hero who once saved the world from a demon army's invasion. However, he was feared and ostracized by people afterward, and ended up with no job. Feeling that his skills would be better appreciated elsewhere, he joins the demon lord's army that he once fought. Now in a new work environment, Leo strives to use his skills and revive the demon army that is on the brink of collapse.    I'm Quitting Heroing is based on Quantum and Hana Amano's fantasy light novel series and streams on HIDIVE on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                You know, I have to give I'm Quitting Heroing some credit. It's not a premise I've encountered before, which can be very valuable when it feels like half the series that come out each season are variations on the same three themes. It also gets off to a strong start, with Leo marching himself into the Demon Lord's castle and proudly presenting his resume. His blunt, arrogant, and somewhat abrasive personality kind of sucks and he knows it, but he's also confident that his skills more than make up for his social deficiencies.    With the first few minutes dedicated to some solid physical comedy and character-based gags, I was ready to lean in and accept that hey, maybe this isn't the anime for me, but it's still pretty fun. The character designs are attractive and varied without being totally hackneyed; plus, one of them has very similar energy to Iskander from Fate/Zero, and I kind of love that. By the time Leo was meeting with the Four Generals in the boardroom, I had settled in for a good, solid 3.5 star premiere. Not my thing necessarily, but a solid recommendation for people who read the summary and think it sounds like something they'd enjoy.    But then the flashbacks start. Leo talks about how he defeated each of the Four Generals while black and white depictions of what he's describing play on screen. It's half showing, half telling, all redundancy, and it really sucks all the oxygen out of the room. It's too abbreviated for any kind of decent action, but there aren't really any jokes there either. It gives us a little information about each character, but mostly shows off what kind of archetype they are, along with reiterating that Leo is really, really strong. My eyes started to glaze over but hey, at least it handled Lily's crush on Leo without being really creepy about it.    And then! And then! It slides straight into melodrama as Leo tells the Four Generals how he ended up deciding to join them in yet another gray-tinged flashback and by now I am checked out. We've gone straight from “fun romp” to “whiny slog” in the space of less than an episode, and I need someone to go out and buy me a neck brace because I am seriously suffering from tonal whiplash. It's a real galaxy-brained choice to make the first episode almost entirely backstory, and I don't mean that in the good way. It stops the story in its tracks before it can even get going. It has the stink of an overly-faithful adaptation of an under-edited light novel to it, and I'm not holding my nose for it.        James Beckett  Rating:               Watching a premiere like the one we get with I'm Quitting Heroing is like eating a Hot Pocket for dinner. You know that it isn't going to be very healthy, or filling, or even very tasty. As you spend two-to-three minutes watching the little meat-and-cheese pastry spin around on the microwave plate, secure in its patented “crispy sleeve” or whatever the hell it's called,  you will have plenty of time to ask yourself the important questions: “Is this really what I'm going to settle for?” “Surely, there must have been something better to choose from than this?” “How many years is eating this mass-produced and possibly irradiated junk food going to take off my life, anyways?” Then you eat the thing, and it's…fine. It's technically food. It contains plenty of sugars and empty calories to keep your body functioning for a few hours more. It could have been worse, probably. It could have been a Lean Pocket.    Anyways, you all know the drill with these overlong food metaphors: They indicate that the subject being reviewed is too bland and featureless to inspire much thought-provoking criticism, so the writer in question had to reach just to find an interesting way of saying that they were mildly but not offensively bored by the whole experience. Also, I'm very hungry as I'm writing this.    I didn't hate I'm Quitting Heroing. It's just that, as a generic workplace comedy twist on even more generic anime fantasy tropes, there is literally nothing about the cast or the story that we haven't seen done ten thousand times before already. The main character is named “Leo Demonheart” for crying out loud. He and all of the Demon Queen's generals look and sound like they were yanked right out of the Default Templates folder you'd find on a vanilla install of RPG Maker.    A couple of the jokes in this episode made me laugh, and at no point did the main guy behave in a way that was creepy or irritating. The episode didn't feel any longer than its 23-minute runtime (though it didn't exactly breeze by, either). So, while I didn't like anything about I'm Quitting Heroing, I didn't actively hate my time with it either. It just sort of exists, designed to be consumed and immediately forgotten, like so many of the cheap frozen dinners that have come and gone throughout the college dorms of the world.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               The premise of this series boils down to a single question: “What happens to the hero after they win?” You may want the legendary hero around when there's an army of invading demons led by an all-powerful Demon Lord, but the moment the hero is triumphant, the whole situation changes. Now you have someone powerful enough to take down the ultimate evil—without the evil part of the equation. This begets fear in the general population which then turns to anger. Soon they will want him gone—if not dead then at least out of sight and out of mind.    This is doubly true in the case of Leo who is a hero so overpowered, he single-handedly took out not only the Demon Lord's army but the Demon Lord and her four generals as well. So what does he do when he is abandoned by all those he worked to save? He sets off to join the remnants of the Demon Lord's army. After all, they will surely accept him since they've seen how effective he is—won't they?    It's a solid premise with a lot of potential for both comedy and drama. But in setting it up, this whole episode becomes little more than a giant backstory dump. We meet the Demon Lord (however briefly) and get introduced to the four generals. Each of the four are walking fantasy stereotypes but this is played for comedy by showing how easily Leo beat them by exploiting their obvious weaknesses. Normally that alone is not enough to carry the episode, but thankfully Leo himself is able to pick up the slack.    Leo is a deeply flawed person. He has ungodly amounts of power and an ego to match. Because of this, he just expects things to work out in his favor and seems more than a little confused when they don't (though he rebounds quickly). But what makes Leo interesting is the simple fact that he doesn't seem to care about anything. He doesn't care about his fellow humans or the things they hold dear. He likewise doesn't care about the demons and all the pain and suffering he has personally put them through.    He doesn't even really seem to care about himself. Even when he is exiled, he doesn't get angry or go on a killing spree like the people fear, he just kind of becomes aimless. It's not like he forgives the people for casting him aside but it seems to roll off of him like something that can't be helped. This is equal parts intriguing and unsettling. Behind the jokes, we have this mystery of a broken man and what made him become this way. And for me, that's enough to give it another watch next week.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Even if you don't admire Leo's chutzpah for waltzing into the castle of the very demon lord he just defeated and asking for a job, you have to give him credit for realizing that he was fighting on the wrong side before. This wouldn't be the first title to posit that humans are the real monsters, and while it isn't necessarily going to be expanded upon here, that line of reasoning is very much open in this first episode. That Leo, after realizing that he wasn't doing great work with a party, took it upon himself to fight Echidna the Demon Queen and her four generals, only to be completely rejected by the very humans he was fighting for after defeating them, is a good demonstration of what's wrong with the story's world. In another show, I might say that it was an indication of what's wrong with the basic narrative of good versus evil, but I honestly don't think that's what this series is going for.    What it does appear to be working towards is a simple role reversal: Leo wasn't respected as a hero, so he's going to try his luck as a villain. He knows the road will be a tricky one, seeing as how he was the instrument of the demons' defeat, but he's also tired, emotionally wounded, and really, really sick of living in a cave since he was banished from the very kingdom he saved. I wouldn't blame him if he had a serious grudge; that he doesn't appear to seems to indicate that this is going to be more of a lighthearted piece – or at least as lighthearted as it can be when there's war involved. Not that anyone seems all that keen on attacking the humans again, Leo included. In part that may be due to the drubbing the demons took, but it's just as likely to be because absolutely nobody involved has any taste for logistics. Since Leo came equipped with handouts, graphs, and a resumé, I think we can assume that planning and other logistical tasks are in his wheelhouse.    Despite all of this relatively interesting information and a decent premise, the episode is kind of dull. Most of it is Leo explaining things, both to his prospective employers and to us in the audience, and while there's some animation, it's not very exciting. Lily's constantly wagging tail is cute, and the scene where Leo returns to town after defeating Echidna has the right uncomfortable balance, but if you don't love exposition, this may be a real slog. It has potential in Leo using his skills to turn things around for the people he previously defeated, but I could see the drag of this episode turning people off.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Just off the bat, I hate this title. Sure, it's succinct enough and doesn't have an overlong subtitle, but “Heroing” is such a clunky word that just never looks right when I read it. The show itself is perfectly alright so far – maybe a little too muddled on whether it wants to take its premise seriously or treat it entirely as a farce – but overall this premiere isn't a bad sit. But that title? Terrible. Awful. My phone keeps auto-correcting it to “I'm Quitting Heroin” and I don't need that kind of mistake in my work e-mails. As protest I'm going to call this one I Quit for the rest of time.    Anyway, the actual premise of I Quit is a solid enough one, though I can't shake the feeling of having seen so many parts of it done better in other shows. I'm also just really tired of over-powered heroes wallowing in how being a LVL 99 Übermensch isn't as fun as they always thought it would be. So Leo himself is kind of a bore throughout this premiere whenever he's supposed to be taken seriously. Thankfully he's a lot more charming when he's played as an obtuse jerk who can't stop talking about how he's so much stronger than the demon army he's trying to get a job at. He's a jerk, sure, but his casual ego gives him some personality and lets him bounce off the other characters in this episode in a way that's funny more often than not.    Though there aren't really any laugh-out-loud moments in this episode, mostly because a lot of it is used for building up the same joke four or five times in a row. Yep, Leo sure is way stronger than everyone else and he totally punked out the demon generals! We definitely needed to see that gag run through the wash multiple times across the episode. Doesn't help that while some of the Generals at least sass him back, a couple of them just roll with Leo's obnoxious personality. Jokes like this one need some real friction to be funny, and that's in short supply across too much of this premiere. I'm especially not a fan of the underage beast-girl who's declared she wants to marry him. The show hasn't yet used her for obvious fanservice, but the prospect of seeing more of that is a pretty good motivator to not watch another episode.    And it didn't really need more help in that endeavor. While there's nothing particularly bad about this premiere, it also just doesn't do much that's interesting or compelling. Maybe it's the generic art style and character designs, maybe it's just the show splitting itself too much between a wacky comedy and a serious story of a banished hero joining the “dark side” –  either way, not being bad or objectionable isn't the same as being good, and I can't give much enthusiasm for a show that leaves such little impression.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review                Odd Taxi: In the Woods   Apr 17, 00:00                 anime    By cleverly reframing its narrative around a series of interviews with the supporting cast, Odd Taxi: In the Woods succeeds where most recap films fail: it's an artistically cohesive film in its own right. ― Odd Taxi was 2021's sleeper anime hit, telling an intricate, original mystery that kept viewers guessing every week.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide I'm Quitting Heroing   Apr  6th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of I'm Quitting Heroing ?                     Community score: 3.7              What is this?   Leo is a hero who once saved the world from a demon army's invasion. However, he was feared and ostracized by people afterward, and ended up with no job. Feeling that his skills would be better appreciated elsewhere, he joins the demon lord's army that he once fought. Now in a new work environment, Leo strives to use his skills and revive the demon army that is on the brink of collapse.    I'm Quitting Heroing is based on Quantum and Hana Amano's fantasy light novel series and streams on HIDIVE on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                You know, I have to give I'm Quitting Heroing some credit. It's not a premise I've encountered before, which can be very valuable when it feels like half the series that come out each season are variations on the same three themes. It also gets off to a strong start, with Leo marching himself into the Demon Lord's castle and proudly presenting his resume. His blunt, arrogant, and somewhat abrasive personality kind of sucks and he knows it, but he's also confident that his skills more than make up for his social deficiencies.    With the first few minutes dedicated to some solid physical comedy and character-based gags, I was ready to lean in and accept that hey, maybe this isn't the anime for me, but it's still pretty fun. The character designs are attractive and varied without being totally hackneyed; plus, one of them has very similar energy to Iskander from Fate/Zero, and I kind of love that. By the time Leo was meeting with the Four Generals in the boardroom, I had settled in for a good, solid 3.5 star premiere. Not my thing necessarily, but a solid recommendation for people who read the summary and think it sounds like something they'd enjoy.    But then the flashbacks start. Leo talks about how he defeated each of the Four Generals while black and white depictions of what he's describing play on screen. It's half showing, half telling, all redundancy, and it really sucks all the oxygen out of the room. It's too abbreviated for any kind of decent action, but there aren't really any jokes there either. It gives us a little information about each character, but mostly shows off what kind of archetype they are, along with reiterating that Leo is really, really strong. My eyes started to glaze over but hey, at least it handled Lily's crush on Leo without being really creepy about it.    And then! And then! It slides straight into melodrama as Leo tells the Four Generals how he ended up deciding to join them in yet another gray-tinged flashback and by now I am checked out. We've gone straight from “fun romp” to “whiny slog” in the space of less than an episode, and I need someone to go out and buy me a neck brace because I am seriously suffering from tonal whiplash. It's a real galaxy-brained choice to make the first episode almost entirely backstory, and I don't mean that in the good way. It stops the story in its tracks before it can even get going. It has the stink of an overly-faithful adaptation of an under-edited light novel to it, and I'm not holding my nose for it.        James Beckett  Rating:               Watching a premiere like the one we get with I'm Quitting Heroing is like eating a Hot Pocket for dinner. You know that it isn't going to be very healthy, or filling, or even very tasty. As you spend two-to-three minutes watching the little meat-and-cheese pastry spin around on the microwave plate, secure in its patented “crispy sleeve” or whatever the hell it's called,  you will have plenty of time to ask yourself the important questions: “Is this really what I'm going to settle for?” “Surely, there must have been something better to choose from than this?” “How many years is eating this mass-produced and possibly irradiated junk food going to take off my life, anyways?” Then you eat the thing, and it's…fine. It's technically food. It contains plenty of sugars and empty calories to keep your body functioning for a few hours more. It could have been worse, probably. It could have been a Lean Pocket.    Anyways, you all know the drill with these overlong food metaphors: They indicate that the subject being reviewed is too bland and featureless to inspire much thought-provoking criticism, so the writer in question had to reach just to find an interesting way of saying that they were mildly but not offensively bored by the whole experience. Also, I'm very hungry as I'm writing this.    I didn't hate I'm Quitting Heroing. It's just that, as a generic workplace comedy twist on even more generic anime fantasy tropes, there is literally nothing about the cast or the story that we haven't seen done ten thousand times before already. The main character is named “Leo Demonheart” for crying out loud. He and all of the Demon Queen's generals look and sound like they were yanked right out of the Default Templates folder you'd find on a vanilla install of RPG Maker.    A couple of the jokes in this episode made me laugh, and at no point did the main guy behave in a way that was creepy or irritating. The episode didn't feel any longer than its 23-minute runtime (though it didn't exactly breeze by, either). So, while I didn't like anything about I'm Quitting Heroing, I didn't actively hate my time with it either. It just sort of exists, designed to be consumed and immediately forgotten, like so many of the cheap frozen dinners that have come and gone throughout the college dorms of the world.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               The premise of this series boils down to a single question: “What happens to the hero after they win?” You may want the legendary hero around when there's an army of invading demons led by an all-powerful Demon Lord, but the moment the hero is triumphant, the whole situation changes. Now you have someone powerful enough to take down the ultimate evil—without the evil part of the equation. This begets fear in the general population which then turns to anger. Soon they will want him gone—if not dead then at least out of sight and out of mind.    This is doubly true in the case of Leo who is a hero so overpowered, he single-handedly took out not only the Demon Lord's army but the Demon Lord and her four generals as well. So what does he do when he is abandoned by all those he worked to save? He sets off to join the remnants of the Demon Lord's army. After all, they will surely accept him since they've seen how effective he is—won't they?    It's a solid premise with a lot of potential for both comedy and drama. But in setting it up, this whole episode becomes little more than a giant backstory dump. We meet the Demon Lord (however briefly) and get introduced to the four generals. Each of the four are walking fantasy stereotypes but this is played for comedy by showing how easily Leo beat them by exploiting their obvious weaknesses. Normally that alone is not enough to carry the episode, but thankfully Leo himself is able to pick up the slack.    Leo is a deeply flawed person. He has ungodly amounts of power and an ego to match. Because of this, he just expects things to work out in his favor and seems more than a little confused when they don't (though he rebounds quickly). But what makes Leo interesting is the simple fact that he doesn't seem to care about anything. He doesn't care about his fellow humans or the things they hold dear. He likewise doesn't care about the demons and all the pain and suffering he has personally put them through.    He doesn't even really seem to care about himself. Even when he is exiled, he doesn't get angry or go on a killing spree like the people fear, he just kind of becomes aimless. It's not like he forgives the people for casting him aside but it seems to roll off of him like something that can't be helped. This is equal parts intriguing and unsettling. Behind the jokes, we have this mystery of a broken man and what made him become this way. And for me, that's enough to give it another watch next week.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Even if you don't admire Leo's chutzpah for waltzing into the castle of the very demon lord he just defeated and asking for a job, you have to give him credit for realizing that he was fighting on the wrong side before. This wouldn't be the first title to posit that humans are the real monsters, and while it isn't necessarily going to be expanded upon here, that line of reasoning is very much open in this first episode. That Leo, after realizing that he wasn't doing great work with a party, took it upon himself to fight Echidna the Demon Queen and her four generals, only to be completely rejected by the very humans he was fighting for after defeating them, is a good demonstration of what's wrong with the story's world. In another show, I might say that it was an indication of what's wrong with the basic narrative of good versus evil, but I honestly don't think that's what this series is going for.    What it does appear to be working towards is a simple role reversal: Leo wasn't respected as a hero, so he's going to try his luck as a villain. He knows the road will be a tricky one, seeing as how he was the instrument of the demons' defeat, but he's also tired, emotionally wounded, and really, really sick of living in a cave since he was banished from the very kingdom he saved. I wouldn't blame him if he had a serious grudge; that he doesn't appear to seems to indicate that this is going to be more of a lighthearted piece – or at least as lighthearted as it can be when there's war involved. Not that anyone seems all that keen on attacking the humans again, Leo included. In part that may be due to the drubbing the demons took, but it's just as likely to be because absolutely nobody involved has any taste for logistics. Since Leo came equipped with handouts, graphs, and a resumé, I think we can assume that planning and other logistical tasks are in his wheelhouse.    Despite all of this relatively interesting information and a decent premise, the episode is kind of dull. Most of it is Leo explaining things, both to his prospective employers and to us in the audience, and while there's some animation, it's not very exciting. Lily's constantly wagging tail is cute, and the scene where Leo returns to town after defeating Echidna has the right uncomfortable balance, but if you don't love exposition, this may be a real slog. It has potential in Leo using his skills to turn things around for the people he previously defeated, but I could see the drag of this episode turning people off.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Just off the bat, I hate this title. Sure, it's succinct enough and doesn't have an overlong subtitle, but “Heroing” is such a clunky word that just never looks right when I read it. The show itself is perfectly alright so far – maybe a little too muddled on whether it wants to take its premise seriously or treat it entirely as a farce – but overall this premiere isn't a bad sit. But that title? Terrible. Awful. My phone keeps auto-correcting it to “I'm Quitting Heroin” and I don't need that kind of mistake in my work e-mails. As protest I'm going to call this one I Quit for the rest of time.    Anyway, the actual premise of I Quit is a solid enough one, though I can't shake the feeling of having seen so many parts of it done better in other shows. I'm also just really tired of over-powered heroes wallowing in how being a LVL 99 Übermensch isn't as fun as they always thought it would be. So Leo himself is kind of a bore throughout this premiere whenever he's supposed to be taken seriously. Thankfully he's a lot more charming when he's played as an obtuse jerk who can't stop talking about how he's so much stronger than the demon army he's trying to get a job at. He's a jerk, sure, but his casual ego gives him some personality and lets him bounce off the other characters in this episode in a way that's funny more often than not.    Though there aren't really any laugh-out-loud moments in this episode, mostly because a lot of it is used for building up the same joke four or five times in a row. Yep, Leo sure is way stronger than everyone else and he totally punked out the demon generals! We definitely needed to see that gag run through the wash multiple times across the episode. Doesn't help that while some of the Generals at least sass him back, a couple of them just roll with Leo's obnoxious personality. Jokes like this one need some real friction to be funny, and that's in short supply across too much of this premiere. I'm especially not a fan of the underage beast-girl who's declared she wants to marry him. The show hasn't yet used her for obvious fanservice, but the prospect of seeing more of that is a pretty good motivator to not watch another episode.    And it didn't really need more help in that endeavor. While there's nothing particularly bad about this premiere, it also just doesn't do much that's interesting or compelling. Maybe it's the generic art style and character designs, maybe it's just the show splitting itself too much between a wacky comedy and a serious story of a banished hero joining the “dark side” –  either way, not being bad or objectionable isn't the same as being good, and I can't give much enthusiasm for a show that leaves such little impression.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review                Odd Taxi: In the Woods   Apr 17, 00:00                 anime    By cleverly reframing its narrative around a series of interviews with the supporting cast, Odd Taxi: In the Woods succeeds where most recap films fail: it's an artistically cohesive film in its own right. ― Odd Taxi was 2021's sleeper anime hit, telling an intricate, original mystery that kept viewers guessing every week.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide I'm Quitting Heroing   Apr  6th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of I'm Quitting Heroing ?                     Community score: 3.7              What is this?   Leo is a hero who once saved the world from a demon army's invasion. However, he was feared and ostracized by people afterward, and ended up with no job. Feeling that his skills would be better appreciated elsewhere, he joins the demon lord's army that he once fought. Now in a new work environment, Leo strives to use his skills and revive the demon army that is on the brink of collapse.    I'm Quitting Heroing is based on Quantum and Hana Amano's fantasy light novel series and streams on HIDIVE on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                You know, I have to give I'm Quitting Heroing some credit. It's not a premise I've encountered before, which can be very valuable when it feels like half the series that come out each season are variations on the same three themes. It also gets off to a strong start, with Leo marching himself into the Demon Lord's castle and proudly presenting his resume. His blunt, arrogant, and somewhat abrasive personality kind of sucks and he knows it, but he's also confident that his skills more than make up for his social deficiencies.    With the first few minutes dedicated to some solid physical comedy and character-based gags, I was ready to lean in and accept that hey, maybe this isn't the anime for me, but it's still pretty fun. The character designs are attractive and varied without being totally hackneyed; plus, one of them has very similar energy to Iskander from Fate/Zero, and I kind of love that. By the time Leo was meeting with the Four Generals in the boardroom, I had settled in for a good, solid 3.5 star premiere. Not my thing necessarily, but a solid recommendation for people who read the summary and think it sounds like something they'd enjoy.    But then the flashbacks start. Leo talks about how he defeated each of the Four Generals while black and white depictions of what he's describing play on screen. It's half showing, half telling, all redundancy, and it really sucks all the oxygen out of the room. It's too abbreviated for any kind of decent action, but there aren't really any jokes there either. It gives us a little information about each character, but mostly shows off what kind of archetype they are, along with reiterating that Leo is really, really strong. My eyes started to glaze over but hey, at least it handled Lily's crush on Leo without being really creepy about it.    And then! And then! It slides straight into melodrama as Leo tells the Four Generals how he ended up deciding to join them in yet another gray-tinged flashback and by now I am checked out. We've gone straight from “fun romp” to “whiny slog” in the space of less than an episode, and I need someone to go out and buy me a neck brace because I am seriously suffering from tonal whiplash. It's a real galaxy-brained choice to make the first episode almost entirely backstory, and I don't mean that in the good way. It stops the story in its tracks before it can even get going. It has the stink of an overly-faithful adaptation of an under-edited light novel to it, and I'm not holding my nose for it.        James Beckett  Rating:               Watching a premiere like the one we get with I'm Quitting Heroing is like eating a Hot Pocket for dinner. You know that it isn't going to be very healthy, or filling, or even very tasty. As you spend two-to-three minutes watching the little meat-and-cheese pastry spin around on the microwave plate, secure in its patented “crispy sleeve” or whatever the hell it's called,  you will have plenty of time to ask yourself the important questions: “Is this really what I'm going to settle for?” “Surely, there must have been something better to choose from than this?” “How many years is eating this mass-produced and possibly irradiated junk food going to take off my life, anyways?” Then you eat the thing, and it's…fine. It's technically food. It contains plenty of sugars and empty calories to keep your body functioning for a few hours more. It could have been worse, probably. It could have been a Lean Pocket.    Anyways, you all know the drill with these overlong food metaphors: They indicate that the subject being reviewed is too bland and featureless to inspire much thought-provoking criticism, so the writer in question had to reach just to find an interesting way of saying that they were mildly but not offensively bored by the whole experience. Also, I'm very hungry as I'm writing this.    I didn't hate I'm Quitting Heroing. It's just that, as a generic workplace comedy twist on even more generic anime fantasy tropes, there is literally nothing about the cast or the story that we haven't seen done ten thousand times before already. The main character is named “Leo Demonheart” for crying out loud. He and all of the Demon Queen's generals look and sound like they were yanked right out of the Default Templates folder you'd find on a vanilla install of RPG Maker.    A couple of the jokes in this episode made me laugh, and at no point did the main guy behave in a way that was creepy or irritating. The episode didn't feel any longer than its 23-minute runtime (though it didn't exactly breeze by, either). So, while I didn't like anything about I'm Quitting Heroing, I didn't actively hate my time with it either. It just sort of exists, designed to be consumed and immediately forgotten, like so many of the cheap frozen dinners that have come and gone throughout the college dorms of the world.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               The premise of this series boils down to a single question: “What happens to the hero after they win?” You may want the legendary hero around when there's an army of invading demons led by an all-powerful Demon Lord, but the moment the hero is triumphant, the whole situation changes. Now you have someone powerful enough to take down the ultimate evil—without the evil part of the equation. This begets fear in the general population which then turns to anger. Soon they will want him gone—if not dead then at least out of sight and out of mind.    This is doubly true in the case of Leo who is a hero so overpowered, he single-handedly took out not only the Demon Lord's army but the Demon Lord and her four generals as well. So what does he do when he is abandoned by all those he worked to save? He sets off to join the remnants of the Demon Lord's army. After all, they will surely accept him since they've seen how effective he is—won't they?    It's a solid premise with a lot of potential for both comedy and drama. But in setting it up, this whole episode becomes little more than a giant backstory dump. We meet the Demon Lord (however briefly) and get introduced to the four generals. Each of the four are walking fantasy stereotypes but this is played for comedy by showing how easily Leo beat them by exploiting their obvious weaknesses. Normally that alone is not enough to carry the episode, but thankfully Leo himself is able to pick up the slack.    Leo is a deeply flawed person. He has ungodly amounts of power and an ego to match. Because of this, he just expects things to work out in his favor and seems more than a little confused when they don't (though he rebounds quickly). But what makes Leo interesting is the simple fact that he doesn't seem to care about anything. He doesn't care about his fellow humans or the things they hold dear. He likewise doesn't care about the demons and all the pain and suffering he has personally put them through.    He doesn't even really seem to care about himself. Even when he is exiled, he doesn't get angry or go on a killing spree like the people fear, he just kind of becomes aimless. It's not like he forgives the people for casting him aside but it seems to roll off of him like something that can't be helped. This is equal parts intriguing and unsettling. Behind the jokes, we have this mystery of a broken man and what made him become this way. And for me, that's enough to give it another watch next week.

This wouldn't be the first title to posit that humans are the real monsters, and while it isn't necessarily going to be expanded upon here, that line of reasoning is very much open in this first episode. That Leo, after realizing that he wasn't doing great work with a party, took it upon himself to fight Echidna the Demon Queen and her four generals, only to be completely rejected by the very humans he was fighting for after defeating them, is a good demonstration of what's wrong with the story's world. In another show, I might say that it was an indication of what's wrong with the basic narrative of good versus evil, but I honestly don't think that's what this series is going for.    What it does appear to be working towards is a simple role reversal: Leo wasn't respected as a hero, so he's going to try his luck as a villain. He knows the road will be a tricky one, seeing as how he was the instrument of the demons' defeat, but he's also tired, emotionally wounded, and really, really sick of living in a cave since he was banished from the very kingdom he saved. I wouldn't blame him if he had a serious grudge; that he doesn't appear to seems to indicate that this is going to be more of a lighthearted piece – or at least as lighthearted as it can be when there's war involved. Not that anyone seems all that keen on attacking the humans again, Leo included. In part that may be due to the drubbing the demons took, but it's just as likely to be because absolutely nobody involved has any taste for logistics. Since Leo came equipped with handouts, graphs, and a resumé, I think we can assume that planning and other logistical tasks are in his wheelhouse.    Despite all of this relatively interesting information and a decent premise, the episode is kind of dull. Most of it is Leo explaining things, both to his prospective employers and to us in the audience, and while there's some animation, it's not very exciting. Lily's constantly wagging tail is cute, and the scene where Leo returns to town after defeating Echidna has the right uncomfortable balance, but if you don't love exposition, this may be a real slog.

Thankfully he's a lot more charming when he's played as an obtuse jerk who can't stop talking about how he's so much stronger than the demon army he's trying to get a job at. He's a jerk, sure, but his casual ego gives him some personality and lets him bounce off the other characters in this episode in a way that's funny more often than not.    Though there aren't really any laugh-out-loud moments in this episode, mostly because a lot of it is used for building up the same joke four or five times in a row. Yep, Leo sure is way stronger than everyone else and he totally punked out the demon generals! We definitely needed to see that gag run through the wash multiple times across the episode. Doesn't help that while some of the Generals at least sass him back, a couple of them just roll with Leo's obnoxious personality. Jokes like this one need some real friction to be funny, and that's in short supply across too much of this premiere. I'm especially not a fan of the underage beast-girl who's declared she wants to marry him. The show hasn't yet used her for obvious fanservice, but the prospect of seeing more of that is a pretty good motivator to not watch another episode.    And it didn't really need more help in that endeavor. While there's nothing particularly bad about this premiere, it also just doesn't do much that's interesting or compelling. Maybe it's the generic art style and character designs, maybe it's just the show splitting itself too much between a wacky comedy and a serious story of a banished hero joining the “dark side” –  either way, not being bad or objectionable isn't the same as being good, and I can't give much enthusiasm for a show that leaves such little impression.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review                Odd Taxi: In the Woods   Apr 17, 00:00                 anime    By cleverly reframing its narrative around a series of interviews with the supporting cast, Odd Taxi: In the Woods succeeds where most recap films fail: it's an artistically cohesive film in its own right. ― Odd Taxi was 2021's sleeper anime hit, telling an intricate, original mystery that kept viewers guessing every week.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide I'm Quitting Heroing   Apr  6th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of I'm Quitting Heroing ?                     Community score: 3.7              What is this?   Leo is a hero who once saved the world from a demon army's invasion. However, he was feared and ostracized by people afterward, and ended up with no job. Feeling that his skills would be better appreciated elsewhere, he joins the demon lord's army that he once fought. Now in a new work environment, Leo strives to use his skills and revive the demon army that is on the brink of collapse.    I'm Quitting Heroing is based on Quantum and Hana Amano's fantasy light novel series and streams on HIDIVE on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                You know, I have to give I'm Quitting Heroing some credit. It's not a premise I've encountered before, which can be very valuable when it feels like half the series that come out each season are variations on the same three themes. It also gets off to a strong start, with Leo marching himself into the Demon Lord's castle and proudly presenting his resume. His blunt, arrogant, and somewhat abrasive personality kind of sucks and he knows it, but he's also confident that his skills more than make up for his social deficiencies.    With the first few minutes dedicated to some solid physical comedy and character-based gags, I was ready to lean in and accept that hey, maybe this isn't the anime for me, but it's still pretty fun. The character designs are attractive and varied without being totally hackneyed; plus, one of them has very similar energy to Iskander from Fate/Zero, and I kind of love that. By the time Leo was meeting with the Four Generals in the boardroom, I had settled in for a good, solid 3.5 star premiere. Not my thing necessarily, but a solid recommendation for people who read the summary and think it sounds like something they'd enjoy.    But then the flashbacks start. Leo talks about how he defeated each of the Four Generals while black and white depictions of what he's describing play on screen. It's half showing, half telling, all redundancy, and it really sucks all the oxygen out of the room. It's too abbreviated for any kind of decent action, but there aren't really any jokes there either. It gives us a little information about each character, but mostly shows off what kind of archetype they are, along with reiterating that Leo is really, really strong. My eyes started to glaze over but hey, at least it handled Lily's crush on Leo without being really creepy about it.    And then! And then! It slides straight into melodrama as Leo tells the Four Generals how he ended up deciding to join them in yet another gray-tinged flashback and by now I am checked out. We've gone straight from “fun romp” to “whiny slog” in the space of less than an episode, and I need someone to go out and buy me a neck brace because I am seriously suffering from tonal whiplash. It's a real galaxy-brained choice to make the first episode almost entirely backstory, and I don't mean that in the good way. It stops the story in its tracks before it can even get going. It has the stink of an overly-faithful adaptation of an under-edited light novel to it, and I'm not holding my nose for it.        James Beckett  Rating:               Watching a premiere like the one we get with I'm Quitting Heroing is like eating a Hot Pocket for dinner. You know that it isn't going to be very healthy, or filling, or even very tasty. As you spend two-to-three minutes watching the little meat-and-cheese pastry spin around on the microwave plate, secure in its patented “crispy sleeve” or whatever the hell it's called,  you will have plenty of time to ask yourself the important questions: “Is this really what I'm going to settle for?” “Surely, there must have been something better to choose from than this?” “How many years is eating this mass-produced and possibly irradiated junk food going to take off my life, anyways?” Then you eat the thing, and it's…fine. It's technically food. It contains plenty of sugars and empty calories to keep your body functioning for a few hours more. It could have been worse, probably. It could have been a Lean Pocket.    Anyways, you all know the drill with these overlong food metaphors: They indicate that the subject being reviewed is too bland and featureless to inspire much thought-provoking criticism, so the writer in question had to reach just to find an interesting way of saying that they were mildly but not offensively bored by the whole experience. Also, I'm very hungry as I'm writing this.    I didn't hate I'm Quitting Heroing. It's just that, as a generic workplace comedy twist on even more generic anime fantasy tropes, there is literally nothing about the cast or the story that we haven't seen done ten thousand times before already. The main character is named “Leo Demonheart” for crying out loud. He and all of the Demon Queen's generals look and sound like they were yanked right out of the Default Templates folder you'd find on a vanilla install of RPG Maker.    A couple of the jokes in this episode made me laugh, and at no point did the main guy behave in a way that was creepy or irritating. The episode didn't feel any longer than its 23-minute runtime (though it didn't exactly breeze by, either). So, while I didn't like anything about I'm Quitting Heroing, I didn't actively hate my time with it either. It just sort of exists, designed to be consumed and immediately forgotten, like so many of the cheap frozen dinners that have come and gone throughout the college dorms of the world.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               The premise of this series boils down to a single question: “What happens to the hero after they win?” You may want the legendary hero around when there's an army of invading demons led by an all-powerful Demon Lord, but the moment the hero is triumphant, the whole situation changes. Now you have someone powerful enough to take down the ultimate evil—without the evil part of the equation. This begets fear in the general population which then turns to anger. Soon they will want him gone—if not dead then at least out of sight and out of mind.    This is doubly true in the case of Leo who is a hero so overpowered, he single-handedly took out not only the Demon Lord's army but the Demon Lord and her four generals as well. So what does he do when he is abandoned by all those he worked to save? He sets off to join the remnants of the Demon Lord's army. After all, they will surely accept him since they've seen how effective he is—won't they?    It's a solid premise with a lot of potential for both comedy and drama. But in setting it up, this whole episode becomes little more than a giant backstory dump. We meet the Demon Lord (however briefly) and get introduced to the four generals. Each of the four are walking fantasy stereotypes but this is played for comedy by showing how easily Leo beat them by exploiting their obvious weaknesses. Normally that alone is not enough to carry the episode, but thankfully Leo himself is able to pick up the slack.    Leo is a deeply flawed person. He has ungodly amounts of power and an ego to match. Because of this, he just expects things to work out in his favor and seems more than a little confused when they don't (though he rebounds quickly). But what makes Leo interesting is the simple fact that he doesn't seem to care about anything. He doesn't care about his fellow humans or the things they hold dear. He likewise doesn't care about the demons and all the pain and suffering he has personally put them through.    He doesn't even really seem to care about himself. Even when he is exiled, he doesn't get angry or go on a killing spree like the people fear, he just kind of becomes aimless. It's not like he forgives the people for casting him aside but it seems to roll off of him like something that can't be helped. This is equal parts intriguing and unsettling. Behind the jokes, we have this mystery of a broken man and what made him become this way. And for me, that's enough to give it another watch next week.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Even if you don't admire Leo's chutzpah for waltzing into the castle of the very demon lord he just defeated and asking for a job, you have to give him credit for realizing that he was fighting on the wrong side before. This wouldn't be the first title to posit that humans are the real monsters, and while it isn't necessarily going to be expanded upon here, that line of reasoning is very much open in this first episode. That Leo, after realizing that he wasn't doing great work with a party, took it upon himself to fight Echidna the Demon Queen and her four generals, only to be completely rejected by the very humans he was fighting for after defeating them, is a good demonstration of what's wrong with the story's world. In another show, I might say that it was an indication of what's wrong with the basic narrative of good versus evil, but I honestly don't think that's what this series is going for.    What it does appear to be working towards is a simple role reversal: Leo wasn't respected as a hero, so he's going to try his luck as a villain. He knows the road will be a tricky one, seeing as how he was the instrument of the demons' defeat, but he's also tired, emotionally wounded, and really, really sick of living in a cave since he was banished from the very kingdom he saved. I wouldn't blame him if he had a serious grudge; that he doesn't appear to seems to indicate that this is going to be more of a lighthearted piece – or at least as lighthearted as it can be when there's war involved. Not that anyone seems all that keen on attacking the humans again, Leo included. In part that may be due to the drubbing the demons took, but it's just as likely to be because absolutely nobody involved has any taste for logistics. Since Leo came equipped with handouts, graphs, and a resumé, I think we can assume that planning and other logistical tasks are in his wheelhouse.    Despite all of this relatively interesting information and a decent premise, the episode is kind of dull. Most of it is Leo explaining things, both to his prospective employers and to us in the audience, and while there's some animation, it's not very exciting. Lily's constantly wagging tail is cute, and the scene where Leo returns to town after defeating Echidna has the right uncomfortable balance, but if you don't love exposition, this may be a real slog. It has potential in Leo using his skills to turn things around for the people he previously defeated, but I could see the drag of this episode turning people off.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Just off the bat, I hate this title. Sure, it's succinct enough and doesn't have an overlong subtitle, but “Heroing” is such a clunky word that just never looks right when I read it. The show itself is perfectly alright so far – maybe a little too muddled on whether it wants to take its premise seriously or treat it entirely as a farce – but overall this premiere isn't a bad sit. But that title? Terrible. Awful. My phone keeps auto-correcting it to “I'm Quitting Heroin” and I don't need that kind of mistake in my work e-mails. As protest I'm going to call this one I Quit for the rest of time.    Anyway, the actual premise of I Quit is a solid enough one, though I can't shake the feeling of having seen so many parts of it done better in other shows. I'm also just really tired of over-powered heroes wallowing in how being a LVL 99 Übermensch isn't as fun as they always thought it would be. So Leo himself is kind of a bore throughout this premiere whenever he's supposed to be taken seriously. Thankfully he's a lot more charming when he's played as an obtuse jerk who can't stop talking about how he's so much stronger than the demon army he's trying to get a job at. He's a jerk, sure, but his casual ego gives him some personality and lets him bounce off the other characters in this episode in a way that's funny more often than not.    Though there aren't really any laugh-out-loud moments in this episode, mostly because a lot of it is used for building up the same joke four or five times in a row. Yep, Leo sure is way stronger than everyone else and he totally punked out the demon generals! We definitely needed to see that gag run through the wash multiple times across the episode. Doesn't help that while some of the Generals at least sass him back, a couple of them just roll with Leo's obnoxious personality. Jokes like this one need some real friction to be funny, and that's in short supply across too much of this premiere. I'm especially not a fan of the underage beast-girl who's declared she wants to marry him. The show hasn't yet used her for obvious fanservice, but the prospect of seeing more of that is a pretty good motivator to not watch another episode.    And it didn't really need more help in that endeavor. While there's nothing particularly bad about this premiere, it also just doesn't do much that's interesting or compelling. Maybe it's the generic art style and character designs, maybe it's just the show splitting itself too much between a wacky comedy and a serious story of a banished hero joining the “dark side” –  either way, not being bad or objectionable isn't the same as being good, and I can't give much enthusiasm for a show that leaves such little impression.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

The character designs are attractive and varied without being totally hackneyed; plus, one of them has very similar energy to Iskander from Fate/Zero, and I kind of love that. By the time Leo was meeting with the Four Generals in the boardroom, I had settled in for a good, solid 3.5 star premiere. Not my thing necessarily, but a solid recommendation for people who read the summary and think it sounds like something they'd enjoy.    But then the flashbacks start. Leo talks about how he defeated each of the Four Generals while black and white depictions of what he's describing play on screen. It's half showing, half telling, all redundancy, and it really sucks all the oxygen out of the room. It's too abbreviated for any kind of decent action, but there aren't really any jokes there either. It gives us a little information about each character, but mostly shows off what kind of archetype they are, along with reiterating that Leo is really, really strong. My eyes started to glaze over but hey, at least it handled Lily's crush on Leo without being really creepy about it.    And then! And then! It slides straight into melodrama as Leo tells the Four Generals how he ended up deciding to join them in yet another gray-tinged flashback and by now I am checked out. We've gone straight from “fun romp” to “whiny slog” in the space of less than an episode, and I need someone to go out and buy me a neck brace because I am seriously suffering from tonal whiplash. It's a real galaxy-brained choice to make the first episode almost entirely backstory, and I don't mean that in the good way. It stops the story in its tracks before it can even get going. It has the stink of an overly-faithful adaptation of an under-edited light novel to it, and I'm not holding my nose for it.        James Beckett  Rating:               Watching a premiere like the one we get with I'm Quitting Heroing is like eating a Hot Pocket for dinner. You know that it isn't going to be very healthy, or filling, or even very tasty. As you spend two-to-three minutes watching the little meat-and-cheese pastry spin around on the microwave plate, secure in its patented “crispy sleeve” or whatever the hell it's called,  you will have plenty of time to ask yourself the important questions: “Is this really what I'm going to settle for?” “Surely, there must have been something better to choose from than this?” “How many years is eating this mass-produced and possibly irradiated junk food going to take off my life, anyways?” Then you eat the thing, and it's…fine. It's technically food. It contains plenty of sugars and empty calories to keep your body functioning for a few hours more. It could have been worse, probably. It could have been a Lean Pocket.    Anyways, you all know the drill with these overlong food metaphors: They indicate that the subject being reviewed is too bland and featureless to inspire much thought-provoking criticism, so the writer in question had to reach just to find an interesting way of saying that they were mildly but not offensively bored by the whole experience. Also, I'm very hungry as I'm writing this.    I didn't hate I'm Quitting Heroing. It's just that, as a generic workplace comedy twist on even more generic anime fantasy tropes, there is literally nothing about the cast or the story that we haven't seen done ten thousand times before already. The main character is named “Leo Demonheart” for crying out loud. He and all of the Demon Queen's generals look and sound like they were yanked right out of the Default Templates folder you'd find on a vanilla install of RPG Maker.    A couple of the jokes in this episode made me laugh, and at no point did the main guy behave in a way that was creepy or irritating. The episode didn't feel any longer than its 23-minute runtime (though it didn't exactly breeze by, either). So, while I didn't like anything about I'm Quitting Heroing, I didn't actively hate my time with it either. It just sort of exists, designed to be consumed and immediately forgotten, like so many of the cheap frozen dinners that have come and gone throughout the college dorms of the world.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               The premise of this series boils down to a single question: “What happens to the hero after they win?” You may want the legendary hero around when there's an army of invading demons led by an all-powerful Demon Lord, but the moment the hero is triumphant, the whole situation changes. Now you have someone powerful enough to take down the ultimate evil—without the evil part of the equation. This begets fear in the general population which then turns to anger. Soon they will want him gone—if not dead then at least out of sight and out of mind.    This is doubly true in the case of Leo who is a hero so overpowered, he single-handedly took out not only the Demon Lord's army but the Demon Lord and her four generals as well. So what does he do when he is abandoned by all those he worked to save? He sets off to join the remnants of the Demon Lord's army. After all, they will surely accept him since they've seen how effective he is—won't they?    It's a solid premise with a lot of potential for both comedy and drama. But in setting it up, this whole episode becomes little more than a giant backstory dump. We meet the Demon Lord (however briefly) and get introduced to the four generals. Each of the four are walking fantasy stereotypes but this is played for comedy by showing how easily Leo beat them by exploiting their obvious weaknesses. Normally that alone is not enough to carry the episode, but thankfully Leo himself is able to pick up the slack.    Leo is a deeply flawed person. He has ungodly amounts of power and an ego to match. Because of this, he just expects things to work out in his favor and seems more than a little confused when they don't (though he rebounds quickly). But what makes Leo interesting is the simple fact that he doesn't seem to care about anything. He doesn't care about his fellow humans or the things they hold dear. He likewise doesn't care about the demons and all the pain and suffering he has personally put them through.    He doesn't even really seem to care about himself. Even when he is exiled, he doesn't get angry or go on a killing spree like the people fear, he just kind of becomes aimless. It's not like he forgives the people for casting him aside but it seems to roll off of him like something that can't be helped. This is equal parts intriguing and unsettling. Behind the jokes, we have this mystery of a broken man and what made him become this way. And for me, that's enough to give it another watch next week.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Even if you don't admire Leo's chutzpah for waltzing into the castle of the very demon lord he just defeated and asking for a job, you have to give him credit for realizing that he was fighting on the wrong side before. This wouldn't be the first title to posit that humans are the real monsters, and while it isn't necessarily going to be expanded upon here, that line of reasoning is very much open in this first episode. That Leo, after realizing that he wasn't doing great work with a party, took it upon himself to fight Echidna the Demon Queen and her four generals, only to be completely rejected by the very humans he was fighting for after defeating them, is a good demonstration of what's wrong with the story's world. In another show, I might say that it was an indication of what's wrong with the basic narrative of good versus evil, but I honestly don't think that's what this series is going for.    What it does appear to be working towards is a simple role reversal: Leo wasn't respected as a hero, so he's going to try his luck as a villain. He knows the road will be a tricky one, seeing as how he was the instrument of the demons' defeat, but he's also tired, emotionally wounded, and really, really sick of living in a cave since he was banished from the very kingdom he saved. I wouldn't blame him if he had a serious grudge; that he doesn't appear to seems to indicate that this is going to be more of a lighthearted piece – or at least as lighthearted as it can be when there's war involved. Not that anyone seems all that keen on attacking the humans again, Leo included. In part that may be due to the drubbing the demons took, but it's just as likely to be because absolutely nobody involved has any taste for logistics. Since Leo came equipped with handouts, graphs, and a resumé, I think we can assume that planning and other logistical tasks are in his wheelhouse.    Despite all of this relatively interesting information and a decent premise, the episode is kind of dull. Most of it is Leo explaining things, both to his prospective employers and to us in the audience, and while there's some animation, it's not very exciting. Lily's constantly wagging tail is cute, and the scene where Leo returns to town after defeating Echidna has the right uncomfortable balance, but if you don't love exposition, this may be a real slog. It has potential in Leo using his skills to turn things around for the people he previously defeated, but I could see the drag of this episode turning people off.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Just off the bat, I hate this title. Sure, it's succinct enough and doesn't have an overlong subtitle, but “Heroing” is such a clunky word that just never looks right when I read it. The show itself is perfectly alright so far – maybe a little too muddled on whether it wants to take its premise seriously or treat it entirely as a farce – but overall this premiere isn't a bad sit. But that title? Terrible. Awful. My phone keeps auto-correcting it to “I'm Quitting Heroin” and I don't need that kind of mistake in my work e-mails. As protest I'm going to call this one I Quit for the rest of time.    Anyway, the actual premise of I Quit is a solid enough one, though I can't shake the feeling of having seen so many parts of it done better in other shows. I'm also just really tired of over-powered heroes wallowing in how being a LVL 99 Übermensch isn't as fun as they always thought it would be. So Leo himself is kind of a bore throughout this premiere whenever he's supposed to be taken seriously. Thankfully he's a lot more charming when he's played as an obtuse jerk who can't stop talking about how he's so much stronger than the demon army he's trying to get a job at. He's a jerk, sure, but his casual ego gives him some personality and lets him bounce off the other characters in this episode in a way that's funny more often than not.    Though there aren't really any laugh-out-loud moments in this episode, mostly because a lot of it is used for building up the same joke four or five times in a row. Yep, Leo sure is way stronger than everyone else and he totally punked out the demon generals! We definitely needed to see that gag run through the wash multiple times across the episode. Doesn't help that while some of the Generals at least sass him back, a couple of them just roll with Leo's obnoxious personality. Jokes like this one need some real friction to be funny, and that's in short supply across too much of this premiere. I'm especially not a fan of the underage beast-girl who's declared she wants to marry him. The show hasn't yet used her for obvious fanservice, but the prospect of seeing more of that is a pretty good motivator to not watch another episode.    And it didn't really need more help in that endeavor. While there's nothing particularly bad about this premiere, it also just doesn't do much that's interesting or compelling. Maybe it's the generic art style and character designs, maybe it's just the show splitting itself too much between a wacky comedy and a serious story of a banished hero joining the “dark side” –  either way, not being bad or objectionable isn't the same as being good, and I can't give much enthusiasm for a show that leaves such little impression.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More     ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 3.7              What is this?   Leo is a hero who once saved the world from a demon army's invasion. However, he was feared and ostracized by people afterward, and ended up with no job. Feeling that his skills would be better appreciated elsewhere, he joins the demon lord's army that he once fought. Now in a new work environment, Leo strives to use his skills and revive the demon army that is on the brink of collapse.    I'm Quitting Heroing is based on Quantum and Hana Amano's fantasy light novel series and streams on HIDIVE on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                You know, I have to give I'm Quitting Heroing some credit. It's not a premise I've encountered before, which can be very valuable when it feels like half the series that come out each season are variations on the same three themes.

It's just that, as a generic workplace comedy twist on even more generic anime fantasy tropes, there is literally nothing about the cast or the story that we haven't seen done ten thousand times before already. The main character is named “Leo Demonheart” for crying out loud. He and all of the Demon Queen's generals look and sound like they were yanked right out of the Default Templates folder you'd find on a vanilla install of RPG Maker.    A couple of the jokes in this episode made me laugh, and at no point did the main guy behave in a way that was creepy or irritating. The episode didn't feel any longer than its 23-minute runtime (though it didn't exactly breeze by, either). So, while I didn't like anything about I'm Quitting Heroing, I didn't actively hate my time with it either. It just sort of exists, designed to be consumed and immediately forgotten, like so many of the cheap frozen dinners that have come and gone throughout the college dorms of the world.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               The premise of this series boils down to a single question: “What happens to the hero after they win?” You may want the legendary hero around when there's an army of invading demons led by an all-powerful Demon Lord, but the moment the hero is triumphant, the whole situation changes. Now you have someone powerful enough to take down the ultimate evil—without the evil part of the equation. This begets fear in the general population which then turns to anger. Soon they will want him gone—if not dead then at least out of sight and out of mind.    This is doubly true in the case of Leo who is a hero so overpowered, he single-handedly took out not only the Demon Lord's army but the Demon Lord and her four generals as well. So what does he do when he is abandoned by all those he worked to save? He sets off to join the remnants of the Demon Lord's army. After all, they will surely accept him since they've seen how effective he is—won't they?    It's a solid premise with a lot of potential for both comedy and drama. But in setting it up, this whole episode becomes little more than a giant backstory dump. We meet the Demon Lord (however briefly) and get introduced to the four generals. Each of the four are walking fantasy stereotypes but this is played for comedy by showing how easily Leo beat them by exploiting their obvious weaknesses. Normally that alone is not enough to carry the episode, but thankfully Leo himself is able to pick up the slack.    Leo is a deeply flawed person. He has ungodly amounts of power and an ego to match. Because of this, he just expects things to work out in his favor and seems more than a little confused when they don't (though he rebounds quickly). But what makes Leo interesting is the simple fact that he doesn't seem to care about anything. He doesn't care about his fellow humans or the things they hold dear. He likewise doesn't care about the demons and all the pain and suffering he has personally put them through.    He doesn't even really seem to care about himself. Even when he is exiled, he doesn't get angry or go on a killing spree like the people fear, he just kind of becomes aimless. It's not like he forgives the people for casting him aside but it seems to roll off of him like something that can't be helped. This is equal parts intriguing and unsettling. Behind the jokes, we have this mystery of a broken man and what made him become this way. And for me, that's enough to give it another watch next week.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Even if you don't admire Leo's chutzpah for waltzing into the castle of the very demon lord he just defeated and asking for a job, you have to give him credit for realizing that he was fighting on the wrong side before. This wouldn't be the first title to posit that humans are the real monsters, and while it isn't necessarily going to be expanded upon here, that line of reasoning is very much open in this first episode. That Leo, after realizing that he wasn't doing great work with a party, took it upon himself to fight Echidna the Demon Queen and her four generals, only to be completely rejected by the very humans he was fighting for after defeating them, is a good demonstration of what's wrong with the story's world. In another show, I might say that it was an indication of what's wrong with the basic narrative of good versus evil, but I honestly don't think that's what this series is going for.    What it does appear to be working towards is a simple role reversal: Leo wasn't respected as a hero, so he's going to try his luck as a villain. He knows the road will be a tricky one, seeing as how he was the instrument of the demons' defeat, but he's also tired, emotionally wounded, and really, really sick of living in a cave since he was banished from the very kingdom he saved. I wouldn't blame him if he had a serious grudge; that he doesn't appear to seems to indicate that this is going to be more of a lighthearted piece – or at least as lighthearted as it can be when there's war involved. Not that anyone seems all that keen on attacking the humans again, Leo included. In part that may be due to the drubbing the demons took, but it's just as likely to be because absolutely nobody involved has any taste for logistics. Since Leo came equipped with handouts, graphs, and a resumé, I think we can assume that planning and other logistical tasks are in his wheelhouse.    Despite all of this relatively interesting information and a decent premise, the episode is kind of dull. Most of it is Leo explaining things, both to his prospective employers and to us in the audience, and while there's some animation, it's not very exciting. Lily's constantly wagging tail is cute, and the scene where Leo returns to town after defeating Echidna has the right uncomfortable balance, but if you don't love exposition, this may be a real slog. It has potential in Leo using his skills to turn things around for the people he previously defeated, but I could see the drag of this episode turning people off.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Just off the bat, I hate this title. Sure, it's succinct enough and doesn't have an overlong subtitle, but “Heroing” is such a clunky word that just never looks right when I read it. The show itself is perfectly alright so far – maybe a little too muddled on whether it wants to take its premise seriously or treat it entirely as a farce – but overall this premiere isn't a bad sit. But that title? Terrible. Awful. My phone keeps auto-correcting it to “I'm Quitting Heroin” and I don't need that kind of mistake in my work e-mails. As protest I'm going to call this one I Quit for the rest of time.    Anyway, the actual premise of I Quit is a solid enough one, though I can't shake the feeling of having seen so many parts of it done better in other shows. I'm also just really tired of over-powered heroes wallowing in how being a LVL 99 Übermensch isn't as fun as they always thought it would be. So Leo himself is kind of a bore throughout this premiere whenever he's supposed to be taken seriously. Thankfully he's a lot more charming when he's played as an obtuse jerk who can't stop talking about how he's so much stronger than the demon army he's trying to get a job at. He's a jerk, sure, but his casual ego gives him some personality and lets him bounce off the other characters in this episode in a way that's funny more often than not.    Though there aren't really any laugh-out-loud moments in this episode, mostly because a lot of it is used for building up the same joke four or five times in a row. Yep, Leo sure is way stronger than everyone else and he totally punked out the demon generals! We definitely needed to see that gag run through the wash multiple times across the episode. Doesn't help that while some of the Generals at least sass him back, a couple of them just roll with Leo's obnoxious personality. Jokes like this one need some real friction to be funny, and that's in short supply across too much of this premiere. I'm especially not a fan of the underage beast-girl who's declared she wants to marry him. The show hasn't yet used her for obvious fanservice, but the prospect of seeing more of that is a pretty good motivator to not watch another episode.    And it didn't really need more help in that endeavor. While there's nothing particularly bad about this premiere, it also just doesn't do much that's interesting or compelling. Maybe it's the generic art style and character designs, maybe it's just the show splitting itself too much between a wacky comedy and a serious story of a banished hero joining the “dark side” –  either way, not being bad or objectionable isn't the same as being good, and I can't give much enthusiasm for a show that leaves such little impression.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives     ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"
17-04-2022,anime,2,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/preview-guide/2022/spring/im-quitting-heroing/.183521,I'm Quitting Heroing - The Spring 2022 Preview Guide - Anime News Network:SEA,"                 How would you rate episode 1 of I'm Quitting Heroing ?                     Community score: 3.7              What is this?   Leo is a hero who once saved the world from a demon army's invasion. However, he was feared and ostracized by people afterward, and ended up with no job. Feeling that his skills would be better appreciated elsewhere, he joins the demon lord's army that he once fought. Now in a new work environment, Leo strives to use his skills and revive the demon army that is on the brink of collapse.    I'm Quitting Heroing is based on Quantum and Hana Amano's fantasy light novel series and streams on HIDIVE on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                You know, I have to give I'm Quitting Heroing some credit. It's not a premise I've encountered before, which can be very valuable when it feels like half the series that come out each season are variations on the same three themes. It also gets off to a strong start, with Leo marching himself into the Demon Lord's castle and proudly presenting his resume. His blunt, arrogant, and somewhat abrasive personality kind of sucks and he knows it, but he's also confident that his skills more than make up for his social deficiencies.    With the first few minutes dedicated to some solid physical comedy and character-based gags, I was ready to lean in and accept that hey, maybe this isn't the anime for me, but it's still pretty fun. The character designs are attractive and varied without being totally hackneyed; plus, one of them has very similar energy to Iskander from Fate/Zero, and I kind of love that. By the time Leo was meeting with the Four Generals in the boardroom, I had settled in for a good, solid 3.5 star premiere. Not my thing necessarily, but a solid recommendation for people who read the summary and think it sounds like something they'd enjoy.    But then the flashbacks start. Leo talks about how he defeated each of the Four Generals while black and white depictions of what he's describing play on screen. It's half showing, half telling, all redundancy, and it really sucks all the oxygen out of the room. It's too abbreviated for any kind of decent action, but there aren't really any jokes there either. It gives us a little information about each character, but mostly shows off what kind of archetype they are, along with reiterating that Leo is really, really strong. My eyes started to glaze over but hey, at least it handled Lily's crush on Leo without being really creepy about it.    And then! And then! It slides straight into melodrama as Leo tells the Four Generals how he ended up deciding to join them in yet another gray-tinged flashback and by now I am checked out. We've gone straight from “fun romp” to “whiny slog” in the space of less than an episode, and I need someone to go out and buy me a neck brace because I am seriously suffering from tonal whiplash. It's a real galaxy-brained choice to make the first episode almost entirely backstory, and I don't mean that in the good way. It stops the story in its tracks before it can even get going. It has the stink of an overly-faithful adaptation of an under-edited light novel to it, and I'm not holding my nose for it.        James Beckett  Rating:               Watching a premiere like the one we get with I'm Quitting Heroing is like eating a Hot Pocket for dinner. You know that it isn't going to be very healthy, or filling, or even very tasty. As you spend two-to-three minutes watching the little meat-and-cheese pastry spin around on the microwave plate, secure in its patented “crispy sleeve” or whatever the hell it's called,  you will have plenty of time to ask yourself the important questions: “Is this really what I'm going to settle for?” “Surely, there must have been something better to choose from than this?” “How many years is eating this mass-produced and possibly irradiated junk food going to take off my life, anyways?” Then you eat the thing, and it's…fine. It's technically food. It contains plenty of sugars and empty calories to keep your body functioning for a few hours more. It could have been worse, probably. It could have been a Lean Pocket.    Anyways, you all know the drill with these overlong food metaphors: They indicate that the subject being reviewed is too bland and featureless to inspire much thought-provoking criticism, so the writer in question had to reach just to find an interesting way of saying that they were mildly but not offensively bored by the whole experience.

Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Even if you don't admire Leo's chutzpah for waltzing into the castle of the very demon lord he just defeated and asking for a job, you have to give him credit for realizing that he was fighting on the wrong side before. This wouldn't be the first title to posit that humans are the real monsters, and while it isn't necessarily going to be expanded upon here, that line of reasoning is very much open in this first episode. That Leo, after realizing that he wasn't doing great work with a party, took it upon himself to fight Echidna the Demon Queen and her four generals, only to be completely rejected by the very humans he was fighting for after defeating them, is a good demonstration of what's wrong with the story's world. In another show, I might say that it was an indication of what's wrong with the basic narrative of good versus evil, but I honestly don't think that's what this series is going for.    What it does appear to be working towards is a simple role reversal: Leo wasn't respected as a hero, so he's going to try his luck as a villain. He knows the road will be a tricky one, seeing as how he was the instrument of the demons' defeat, but he's also tired, emotionally wounded, and really, really sick of living in a cave since he was banished from the very kingdom he saved. I wouldn't blame him if he had a serious grudge; that he doesn't appear to seems to indicate that this is going to be more of a lighthearted piece – or at least as lighthearted as it can be when there's war involved. Not that anyone seems all that keen on attacking the humans again, Leo included. In part that may be due to the drubbing the demons took, but it's just as likely to be because absolutely nobody involved has any taste for logistics. Since Leo came equipped with handouts, graphs, and a resumé, I think we can assume that planning and other logistical tasks are in his wheelhouse.    Despite all of this relatively interesting information and a decent premise, the episode is kind of dull. Most of it is Leo explaining things, both to his prospective employers and to us in the audience, and while there's some animation, it's not very exciting. Lily's constantly wagging tail is cute, and the scene where Leo returns to town after defeating Echidna has the right uncomfortable balance, but if you don't love exposition, this may be a real slog. It has potential in Leo using his skills to turn things around for the people he previously defeated, but I could see the drag of this episode turning people off.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Just off the bat, I hate this title. Sure, it's succinct enough and doesn't have an overlong subtitle, but “Heroing” is such a clunky word that just never looks right when I read it. The show itself is perfectly alright so far – maybe a little too muddled on whether it wants to take its premise seriously or treat it entirely as a farce – but overall this premiere isn't a bad sit. But that title? Terrible. Awful. My phone keeps auto-correcting it to “I'm Quitting Heroin” and I don't need that kind of mistake in my work e-mails. As protest I'm going to call this one I Quit for the rest of time.    Anyway, the actual premise of I Quit is a solid enough one, though I can't shake the feeling of having seen so many parts of it done better in other shows. I'm also just really tired of over-powered heroes wallowing in how being a LVL 99 Übermensch isn't as fun as they always thought it would be. So Leo himself is kind of a bore throughout this premiere whenever he's supposed to be taken seriously. Thankfully he's a lot more charming when he's played as an obtuse jerk who can't stop talking about how he's so much stronger than the demon army he's trying to get a job at. He's a jerk, sure, but his casual ego gives him some personality and lets him bounce off the other characters in this episode in a way that's funny more often than not.    Though there aren't really any laugh-out-loud moments in this episode, mostly because a lot of it is used for building up the same joke four or five times in a row. Yep, Leo sure is way stronger than everyone else and he totally punked out the demon generals! We definitely needed to see that gag run through the wash multiple times across the episode. Doesn't help that while some of the Generals at least sass him back, a couple of them just roll with Leo's obnoxious personality. Jokes like this one need some real friction to be funny, and that's in short supply across too much of this premiere. I'm especially not a fan of the underage beast-girl who's declared she wants to marry him. The show hasn't yet used her for obvious fanservice, but the prospect of seeing more of that is a pretty good motivator to not watch another episode.    And it didn't really need more help in that endeavor. While there's nothing particularly bad about this premiere, it also just doesn't do much that's interesting or compelling. Maybe it's the generic art style and character designs, maybe it's just the show splitting itself too much between a wacky comedy and a serious story of a banished hero joining the “dark side” –  either way, not being bad or objectionable isn't the same as being good, and I can't give much enthusiasm for a show that leaves such little impression.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives   ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"
17-04-2022,anime,2,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/preview-guide/2022/spring/im-quitting-heroing/.183521,I'm Quitting Heroing - The Spring 2022 Preview Guide - Anime News Network:SEA,"             How would you rate episode 1 of I'm Quitting Heroing ?                     Community score: 3.7              What is this?   Leo is a hero who once saved the world from a demon army's invasion. However, he was feared and ostracized by people afterward, and ended up with no job. Feeling that his skills would be better appreciated elsewhere, he joins the demon lord's army that he once fought. Now in a new work environment, Leo strives to use his skills and revive the demon army that is on the brink of collapse.    I'm Quitting Heroing is based on Quantum and Hana Amano's fantasy light novel series and streams on HIDIVE on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                You know, I have to give I'm Quitting Heroing some credit. It's not a premise I've encountered before, which can be very valuable when it feels like half the series that come out each season are variations on the same three themes. It also gets off to a strong start, with Leo marching himself into the Demon Lord's castle and proudly presenting his resume. His blunt, arrogant, and somewhat abrasive personality kind of sucks and he knows it, but he's also confident that his skills more than make up for his social deficiencies.    With the first few minutes dedicated to some solid physical comedy and character-based gags, I was ready to lean in and accept that hey, maybe this isn't the anime for me, but it's still pretty fun. The character designs are attractive and varied without being totally hackneyed; plus, one of them has very similar energy to Iskander from Fate/Zero, and I kind of love that. By the time Leo was meeting with the Four Generals in the boardroom, I had settled in for a good, solid 3.5 star premiere. Not my thing necessarily, but a solid recommendation for people who read the summary and think it sounds like something they'd enjoy.    But then the flashbacks start. Leo talks about how he defeated each of the Four Generals while black and white depictions of what he's describing play on screen. It's half showing, half telling, all redundancy, and it really sucks all the oxygen out of the room. It's too abbreviated for any kind of decent action, but there aren't really any jokes there either. It gives us a little information about each character, but mostly shows off what kind of archetype they are, along with reiterating that Leo is really, really strong. My eyes started to glaze over but hey, at least it handled Lily's crush on Leo without being really creepy about it.    And then! And then! It slides straight into melodrama as Leo tells the Four Generals how he ended up deciding to join them in yet another gray-tinged flashback and by now I am checked out. We've gone straight from “fun romp” to “whiny slog” in the space of less than an episode, and I need someone to go out and buy me a neck brace because I am seriously suffering from tonal whiplash. It's a real galaxy-brained choice to make the first episode almost entirely backstory, and I don't mean that in the good way. It stops the story in its tracks before it can even get going. It has the stink of an overly-faithful adaptation of an under-edited light novel to it, and I'm not holding my nose for it.        James Beckett  Rating:               Watching a premiere like the one we get with I'm Quitting Heroing is like eating a Hot Pocket for dinner. You know that it isn't going to be very healthy, or filling, or even very tasty. As you spend two-to-three minutes watching the little meat-and-cheese pastry spin around on the microwave plate, secure in its patented “crispy sleeve” or whatever the hell it's called,  you will have plenty of time to ask yourself the important questions: “Is this really what I'm going to settle for?” “Surely, there must have been something better to choose from than this?” “How many years is eating this mass-produced and possibly irradiated junk food going to take off my life, anyways?” Then you eat the thing, and it's…fine. It's technically food. It contains plenty of sugars and empty calories to keep your body functioning for a few hours more. It could have been worse, probably. It could have been a Lean Pocket.    Anyways, you all know the drill with these overlong food metaphors: They indicate that the subject being reviewed is too bland and featureless to inspire much thought-provoking criticism, so the writer in question had to reach just to find an interesting way of saying that they were mildly but not offensively bored by the whole experience. Also, I'm very hungry as I'm writing this.    I didn't hate I'm Quitting Heroing. It's just that, as a generic workplace comedy twist on even more generic anime fantasy tropes, there is literally nothing about the cast or the story that we haven't seen done ten thousand times before already. The main character is named “Leo Demonheart” for crying out loud. He and all of the Demon Queen's generals look and sound like they were yanked right out of the Default Templates folder you'd find on a vanilla install of RPG Maker.    A couple of the jokes in this episode made me laugh, and at no point did the main guy behave in a way that was creepy or irritating. The episode didn't feel any longer than its 23-minute runtime (though it didn't exactly breeze by, either). So, while I didn't like anything about I'm Quitting Heroing, I didn't actively hate my time with it either. It just sort of exists, designed to be consumed and immediately forgotten, like so many of the cheap frozen dinners that have come and gone throughout the college dorms of the world.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               The premise of this series boils down to a single question: “What happens to the hero after they win?” You may want the legendary hero around when there's an army of invading demons led by an all-powerful Demon Lord, but the moment the hero is triumphant, the whole situation changes. Now you have someone powerful enough to take down the ultimate evil—without the evil part of the equation. This begets fear in the general population which then turns to anger. Soon they will want him gone—if not dead then at least out of sight and out of mind.    This is doubly true in the case of Leo who is a hero so overpowered, he single-handedly took out not only the Demon Lord's army but the Demon Lord and her four generals as well. So what does he do when he is abandoned by all those he worked to save? He sets off to join the remnants of the Demon Lord's army. After all, they will surely accept him since they've seen how effective he is—won't they?    It's a solid premise with a lot of potential for both comedy and drama. But in setting it up, this whole episode becomes little more than a giant backstory dump. We meet the Demon Lord (however briefly) and get introduced to the four generals. Each of the four are walking fantasy stereotypes but this is played for comedy by showing how easily Leo beat them by exploiting their obvious weaknesses. Normally that alone is not enough to carry the episode, but thankfully Leo himself is able to pick up the slack.    Leo is a deeply flawed person. He has ungodly amounts of power and an ego to match. Because of this, he just expects things to work out in his favor and seems more than a little confused when they don't (though he rebounds quickly). But what makes Leo interesting is the simple fact that he doesn't seem to care about anything. He doesn't care about his fellow humans or the things they hold dear. He likewise doesn't care about the demons and all the pain and suffering he has personally put them through.    He doesn't even really seem to care about himself. Even when he is exiled, he doesn't get angry or go on a killing spree like the people fear, he just kind of becomes aimless. It's not like he forgives the people for casting him aside but it seems to roll off of him like something that can't be helped. This is equal parts intriguing and unsettling. Behind the jokes, we have this mystery of a broken man and what made him become this way. And for me, that's enough to give it another watch next week.

He's a jerk, sure, but his casual ego gives him some personality and lets him bounce off the other characters in this episode in a way that's funny more often than not.    Though there aren't really any laugh-out-loud moments in this episode, mostly because a lot of it is used for building up the same joke four or five times in a row. Yep, Leo sure is way stronger than everyone else and he totally punked out the demon generals! We definitely needed to see that gag run through the wash multiple times across the episode. Doesn't help that while some of the Generals at least sass him back, a couple of them just roll with Leo's obnoxious personality. Jokes like this one need some real friction to be funny, and that's in short supply across too much of this premiere. I'm especially not a fan of the underage beast-girl who's declared she wants to marry him. The show hasn't yet used her for obvious fanservice, but the prospect of seeing more of that is a pretty good motivator to not watch another episode.    And it didn't really need more help in that endeavor. While there's nothing particularly bad about this premiere, it also just doesn't do much that's interesting or compelling. Maybe it's the generic art style and character designs, maybe it's just the show splitting itself too much between a wacky comedy and a serious story of a banished hero joining the “dark side” –  either way, not being bad or objectionable isn't the same as being good, and I can't give much enthusiasm for a show that leaves such little impression.

News Crunchyroll Streams Aharen-san wa Hakarenai Romantic Comedy Anime's English Dub on April 15   posted on 2022-04-15 01:19 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo          Ben Balmaceda, Dani Chambers star    Crunchyroll will begin streaming an English dub for the television anime of  Asato Mizu's Aharen-san wa Hakarenai (Aharen Is Indecipherable) romantic comedy manga series on Friday at 4:00 p.m. EDT.    The English cast includes:    Ben Balmaceda as Raido   Dani Chambers as Aharen   Kristen McGuire as Ooshiro   Jalitza Delgado as Raido's Sister   Tia Ballard as Miyahira    Emily Fajardo is directing the English dub. Jamal Roberson is the lead ADR engineer, and Xavier Earl and Noah Whitehead are the assistant engineers. Madeleine Morris is writing the script with Bonny Clinkenbeard as supervisor. Brandon Peters is in charge of ADR prep.    The anime premiered in the Animeism block on April 1. Crunchyroll is streaming the anime as it airs in Japan.    The teen romantic comedy follows the ""indecipherable"" daily life of short, quiet Reina Aharen and Raidō who sits next to her in class. Aharen is not so good at gauging the distance between people (or personal boundaries), and Raidō initially sensed some distance between the two of them. Then one day, when Raidō picked up the eraser that Aharen had dropped, the distance between them suddenly became uncomfortably close.    From ""way too distant"" to ""way too close"" ... Aharen is simply unpredictable.      Yasutaka Yamamoto (Servant × Service, Valkyria Chronicles) is serving as chief director, and Tomoe Makino (Woodpecker Detective's Office) is directing the anime at Felix Film. Takao Yoshioka (High School DxD, I'm Standing on 1,000,000 Lives., Sekirei, WATAMOTE) is in charge of the series scripts, and is also writing them with Ayumu Hisao and Kotsukotsu. Yūko Yahiro (Diabolik Lovers, Kaguya-sama: Love is War, Katana Maidens: Toji no Miko) is designing the characters.    Yahiro, Tomoko Iwasa, Chie Mishima, and Yūki Fukuchi are serving as the chief animation directors. Satoru Kousaki (BEASTARS, Lucky Star, Oreimo) and monaca (My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU, Servant × Service, Wagnaria!!) are composing the music. The Chinese streaming service bilibili is presenting the project.      The unit TrySail performs the opening theme song ""Hanarenai Kyori"" (Inseparable Distance), while the unit HaKoniwalily performs the ending theme song ""Kyori-Kan"" (A Sense of Distance).    Mizu launched the manga on Shonen Jump+ in January 2017, and Shueisha published the 13th compiled book volume on April 4.

The English cast includes:    Ben Balmaceda as Raido   Dani Chambers as Aharen   Kristen McGuire as Ooshiro   Jalitza Delgado as Raido's Sister   Tia Ballard as Miyahira    Emily Fajardo is directing the English dub.

Brandon Peters is in charge of ADR prep.    The anime premiered in the Animeism block on April 1. Crunchyroll is streaming the anime as it airs in Japan.    The teen romantic comedy follows the ""indecipherable"" daily life of short, quiet Reina Aharen and Raidō who sits next to her in class. Aharen is not so good at gauging the distance between people (or personal boundaries), and Raidō initially sensed some distance between the two of them. Then one day, when Raidō picked up the eraser that Aharen had dropped, the distance between them suddenly became uncomfortably close.    From ""way too distant"" to ""way too close"" ... Aharen is simply unpredictable.      Yasutaka Yamamoto (Servant × Service, Valkyria Chronicles) is serving as chief director, and Tomoe Makino (Woodpecker Detective's Office) is directing the anime at Felix Film. Takao Yoshioka (High School DxD, I'm Standing on 1,000,000 Lives., Sekirei, WATAMOTE) is in charge of the series scripts, and is also writing them with Ayumu Hisao and Kotsukotsu.

News Crunchyroll Streams Aharen-san wa Hakarenai Romantic Comedy Anime's English Dub on April 15   posted on 2022-04-15 01:19 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo          Ben Balmaceda, Dani Chambers star    Crunchyroll will begin streaming an English dub for the television anime of  Asato Mizu's Aharen-san wa Hakarenai (Aharen Is Indecipherable) romantic comedy manga series on Friday at 4:00 p.m. EDT.    The English cast includes:    Ben Balmaceda as Raido   Dani Chambers as Aharen   Kristen McGuire as Ooshiro   Jalitza Delgado as Raido's Sister   Tia Ballard as Miyahira    Emily Fajardo is directing the English dub.

Brandon Peters is in charge of ADR prep.    The anime premiered in the Animeism block on April 1. Crunchyroll is streaming the anime as it airs in Japan.    The teen romantic comedy follows the ""indecipherable"" daily life of short, quiet Reina Aharen and Raidō who sits next to her in class. Aharen is not so good at gauging the distance between people (or personal boundaries), and Raidō initially sensed some distance between the two of them. Then one day, when Raidō picked up the eraser that Aharen had dropped, the distance between them suddenly became uncomfortably close.    From ""way too distant"" to ""way too close"" ... Aharen is simply unpredictable.      Yasutaka Yamamoto (Servant × Service, Valkyria Chronicles) is serving as chief director, and Tomoe Makino (Woodpecker Detective's Office) is directing the anime at Felix Film. Takao Yoshioka (High School DxD, I'm Standing on 1,000,000 Lives., Sekirei, WATAMOTE) is in charge of the series scripts, and is also writing them with Ayumu Hisao and Kotsukotsu.

Yahiro, Tomoko Iwasa, Chie Mishima, and Yūki Fukuchi are serving as the chief animation directors. Satoru Kousaki (BEASTARS, Lucky Star, Oreimo) and monaca (My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU, Servant × Service, Wagnaria!!) are composing the music. The Chinese streaming service bilibili is presenting the project.      The unit TrySail performs the opening theme song ""Hanarenai Kyori"" (Inseparable Distance), while the unit HaKoniwalily performs the ending theme song ""Kyori-Kan"" (A Sense of Distance).

On the other hand, most of Lupin III movies and OVAs (including the Detective Conan crossover movie) were dubbed in México (and an Argentine redub done for Cagliostro). I hope that Part 6 gets dubbed in México so that the actors from the movies can reprise their roles (something which didn't happen with The First), though HiDive/Sentai Filmworks' Neutral Spanish dubs have a bad reputation among dubbing fans, their dubs for anime like DanMachi, Food Wars and Parasyte: the Maxim have a worse reputation than Funimation's My Hero Academia Neutral Spanish dub.

Part 1 also got a new Spanish dub that'll be finishing up on Hidive tomorrow, so this is definitely something that TMS is pushing for more now; I'm sure Part 6 will be using the same main cast as that new Part 1 dub. In fact, Part 6 is also getting a Portuguese dub!

The show is actually available with the old dub in Pluto TV, it's interesting hearing Victor Mares Jr (Marty McFly) as Lupin, or Aramis as how he's named in that dub. I would like hearing Ricardo Tejedo as Lupin, the last time he voiced the character was in the Lupin vs Conan movie which was dubbed in 2016. In Lupin III The First he was voiced by Carlos Ballarta, who is more of a stand-up comedian and doesn't have a lot of voice acting experience, though he voiced Grisha Jaeger in Attack on Titan.

Like I said, the last three episodes of this ""Latin American Spanish"" dub go up onto Hidive tomorrow, as they've been uploading a few episodes at a time every Thursday.   It could just be the old dub, but considering how it wasn't simply uploaded alongside the English dub, like how Part 4 is getting both Japanese & English uploaded together onto Hidive weekly, and there's now a new Spanish dub for Part 6, it could be a new one for Part 1, as well.

How are they mis-selling it?            They probably meant that it was building up a Lupin/Sherlock rivalry that is essentially already over before it starts, because spoiler[it's later revealed Holmes already knows that Lupin didn't kill Watson.]   Just like the Japanese trailers sold it as Holmes having something personal against Lupin and Lupin being a killer.

On the other hand, most of Lupin III movies and OVAs (including the Detective Conan crossover movie) were dubbed in México (and an Argentine redub done for Cagliostro). I hope that Part 6 gets dubbed in México so that the actors from the movies can reprise their roles (something which didn't happen with The First), though HiDive/Sentai Filmworks' Neutral Spanish dubs have a bad reputation among dubbing fans, their dubs for anime like DanMachi, Food Wars and Parasyte: the Maxim have a worse reputation than Funimation's My Hero Academia Neutral Spanish dub.

Part 1 also got a new Spanish dub that'll be finishing up on Hidive tomorrow, so this is definitely something that TMS is pushing for more now; I'm sure Part 6 will be using the same main cast as that new Part 1 dub. In fact, Part 6 is also getting a Portuguese dub!

The show is actually available with the old dub in Pluto TV, it's interesting hearing Victor Mares Jr (Marty McFly) as Lupin, or Aramis as how he's named in that dub. I would like hearing Ricardo Tejedo as Lupin, the last time he voiced the character was in the Lupin vs Conan movie which was dubbed in 2016. In Lupin III The First he was voiced by Carlos Ballarta, who is more of a stand-up comedian and doesn't have a lot of voice acting experience, though he voiced Grisha Jaeger in Attack on Titan.

Like I said, the last three episodes of this ""Latin American Spanish"" dub go up onto Hidive tomorrow, as they've been uploading a few episodes at a time every Thursday.   It could just be the old dub, but considering how it wasn't simply uploaded alongside the English dub, like how Part 4 is getting both Japanese & English uploaded together onto Hidive weekly, and there's now a new Spanish dub for Part 6, it could be a new one for Part 1, as well.

They probably meant that it was building up a Lupin/Sherlock rivalry that is essentially already over before it starts, because spoiler[it's later revealed Holmes already knows that Lupin didn't kill Watson.]   Just like the Japanese trailers sold it as Holmes having something personal against Lupin and Lupin being a killer.

Part 1 also got a new Spanish dub that'll be finishing up on Hidive tomorrow, so this is definitely something that TMS is pushing for more now; I'm sure Part 6 will be using the same main cast as that new Part 1 dub.

The show is actually available with the old dub in Pluto TV, it's interesting hearing Victor Mares Jr (Marty McFly) as Lupin, or Aramis as how he's named in that dub. I would like hearing Ricardo Tejedo as Lupin, the last time he voiced the character was in the Lupin vs Conan movie which was dubbed in 2016. In Lupin III The First he was voiced by Carlos Ballarta, who is more of a stand-up comedian and doesn't have a lot of voice acting experience, though he voiced Grisha Jaeger in Attack on Titan.

Like I said, the last three episodes of this ""Latin American Spanish"" dub go up onto Hidive tomorrow, as they've been uploading a few episodes at a time every Thursday.   It could just be the old dub, but considering how it wasn't simply uploaded alongside the English dub, like how Part 4 is getting both Japanese & English uploaded together onto Hidive weekly, and there's now a new Spanish dub for Part 6, it could be a new one for Part 1, as well.

It looks like this is a Bang Zoom dub at the very least they kept Tony around for Lupin this time around.

How are they mis-selling it?            They probably meant that it was building up a Lupin/Sherlock rivalry that is essentially already over before it starts, because spoiler[it's later revealed Holmes already knows that Lupin didn't kill Watson.]   Just like the Japanese trailers sold it as Holmes having something personal against Lupin and Lupin being a killer.

Part 1 also got a new Spanish dub that'll be finishing up on Hidive tomorrow, so this is definitely something that TMS is pushing for more now; I'm sure Part 6 will be using the same main cast as that new Part 1 dub.

The show is actually available with the old dub in Pluto TV, it's interesting hearing Victor Mares Jr (Marty McFly) as Lupin, or Aramis as how he's named in that dub. I would like hearing Ricardo Tejedo as Lupin, the last time he voiced the character was in the Lupin vs Conan movie which was dubbed in 2016. In Lupin III The First he was voiced by Carlos Ballarta, who is more of a stand-up comedian and doesn't have a lot of voice acting experience, though he voiced Grisha Jaeger in Attack on Titan.

Like I said, the last three episodes of this ""Latin American Spanish"" dub go up onto Hidive tomorrow, as they've been uploading a few episodes at a time every Thursday.   It could just be the old dub, but considering how it wasn't simply uploaded alongside the English dub, like how Part 4 is getting both Japanese & English uploaded together onto Hidive weekly, and there's now a new Spanish dub for Part 6, it could be a new one for Part 1, as well.

They probably meant that it was building up a Lupin/Sherlock rivalry that is essentially already over before it starts, because spoiler[it's later revealed Holmes already knows that Lupin didn't kill Watson.]   Just like the Japanese trailers sold it as Holmes having something personal against Lupin and Lupin being a killer.

Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department Episode 12  by Christopher Farris, Apr  4th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department ?                     Community score: 4.3            ""Companies don't necessarily stay the same forever"" is the wisdom dispensed as Miss Kuroitsu and the Monster Development crew sit on the precipice of potential change here in this final episode of the show. Superhero stories like the ones this show riffs on are usually built on some sort of stock status quo, but everything needs to get upended in time for a finale eventually. Obviously this isn't the actual ending for Miss Kuroitsu; the original manga is still ongoing and the episode makes it clear that the odd antics will continue (with several plot threads, such as this series has had them, still very much unresolved). But still, this season-ender plays at the idea of shifts in series like these, and the big climactic finishes that can come as a result of those setups. It is pretty much the exact kind of ending I could have asked for from this show.    One of the more clever elements of this finale is how they fully integrate the 'business' and 'super-villain' gimmicks for this one. Mergers and Acquisitions are an expected part of corporate business, but you've probably never seen a takeover quite this hostile! The story isn't even singularly oppositional to the idea of Agastia getting absorbed into Zet Arc at the beginning either; points are made about the benefit of resources they'd receive, something we know the Monster Development team has struggled with all season. Instead, the main contention comes down to the subject of attitude we've followed before: Agastia may be evil, but they try not to be jerks about it, while these Zet Arc guys are downright unpleasant. Every good business has principles they've got to stick by, and as we find out later in the episode, Zet Arc doesn't even have any respect for monsters or the fine craft behind them. Truly unforgivable.    This is all brisk setup in service of a big final battle that can bring together all the disparate players, hero or villain, from this series to unite against Zet Arc. Even as average-looking as Miss Kuroitsu has always been, the spectacle is still sold well enough this episode (and it looks a damn sight better than last week's), mostly on account of just how much is getting thrown on the screen. It's got that strong 'Everyone is here!' sense, with the magical girls, Black Lore, and eventually Blader himself jumping in not out of any aligned agendas, but simply because they're all in agreement about how much Zet Arc sucks.    There's an appreciation here for the motivational relationship between heroes and villains in toku-style shows among all the other elements that Miss Kuroitsu has lovingly embraced about the medium. Good or Evil, those sides are ostensibly both loved by the audience regardless because they're both essential to the entertainment. Apart from the main characters on display here, this final battle takes an extended period to montage across all the Local Heroes, and their accompanying villains, that the show has touched on across its run. It's a fine indulgence in a finale like this, coming off like a genuine tribute to the very institution of tokusatsu action this series is founded on. Those sorts of live local suit-action performances are often reliant on eliciting audience cheers throughout them, and you get the sense the creators of Miss Kuroitsu here were trying to get that sort of reaction even from the kids and adults watching along at home.    Not only does it succeed as a parade of real-life character cameos, but it relates back to its own story as well. Anybody who follows shows like this knows it's a big deal when a character gets their own new transformational toy, and who else but Miss Kuroitsu herself would obtain such a thing for the big finish here? It even ties in with the mechanics of the show, what with the power-up item is itself a 'monster' that we saw the Development Team working on earlier, and what else would we expect from a villainous group's final plan than an evil version of the hero they oppose? Maybe Kuroitsu donning the Black Blader suit herself wasn't the original idea, but any good toku show knows to just run with whims that occur thanks to production weirdness. And as intended, it comes off as a total fist-pump moment when she actually teams up with Blader here instead of fighting against him like they always have.    That overall celebratory metatext is what does it for me with this finale. The leader of Zet Arc decries the stylings of these monsters and heroes as 'inefficient' and belittles the smaller budgets they're forced to work with, but we know that those 'limitations' are a lot of what make tokusatsu what it is. Those outlandish costumes and overt posing for attacks may be 'inefficient', but it's also dang cool, and having to work within the limits of budget constraints necessitates a lot of creativity. ""Monster development has infinite possibilities"" is the wisdom Miss Kuroitsu works with, and to the end, this has been a scrappy little show that proves that. It's hardly perfect, but it 'gets it', and appeals to fandom appreciation in that very earnest way.

Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department Episode 12  by Christopher Farris, Apr  4th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department ?                     Community score: 4.3            ""Companies don't necessarily stay the same forever"" is the wisdom dispensed as Miss Kuroitsu and the Monster Development crew sit on the precipice of potential change here in this final episode of the show. Superhero stories like the ones this show riffs on are usually built on some sort of stock status quo, but everything needs to get upended in time for a finale eventually. Obviously this isn't the actual ending for Miss Kuroitsu; the original manga is still ongoing and the episode makes it clear that the odd antics will continue (with several plot threads, such as this series has had them, still very much unresolved). But still, this season-ender plays at the idea of shifts in series like these, and the big climactic finishes that can come as a result of those setups. It is pretty much the exact kind of ending I could have asked for from this show.    One of the more clever elements of this finale is how they fully integrate the 'business' and 'super-villain' gimmicks for this one. Mergers and Acquisitions are an expected part of corporate business, but you've probably never seen a takeover quite this hostile! The story isn't even singularly oppositional to the idea of Agastia getting absorbed into Zet Arc at the beginning either; points are made about the benefit of resources they'd receive, something we know the Monster Development team has struggled with all season. Instead, the main contention comes down to the subject of attitude we've followed before: Agastia may be evil, but they try not to be jerks about it, while these Zet Arc guys are downright unpleasant. Every good business has principles they've got to stick by, and as we find out later in the episode, Zet Arc doesn't even have any respect for monsters or the fine craft behind them. Truly unforgivable.    This is all brisk setup in service of a big final battle that can bring together all the disparate players, hero or villain, from this series to unite against Zet Arc. Even as average-looking as Miss Kuroitsu has always been, the spectacle is still sold well enough this episode (and it looks a damn sight better than last week's), mostly on account of just how much is getting thrown on the screen. It's got that strong 'Everyone is here!' sense, with the magical girls, Black Lore, and eventually Blader himself jumping in not out of any aligned agendas, but simply because they're all in agreement about how much Zet Arc sucks.    There's an appreciation here for the motivational relationship between heroes and villains in toku-style shows among all the other elements that Miss Kuroitsu has lovingly embraced about the medium. Good or Evil, those sides are ostensibly both loved by the audience regardless because they're both essential to the entertainment. Apart from the main characters on display here, this final battle takes an extended period to montage across all the Local Heroes, and their accompanying villains, that the show has touched on across its run. It's a fine indulgence in a finale like this, coming off like a genuine tribute to the very institution of tokusatsu action this series is founded on. Those sorts of live local suit-action performances are often reliant on eliciting audience cheers throughout them, and you get the sense the creators of Miss Kuroitsu here were trying to get that sort of reaction even from the kids and adults watching along at home.    Not only does it succeed as a parade of real-life character cameos, but it relates back to its own story as well. Anybody who follows shows like this knows it's a big deal when a character gets their own new transformational toy, and who else but Miss Kuroitsu herself would obtain such a thing for the big finish here? It even ties in with the mechanics of the show, what with the power-up item is itself a 'monster' that we saw the Development Team working on earlier, and what else would we expect from a villainous group's final plan than an evil version of the hero they oppose? Maybe Kuroitsu donning the Black Blader suit herself wasn't the original idea, but any good toku show knows to just run with whims that occur thanks to production weirdness. And as intended, it comes off as a total fist-pump moment when she actually teams up with Blader here instead of fighting against him like they always have.    That overall celebratory metatext is what does it for me with this finale. The leader of Zet Arc decries the stylings of these monsters and heroes as 'inefficient' and belittles the smaller budgets they're forced to work with, but we know that those 'limitations' are a lot of what make tokusatsu what it is. Those outlandish costumes and overt posing for attacks may be 'inefficient', but it's also dang cool, and having to work within the limits of budget constraints necessitates a lot of creativity. ""Monster development has infinite possibilities"" is the wisdom Miss Kuroitsu works with, and to the end, this has been a scrappy little show that proves that. It's hardly perfect, but it 'gets it', and appeals to fandom appreciation in that very earnest way.

Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department Episode 12  by Christopher Farris, Apr  4th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department ?                     Community score: 4.3            ""Companies don't necessarily stay the same forever"" is the wisdom dispensed as Miss Kuroitsu and the Monster Development crew sit on the precipice of potential change here in this final episode of the show. Superhero stories like the ones this show riffs on are usually built on some sort of stock status quo, but everything needs to get upended in time for a finale eventually. Obviously this isn't the actual ending for Miss Kuroitsu; the original manga is still ongoing and the episode makes it clear that the odd antics will continue (with several plot threads, such as this series has had them, still very much unresolved). But still, this season-ender plays at the idea of shifts in series like these, and the big climactic finishes that can come as a result of those setups. It is pretty much the exact kind of ending I could have asked for from this show.    One of the more clever elements of this finale is how they fully integrate the 'business' and 'super-villain' gimmicks for this one. Mergers and Acquisitions are an expected part of corporate business, but you've probably never seen a takeover quite this hostile! The story isn't even singularly oppositional to the idea of Agastia getting absorbed into Zet Arc at the beginning either; points are made about the benefit of resources they'd receive, something we know the Monster Development team has struggled with all season. Instead, the main contention comes down to the subject of attitude we've followed before: Agastia may be evil, but they try not to be jerks about it, while these Zet Arc guys are downright unpleasant. Every good business has principles they've got to stick by, and as we find out later in the episode, Zet Arc doesn't even have any respect for monsters or the fine craft behind them. Truly unforgivable.    This is all brisk setup in service of a big final battle that can bring together all the disparate players, hero or villain, from this series to unite against Zet Arc. Even as average-looking as Miss Kuroitsu has always been, the spectacle is still sold well enough this episode (and it looks a damn sight better than last week's), mostly on account of just how much is getting thrown on the screen. It's got that strong 'Everyone is here!' sense, with the magical girls, Black Lore, and eventually Blader himself jumping in not out of any aligned agendas, but simply because they're all in agreement about how much Zet Arc sucks.    There's an appreciation here for the motivational relationship between heroes and villains in toku-style shows among all the other elements that Miss Kuroitsu has lovingly embraced about the medium. Good or Evil, those sides are ostensibly both loved by the audience regardless because they're both essential to the entertainment. Apart from the main characters on display here, this final battle takes an extended period to montage across all the Local Heroes, and their accompanying villains, that the show has touched on across its run. It's a fine indulgence in a finale like this, coming off like a genuine tribute to the very institution of tokusatsu action this series is founded on. Those sorts of live local suit-action performances are often reliant on eliciting audience cheers throughout them, and you get the sense the creators of Miss Kuroitsu here were trying to get that sort of reaction even from the kids and adults watching along at home.    Not only does it succeed as a parade of real-life character cameos, but it relates back to its own story as well. Anybody who follows shows like this knows it's a big deal when a character gets their own new transformational toy, and who else but Miss Kuroitsu herself would obtain such a thing for the big finish here? It even ties in with the mechanics of the show, what with the power-up item is itself a 'monster' that we saw the Development Team working on earlier, and what else would we expect from a villainous group's final plan than an evil version of the hero they oppose? Maybe Kuroitsu donning the Black Blader suit herself wasn't the original idea, but any good toku show knows to just run with whims that occur thanks to production weirdness. And as intended, it comes off as a total fist-pump moment when she actually teams up with Blader here instead of fighting against him like they always have.    That overall celebratory metatext is what does it for me with this finale. The leader of Zet Arc decries the stylings of these monsters and heroes as 'inefficient' and belittles the smaller budgets they're forced to work with, but we know that those 'limitations' are a lot of what make tokusatsu what it is. Those outlandish costumes and overt posing for attacks may be 'inefficient', but it's also dang cool, and having to work within the limits of budget constraints necessitates a lot of creativity. ""Monster development has infinite possibilities"" is the wisdom Miss Kuroitsu works with, and to the end, this has been a scrappy little show that proves that. It's hardly perfect, but it 'gets it', and appeals to fandom appreciation in that very earnest way.
