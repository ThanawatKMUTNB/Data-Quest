News Kōkyū no Karasu Anime Unveils Cast, Staff, October Premiere   posted on 2022-04-14 21:25 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo          Saku Mizuno, Masaaki Mizunaka, Taku Yashiro, Marika Kōno star in BN Pictures anime    Aniplex unveiled the main cast, main staff, October premiere, and teaser visual for the television anime of Kōko Shirakawa's Kōkyū no Karasu (A Raven in the Harem) novel series on Thursday.       The main cast members are:     Saku Mizuno as Jusetsu Ryō  Masaaki Mizunaka as Kōshun Ka  Taku Yashiro as Eisei  Marika Kōno as Jiujiu   Chizuru Miyawaki (Gintama TV anime, Gintama: The Final) is directing the anime at BN Pictures, and Satomi Ooshima (Fortune Favors Lady Nikuko) is overseeing the series scripts. Shinji Takeuchi (Fairy Tail, Gintama) is adapting Ayuko's original character designs for animation. Asami Tachibana (DARLING in the FRANXX, Haikyu!!, Moriarty the Patriot) is composing the music.    The novels' story centers on Uki, an imperial concubine who has never been called to the emperor's bedchambers, and maintains a singularly unique life within the harem chambers. Seen by some as having the appearance of an old woman, and some others as a young lady, she is knowne to use mysterious magic that helps with everything from finding lost items to inflicting curses. When a circumstance makes the emperor call on her, their meeting will change history.    Shirakawa launched the novel series with illustrations by Ayuko (The Earl & the Fairy) in April 2018. The sixth novel volume shipped in August 2021. The seventh volume will ship on April 21. On the same day at 9:00 p.m. JST, Aniplex's YouTube channel will stream a teaser promotional video for the anime.

News Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero Film Rescheduled to June 11 After Toei Animation Hack   posted on 2022-04-14 15:06 UTC-8 by Egan Loo         Originally slated for April 22    Toei announced on Thursday that Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero, the second anime film in the Dragon Ball Super franchise, has been rescheduled for June 11. It had been delayed due to the Toei Animation hack last month. Toei added that the entire staff is putting all their effort into meeting the new release date.      The film was slated to open in Japan on April 22, and then was slated to open in North America this summer. (The CG film's release schedule may differ depending on each country and region.)    As the name suggests, the film will have a focus on the ""superhero"" aspect. Original creator Akira Toriyama is in charge of the screenplay and character design. Planning for the new film project began in 2018, before the release of Dragon Ball Super: Broly. The film has a goal of telling ""a large-scale story."" Aside from story composition and character design, Toriyama is also writing lines of dialogue for the film.    Tetsuro Kodama is directing the film, and Naoki Satō is composing the music. Nobuhito Sue is the art director, Chikashi Kubota is the animation director, and Jae Hoon Jung is the CG director.    Guest cast members include:    Hiroshi Kamiya as Gamma #1   Mamoru Miyano as Gamma #2   Miyu Irino as Dr. Hedo   Volcano Ōta as Magenta   Ryota Takeuchi as Carmine    The staff has previously revealed new character designs for Dende, Korin, and Bulma, and teased that Whis will appear in the film.    The film will be the 21st anime film in the overall Dragon Ball franchise.   Toei Animation announced on March 11 that on March 6, an unauthorized third party accessed the company's network, which resulted in a shutdown of part of the company's systems. Toei Animation is currently investigating the matter. The hack affected the broadcast schedules for the One Piece, Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai, Delicious Party Precure, and Digimon Ghost Game anime, starting with the episodes slated to air on the weekend of March 12-13. All four shows will resume airing new episodes during the April 16-17 weekend.    NHK reported on April 7 that according to its sources at Toei Animation, the  hack was a ransomware attack. NHK quoted a company source as saying, ""the impact on production is still continuing, and we are working hard to bring things back to normal.""

News Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero Film Rescheduled to June 11 After Toei Animation Hack   posted on 2022-04-14 15:06 UTC-8 by Egan Loo         Originally slated for April 22    Toei announced on Thursday that Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero, the second anime film in the Dragon Ball Super franchise, has been rescheduled for June 11. It had been delayed due to the Toei Animation hack last month. Toei added that the entire staff is putting all their effort into meeting the new release date.      The film was slated to open in Japan on April 22, and then was slated to open in North America this summer. (The CG film's release schedule may differ depending on each country and region.)    As the name suggests, the film will have a focus on the ""superhero"" aspect. Original creator Akira Toriyama is in charge of the screenplay and character design. Planning for the new film project began in 2018, before the release of Dragon Ball Super: Broly. The film has a goal of telling ""a large-scale story."" Aside from story composition and character design, Toriyama is also writing lines of dialogue for the film.    Tetsuro Kodama is directing the film, and Naoki Satō is composing the music. Nobuhito Sue is the art director, Chikashi Kubota is the animation director, and Jae Hoon Jung is the CG director.    Guest cast members include:    Hiroshi Kamiya as Gamma #1   Mamoru Miyano as Gamma #2   Miyu Irino as Dr. Hedo   Volcano Ōta as Magenta   Ryota Takeuchi as Carmine    The staff has previously revealed new character designs for Dende, Korin, and Bulma, and teased that Whis will appear in the film.    The film will be the 21st anime film in the overall Dragon Ball franchise.   Toei Animation announced on March 11 that on March 6, an unauthorized third party accessed the company's network, which resulted in a shutdown of part of the company's systems. Toei Animation is currently investigating the matter. The hack affected the broadcast schedules for the One Piece, Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai, Delicious Party Precure, and Digimon Ghost Game anime, starting with the episodes slated to air on the weekend of March 12-13. All four shows will resume airing new episodes during the April 16-17 weekend.    NHK reported on April 7 that according to its sources at Toei Animation, the  hack was a ransomware attack. NHK quoted a company source as saying, ""the impact on production is still continuing, and we are working hard to bring things back to normal.""
