Manga Artist Donates Film Rights Fee to Marriage For All Japan   posted on 2022-04-15 05:45 UTC-8 by Kim Morrissy         Live-action film based on Yū Toyota's boys-love manga opened last Friday    Cherry Magic! Thirty Years of Virginity Can Make You a Wizard?! (30-sai Dōtei da to Mahō Tsukai ni Nareru Rashii) manga creator Yū Toyota announced on her Twitter account last Wednesday that she has donated part of the film/adaptation rights fee to Marriage For All Japan, an organization which advocates same-sex marriage in Japan.    ""I hope that our society can become a place where people can love each other in the form they desire regardless of gender,"" she wrote.    CheriMaho the Movie ~30-sai Dōtei da to Mahō Tsukai ni Nareru Rashii~ (Cherry Magic! the Movie: Thirty Years of Virginity Can Make You a Wizard?!), the film sequel to the live-action television series based on Toyota's manga opened in Japan last Friday.    Square Enix Manga & Books licensed the manga, and it describes the story:  Adachi, a thirty-year-old virgin, has developed the power to read people's minds by touching them. After a brush with his very handsome colleague, Adachi realizes he has a raging crush on none other than Adachi himself!  The manga began serialization on pixiv's Gangan pixiv service in 2018, and the manga's eighth compiled book volume shipped in Japan on October 21. Square Enix Manga released the second volume on September 8, and it is the first boys-love manga that the company has published in English.    The television series premiered on TV Tokyo on October 9, 2020, and it also streamed on the Tsutaya Premium service. Crunchyroll began streaming the series outside Japan in December 2020. The television series already inspired a two-episode net spinoff that debuted on the Tsutaya Premium streaming service on December 2020.

(30-sai Dōtei da to Mahō Tsukai ni Nareru Rashii) manga creator Yū Toyota announced on her Twitter account last Wednesday that she has donated part of the film/adaptation rights fee to Marriage For All Japan, an organization which advocates same-sex marriage in Japan.

Square Enix Manga & Books licensed the manga, and it describes the story:  Adachi, a thirty-year-old virgin, has developed the power to read people's minds by touching them. After a brush with his very handsome colleague, Adachi realizes he has a raging crush on none other than Adachi himself!  The manga began serialization on pixiv's Gangan pixiv service in 2018, and the manga's eighth compiled book volume shipped in Japan on October 21.

The television series premiered on TV Tokyo on October 9, 2020, and it also streamed on the Tsutaya Premium service. Crunchyroll began streaming the series outside Japan in December 2020.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story-   Apr  6th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story- ?                     Community score: 3.8              What is this?   A youth story centering on two young women golfers named Eve and Aoi Amawashi. The two come from completely different backgrounds, with completely opposite play styles, and together they will shake the world of golf.    Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story- is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    Cailtin Moore  Rating:                People who have been reading my preview guide entries (and maybe premiere reviews for other sites before that) over the last few years are well familiar with how I've been opining that the lack of serious girls' sports anime is a travesty. Most of them are moe-fests about the power of friendship that aim to portray cuteness over athleticism, or jiggly fanservice delivery devices. I wanted the equivalent of Haikyu!! or Run with the Wind: stories that portray the characters as serious competitors, scrappy underdogs scraping by through hard training and camaraderie. That's what I thought I wanted.    But now that I've seen Birdie Wing, I've seen the light. I didn't need a serious story about overcoming the odds and rising through the ranks. I needed a shonen story full of hotblooded rivalry and ridiculously over-the-top superpowered moves, but minus the obsession with bouncing tits. What I needed… was Birdie Wing.    Oh, I was skeptical at first. Like many others who grew up before everyone had their own personal devices, I was tormented by my dad hogging the TV all day on weekends to watch his excruciatingly boring gold matches. I could not have cared less who Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods, or Vijay Singh were, but I learned nonetheless. I thought the trailer for Birdie Wing looked good and the character designs were appealing, but I wasn't sure if that could cut through the trauma of all those weekend afternoons I was forced to read instead of watch syndicated sitcoms.    By the time the ending credits rolled, I was more than ready to take back my misgivings. I wasn't sure how I felt about what I had just watched, but it certainly wasn't boring. And as I processed it, I finally arrived at how I felt: I loved it. It's not particularly well-animated or coherent, but it's wildly off-the-wall in the best possible way, constantly throwing things at the wall to see what sticks without rhyme or reason, and it is incredibly fun. Playing basically the world's most intense game of mini-golf but with actual trains instead of the archetypical windmill and your opponent is a clown mask? Sure. Hitting a tree branch in your way so hard it breaks without the ball completely losing its velocity? Why not! And don't forget the insert song full of black-and-white images of the protagonist Eve posing angstily against graffitied walls in slums that do nothing to advance the story.    It's so much. So much what, you ask? Just… so much. It's stuffed to the gills with the kind of anime bullshit that draw people to the medium, gleefully weird and energetic. It's not going to be a hole in one for everyone, but if you're looking for something that's not just par for the course, this is worth taking a look at.        James Beckett  Rating:               Birdie Wing is a sports anime that dares to break eons of tradition and ask the question that everyone has been to afraid to utter: “What if golf…was actually really cool?” That isn't to imply that golf isn't fun, or interesting, or a worthwhile athletic challenge; of all the less prolific sports for an anime to cover, I'm actually pretty happy to see one that's about golf at all. But I don't think even the hardest of the hardcore devotees of 18-Hole Pilgrimage would ever be shocked to hear me say that golf usually isn't considered one of the “cool” sports. For many folks, golf resides firmly within the realm of middle-aged white men donned in khaki shorts and matching visors who are probably just using a trip out to the greens as an excuse to get day drunk with all of their recently divorced friends.    Birdie Wing, instead, gives us a world of golf where the rich geezers are outnumbered by flashy anime gals and mysterious clown women that all treat golf as nothing less than existential blood sport. This cartoon's version of America is a dichotomy of disparity, where the most desperate and destitute live in the shadow of the wealthy elite (so…basically the exact same thing as the real America, come to think of it). Our scrappy heroine Eve is the equivalent of a jaded ronin for hire, except her katana is a golf club, and instead of bathing in the blood of her enemies, she revels in the meager riches she can accrue for her gal pals and the orphans they're helping to raise. Eve looks like a the frontwoman of a punk band and wields borderline supernatural skills on the links, and her companion Lily is all too happy to patiently explain to their opponents all of the ways in which they are viscerally screwed. Lily also loves Gunpla, which naturally makes here almost as cool as Eve.    Is this an utterly ridiculous premise for a golf anime to tackle? Yes, but damn it, that's what makes it cool. It's like when Calvin and Hobbes put on those dark shades and just stood around, doing nothing. The best sports shows are the ones that take the everyday thrills of athletic achievement and gild them in a shiny layer of Glorious Anime Bullshit, without so much as an ounce of shame. Y'all can keep your “Cute Girls Gently Sharing Common Hobbies,” I'd like to order a double serving of “Vagrant Women Engaging in Spiritual Combat with Suggestive Sports Metaphors,” and pile on the extra cheese if you please.    My only complaint about Birdie Wing is that its modest productions values and flat direction don't always do the funny premise and genuinely likeable characters justice. This is the kind of series that only becomes funnier the more ironically impressive it looks, and some more sakuga would go a long way towards bringing the whole experience together. Still, Birdie Wing is an awful lot of fun, and I'm excited to see where these golf girls go in future episodes.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               I have to hand it to Birdie Wing – it has managed to make one of the most stultifying sports to watch interesting. That's due to a combination of some very nice animation and shot framing and a premise that I can get behind, which is one that stands to challenge the exclusivity of what can be a very snooty sport. (At least in my experience; it's kind of a summer person sport where I'm from.) For Eve and her sister Lily, golf isn't just about winning prestigious tournaments, it's about having money to keep their found family together, because they're all living what appears to be a very precarious life in the slums, and while the oldest sister does her best, it's leveraging Eve's golf skills that keeps body and soul together – or at least that's the implication.    That's something that the episode does a remarkable job of showing us without any clunky exposition. We see a corrupt cop shaking down the family for protection money, we see that Eve's earnings go directly to food, and we see that Eve only plays with three clubs, instead of the vast array that other players have in their bags. When Eve is filling in for an injured player, her caddy is surprised to see her choose what she deems inappropriate clubs for a shot; later we realize that Eve's using the only clubs she's used to playing with – the others just aren't comfortable for her because she's not had the opportunity to use them very often, if ever. When Helene, a girl her age who plays in tournaments, notes that Eve only has the three clubs, it drives home the point without ever explicitly saying, “She's poor and these clubs are all she can afford.”    The episode also takes its time to establish Eve and Lily as characters before bringing us into the fateful meeting that stands to shape Eve's future. It's not until the end of the episode that Eve and Aoi, her probable rival/friend, even meet. We see just enough of Aoi to get the impression that she's intensely competitive and living in a totally different world than Eve – again, through context clues rather than being flat-out told – and it isn't until she approaches Eve that we start to get an idea of how they'll affect each other. Aoi calls golf “sacred;” Eve says that she only plays for money, which is something that Eve can't possibly understand. While I don't give a damn about golf, seeing where this relationship goes looks like it'll be worth putting up with the spectacularly cheesy background music. Both Eve and Aoi have things that could benefit each other. How they'll develop should be worth watching.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               I think golf is pretty much the most boring sport in the world to watch. But as I've said before, sports anime live or die on their characters—the sport itself is nothing more than a catalyst for the show's interpersonal drama. And let me tell you, Birdie Wing has learned this lesson well. Instead of being set around a high school sports team or being about a newbie learning the sport for the first time, Birdie Wing follows Eve, a golf hustler who makes her money by winning underground matches against rich amateurs and moonlighting on the pro-circuit in disguise.    Honestly, it's a welcome change of pace—especially as Eve is a highly sympathetic character. Living in the slums, making money to keep a room over the head of orphans, it's impossible not to root for her as she pockets the money of the rich despite owning only three clubs herself. She's basically the Robin Hood of golf. It also helps that while Eve is no doubt talented, much of her skill comes from countless hours of hard work—despite rarely getting to play on anything as nice as an actual course. It looks like watching her rise to stardom will be a cathartic experience to say the least.    On the visual side of things, the anime looks great. From the shots of the dirty slums and vibrant golf courses to the surreal animation of Eve's Prince of Tennis-style special moves, everything is clear and detailed. (And did anyone else notice that Eve and Aoi look a lot like the transformation scene versions of Panty and Stocking? No? Just me? Okay.) Then we have the music. From surprise Eurobeat to a heartfelt ballad, it was fantastic throughout. It's a score I'd expect in an idol anime, not a sports one.    All in all, it's safe to say that Birdie Wing caught me completely off guard. It is easily the best sport anime we've seen so far this season and with its Megalobox meets Carole & Tuesday vibes, I am 100% here for it.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Let me say up top that you're best off going into this show with as little foreknowledge as possible. If you're at all curious about this series, or were planning to check it out if the reviews were good, or just have 30 minutes to kill, do yourself a favor: go in blind and let this premiere wash over you. That's what I did, and I'm confident saying that's the best way to experience whatever the hell Birdie Wing is doing.    Really, going into this with just a short preview and a key image, I was fully expecting a standard sports anime. Sure there was the novelty of it being a rather rare girls' sports show, but I've been here before. I knew what I was getting into. Then 90 seconds in our heroine peeled off a Lupin-style rubber mask to reveal she was a secret underground golfer who makes her living betting on games against pros and occasionally impersonating other golfers to help them place in tournaments. Then I learned she does all this to support her found family of undocumented immigrants who run a dive bar and take care of three orphaned children. THEN she went off to play a midnight, high-stakes golf match against a woman in a clown mask on a golf course built on top of active train tracks. And right about there I realized I had no clue where this show was going, but I needed to find out.    It's the kind a pure-hearted anime bullshit that gets talked about a lot, but only occasionally pops up for real, and I ate it right up. Every couple of minutes this premiere found some new idea or element to blindside me with, and it pulled me through the entire episode in record time. A moody music video interlude of Eve looking solemnly over the slums of her home town? Osamu Dezaki-esque postcard memories to punctuate our heroine's cool lines about golf? Her rival striking an Obari Pose before showing off her absurdly long driver that powers he own cartoony style of golf? All of that and far more, to the point where it legitimately started to feel like this wasn't a real show, but an elaborate prank laser targeted at me and my online friend circle.    The only real hangup is that I don't know how long this show can keep that kind of energy up. It's already showing some strains in its production, and while the golf sections are conceptually creative, they struggle to deliver that energy in motion. Sk8 the Infinity, this show's closest cousin, managed its bawdy mix of skateboarding and pro-wrestling with fantastic visuals and pulse-pounding races, and I don't think this series has that in its cards. This could all very well fall apart in a few episodes once it runs out of ideas or the drawings start melting, and that would be a huge bummer.    But those are problems for Future Nick to worry about. In the here and now, this was an absolute blast to watch from start to finish. God knows I never expected to say that about a golf anime. If you were coming here looking for a serious and down-to-earth girls' sports show, I'm sorry. There's nothing for you here. But if you're at all intrigued by this nonsense I've been rambling out, give it a shot.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review                Odd Taxi: In the Woods   Apr 17, 00:00                 anime    By cleverly reframing its narrative around a series of interviews with the supporting cast, Odd Taxi: In the Woods succeeds where most recap films fail: it's an artistically cohesive film in its own right. ― Odd Taxi was 2021's sleeper anime hit, telling an intricate, original mystery that kept viewers guessing every week.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story-   Apr  6th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story- ?                     Community score: 3.8              What is this?   A youth story centering on two young women golfers named Eve and Aoi Amawashi. The two come from completely different backgrounds, with completely opposite play styles, and together they will shake the world of golf.    Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story- is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    Cailtin Moore  Rating:                People who have been reading my preview guide entries (and maybe premiere reviews for other sites before that) over the last few years are well familiar with how I've been opining that the lack of serious girls' sports anime is a travesty. Most of them are moe-fests about the power of friendship that aim to portray cuteness over athleticism, or jiggly fanservice delivery devices. I wanted the equivalent of Haikyu!! or Run with the Wind: stories that portray the characters as serious competitors, scrappy underdogs scraping by through hard training and camaraderie. That's what I thought I wanted.    But now that I've seen Birdie Wing, I've seen the light. I didn't need a serious story about overcoming the odds and rising through the ranks. I needed a shonen story full of hotblooded rivalry and ridiculously over-the-top superpowered moves, but minus the obsession with bouncing tits. What I needed… was Birdie Wing.    Oh, I was skeptical at first. Like many others who grew up before everyone had their own personal devices, I was tormented by my dad hogging the TV all day on weekends to watch his excruciatingly boring gold matches. I could not have cared less who Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods, or Vijay Singh were, but I learned nonetheless. I thought the trailer for Birdie Wing looked good and the character designs were appealing, but I wasn't sure if that could cut through the trauma of all those weekend afternoons I was forced to read instead of watch syndicated sitcoms.    By the time the ending credits rolled, I was more than ready to take back my misgivings. I wasn't sure how I felt about what I had just watched, but it certainly wasn't boring. And as I processed it, I finally arrived at how I felt: I loved it. It's not particularly well-animated or coherent, but it's wildly off-the-wall in the best possible way, constantly throwing things at the wall to see what sticks without rhyme or reason, and it is incredibly fun. Playing basically the world's most intense game of mini-golf but with actual trains instead of the archetypical windmill and your opponent is a clown mask? Sure. Hitting a tree branch in your way so hard it breaks without the ball completely losing its velocity? Why not! And don't forget the insert song full of black-and-white images of the protagonist Eve posing angstily against graffitied walls in slums that do nothing to advance the story.    It's so much. So much what, you ask? Just… so much. It's stuffed to the gills with the kind of anime bullshit that draw people to the medium, gleefully weird and energetic. It's not going to be a hole in one for everyone, but if you're looking for something that's not just par for the course, this is worth taking a look at.        James Beckett  Rating:               Birdie Wing is a sports anime that dares to break eons of tradition and ask the question that everyone has been to afraid to utter: “What if golf…was actually really cool?” That isn't to imply that golf isn't fun, or interesting, or a worthwhile athletic challenge; of all the less prolific sports for an anime to cover, I'm actually pretty happy to see one that's about golf at all. But I don't think even the hardest of the hardcore devotees of 18-Hole Pilgrimage would ever be shocked to hear me say that golf usually isn't considered one of the “cool” sports. For many folks, golf resides firmly within the realm of middle-aged white men donned in khaki shorts and matching visors who are probably just using a trip out to the greens as an excuse to get day drunk with all of their recently divorced friends.    Birdie Wing, instead, gives us a world of golf where the rich geezers are outnumbered by flashy anime gals and mysterious clown women that all treat golf as nothing less than existential blood sport. This cartoon's version of America is a dichotomy of disparity, where the most desperate and destitute live in the shadow of the wealthy elite (so…basically the exact same thing as the real America, come to think of it). Our scrappy heroine Eve is the equivalent of a jaded ronin for hire, except her katana is a golf club, and instead of bathing in the blood of her enemies, she revels in the meager riches she can accrue for her gal pals and the orphans they're helping to raise. Eve looks like a the frontwoman of a punk band and wields borderline supernatural skills on the links, and her companion Lily is all too happy to patiently explain to their opponents all of the ways in which they are viscerally screwed. Lily also loves Gunpla, which naturally makes here almost as cool as Eve.    Is this an utterly ridiculous premise for a golf anime to tackle? Yes, but damn it, that's what makes it cool. It's like when Calvin and Hobbes put on those dark shades and just stood around, doing nothing. The best sports shows are the ones that take the everyday thrills of athletic achievement and gild them in a shiny layer of Glorious Anime Bullshit, without so much as an ounce of shame. Y'all can keep your “Cute Girls Gently Sharing Common Hobbies,” I'd like to order a double serving of “Vagrant Women Engaging in Spiritual Combat with Suggestive Sports Metaphors,” and pile on the extra cheese if you please.    My only complaint about Birdie Wing is that its modest productions values and flat direction don't always do the funny premise and genuinely likeable characters justice. This is the kind of series that only becomes funnier the more ironically impressive it looks, and some more sakuga would go a long way towards bringing the whole experience together. Still, Birdie Wing is an awful lot of fun, and I'm excited to see where these golf girls go in future episodes.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               I have to hand it to Birdie Wing – it has managed to make one of the most stultifying sports to watch interesting. That's due to a combination of some very nice animation and shot framing and a premise that I can get behind, which is one that stands to challenge the exclusivity of what can be a very snooty sport. (At least in my experience; it's kind of a summer person sport where I'm from.) For Eve and her sister Lily, golf isn't just about winning prestigious tournaments, it's about having money to keep their found family together, because they're all living what appears to be a very precarious life in the slums, and while the oldest sister does her best, it's leveraging Eve's golf skills that keeps body and soul together – or at least that's the implication.    That's something that the episode does a remarkable job of showing us without any clunky exposition. We see a corrupt cop shaking down the family for protection money, we see that Eve's earnings go directly to food, and we see that Eve only plays with three clubs, instead of the vast array that other players have in their bags. When Eve is filling in for an injured player, her caddy is surprised to see her choose what she deems inappropriate clubs for a shot; later we realize that Eve's using the only clubs she's used to playing with – the others just aren't comfortable for her because she's not had the opportunity to use them very often, if ever. When Helene, a girl her age who plays in tournaments, notes that Eve only has the three clubs, it drives home the point without ever explicitly saying, “She's poor and these clubs are all she can afford.”    The episode also takes its time to establish Eve and Lily as characters before bringing us into the fateful meeting that stands to shape Eve's future. It's not until the end of the episode that Eve and Aoi, her probable rival/friend, even meet. We see just enough of Aoi to get the impression that she's intensely competitive and living in a totally different world than Eve – again, through context clues rather than being flat-out told – and it isn't until she approaches Eve that we start to get an idea of how they'll affect each other. Aoi calls golf “sacred;” Eve says that she only plays for money, which is something that Eve can't possibly understand. While I don't give a damn about golf, seeing where this relationship goes looks like it'll be worth putting up with the spectacularly cheesy background music. Both Eve and Aoi have things that could benefit each other. How they'll develop should be worth watching.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               I think golf is pretty much the most boring sport in the world to watch. But as I've said before, sports anime live or die on their characters—the sport itself is nothing more than a catalyst for the show's interpersonal drama. And let me tell you, Birdie Wing has learned this lesson well. Instead of being set around a high school sports team or being about a newbie learning the sport for the first time, Birdie Wing follows Eve, a golf hustler who makes her money by winning underground matches against rich amateurs and moonlighting on the pro-circuit in disguise.    Honestly, it's a welcome change of pace—especially as Eve is a highly sympathetic character. Living in the slums, making money to keep a room over the head of orphans, it's impossible not to root for her as she pockets the money of the rich despite owning only three clubs herself. She's basically the Robin Hood of golf. It also helps that while Eve is no doubt talented, much of her skill comes from countless hours of hard work—despite rarely getting to play on anything as nice as an actual course. It looks like watching her rise to stardom will be a cathartic experience to say the least.    On the visual side of things, the anime looks great. From the shots of the dirty slums and vibrant golf courses to the surreal animation of Eve's Prince of Tennis-style special moves, everything is clear and detailed. (And did anyone else notice that Eve and Aoi look a lot like the transformation scene versions of Panty and Stocking? No? Just me? Okay.) Then we have the music. From surprise Eurobeat to a heartfelt ballad, it was fantastic throughout. It's a score I'd expect in an idol anime, not a sports one.    All in all, it's safe to say that Birdie Wing caught me completely off guard. It is easily the best sport anime we've seen so far this season and with its Megalobox meets Carole & Tuesday vibes, I am 100% here for it.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Let me say up top that you're best off going into this show with as little foreknowledge as possible. If you're at all curious about this series, or were planning to check it out if the reviews were good, or just have 30 minutes to kill, do yourself a favor: go in blind and let this premiere wash over you. That's what I did, and I'm confident saying that's the best way to experience whatever the hell Birdie Wing is doing.    Really, going into this with just a short preview and a key image, I was fully expecting a standard sports anime. Sure there was the novelty of it being a rather rare girls' sports show, but I've been here before. I knew what I was getting into. Then 90 seconds in our heroine peeled off a Lupin-style rubber mask to reveal she was a secret underground golfer who makes her living betting on games against pros and occasionally impersonating other golfers to help them place in tournaments. Then I learned she does all this to support her found family of undocumented immigrants who run a dive bar and take care of three orphaned children. THEN she went off to play a midnight, high-stakes golf match against a woman in a clown mask on a golf course built on top of active train tracks. And right about there I realized I had no clue where this show was going, but I needed to find out.    It's the kind a pure-hearted anime bullshit that gets talked about a lot, but only occasionally pops up for real, and I ate it right up. Every couple of minutes this premiere found some new idea or element to blindside me with, and it pulled me through the entire episode in record time. A moody music video interlude of Eve looking solemnly over the slums of her home town? Osamu Dezaki-esque postcard memories to punctuate our heroine's cool lines about golf? Her rival striking an Obari Pose before showing off her absurdly long driver that powers he own cartoony style of golf? All of that and far more, to the point where it legitimately started to feel like this wasn't a real show, but an elaborate prank laser targeted at me and my online friend circle.    The only real hangup is that I don't know how long this show can keep that kind of energy up. It's already showing some strains in its production, and while the golf sections are conceptually creative, they struggle to deliver that energy in motion. Sk8 the Infinity, this show's closest cousin, managed its bawdy mix of skateboarding and pro-wrestling with fantastic visuals and pulse-pounding races, and I don't think this series has that in its cards. This could all very well fall apart in a few episodes once it runs out of ideas or the drawings start melting, and that would be a huge bummer.    But those are problems for Future Nick to worry about. In the here and now, this was an absolute blast to watch from start to finish. God knows I never expected to say that about a golf anime. If you were coming here looking for a serious and down-to-earth girls' sports show, I'm sorry. There's nothing for you here. But if you're at all intrigued by this nonsense I've been rambling out, give it a shot.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review                Odd Taxi: In the Woods   Apr 17, 00:00                 anime    By cleverly reframing its narrative around a series of interviews with the supporting cast, Odd Taxi: In the Woods succeeds where most recap films fail: it's an artistically cohesive film in its own right. ― Odd Taxi was 2021's sleeper anime hit, telling an intricate, original mystery that kept viewers guessing every week.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story-   Apr  6th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story- ?                     Community score: 3.8              What is this?   A youth story centering on two young women golfers named Eve and Aoi Amawashi. The two come from completely different backgrounds, with completely opposite play styles, and together they will shake the world of golf.    Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story- is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    Cailtin Moore  Rating:                People who have been reading my preview guide entries (and maybe premiere reviews for other sites before that) over the last few years are well familiar with how I've been opining that the lack of serious girls' sports anime is a travesty. Most of them are moe-fests about the power of friendship that aim to portray cuteness over athleticism, or jiggly fanservice delivery devices. I wanted the equivalent of Haikyu!! or Run with the Wind: stories that portray the characters as serious competitors, scrappy underdogs scraping by through hard training and camaraderie. That's what I thought I wanted.    But now that I've seen Birdie Wing, I've seen the light. I didn't need a serious story about overcoming the odds and rising through the ranks. I needed a shonen story full of hotblooded rivalry and ridiculously over-the-top superpowered moves, but minus the obsession with bouncing tits. What I needed… was Birdie Wing.    Oh, I was skeptical at first. Like many others who grew up before everyone had their own personal devices, I was tormented by my dad hogging the TV all day on weekends to watch his excruciatingly boring gold matches. I could not have cared less who Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods, or Vijay Singh were, but I learned nonetheless. I thought the trailer for Birdie Wing looked good and the character designs were appealing, but I wasn't sure if that could cut through the trauma of all those weekend afternoons I was forced to read instead of watch syndicated sitcoms.    By the time the ending credits rolled, I was more than ready to take back my misgivings. I wasn't sure how I felt about what I had just watched, but it certainly wasn't boring. And as I processed it, I finally arrived at how I felt: I loved it. It's not particularly well-animated or coherent, but it's wildly off-the-wall in the best possible way, constantly throwing things at the wall to see what sticks without rhyme or reason, and it is incredibly fun. Playing basically the world's most intense game of mini-golf but with actual trains instead of the archetypical windmill and your opponent is a clown mask? Sure. Hitting a tree branch in your way so hard it breaks without the ball completely losing its velocity? Why not! And don't forget the insert song full of black-and-white images of the protagonist Eve posing angstily against graffitied walls in slums that do nothing to advance the story.    It's so much. So much what, you ask? Just… so much. It's stuffed to the gills with the kind of anime bullshit that draw people to the medium, gleefully weird and energetic. It's not going to be a hole in one for everyone, but if you're looking for something that's not just par for the course, this is worth taking a look at.        James Beckett  Rating:               Birdie Wing is a sports anime that dares to break eons of tradition and ask the question that everyone has been to afraid to utter: “What if golf…was actually really cool?” That isn't to imply that golf isn't fun, or interesting, or a worthwhile athletic challenge; of all the less prolific sports for an anime to cover, I'm actually pretty happy to see one that's about golf at all. But I don't think even the hardest of the hardcore devotees of 18-Hole Pilgrimage would ever be shocked to hear me say that golf usually isn't considered one of the “cool” sports. For many folks, golf resides firmly within the realm of middle-aged white men donned in khaki shorts and matching visors who are probably just using a trip out to the greens as an excuse to get day drunk with all of their recently divorced friends.    Birdie Wing, instead, gives us a world of golf where the rich geezers are outnumbered by flashy anime gals and mysterious clown women that all treat golf as nothing less than existential blood sport. This cartoon's version of America is a dichotomy of disparity, where the most desperate and destitute live in the shadow of the wealthy elite (so…basically the exact same thing as the real America, come to think of it). Our scrappy heroine Eve is the equivalent of a jaded ronin for hire, except her katana is a golf club, and instead of bathing in the blood of her enemies, she revels in the meager riches she can accrue for her gal pals and the orphans they're helping to raise. Eve looks like a the frontwoman of a punk band and wields borderline supernatural skills on the links, and her companion Lily is all too happy to patiently explain to their opponents all of the ways in which they are viscerally screwed. Lily also loves Gunpla, which naturally makes here almost as cool as Eve.    Is this an utterly ridiculous premise for a golf anime to tackle? Yes, but damn it, that's what makes it cool. It's like when Calvin and Hobbes put on those dark shades and just stood around, doing nothing. The best sports shows are the ones that take the everyday thrills of athletic achievement and gild them in a shiny layer of Glorious Anime Bullshit, without so much as an ounce of shame. Y'all can keep your “Cute Girls Gently Sharing Common Hobbies,” I'd like to order a double serving of “Vagrant Women Engaging in Spiritual Combat with Suggestive Sports Metaphors,” and pile on the extra cheese if you please.    My only complaint about Birdie Wing is that its modest productions values and flat direction don't always do the funny premise and genuinely likeable characters justice. This is the kind of series that only becomes funnier the more ironically impressive it looks, and some more sakuga would go a long way towards bringing the whole experience together. Still, Birdie Wing is an awful lot of fun, and I'm excited to see where these golf girls go in future episodes.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               I have to hand it to Birdie Wing – it has managed to make one of the most stultifying sports to watch interesting. That's due to a combination of some very nice animation and shot framing and a premise that I can get behind, which is one that stands to challenge the exclusivity of what can be a very snooty sport. (At least in my experience; it's kind of a summer person sport where I'm from.) For Eve and her sister Lily, golf isn't just about winning prestigious tournaments, it's about having money to keep their found family together, because they're all living what appears to be a very precarious life in the slums, and while the oldest sister does her best, it's leveraging Eve's golf skills that keeps body and soul together – or at least that's the implication.    That's something that the episode does a remarkable job of showing us without any clunky exposition. We see a corrupt cop shaking down the family for protection money, we see that Eve's earnings go directly to food, and we see that Eve only plays with three clubs, instead of the vast array that other players have in their bags. When Eve is filling in for an injured player, her caddy is surprised to see her choose what she deems inappropriate clubs for a shot; later we realize that Eve's using the only clubs she's used to playing with – the others just aren't comfortable for her because she's not had the opportunity to use them very often, if ever. When Helene, a girl her age who plays in tournaments, notes that Eve only has the three clubs, it drives home the point without ever explicitly saying, “She's poor and these clubs are all she can afford.”    The episode also takes its time to establish Eve and Lily as characters before bringing us into the fateful meeting that stands to shape Eve's future. It's not until the end of the episode that Eve and Aoi, her probable rival/friend, even meet. We see just enough of Aoi to get the impression that she's intensely competitive and living in a totally different world than Eve – again, through context clues rather than being flat-out told – and it isn't until she approaches Eve that we start to get an idea of how they'll affect each other. Aoi calls golf “sacred;” Eve says that she only plays for money, which is something that Eve can't possibly understand. While I don't give a damn about golf, seeing where this relationship goes looks like it'll be worth putting up with the spectacularly cheesy background music. Both Eve and Aoi have things that could benefit each other. How they'll develop should be worth watching.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               I think golf is pretty much the most boring sport in the world to watch. But as I've said before, sports anime live or die on their characters—the sport itself is nothing more than a catalyst for the show's interpersonal drama. And let me tell you, Birdie Wing has learned this lesson well. Instead of being set around a high school sports team or being about a newbie learning the sport for the first time, Birdie Wing follows Eve, a golf hustler who makes her money by winning underground matches against rich amateurs and moonlighting on the pro-circuit in disguise.    Honestly, it's a welcome change of pace—especially as Eve is a highly sympathetic character. Living in the slums, making money to keep a room over the head of orphans, it's impossible not to root for her as she pockets the money of the rich despite owning only three clubs herself. She's basically the Robin Hood of golf. It also helps that while Eve is no doubt talented, much of her skill comes from countless hours of hard work—despite rarely getting to play on anything as nice as an actual course. It looks like watching her rise to stardom will be a cathartic experience to say the least.    On the visual side of things, the anime looks great. From the shots of the dirty slums and vibrant golf courses to the surreal animation of Eve's Prince of Tennis-style special moves, everything is clear and detailed. (And did anyone else notice that Eve and Aoi look a lot like the transformation scene versions of Panty and Stocking? No? Just me? Okay.) Then we have the music. From surprise Eurobeat to a heartfelt ballad, it was fantastic throughout. It's a score I'd expect in an idol anime, not a sports one.    All in all, it's safe to say that Birdie Wing caught me completely off guard. It is easily the best sport anime we've seen so far this season and with its Megalobox meets Carole & Tuesday vibes, I am 100% here for it.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Let me say up top that you're best off going into this show with as little foreknowledge as possible. If you're at all curious about this series, or were planning to check it out if the reviews were good, or just have 30 minutes to kill, do yourself a favor: go in blind and let this premiere wash over you. That's what I did, and I'm confident saying that's the best way to experience whatever the hell Birdie Wing is doing.    Really, going into this with just a short preview and a key image, I was fully expecting a standard sports anime. Sure there was the novelty of it being a rather rare girls' sports show, but I've been here before. I knew what I was getting into. Then 90 seconds in our heroine peeled off a Lupin-style rubber mask to reveal she was a secret underground golfer who makes her living betting on games against pros and occasionally impersonating other golfers to help them place in tournaments. Then I learned she does all this to support her found family of undocumented immigrants who run a dive bar and take care of three orphaned children. THEN she went off to play a midnight, high-stakes golf match against a woman in a clown mask on a golf course built on top of active train tracks. And right about there I realized I had no clue where this show was going, but I needed to find out.    It's the kind a pure-hearted anime bullshit that gets talked about a lot, but only occasionally pops up for real, and I ate it right up. Every couple of minutes this premiere found some new idea or element to blindside me with, and it pulled me through the entire episode in record time. A moody music video interlude of Eve looking solemnly over the slums of her home town? Osamu Dezaki-esque postcard memories to punctuate our heroine's cool lines about golf? Her rival striking an Obari Pose before showing off her absurdly long driver that powers he own cartoony style of golf? All of that and far more, to the point where it legitimately started to feel like this wasn't a real show, but an elaborate prank laser targeted at me and my online friend circle.    The only real hangup is that I don't know how long this show can keep that kind of energy up. It's already showing some strains in its production, and while the golf sections are conceptually creative, they struggle to deliver that energy in motion. Sk8 the Infinity, this show's closest cousin, managed its bawdy mix of skateboarding and pro-wrestling with fantastic visuals and pulse-pounding races, and I don't think this series has that in its cards. This could all very well fall apart in a few episodes once it runs out of ideas or the drawings start melting, and that would be a huge bummer.    But those are problems for Future Nick to worry about. In the here and now, this was an absolute blast to watch from start to finish. God knows I never expected to say that about a golf anime. If you were coming here looking for a serious and down-to-earth girls' sports show, I'm sorry. There's nothing for you here. But if you're at all intrigued by this nonsense I've been rambling out, give it a shot.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review                Odd Taxi: In the Woods   Apr 17, 00:00                 anime    By cleverly reframing its narrative around a series of interviews with the supporting cast, Odd Taxi: In the Woods succeeds where most recap films fail: it's an artistically cohesive film in its own right. ― Odd Taxi was 2021's sleeper anime hit, telling an intricate, original mystery that kept viewers guessing every week.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story-   Apr  6th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story- ?                     Community score: 3.8              What is this?   A youth story centering on two young women golfers named Eve and Aoi Amawashi. The two come from completely different backgrounds, with completely opposite play styles, and together they will shake the world of golf.    Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story- is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    Cailtin Moore  Rating:                People who have been reading my preview guide entries (and maybe premiere reviews for other sites before that) over the last few years are well familiar with how I've been opining that the lack of serious girls' sports anime is a travesty. Most of them are moe-fests about the power of friendship that aim to portray cuteness over athleticism, or jiggly fanservice delivery devices. I wanted the equivalent of Haikyu!! or Run with the Wind: stories that portray the characters as serious competitors, scrappy underdogs scraping by through hard training and camaraderie. That's what I thought I wanted.    But now that I've seen Birdie Wing, I've seen the light. I didn't need a serious story about overcoming the odds and rising through the ranks. I needed a shonen story full of hotblooded rivalry and ridiculously over-the-top superpowered moves, but minus the obsession with bouncing tits. What I needed… was Birdie Wing.    Oh, I was skeptical at first. Like many others who grew up before everyone had their own personal devices, I was tormented by my dad hogging the TV all day on weekends to watch his excruciatingly boring gold matches. I could not have cared less who Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods, or Vijay Singh were, but I learned nonetheless. I thought the trailer for Birdie Wing looked good and the character designs were appealing, but I wasn't sure if that could cut through the trauma of all those weekend afternoons I was forced to read instead of watch syndicated sitcoms.    By the time the ending credits rolled, I was more than ready to take back my misgivings. I wasn't sure how I felt about what I had just watched, but it certainly wasn't boring. And as I processed it, I finally arrived at how I felt: I loved it. It's not particularly well-animated or coherent, but it's wildly off-the-wall in the best possible way, constantly throwing things at the wall to see what sticks without rhyme or reason, and it is incredibly fun. Playing basically the world's most intense game of mini-golf but with actual trains instead of the archetypical windmill and your opponent is a clown mask? Sure. Hitting a tree branch in your way so hard it breaks without the ball completely losing its velocity? Why not! And don't forget the insert song full of black-and-white images of the protagonist Eve posing angstily against graffitied walls in slums that do nothing to advance the story.    It's so much. So much what, you ask? Just… so much. It's stuffed to the gills with the kind of anime bullshit that draw people to the medium, gleefully weird and energetic. It's not going to be a hole in one for everyone, but if you're looking for something that's not just par for the course, this is worth taking a look at.        James Beckett  Rating:               Birdie Wing is a sports anime that dares to break eons of tradition and ask the question that everyone has been to afraid to utter: “What if golf…was actually really cool?” That isn't to imply that golf isn't fun, or interesting, or a worthwhile athletic challenge; of all the less prolific sports for an anime to cover, I'm actually pretty happy to see one that's about golf at all. But I don't think even the hardest of the hardcore devotees of 18-Hole Pilgrimage would ever be shocked to hear me say that golf usually isn't considered one of the “cool” sports. For many folks, golf resides firmly within the realm of middle-aged white men donned in khaki shorts and matching visors who are probably just using a trip out to the greens as an excuse to get day drunk with all of their recently divorced friends.

This cartoon's version of America is a dichotomy of disparity, where the most desperate and destitute live in the shadow of the wealthy elite (so…basically the exact same thing as the real America, come to think of it). Our scrappy heroine Eve is the equivalent of a jaded ronin for hire, except her katana is a golf club, and instead of bathing in the blood of her enemies, she revels in the meager riches she can accrue for her gal pals and the orphans they're helping to raise. Eve looks like a the frontwoman of a punk band and wields borderline supernatural skills on the links, and her companion Lily is all too happy to patiently explain to their opponents all of the ways in which they are viscerally screwed. Lily also loves Gunpla, which naturally makes here almost as cool as Eve.    Is this an utterly ridiculous premise for a golf anime to tackle? Yes, but damn it, that's what makes it cool. It's like when Calvin and Hobbes put on those dark shades and just stood around, doing nothing. The best sports shows are the ones that take the everyday thrills of athletic achievement and gild them in a shiny layer of Glorious Anime Bullshit, without so much as an ounce of shame. Y'all can keep your “Cute Girls Gently Sharing Common Hobbies,” I'd like to order a double serving of “Vagrant Women Engaging in Spiritual Combat with Suggestive Sports Metaphors,” and pile on the extra cheese if you please.    My only complaint about Birdie Wing is that its modest productions values and flat direction don't always do the funny premise and genuinely likeable characters justice. This is the kind of series that only becomes funnier the more ironically impressive it looks, and some more sakuga would go a long way towards bringing the whole experience together. Still, Birdie Wing is an awful lot of fun, and I'm excited to see where these golf girls go in future episodes.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               I have to hand it to Birdie Wing – it has managed to make one of the most stultifying sports to watch interesting. That's due to a combination of some very nice animation and shot framing and a premise that I can get behind, which is one that stands to challenge the exclusivity of what can be a very snooty sport. (At least in my experience; it's kind of a summer person sport where I'm from.) For Eve and her sister Lily, golf isn't just about winning prestigious tournaments, it's about having money to keep their found family together, because they're all living what appears to be a very precarious life in the slums, and while the oldest sister does her best, it's leveraging Eve's golf skills that keeps body and soul together – or at least that's the implication.    That's something that the episode does a remarkable job of showing us without any clunky exposition. We see a corrupt cop shaking down the family for protection money, we see that Eve's earnings go directly to food, and we see that Eve only plays with three clubs, instead of the vast array that other players have in their bags. When Eve is filling in for an injured player, her caddy is surprised to see her choose what she deems inappropriate clubs for a shot; later we realize that Eve's using the only clubs she's used to playing with – the others just aren't comfortable for her because she's not had the opportunity to use them very often, if ever. When Helene, a girl her age who plays in tournaments, notes that Eve only has the three clubs, it drives home the point without ever explicitly saying, “She's poor and these clubs are all she can afford.”    The episode also takes its time to establish Eve and Lily as characters before bringing us into the fateful meeting that stands to shape Eve's future. It's not until the end of the episode that Eve and Aoi, her probable rival/friend, even meet. We see just enough of Aoi to get the impression that she's intensely competitive and living in a totally different world than Eve – again, through context clues rather than being flat-out told – and it isn't until she approaches Eve that we start to get an idea of how they'll affect each other. Aoi calls golf “sacred;” Eve says that she only plays for money, which is something that Eve can't possibly understand. While I don't give a damn about golf, seeing where this relationship goes looks like it'll be worth putting up with the spectacularly cheesy background music. Both Eve and Aoi have things that could benefit each other. How they'll develop should be worth watching.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               I think golf is pretty much the most boring sport in the world to watch. But as I've said before, sports anime live or die on their characters—the sport itself is nothing more than a catalyst for the show's interpersonal drama. And let me tell you, Birdie Wing has learned this lesson well. Instead of being set around a high school sports team or being about a newbie learning the sport for the first time, Birdie Wing follows Eve, a golf hustler who makes her money by winning underground matches against rich amateurs and moonlighting on the pro-circuit in disguise.    Honestly, it's a welcome change of pace—especially as Eve is a highly sympathetic character. Living in the slums, making money to keep a room over the head of orphans, it's impossible not to root for her as she pockets the money of the rich despite owning only three clubs herself. She's basically the Robin Hood of golf. It also helps that while Eve is no doubt talented, much of her skill comes from countless hours of hard work—despite rarely getting to play on anything as nice as an actual course. It looks like watching her rise to stardom will be a cathartic experience to say the least.    On the visual side of things, the anime looks great. From the shots of the dirty slums and vibrant golf courses to the surreal animation of Eve's Prince of Tennis-style special moves, everything is clear and detailed. (And did anyone else notice that Eve and Aoi look a lot like the transformation scene versions of Panty and Stocking? No? Just me? Okay.) Then we have the music. From surprise Eurobeat to a heartfelt ballad, it was fantastic throughout. It's a score I'd expect in an idol anime, not a sports one.    All in all, it's safe to say that Birdie Wing caught me completely off guard. It is easily the best sport anime we've seen so far this season and with its Megalobox meets Carole & Tuesday vibes, I am 100% here for it.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Let me say up top that you're best off going into this show with as little foreknowledge as possible. If you're at all curious about this series, or were planning to check it out if the reviews were good, or just have 30 minutes to kill, do yourself a favor: go in blind and let this premiere wash over you. That's what I did, and I'm confident saying that's the best way to experience whatever the hell Birdie Wing is doing.    Really, going into this with just a short preview and a key image, I was fully expecting a standard sports anime. Sure there was the novelty of it being a rather rare girls' sports show, but I've been here before. I knew what I was getting into. Then 90 seconds in our heroine peeled off a Lupin-style rubber mask to reveal she was a secret underground golfer who makes her living betting on games against pros and occasionally impersonating other golfers to help them place in tournaments. Then I learned she does all this to support her found family of undocumented immigrants who run a dive bar and take care of three orphaned children. THEN she went off to play a midnight, high-stakes golf match against a woman in a clown mask on a golf course built on top of active train tracks. And right about there I realized I had no clue where this show was going, but I needed to find out.    It's the kind a pure-hearted anime bullshit that gets talked about a lot, but only occasionally pops up for real, and I ate it right up. Every couple of minutes this premiere found some new idea or element to blindside me with, and it pulled me through the entire episode in record time. A moody music video interlude of Eve looking solemnly over the slums of her home town? Osamu Dezaki-esque postcard memories to punctuate our heroine's cool lines about golf? Her rival striking an Obari Pose before showing off her absurdly long driver that powers he own cartoony style of golf? All of that and far more, to the point where it legitimately started to feel like this wasn't a real show, but an elaborate prank laser targeted at me and my online friend circle.    The only real hangup is that I don't know how long this show can keep that kind of energy up. It's already showing some strains in its production, and while the golf sections are conceptually creative, they struggle to deliver that energy in motion. Sk8 the Infinity, this show's closest cousin, managed its bawdy mix of skateboarding and pro-wrestling with fantastic visuals and pulse-pounding races, and I don't think this series has that in its cards. This could all very well fall apart in a few episodes once it runs out of ideas or the drawings start melting, and that would be a huge bummer.    But those are problems for Future Nick to worry about. In the here and now, this was an absolute blast to watch from start to finish. God knows I never expected to say that about a golf anime. If you were coming here looking for a serious and down-to-earth girls' sports show, I'm sorry. There's nothing for you here.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story-   Apr  6th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story- ?                     Community score: 3.8              What is this?   A youth story centering on two young women golfers named Eve and Aoi Amawashi. The two come from completely different backgrounds, with completely opposite play styles, and together they will shake the world of golf.    Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story- is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    Cailtin Moore  Rating:                People who have been reading my preview guide entries (and maybe premiere reviews for other sites before that) over the last few years are well familiar with how I've been opining that the lack of serious girls' sports anime is a travesty. Most of them are moe-fests about the power of friendship that aim to portray cuteness over athleticism, or jiggly fanservice delivery devices. I wanted the equivalent of Haikyu!! or Run with the Wind: stories that portray the characters as serious competitors, scrappy underdogs scraping by through hard training and camaraderie. That's what I thought I wanted.    But now that I've seen Birdie Wing, I've seen the light. I didn't need a serious story about overcoming the odds and rising through the ranks. I needed a shonen story full of hotblooded rivalry and ridiculously over-the-top superpowered moves, but minus the obsession with bouncing tits. What I needed… was Birdie Wing.    Oh, I was skeptical at first. Like many others who grew up before everyone had their own personal devices, I was tormented by my dad hogging the TV all day on weekends to watch his excruciatingly boring gold matches. I could not have cared less who Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods, or Vijay Singh were, but I learned nonetheless. I thought the trailer for Birdie Wing looked good and the character designs were appealing, but I wasn't sure if that could cut through the trauma of all those weekend afternoons I was forced to read instead of watch syndicated sitcoms.    By the time the ending credits rolled, I was more than ready to take back my misgivings. I wasn't sure how I felt about what I had just watched, but it certainly wasn't boring. And as I processed it, I finally arrived at how I felt: I loved it. It's not particularly well-animated or coherent, but it's wildly off-the-wall in the best possible way, constantly throwing things at the wall to see what sticks without rhyme or reason, and it is incredibly fun. Playing basically the world's most intense game of mini-golf but with actual trains instead of the archetypical windmill and your opponent is a clown mask? Sure. Hitting a tree branch in your way so hard it breaks without the ball completely losing its velocity? Why not! And don't forget the insert song full of black-and-white images of the protagonist Eve posing angstily against graffitied walls in slums that do nothing to advance the story.    It's so much. So much what, you ask? Just… so much. It's stuffed to the gills with the kind of anime bullshit that draw people to the medium, gleefully weird and energetic. It's not going to be a hole in one for everyone, but if you're looking for something that's not just par for the course, this is worth taking a look at.        James Beckett  Rating:               Birdie Wing is a sports anime that dares to break eons of tradition and ask the question that everyone has been to afraid to utter: “What if golf…was actually really cool?” That isn't to imply that golf isn't fun, or interesting, or a worthwhile athletic challenge; of all the less prolific sports for an anime to cover, I'm actually pretty happy to see one that's about golf at all. But I don't think even the hardest of the hardcore devotees of 18-Hole Pilgrimage would ever be shocked to hear me say that golf usually isn't considered one of the “cool” sports. For many folks, golf resides firmly within the realm of middle-aged white men donned in khaki shorts and matching visors who are probably just using a trip out to the greens as an excuse to get day drunk with all of their recently divorced friends.    Birdie Wing, instead, gives us a world of golf where the rich geezers are outnumbered by flashy anime gals and mysterious clown women that all treat golf as nothing less than existential blood sport. This cartoon's version of America is a dichotomy of disparity, where the most desperate and destitute live in the shadow of the wealthy elite (so…basically the exact same thing as the real America, come to think of it). Our scrappy heroine Eve is the equivalent of a jaded ronin for hire, except her katana is a golf club, and instead of bathing in the blood of her enemies, she revels in the meager riches she can accrue for her gal pals and the orphans they're helping to raise. Eve looks like a the frontwoman of a punk band and wields borderline supernatural skills on the links, and her companion Lily is all too happy to patiently explain to their opponents all of the ways in which they are viscerally screwed. Lily also loves Gunpla, which naturally makes here almost as cool as Eve.    Is this an utterly ridiculous premise for a golf anime to tackle? Yes, but damn it, that's what makes it cool. It's like when Calvin and Hobbes put on those dark shades and just stood around, doing nothing. The best sports shows are the ones that take the everyday thrills of athletic achievement and gild them in a shiny layer of Glorious Anime Bullshit, without so much as an ounce of shame. Y'all can keep your “Cute Girls Gently Sharing Common Hobbies,” I'd like to order a double serving of “Vagrant Women Engaging in Spiritual Combat with Suggestive Sports Metaphors,” and pile on the extra cheese if you please.    My only complaint about Birdie Wing is that its modest productions values and flat direction don't always do the funny premise and genuinely likeable characters justice. This is the kind of series that only becomes funnier the more ironically impressive it looks, and some more sakuga would go a long way towards bringing the whole experience together. Still, Birdie Wing is an awful lot of fun, and I'm excited to see where these golf girls go in future episodes.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               I have to hand it to Birdie Wing – it has managed to make one of the most stultifying sports to watch interesting. That's due to a combination of some very nice animation and shot framing and a premise that I can get behind, which is one that stands to challenge the exclusivity of what can be a very snooty sport. (At least in my experience; it's kind of a summer person sport where I'm from.) For Eve and her sister Lily, golf isn't just about winning prestigious tournaments, it's about having money to keep their found family together, because they're all living what appears to be a very precarious life in the slums, and while the oldest sister does her best, it's leveraging Eve's golf skills that keeps body and soul together – or at least that's the implication.    That's something that the episode does a remarkable job of showing us without any clunky exposition. We see a corrupt cop shaking down the family for protection money, we see that Eve's earnings go directly to food, and we see that Eve only plays with three clubs, instead of the vast array that other players have in their bags. When Eve is filling in for an injured player, her caddy is surprised to see her choose what she deems inappropriate clubs for a shot; later we realize that Eve's using the only clubs she's used to playing with – the others just aren't comfortable for her because she's not had the opportunity to use them very often, if ever. When Helene, a girl her age who plays in tournaments, notes that Eve only has the three clubs, it drives home the point without ever explicitly saying, “She's poor and these clubs are all she can afford.”    The episode also takes its time to establish Eve and Lily as characters before bringing us into the fateful meeting that stands to shape Eve's future. It's not until the end of the episode that Eve and Aoi, her probable rival/friend, even meet. We see just enough of Aoi to get the impression that she's intensely competitive and living in a totally different world than Eve – again, through context clues rather than being flat-out told – and it isn't until she approaches Eve that we start to get an idea of how they'll affect each other. Aoi calls golf “sacred;” Eve says that she only plays for money, which is something that Eve can't possibly understand. While I don't give a damn about golf, seeing where this relationship goes looks like it'll be worth putting up with the spectacularly cheesy background music. Both Eve and Aoi have things that could benefit each other. How they'll develop should be worth watching.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               I think golf is pretty much the most boring sport in the world to watch. But as I've said before, sports anime live or die on their characters—the sport itself is nothing more than a catalyst for the show's interpersonal drama. And let me tell you, Birdie Wing has learned this lesson well. Instead of being set around a high school sports team or being about a newbie learning the sport for the first time, Birdie Wing follows Eve, a golf hustler who makes her money by winning underground matches against rich amateurs and moonlighting on the pro-circuit in disguise.    Honestly, it's a welcome change of pace—especially as Eve is a highly sympathetic character. Living in the slums, making money to keep a room over the head of orphans, it's impossible not to root for her as she pockets the money of the rich despite owning only three clubs herself. She's basically the Robin Hood of golf. It also helps that while Eve is no doubt talented, much of her skill comes from countless hours of hard work—despite rarely getting to play on anything as nice as an actual course.

All in all, it's safe to say that Birdie Wing caught me completely off guard. It is easily the best sport anime we've seen so far this season and with its Megalobox meets Carole & Tuesday vibes, I am 100% here for it.

And right about there I realized I had no clue where this show was going, but I needed to find out.    It's the kind a pure-hearted anime bullshit that gets talked about a lot, but only occasionally pops up for real, and I ate it right up. Every couple of minutes this premiere found some new idea or element to blindside me with, and it pulled me through the entire episode in record time. A moody music video interlude of Eve looking solemnly over the slums of her home town? Osamu Dezaki-esque postcard memories to punctuate our heroine's cool lines about golf? Her rival striking an Obari Pose before showing off her absurdly long driver that powers he own cartoony style of golf? All of that and far more, to the point where it legitimately started to feel like this wasn't a real show, but an elaborate prank laser targeted at me and my online friend circle.    The only real hangup is that I don't know how long this show can keep that kind of energy up. It's already showing some strains in its production, and while the golf sections are conceptually creative, they struggle to deliver that energy in motion. Sk8 the Infinity, this show's closest cousin, managed its bawdy mix of skateboarding and pro-wrestling with fantastic visuals and pulse-pounding races, and I don't think this series has that in its cards. This could all very well fall apart in a few episodes once it runs out of ideas or the drawings start melting, and that would be a huge bummer.    But those are problems for Future Nick to worry about. In the here and now, this was an absolute blast to watch from start to finish. God knows I never expected to say that about a golf anime. If you were coming here looking for a serious and down-to-earth girls' sports show, I'm sorry. There's nothing for you here. But if you're at all intrigued by this nonsense I've been rambling out, give it a shot.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story-   Apr  6th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story- ?                     Community score: 3.8              What is this?   A youth story centering on two young women golfers named Eve and Aoi Amawashi. The two come from completely different backgrounds, with completely opposite play styles, and together they will shake the world of golf.    Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story- is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    Cailtin Moore  Rating:                People who have been reading my preview guide entries (and maybe premiere reviews for other sites before that) over the last few years are well familiar with how I've been opining that the lack of serious girls' sports anime is a travesty. Most of them are moe-fests about the power of friendship that aim to portray cuteness over athleticism, or jiggly fanservice delivery devices. I wanted the equivalent of Haikyu!! or Run with the Wind: stories that portray the characters as serious competitors, scrappy underdogs scraping by through hard training and camaraderie. That's what I thought I wanted.    But now that I've seen Birdie Wing, I've seen the light. I didn't need a serious story about overcoming the odds and rising through the ranks. I needed a shonen story full of hotblooded rivalry and ridiculously over-the-top superpowered moves, but minus the obsession with bouncing tits. What I needed… was Birdie Wing.    Oh, I was skeptical at first. Like many others who grew up before everyone had their own personal devices, I was tormented by my dad hogging the TV all day on weekends to watch his excruciatingly boring gold matches. I could not have cared less who Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods, or Vijay Singh were, but I learned nonetheless. I thought the trailer for Birdie Wing looked good and the character designs were appealing, but I wasn't sure if that could cut through the trauma of all those weekend afternoons I was forced to read instead of watch syndicated sitcoms.    By the time the ending credits rolled, I was more than ready to take back my misgivings. I wasn't sure how I felt about what I had just watched, but it certainly wasn't boring. And as I processed it, I finally arrived at how I felt: I loved it. It's not particularly well-animated or coherent, but it's wildly off-the-wall in the best possible way, constantly throwing things at the wall to see what sticks without rhyme or reason, and it is incredibly fun. Playing basically the world's most intense game of mini-golf but with actual trains instead of the archetypical windmill and your opponent is a clown mask? Sure. Hitting a tree branch in your way so hard it breaks without the ball completely losing its velocity? Why not! And don't forget the insert song full of black-and-white images of the protagonist Eve posing angstily against graffitied walls in slums that do nothing to advance the story.    It's so much. So much what, you ask? Just… so much. It's stuffed to the gills with the kind of anime bullshit that draw people to the medium, gleefully weird and energetic. It's not going to be a hole in one for everyone, but if you're looking for something that's not just par for the course, this is worth taking a look at.        James Beckett  Rating:               Birdie Wing is a sports anime that dares to break eons of tradition and ask the question that everyone has been to afraid to utter: “What if golf…was actually really cool?” That isn't to imply that golf isn't fun, or interesting, or a worthwhile athletic challenge; of all the less prolific sports for an anime to cover, I'm actually pretty happy to see one that's about golf at all. But I don't think even the hardest of the hardcore devotees of 18-Hole Pilgrimage would ever be shocked to hear me say that golf usually isn't considered one of the “cool” sports. For many folks, golf resides firmly within the realm of middle-aged white men donned in khaki shorts and matching visors who are probably just using a trip out to the greens as an excuse to get day drunk with all of their recently divorced friends.    Birdie Wing, instead, gives us a world of golf where the rich geezers are outnumbered by flashy anime gals and mysterious clown women that all treat golf as nothing less than existential blood sport. This cartoon's version of America is a dichotomy of disparity, where the most desperate and destitute live in the shadow of the wealthy elite (so…basically the exact same thing as the real America, come to think of it). Our scrappy heroine Eve is the equivalent of a jaded ronin for hire, except her katana is a golf club, and instead of bathing in the blood of her enemies, she revels in the meager riches she can accrue for her gal pals and the orphans they're helping to raise. Eve looks like a the frontwoman of a punk band and wields borderline supernatural skills on the links, and her companion Lily is all too happy to patiently explain to their opponents all of the ways in which they are viscerally screwed. Lily also loves Gunpla, which naturally makes here almost as cool as Eve.    Is this an utterly ridiculous premise for a golf anime to tackle? Yes, but damn it, that's what makes it cool. It's like when Calvin and Hobbes put on those dark shades and just stood around, doing nothing. The best sports shows are the ones that take the everyday thrills of athletic achievement and gild them in a shiny layer of Glorious Anime Bullshit, without so much as an ounce of shame. Y'all can keep your “Cute Girls Gently Sharing Common Hobbies,” I'd like to order a double serving of “Vagrant Women Engaging in Spiritual Combat with Suggestive Sports Metaphors,” and pile on the extra cheese if you please.    My only complaint about Birdie Wing is that its modest productions values and flat direction don't always do the funny premise and genuinely likeable characters justice. This is the kind of series that only becomes funnier the more ironically impressive it looks, and some more sakuga would go a long way towards bringing the whole experience together. Still, Birdie Wing is an awful lot of fun, and I'm excited to see where these golf girls go in future episodes.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               I have to hand it to Birdie Wing – it has managed to make one of the most stultifying sports to watch interesting. That's due to a combination of some very nice animation and shot framing and a premise that I can get behind, which is one that stands to challenge the exclusivity of what can be a very snooty sport. (At least in my experience; it's kind of a summer person sport where I'm from.) For Eve and her sister Lily, golf isn't just about winning prestigious tournaments, it's about having money to keep their found family together, because they're all living what appears to be a very precarious life in the slums, and while the oldest sister does her best, it's leveraging Eve's golf skills that keeps body and soul together – or at least that's the implication.    That's something that the episode does a remarkable job of showing us without any clunky exposition. We see a corrupt cop shaking down the family for protection money, we see that Eve's earnings go directly to food, and we see that Eve only plays with three clubs, instead of the vast array that other players have in their bags. When Eve is filling in for an injured player, her caddy is surprised to see her choose what she deems inappropriate clubs for a shot; later we realize that Eve's using the only clubs she's used to playing with – the others just aren't comfortable for her because she's not had the opportunity to use them very often, if ever. When Helene, a girl her age who plays in tournaments, notes that Eve only has the three clubs, it drives home the point without ever explicitly saying, “She's poor and these clubs are all she can afford.”    The episode also takes its time to establish Eve and Lily as characters before bringing us into the fateful meeting that stands to shape Eve's future. It's not until the end of the episode that Eve and Aoi, her probable rival/friend, even meet. We see just enough of Aoi to get the impression that she's intensely competitive and living in a totally different world than Eve – again, through context clues rather than being flat-out told – and it isn't until she approaches Eve that we start to get an idea of how they'll affect each other. Aoi calls golf “sacred;” Eve says that she only plays for money, which is something that Eve can't possibly understand. While I don't give a damn about golf, seeing where this relationship goes looks like it'll be worth putting up with the spectacularly cheesy background music. Both Eve and Aoi have things that could benefit each other. How they'll develop should be worth watching.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               I think golf is pretty much the most boring sport in the world to watch. But as I've said before, sports anime live or die on their characters—the sport itself is nothing more than a catalyst for the show's interpersonal drama. And let me tell you, Birdie Wing has learned this lesson well. Instead of being set around a high school sports team or being about a newbie learning the sport for the first time, Birdie Wing follows Eve, a golf hustler who makes her money by winning underground matches against rich amateurs and moonlighting on the pro-circuit in disguise.    Honestly, it's a welcome change of pace—especially as Eve is a highly sympathetic character. Living in the slums, making money to keep a room over the head of orphans, it's impossible not to root for her as she pockets the money of the rich despite owning only three clubs herself. She's basically the Robin Hood of golf. It also helps that while Eve is no doubt talented, much of her skill comes from countless hours of hard work—despite rarely getting to play on anything as nice as an actual course. It looks like watching her rise to stardom will be a cathartic experience to say the least.    On the visual side of things, the anime looks great. From the shots of the dirty slums and vibrant golf courses to the surreal animation of Eve's Prince of Tennis-style special moves, everything is clear and detailed. (And did anyone else notice that Eve and Aoi look a lot like the transformation scene versions of Panty and Stocking? No? Just me? Okay.) Then we have the music. From surprise Eurobeat to a heartfelt ballad, it was fantastic throughout. It's a score I'd expect in an idol anime, not a sports one.    All in all, it's safe to say that Birdie Wing caught me completely off guard. It is easily the best sport anime we've seen so far this season and with its Megalobox meets Carole & Tuesday vibes, I am 100% here for it.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Let me say up top that you're best off going into this show with as little foreknowledge as possible. If you're at all curious about this series, or were planning to check it out if the reviews were good, or just have 30 minutes to kill, do yourself a favor: go in blind and let this premiere wash over you. That's what I did, and I'm confident saying that's the best way to experience whatever the hell Birdie Wing is doing.    Really, going into this with just a short preview and a key image, I was fully expecting a standard sports anime. Sure there was the novelty of it being a rather rare girls' sports show, but I've been here before. I knew what I was getting into. Then 90 seconds in our heroine peeled off a Lupin-style rubber mask to reveal she was a secret underground golfer who makes her living betting on games against pros and occasionally impersonating other golfers to help them place in tournaments. Then I learned she does all this to support her found family of undocumented immigrants who run a dive bar and take care of three orphaned children. THEN she went off to play a midnight, high-stakes golf match against a woman in a clown mask on a golf course built on top of active train tracks.

Community score: 3.8              What is this?   A youth story centering on two young women golfers named Eve and Aoi Amawashi. The two come from completely different backgrounds, with completely opposite play styles, and together they will shake the world of golf.    Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story- is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    Cailtin Moore  Rating:                People who have been reading my preview guide entries (and maybe premiere reviews for other sites before that) over the last few years are well familiar with how I've been opining that the lack of serious girls' sports anime is a travesty. Most of them are moe-fests about the power of friendship that aim to portray cuteness over athleticism, or jiggly fanservice delivery devices. I wanted the equivalent of Haikyu!! or Run with the Wind: stories that portray the characters as serious competitors, scrappy underdogs scraping by through hard training and camaraderie. That's what I thought I wanted.    But now that I've seen Birdie Wing, I've seen the light. I didn't need a serious story about overcoming the odds and rising through the ranks. I needed a shonen story full of hotblooded rivalry and ridiculously over-the-top superpowered moves, but minus the obsession with bouncing tits. What I needed… was Birdie Wing.    Oh, I was skeptical at first. Like many others who grew up before everyone had their own personal devices, I was tormented by my dad hogging the TV all day on weekends to watch his excruciatingly boring gold matches. I could not have cared less who Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods, or Vijay Singh were, but I learned nonetheless. I thought the trailer for Birdie Wing looked good and the character designs were appealing, but I wasn't sure if that could cut through the trauma of all those weekend afternoons I was forced to read instead of watch syndicated sitcoms.    By the time the ending credits rolled, I was more than ready to take back my misgivings. I wasn't sure how I felt about what I had just watched, but it certainly wasn't boring. And as I processed it, I finally arrived at how I felt: I loved it. It's not particularly well-animated or coherent, but it's wildly off-the-wall in the best possible way, constantly throwing things at the wall to see what sticks without rhyme or reason, and it is incredibly fun. Playing basically the world's most intense game of mini-golf but with actual trains instead of the archetypical windmill and your opponent is a clown mask? Sure. Hitting a tree branch in your way so hard it breaks without the ball completely losing its velocity? Why not! And don't forget the insert song full of black-and-white images of the protagonist Eve posing angstily against graffitied walls in slums that do nothing to advance the story.    It's so much. So much what, you ask? Just… so much. It's stuffed to the gills with the kind of anime bullshit that draw people to the medium, gleefully weird and energetic. It's not going to be a hole in one for everyone, but if you're looking for something that's not just par for the course, this is worth taking a look at.        James Beckett  Rating:               Birdie Wing is a sports anime that dares to break eons of tradition and ask the question that everyone has been to afraid to utter: “What if golf…was actually really cool?” That isn't to imply that golf isn't fun, or interesting, or a worthwhile athletic challenge; of all the less prolific sports for an anime to cover, I'm actually pretty happy to see one that's about golf at all. But I don't think even the hardest of the hardcore devotees of 18-Hole Pilgrimage would ever be shocked to hear me say that golf usually isn't considered one of the “cool” sports. For many folks, golf resides firmly within the realm of middle-aged white men donned in khaki shorts and matching visors who are probably just using a trip out to the greens as an excuse to get day drunk with all of their recently divorced friends.    Birdie Wing, instead, gives us a world of golf where the rich geezers are outnumbered by flashy anime gals and mysterious clown women that all treat golf as nothing less than existential blood sport. This cartoon's version of America is a dichotomy of disparity, where the most desperate and destitute live in the shadow of the wealthy elite (so…basically the exact same thing as the real America, come to think of it). Our scrappy heroine Eve is the equivalent of a jaded ronin for hire, except her katana is a golf club, and instead of bathing in the blood of her enemies, she revels in the meager riches she can accrue for her gal pals and the orphans they're helping to raise. Eve looks like a the frontwoman of a punk band and wields borderline supernatural skills on the links, and her companion Lily is all too happy to patiently explain to their opponents all of the ways in which they are viscerally screwed. Lily also loves Gunpla, which naturally makes here almost as cool as Eve.    Is this an utterly ridiculous premise for a golf anime to tackle? Yes, but damn it, that's what makes it cool. It's like when Calvin and Hobbes put on those dark shades and just stood around, doing nothing. The best sports shows are the ones that take the everyday thrills of athletic achievement and gild them in a shiny layer of Glorious Anime Bullshit, without so much as an ounce of shame. Y'all can keep your “Cute Girls Gently Sharing Common Hobbies,” I'd like to order a double serving of “Vagrant Women Engaging in Spiritual Combat with Suggestive Sports Metaphors,” and pile on the extra cheese if you please.    My only complaint about Birdie Wing is that its modest productions values and flat direction don't always do the funny premise and genuinely likeable characters justice. This is the kind of series that only becomes funnier the more ironically impressive it looks, and some more sakuga would go a long way towards bringing the whole experience together. Still, Birdie Wing is an awful lot of fun, and I'm excited to see where these golf girls go in future episodes.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               I have to hand it to Birdie Wing – it has managed to make one of the most stultifying sports to watch interesting. That's due to a combination of some very nice animation and shot framing and a premise that I can get behind, which is one that stands to challenge the exclusivity of what can be a very snooty sport. (At least in my experience; it's kind of a summer person sport where I'm from.) For Eve and her sister Lily, golf isn't just about winning prestigious tournaments, it's about having money to keep their found family together, because they're all living what appears to be a very precarious life in the slums, and while the oldest sister does her best, it's leveraging Eve's golf skills that keeps body and soul together – or at least that's the implication.    That's something that the episode does a remarkable job of showing us without any clunky exposition. We see a corrupt cop shaking down the family for protection money, we see that Eve's earnings go directly to food, and we see that Eve only plays with three clubs, instead of the vast array that other players have in their bags. When Eve is filling in for an injured player, her caddy is surprised to see her choose what she deems inappropriate clubs for a shot; later we realize that Eve's using the only clubs she's used to playing with – the others just aren't comfortable for her because she's not had the opportunity to use them very often, if ever. When Helene, a girl her age who plays in tournaments, notes that Eve only has the three clubs, it drives home the point without ever explicitly saying, “She's poor and these clubs are all she can afford.”    The episode also takes its time to establish Eve and Lily as characters before bringing us into the fateful meeting that stands to shape Eve's future. It's not until the end of the episode that Eve and Aoi, her probable rival/friend, even meet. We see just enough of Aoi to get the impression that she's intensely competitive and living in a totally different world than Eve – again, through context clues rather than being flat-out told – and it isn't until she approaches Eve that we start to get an idea of how they'll affect each other. Aoi calls golf “sacred;” Eve says that she only plays for money, which is something that Eve can't possibly understand. While I don't give a damn about golf, seeing where this relationship goes looks like it'll be worth putting up with the spectacularly cheesy background music. Both Eve and Aoi have things that could benefit each other. How they'll develop should be worth watching.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               I think golf is pretty much the most boring sport in the world to watch. But as I've said before, sports anime live or die on their characters—the sport itself is nothing more than a catalyst for the show's interpersonal drama. And let me tell you, Birdie Wing has learned this lesson well. Instead of being set around a high school sports team or being about a newbie learning the sport for the first time, Birdie Wing follows Eve, a golf hustler who makes her money by winning underground matches against rich amateurs and moonlighting on the pro-circuit in disguise.    Honestly, it's a welcome change of pace—especially as Eve is a highly sympathetic character. Living in the slums, making money to keep a room over the head of orphans, it's impossible not to root for her as she pockets the money of the rich despite owning only three clubs herself. She's basically the Robin Hood of golf. It also helps that while Eve is no doubt talented, much of her skill comes from countless hours of hard work—despite rarely getting to play on anything as nice as an actual course. It looks like watching her rise to stardom will be a cathartic experience to say the least.    On the visual side of things, the anime looks great. From the shots of the dirty slums and vibrant golf courses to the surreal animation of Eve's Prince of Tennis-style special moves, everything is clear and detailed. (And did anyone else notice that Eve and Aoi look a lot like the transformation scene versions of Panty and Stocking? No? Just me? Okay.) Then we have the music. From surprise Eurobeat to a heartfelt ballad, it was fantastic throughout. It's a score I'd expect in an idol anime, not a sports one.    All in all, it's safe to say that Birdie Wing caught me completely off guard. It is easily the best sport anime we've seen so far this season and with its Megalobox meets Carole & Tuesday vibes, I am 100% here for it.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Let me say up top that you're best off going into this show with as little foreknowledge as possible. If you're at all curious about this series, or were planning to check it out if the reviews were good, or just have 30 minutes to kill, do yourself a favor: go in blind and let this premiere wash over you. That's what I did, and I'm confident saying that's the best way to experience whatever the hell Birdie Wing is doing.    Really, going into this with just a short preview and a key image, I was fully expecting a standard sports anime. Sure there was the novelty of it being a rather rare girls' sports show, but I've been here before. I knew what I was getting into. Then 90 seconds in our heroine peeled off a Lupin-style rubber mask to reveal she was a secret underground golfer who makes her living betting on games against pros and occasionally impersonating other golfers to help them place in tournaments. Then I learned she does all this to support her found family of undocumented immigrants who run a dive bar and take care of three orphaned children. THEN she went off to play a midnight, high-stakes golf match against a woman in a clown mask on a golf course built on top of active train tracks. And right about there I realized I had no clue where this show was going, but I needed to find out.    It's the kind a pure-hearted anime bullshit that gets talked about a lot, but only occasionally pops up for real, and I ate it right up. Every couple of minutes this premiere found some new idea or element to blindside me with, and it pulled me through the entire episode in record time. A moody music video interlude of Eve looking solemnly over the slums of her home town? Osamu Dezaki-esque postcard memories to punctuate our heroine's cool lines about golf? Her rival striking an Obari Pose before showing off her absurdly long driver that powers he own cartoony style of golf? All of that and far more, to the point where it legitimately started to feel like this wasn't a real show, but an elaborate prank laser targeted at me and my online friend circle.    The only real hangup is that I don't know how long this show can keep that kind of energy up. It's already showing some strains in its production, and while the golf sections are conceptually creative, they struggle to deliver that energy in motion. Sk8 the Infinity, this show's closest cousin, managed its bawdy mix of skateboarding and pro-wrestling with fantastic visuals and pulse-pounding races, and I don't think this series has that in its cards. This could all very well fall apart in a few episodes once it runs out of ideas or the drawings start melting, and that would be a huge bummer.    But those are problems for Future Nick to worry about. In the here and now, this was an absolute blast to watch from start to finish. God knows I never expected to say that about a golf anime.

I could not have cared less who Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods, or Vijay Singh were, but I learned nonetheless. I thought the trailer for Birdie Wing looked good and the character designs were appealing, but I wasn't sure if that could cut through the trauma of all those weekend afternoons I was forced to read instead of watch syndicated sitcoms.    By the time the ending credits rolled, I was more than ready to take back my misgivings. I wasn't sure how I felt about what I had just watched, but it certainly wasn't boring. And as I processed it, I finally arrived at how I felt: I loved it. It's not particularly well-animated or coherent, but it's wildly off-the-wall in the best possible way, constantly throwing things at the wall to see what sticks without rhyme or reason, and it is incredibly fun. Playing basically the world's most intense game of mini-golf but with actual trains instead of the archetypical windmill and your opponent is a clown mask? Sure. Hitting a tree branch in your way so hard it breaks without the ball completely losing its velocity? Why not! And don't forget the insert song full of black-and-white images of the protagonist Eve posing angstily against graffitied walls in slums that do nothing to advance the story.    It's so much. So much what, you ask? Just… so much. It's stuffed to the gills with the kind of anime bullshit that draw people to the medium, gleefully weird and energetic. It's not going to be a hole in one for everyone, but if you're looking for something that's not just par for the course, this is worth taking a look at.        James Beckett  Rating:               Birdie Wing is a sports anime that dares to break eons of tradition and ask the question that everyone has been to afraid to utter: “What if golf…was actually really cool?” That isn't to imply that golf isn't fun, or interesting, or a worthwhile athletic challenge; of all the less prolific sports for an anime to cover, I'm actually pretty happy to see one that's about golf at all. But I don't think even the hardest of the hardcore devotees of 18-Hole Pilgrimage would ever be shocked to hear me say that golf usually isn't considered one of the “cool” sports. For many folks, golf resides firmly within the realm of middle-aged white men donned in khaki shorts and matching visors who are probably just using a trip out to the greens as an excuse to get day drunk with all of their recently divorced friends.    Birdie Wing, instead, gives us a world of golf where the rich geezers are outnumbered by flashy anime gals and mysterious clown women that all treat golf as nothing less than existential blood sport. This cartoon's version of America is a dichotomy of disparity, where the most desperate and destitute live in the shadow of the wealthy elite (so…basically the exact same thing as the real America, come to think of it). Our scrappy heroine Eve is the equivalent of a jaded ronin for hire, except her katana is a golf club, and instead of bathing in the blood of her enemies, she revels in the meager riches she can accrue for her gal pals and the orphans they're helping to raise. Eve looks like a the frontwoman of a punk band and wields borderline supernatural skills on the links, and her companion Lily is all too happy to patiently explain to their opponents all of the ways in which they are viscerally screwed. Lily also loves Gunpla, which naturally makes here almost as cool as Eve.    Is this an utterly ridiculous premise for a golf anime to tackle? Yes, but damn it, that's what makes it cool. It's like when Calvin and Hobbes put on those dark shades and just stood around, doing nothing. The best sports shows are the ones that take the everyday thrills of athletic achievement and gild them in a shiny layer of Glorious Anime Bullshit, without so much as an ounce of shame. Y'all can keep your “Cute Girls Gently Sharing Common Hobbies,” I'd like to order a double serving of “Vagrant Women Engaging in Spiritual Combat with Suggestive Sports Metaphors,” and pile on the extra cheese if you please.    My only complaint about Birdie Wing is that its modest productions values and flat direction don't always do the funny premise and genuinely likeable characters justice. This is the kind of series that only becomes funnier the more ironically impressive it looks, and some more sakuga would go a long way towards bringing the whole experience together. Still, Birdie Wing is an awful lot of fun, and I'm excited to see where these golf girls go in future episodes.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               I have to hand it to Birdie Wing – it has managed to make one of the most stultifying sports to watch interesting. That's due to a combination of some very nice animation and shot framing and a premise that I can get behind, which is one that stands to challenge the exclusivity of what can be a very snooty sport. (At least in my experience; it's kind of a summer person sport where I'm from.) For Eve and her sister Lily, golf isn't just about winning prestigious tournaments, it's about having money to keep their found family together, because they're all living what appears to be a very precarious life in the slums, and while the oldest sister does her best, it's leveraging Eve's golf skills that keeps body and soul together – or at least that's the implication.    That's something that the episode does a remarkable job of showing us without any clunky exposition. We see a corrupt cop shaking down the family for protection money, we see that Eve's earnings go directly to food, and we see that Eve only plays with three clubs, instead of the vast array that other players have in their bags. When Eve is filling in for an injured player, her caddy is surprised to see her choose what she deems inappropriate clubs for a shot; later we realize that Eve's using the only clubs she's used to playing with – the others just aren't comfortable for her because she's not had the opportunity to use them very often, if ever. When Helene, a girl her age who plays in tournaments, notes that Eve only has the three clubs, it drives home the point without ever explicitly saying, “She's poor and these clubs are all she can afford.”    The episode also takes its time to establish Eve and Lily as characters before bringing us into the fateful meeting that stands to shape Eve's future. It's not until the end of the episode that Eve and Aoi, her probable rival/friend, even meet. We see just enough of Aoi to get the impression that she's intensely competitive and living in a totally different world than Eve – again, through context clues rather than being flat-out told – and it isn't until she approaches Eve that we start to get an idea of how they'll affect each other. Aoi calls golf “sacred;” Eve says that she only plays for money, which is something that Eve can't possibly understand. While I don't give a damn about golf, seeing where this relationship goes looks like it'll be worth putting up with the spectacularly cheesy background music. Both Eve and Aoi have things that could benefit each other. How they'll develop should be worth watching.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               I think golf is pretty much the most boring sport in the world to watch. But as I've said before, sports anime live or die on their characters—the sport itself is nothing more than a catalyst for the show's interpersonal drama. And let me tell you, Birdie Wing has learned this lesson well. Instead of being set around a high school sports team or being about a newbie learning the sport for the first time, Birdie Wing follows Eve, a golf hustler who makes her money by winning underground matches against rich amateurs and moonlighting on the pro-circuit in disguise.    Honestly, it's a welcome change of pace—especially as Eve is a highly sympathetic character. Living in the slums, making money to keep a room over the head of orphans, it's impossible not to root for her as she pockets the money of the rich despite owning only three clubs herself. She's basically the Robin Hood of golf. It also helps that while Eve is no doubt talented, much of her skill comes from countless hours of hard work—despite rarely getting to play on anything as nice as an actual course. It looks like watching her rise to stardom will be a cathartic experience to say the least.    On the visual side of things, the anime looks great. From the shots of the dirty slums and vibrant golf courses to the surreal animation of Eve's Prince of Tennis-style special moves, everything is clear and detailed. (And did anyone else notice that Eve and Aoi look a lot like the transformation scene versions of Panty and Stocking? No? Just me? Okay.) Then we have the music. From surprise Eurobeat to a heartfelt ballad, it was fantastic throughout. It's a score I'd expect in an idol anime, not a sports one.    All in all, it's safe to say that Birdie Wing caught me completely off guard. It is easily the best sport anime we've seen so far this season and with its Megalobox meets Carole & Tuesday vibes, I am 100% here for it.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Let me say up top that you're best off going into this show with as little foreknowledge as possible. If you're at all curious about this series, or were planning to check it out if the reviews were good, or just have 30 minutes to kill, do yourself a favor: go in blind and let this premiere wash over you. That's what I did, and I'm confident saying that's the best way to experience whatever the hell Birdie Wing is doing.    Really, going into this with just a short preview and a key image, I was fully expecting a standard sports anime. Sure there was the novelty of it being a rather rare girls' sports show, but I've been here before. I knew what I was getting into. Then 90 seconds in our heroine peeled off a Lupin-style rubber mask to reveal she was a secret underground golfer who makes her living betting on games against pros and occasionally impersonating other golfers to help them place in tournaments. Then I learned she does all this to support her found family of undocumented immigrants who run a dive bar and take care of three orphaned children. THEN she went off to play a midnight, high-stakes golf match against a woman in a clown mask on a golf course built on top of active train tracks. And right about there I realized I had no clue where this show was going, but I needed to find out.    It's the kind a pure-hearted anime bullshit that gets talked about a lot, but only occasionally pops up for real, and I ate it right up. Every couple of minutes this premiere found some new idea or element to blindside me with, and it pulled me through the entire episode in record time. A moody music video interlude of Eve looking solemnly over the slums of her home town? Osamu Dezaki-esque postcard memories to punctuate our heroine's cool lines about golf? Her rival striking an Obari Pose before showing off her absurdly long driver that powers he own cartoony style of golf? All of that and far more, to the point where it legitimately started to feel like this wasn't a real show, but an elaborate prank laser targeted at me and my online friend circle.    The only real hangup is that I don't know how long this show can keep that kind of energy up. It's already showing some strains in its production, and while the golf sections are conceptually creative, they struggle to deliver that energy in motion. Sk8 the Infinity, this show's closest cousin, managed its bawdy mix of skateboarding and pro-wrestling with fantastic visuals and pulse-pounding races, and I don't think this series has that in its cards. This could all very well fall apart in a few episodes once it runs out of ideas or the drawings start melting, and that would be a huge bummer.    But those are problems for Future Nick to worry about. In the here and now, this was an absolute blast to watch from start to finish. God knows I never expected to say that about a golf anime. If you were coming here looking for a serious and down-to-earth girls' sports show, I'm sorry. There's nothing for you here. But if you're at all intrigued by this nonsense I've been rambling out, give it a shot.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives   ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 3.8              What is this?   A youth story centering on two young women golfers named Eve and Aoi Amawashi. The two come from completely different backgrounds, with completely opposite play styles, and together they will shake the world of golf.    Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story- is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    Cailtin Moore  Rating:                People who have been reading my preview guide entries (and maybe premiere reviews for other sites before that) over the last few years are well familiar with how I've been opining that the lack of serious girls' sports anime is a travesty. Most of them are moe-fests about the power of friendship that aim to portray cuteness over athleticism, or jiggly fanservice delivery devices. I wanted the equivalent of Haikyu!! or Run with the Wind: stories that portray the characters as serious competitors, scrappy underdogs scraping by through hard training and camaraderie. That's what I thought I wanted.    But now that I've seen Birdie Wing, I've seen the light. I didn't need a serious story about overcoming the odds and rising through the ranks. I needed a shonen story full of hotblooded rivalry and ridiculously over-the-top superpowered moves, but minus the obsession with bouncing tits. What I needed… was Birdie Wing.    Oh, I was skeptical at first.

Y'all can keep your “Cute Girls Gently Sharing Common Hobbies,” I'd like to order a double serving of “Vagrant Women Engaging in Spiritual Combat with Suggestive Sports Metaphors,” and pile on the extra cheese if you please.    My only complaint about Birdie Wing is that its modest productions values and flat direction don't always do the funny premise and genuinely likeable characters justice. This is the kind of series that only becomes funnier the more ironically impressive it looks, and some more sakuga would go a long way towards bringing the whole experience together. Still, Birdie Wing is an awful lot of fun, and I'm excited to see where these golf girls go in future episodes.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               I have to hand it to Birdie Wing – it has managed to make one of the most stultifying sports to watch interesting. That's due to a combination of some very nice animation and shot framing and a premise that I can get behind, which is one that stands to challenge the exclusivity of what can be a very snooty sport. (At least in my experience; it's kind of a summer person sport where I'm from.) For Eve and her sister Lily, golf isn't just about winning prestigious tournaments, it's about having money to keep their found family together, because they're all living what appears to be a very precarious life in the slums, and while the oldest sister does her best, it's leveraging Eve's golf skills that keeps body and soul together – or at least that's the implication.    That's something that the episode does a remarkable job of showing us without any clunky exposition. We see a corrupt cop shaking down the family for protection money, we see that Eve's earnings go directly to food, and we see that Eve only plays with three clubs, instead of the vast array that other players have in their bags. When Eve is filling in for an injured player, her caddy is surprised to see her choose what she deems inappropriate clubs for a shot; later we realize that Eve's using the only clubs she's used to playing with – the others just aren't comfortable for her because she's not had the opportunity to use them very often, if ever. When Helene, a girl her age who plays in tournaments, notes that Eve only has the three clubs, it drives home the point without ever explicitly saying, “She's poor and these clubs are all she can afford.”    The episode also takes its time to establish Eve and Lily as characters before bringing us into the fateful meeting that stands to shape Eve's future. It's not until the end of the episode that Eve and Aoi, her probable rival/friend, even meet. We see just enough of Aoi to get the impression that she's intensely competitive and living in a totally different world than Eve – again, through context clues rather than being flat-out told – and it isn't until she approaches Eve that we start to get an idea of how they'll affect each other. Aoi calls golf “sacred;” Eve says that she only plays for money, which is something that Eve can't possibly understand. While I don't give a damn about golf, seeing where this relationship goes looks like it'll be worth putting up with the spectacularly cheesy background music. Both Eve and Aoi have things that could benefit each other. How they'll develop should be worth watching.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               I think golf is pretty much the most boring sport in the world to watch. But as I've said before, sports anime live or die on their characters—the sport itself is nothing more than a catalyst for the show's interpersonal drama. And let me tell you, Birdie Wing has learned this lesson well. Instead of being set around a high school sports team or being about a newbie learning the sport for the first time, Birdie Wing follows Eve, a golf hustler who makes her money by winning underground matches against rich amateurs and moonlighting on the pro-circuit in disguise.    Honestly, it's a welcome change of pace—especially as Eve is a highly sympathetic character. Living in the slums, making money to keep a room over the head of orphans, it's impossible not to root for her as she pockets the money of the rich despite owning only three clubs herself. She's basically the Robin Hood of golf. It also helps that while Eve is no doubt talented, much of her skill comes from countless hours of hard work—despite rarely getting to play on anything as nice as an actual course. It looks like watching her rise to stardom will be a cathartic experience to say the least.    On the visual side of things, the anime looks great. From the shots of the dirty slums and vibrant golf courses to the surreal animation of Eve's Prince of Tennis-style special moves, everything is clear and detailed. (And did anyone else notice that Eve and Aoi look a lot like the transformation scene versions of Panty and Stocking? No? Just me? Okay.) Then we have the music. From surprise Eurobeat to a heartfelt ballad, it was fantastic throughout. It's a score I'd expect in an idol anime, not a sports one.    All in all, it's safe to say that Birdie Wing caught me completely off guard. It is easily the best sport anime we've seen so far this season and with its Megalobox meets Carole & Tuesday vibes, I am 100% here for it.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Let me say up top that you're best off going into this show with as little foreknowledge as possible. If you're at all curious about this series, or were planning to check it out if the reviews were good, or just have 30 minutes to kill, do yourself a favor: go in blind and let this premiere wash over you. That's what I did, and I'm confident saying that's the best way to experience whatever the hell Birdie Wing is doing.    Really, going into this with just a short preview and a key image, I was fully expecting a standard sports anime. Sure there was the novelty of it being a rather rare girls' sports show, but I've been here before. I knew what I was getting into. Then 90 seconds in our heroine peeled off a Lupin-style rubber mask to reveal she was a secret underground golfer who makes her living betting on games against pros and occasionally impersonating other golfers to help them place in tournaments. Then I learned she does all this to support her found family of undocumented immigrants who run a dive bar and take care of three orphaned children. THEN she went off to play a midnight, high-stakes golf match against a woman in a clown mask on a golf course built on top of active train tracks. And right about there I realized I had no clue where this show was going, but I needed to find out.    It's the kind a pure-hearted anime bullshit that gets talked about a lot, but only occasionally pops up for real, and I ate it right up. Every couple of minutes this premiere found some new idea or element to blindside me with, and it pulled me through the entire episode in record time. A moody music video interlude of Eve looking solemnly over the slums of her home town? Osamu Dezaki-esque postcard memories to punctuate our heroine's cool lines about golf? Her rival striking an Obari Pose before showing off her absurdly long driver that powers he own cartoony style of golf? All of that and far more, to the point where it legitimately started to feel like this wasn't a real show, but an elaborate prank laser targeted at me and my online friend circle.    The only real hangup is that I don't know how long this show can keep that kind of energy up. It's already showing some strains in its production, and while the golf sections are conceptually creative, they struggle to deliver that energy in motion. Sk8 the Infinity, this show's closest cousin, managed its bawdy mix of skateboarding and pro-wrestling with fantastic visuals and pulse-pounding races, and I don't think this series has that in its cards. This could all very well fall apart in a few episodes once it runs out of ideas or the drawings start melting, and that would be a huge bummer.    But those are problems for Future Nick to worry about. In the here and now, this was an absolute blast to watch from start to finish. God knows I never expected to say that about a golf anime. If you were coming here looking for a serious and down-to-earth girls' sports show, I'm sorry. There's nothing for you here. But if you're at all intrigued by this nonsense I've been rambling out, give it a shot.

Streaming                     Synopsis:             After he sees a particularly skillful player during a televised futsal match, high schooler Haru Yamato becomes inspired to play the sport, despite some uncomfortable associations with it. He enrolls at Koyo Gakuen with the intent to play on their team, only to find that it's very small and perhaps doesn't have the greatest track record. Undeterred, he and his fellow players work their hardest to propel Koyo into the national spotlight, but that will require more than just improving their individual skills: they've got a lot to learn about playing as a team before they can even begin to rise to the heights they aspire to.      Review:         Synopsis:        After he sees a particularly skillful player during a televised futsal match, high schooler Haru Yamato becomes inspired to play the sport, despite some uncomfortable associations with it. He enrolls at Koyo Gakuen with the intent to play on their team, only to find that it's very small and perhaps doesn't have the greatest track record. Undeterred, he and his fellow players work their hardest to propel Koyo into the national spotlight, but that will require more than just improving their individual skills: they've got a lot to learn about playing as a team before they can even begin to rise to the heights they aspire to.     Review:            In the novel Reaper Man, the late, great Terry Pratchett remarked that “Five exclamation marks [are] the sure sign of an insane mind.” While Futsal Boys!!!!! isn't alone in its enthusiasm for its own title, it also isn't up to the task of living up to it, either in terms of sports-related lunacy or its love of its subject matter – the series is clearly modeling itself after other, more successful sports titles and making that fact just a little too obvious as it strives to capture its audience and makes more than a few missteps along the way.    The most obvious influence on the series would appear to be volleyball series Haikyu!!. That's not just because it's about an underdog team playing a ball sport, but rather because the character dynamics are set up to mimic those which were so successful in Haikyu!!. We have the incredibly excited newcomer, Haru, to fill the Hinata role, grumpy egotistical former star player Sakaki as Kageyama, a bouncy duo, a stoic(ish) captain, and even a third-year player who spends most of the games on the bench so that the perky, talented first years can play. While these character types certainly aren't unique to Haikyu!!, that series is among the most recent to make them a roaring success, and the fact that they're all so easily recognizable in Futsal Boys!!!!! isn't a great sign – especially since the series doesn't give itself the time to develop them into characters beyond their tropes and as a result lacks any real sense of tension or urgency.    Mostly this is an issue of allocation. With only twelve episodes, the series is mostly invested in coming to a conclusion where we've seen the Koyo team improve but unwilling to spend the time to make us care that they've become better players. It isn't enough to harp on Sakaki's unwillingness to pass the ball to anyone; we need to understand why this is an issue long before we do, and the same could be said of most of the team. Captain Toi's preferred group dynamic isn't even mentioned before the final episode, and Taiga's anxiety issues are barely covered before they're once again shoved into the background. Likewise the fact that Haru was studying break dancing (and was really pretty good at it) is barely incorporated into the story, despite the fact that in the first game we see him play he whips out a move that helps him to score a goal. While that one specific move does come back every so often, it's still underutilized, as is his apparently very transferrable skill in general. Why bother to give him that piece of background if it's not going to be used on the regular, especially if it's established early on that using it isn't cheating? Similarly, the issue of Haru's father being a futsal star is barely touched on, which is perhaps the oddest of all of the series' omissions. Shouldn't the other players find this more interesting or significant? Granted, “Yamato” isn't exactly a unique last name, but it's still strikingly odd that his past gets barely any screentime.    What does get most of the series' attention is the vast number of pretty high school boys with oddball uniforms. Koyo plays against several teams in official matches, one of which has a truly unfortunate uniform that combines pastel pink with white tiger stripes (even worse when we consider that most of the Adelbert Gakuen boys have pastel hair), and we meet at least two others, one while at a training camp and the other in passing. The former is made up entirely of professional entertainers and seems to serve very little purpose besides making sure that “hot idols” is ticked off the checklist of “stuff that appeals to girls,” while the latter is the premier high school team in our heroes' region. In fact, their star player is the guy whose moves inspired Haru, but a couple of low-key meetings and a failed grudge match between the two of them doesn't quite merit their presence in the story, which could have moved along with Yamato's idol remaining an off-screen aspiration. That, at least, would have kept their “escaped from a marching band” school uniforms from assaulting our eyes.    This brings us to the series' main fault: it feels very much as if it's just going down a list of things that have done well in shows with male casts that appeal to female viewers in the past without actually realizing what made those shows work. In my own experience, what is primarily appealing about shows like Haikyu!! or IDOLiSH7 is not the fact that they're populated with pretty boys, but the character development and interactions. They could just as easily star garden slugs and be as good, because the ways that the various players evolve as characters is the draw. The team format simply allows for those interactions and developments to happen, and simply being a collection of attractive characters isn't enough to move things along. While Futsal Boys!!!!! does make a token effort in that direction, specifically with the Taiga/Ryu friendship and the Haru/Sakaki rivalry, it doesn't spend the time to make them stand out in the otherwise crowded series. Yes, it's fun to see them play a game and win, but that's not enough to carry an entire story, and just throwing in bits and pieces that have worked in other titles isn't going to make this one particularly memorable.    It's a shame, because futsal (a soccer/football variant developed in Uruguay) isn't a sport that gets a lot of anime airtime and there are elements of this series that are appealing. It also isn't helped by the fact that the art often has perspective issues and that post-action shots are often just a frame or two too long. The voice acting is also fine, although I feel as if there are more effort noises than are typical; possibly this is because the music is a bit underwhelming, making them stand out more. This just isn't as good a story as it could have been, bogged down by trying to throw in too many elements of other, more successful shows and not spending the time to develop any one of them. If you're desperate for a sports show that incorporates futsal, well, maybe check out DAYS instead. Otherwise, this will do in a pinch.             Grade:      Overall (sub) : C Story : C- Animation : B- Art : B- Music : C  + Decent premise and character designs, a few interesting story elements. − Premise and plot aren't used well in favor of cramming in too many popular bits and pieces, story doesn't develop fully.

Streaming                     Synopsis:             After he sees a particularly skillful player during a televised futsal match, high schooler Haru Yamato becomes inspired to play the sport, despite some uncomfortable associations with it. He enrolls at Koyo Gakuen with the intent to play on their team, only to find that it's very small and perhaps doesn't have the greatest track record. Undeterred, he and his fellow players work their hardest to propel Koyo into the national spotlight, but that will require more than just improving their individual skills: they've got a lot to learn about playing as a team before they can even begin to rise to the heights they aspire to.      Review:         Synopsis:        After he sees a particularly skillful player during a televised futsal match, high schooler Haru Yamato becomes inspired to play the sport, despite some uncomfortable associations with it. He enrolls at Koyo Gakuen with the intent to play on their team, only to find that it's very small and perhaps doesn't have the greatest track record. Undeterred, he and his fellow players work their hardest to propel Koyo into the national spotlight, but that will require more than just improving their individual skills: they've got a lot to learn about playing as a team before they can even begin to rise to the heights they aspire to.     Review:            In the novel Reaper Man, the late, great Terry Pratchett remarked that “Five exclamation marks [are] the sure sign of an insane mind.” While Futsal Boys!!!!! isn't alone in its enthusiasm for its own title, it also isn't up to the task of living up to it, either in terms of sports-related lunacy or its love of its subject matter – the series is clearly modeling itself after other, more successful sports titles and making that fact just a little too obvious as it strives to capture its audience and makes more than a few missteps along the way.    The most obvious influence on the series would appear to be volleyball series Haikyu!!. That's not just because it's about an underdog team playing a ball sport, but rather because the character dynamics are set up to mimic those which were so successful in Haikyu!!. We have the incredibly excited newcomer, Haru, to fill the Hinata role, grumpy egotistical former star player Sakaki as Kageyama, a bouncy duo, a stoic(ish) captain, and even a third-year player who spends most of the games on the bench so that the perky, talented first years can play. While these character types certainly aren't unique to Haikyu!!, that series is among the most recent to make them a roaring success, and the fact that they're all so easily recognizable in Futsal Boys!!!!! isn't a great sign – especially since the series doesn't give itself the time to develop them into characters beyond their tropes and as a result lacks any real sense of tension or urgency.    Mostly this is an issue of allocation. With only twelve episodes, the series is mostly invested in coming to a conclusion where we've seen the Koyo team improve but unwilling to spend the time to make us care that they've become better players. It isn't enough to harp on Sakaki's unwillingness to pass the ball to anyone; we need to understand why this is an issue long before we do, and the same could be said of most of the team. Captain Toi's preferred group dynamic isn't even mentioned before the final episode, and Taiga's anxiety issues are barely covered before they're once again shoved into the background. Likewise the fact that Haru was studying break dancing (and was really pretty good at it) is barely incorporated into the story, despite the fact that in the first game we see him play he whips out a move that helps him to score a goal. While that one specific move does come back every so often, it's still underutilized, as is his apparently very transferrable skill in general. Why bother to give him that piece of background if it's not going to be used on the regular, especially if it's established early on that using it isn't cheating? Similarly, the issue of Haru's father being a futsal star is barely touched on, which is perhaps the oddest of all of the series' omissions. Shouldn't the other players find this more interesting or significant? Granted, “Yamato” isn't exactly a unique last name, but it's still strikingly odd that his past gets barely any screentime.    What does get most of the series' attention is the vast number of pretty high school boys with oddball uniforms. Koyo plays against several teams in official matches, one of which has a truly unfortunate uniform that combines pastel pink with white tiger stripes (even worse when we consider that most of the Adelbert Gakuen boys have pastel hair), and we meet at least two others, one while at a training camp and the other in passing. The former is made up entirely of professional entertainers and seems to serve very little purpose besides making sure that “hot idols” is ticked off the checklist of “stuff that appeals to girls,” while the latter is the premier high school team in our heroes' region. In fact, their star player is the guy whose moves inspired Haru, but a couple of low-key meetings and a failed grudge match between the two of them doesn't quite merit their presence in the story, which could have moved along with Yamato's idol remaining an off-screen aspiration. That, at least, would have kept their “escaped from a marching band” school uniforms from assaulting our eyes.    This brings us to the series' main fault: it feels very much as if it's just going down a list of things that have done well in shows with male casts that appeal to female viewers in the past without actually realizing what made those shows work. In my own experience, what is primarily appealing about shows like Haikyu!! or IDOLiSH7 is not the fact that they're populated with pretty boys, but the character development and interactions. They could just as easily star garden slugs and be as good, because the ways that the various players evolve as characters is the draw. The team format simply allows for those interactions and developments to happen, and simply being a collection of attractive characters isn't enough to move things along. While Futsal Boys!!!!! does make a token effort in that direction, specifically with the Taiga/Ryu friendship and the Haru/Sakaki rivalry, it doesn't spend the time to make them stand out in the otherwise crowded series. Yes, it's fun to see them play a game and win, but that's not enough to carry an entire story, and just throwing in bits and pieces that have worked in other titles isn't going to make this one particularly memorable.    It's a shame, because futsal (a soccer/football variant developed in Uruguay) isn't a sport that gets a lot of anime airtime and there are elements of this series that are appealing. It also isn't helped by the fact that the art often has perspective issues and that post-action shots are often just a frame or two too long. The voice acting is also fine, although I feel as if there are more effort noises than are typical; possibly this is because the music is a bit underwhelming, making them stand out more. This just isn't as good a story as it could have been, bogged down by trying to throw in too many elements of other, more successful shows and not spending the time to develop any one of them. If you're desperate for a sports show that incorporates futsal, well, maybe check out DAYS instead. Otherwise, this will do in a pinch.             Grade:      Overall (sub) : C Story : C- Animation : B- Art : B- Music : C  + Decent premise and character designs, a few interesting story elements. − Premise and plot aren't used well in favor of cramming in too many popular bits and pieces, story doesn't develop fully.

Streaming                     Synopsis:             After he sees a particularly skillful player during a televised futsal match, high schooler Haru Yamato becomes inspired to play the sport, despite some uncomfortable associations with it. He enrolls at Koyo Gakuen with the intent to play on their team, only to find that it's very small and perhaps doesn't have the greatest track record. Undeterred, he and his fellow players work their hardest to propel Koyo into the national spotlight, but that will require more than just improving their individual skills: they've got a lot to learn about playing as a team before they can even begin to rise to the heights they aspire to.      Review:         Synopsis:        After he sees a particularly skillful player during a televised futsal match, high schooler Haru Yamato becomes inspired to play the sport, despite some uncomfortable associations with it. He enrolls at Koyo Gakuen with the intent to play on their team, only to find that it's very small and perhaps doesn't have the greatest track record. Undeterred, he and his fellow players work their hardest to propel Koyo into the national spotlight, but that will require more than just improving their individual skills: they've got a lot to learn about playing as a team before they can even begin to rise to the heights they aspire to.     Review:            In the novel Reaper Man, the late, great Terry Pratchett remarked that “Five exclamation marks [are] the sure sign of an insane mind.” While Futsal Boys!!!!! isn't alone in its enthusiasm for its own title, it also isn't up to the task of living up to it, either in terms of sports-related lunacy or its love of its subject matter – the series is clearly modeling itself after other, more successful sports titles and making that fact just a little too obvious as it strives to capture its audience and makes more than a few missteps along the way.    The most obvious influence on the series would appear to be volleyball series Haikyu!!. That's not just because it's about an underdog team playing a ball sport, but rather because the character dynamics are set up to mimic those which were so successful in Haikyu!!. We have the incredibly excited newcomer, Haru, to fill the Hinata role, grumpy egotistical former star player Sakaki as Kageyama, a bouncy duo, a stoic(ish) captain, and even a third-year player who spends most of the games on the bench so that the perky, talented first years can play. While these character types certainly aren't unique to Haikyu!!, that series is among the most recent to make them a roaring success, and the fact that they're all so easily recognizable in Futsal Boys!!!!! isn't a great sign – especially since the series doesn't give itself the time to develop them into characters beyond their tropes and as a result lacks any real sense of tension or urgency.    Mostly this is an issue of allocation. With only twelve episodes, the series is mostly invested in coming to a conclusion where we've seen the Koyo team improve but unwilling to spend the time to make us care that they've become better players. It isn't enough to harp on Sakaki's unwillingness to pass the ball to anyone; we need to understand why this is an issue long before we do, and the same could be said of most of the team. Captain Toi's preferred group dynamic isn't even mentioned before the final episode, and Taiga's anxiety issues are barely covered before they're once again shoved into the background. Likewise the fact that Haru was studying break dancing (and was really pretty good at it) is barely incorporated into the story, despite the fact that in the first game we see him play he whips out a move that helps him to score a goal. While that one specific move does come back every so often, it's still underutilized, as is his apparently very transferrable skill in general. Why bother to give him that piece of background if it's not going to be used on the regular, especially if it's established early on that using it isn't cheating? Similarly, the issue of Haru's father being a futsal star is barely touched on, which is perhaps the oddest of all of the series' omissions. Shouldn't the other players find this more interesting or significant? Granted, “Yamato” isn't exactly a unique last name, but it's still strikingly odd that his past gets barely any screentime.    What does get most of the series' attention is the vast number of pretty high school boys with oddball uniforms. Koyo plays against several teams in official matches, one of which has a truly unfortunate uniform that combines pastel pink with white tiger stripes (even worse when we consider that most of the Adelbert Gakuen boys have pastel hair), and we meet at least two others, one while at a training camp and the other in passing. The former is made up entirely of professional entertainers and seems to serve very little purpose besides making sure that “hot idols” is ticked off the checklist of “stuff that appeals to girls,” while the latter is the premier high school team in our heroes' region. In fact, their star player is the guy whose moves inspired Haru, but a couple of low-key meetings and a failed grudge match between the two of them doesn't quite merit their presence in the story, which could have moved along with Yamato's idol remaining an off-screen aspiration. That, at least, would have kept their “escaped from a marching band” school uniforms from assaulting our eyes.    This brings us to the series' main fault: it feels very much as if it's just going down a list of things that have done well in shows with male casts that appeal to female viewers in the past without actually realizing what made those shows work. In my own experience, what is primarily appealing about shows like Haikyu!! or IDOLiSH7 is not the fact that they're populated with pretty boys, but the character development and interactions. They could just as easily star garden slugs and be as good, because the ways that the various players evolve as characters is the draw. The team format simply allows for those interactions and developments to happen, and simply being a collection of attractive characters isn't enough to move things along. While Futsal Boys!!!!! does make a token effort in that direction, specifically with the Taiga/Ryu friendship and the Haru/Sakaki rivalry, it doesn't spend the time to make them stand out in the otherwise crowded series. Yes, it's fun to see them play a game and win, but that's not enough to carry an entire story, and just throwing in bits and pieces that have worked in other titles isn't going to make this one particularly memorable.    It's a shame, because futsal (a soccer/football variant developed in Uruguay) isn't a sport that gets a lot of anime airtime and there are elements of this series that are appealing. It also isn't helped by the fact that the art often has perspective issues and that post-action shots are often just a frame or two too long. The voice acting is also fine, although I feel as if there are more effort noises than are typical; possibly this is because the music is a bit underwhelming, making them stand out more. This just isn't as good a story as it could have been, bogged down by trying to throw in too many elements of other, more successful shows and not spending the time to develop any one of them. If you're desperate for a sports show that incorporates futsal, well, maybe check out DAYS instead. Otherwise, this will do in a pinch.             Grade:      Overall (sub) : C Story : C- Animation : B- Art : B- Music : C  + Decent premise and character designs, a few interesting story elements. − Premise and plot aren't used well in favor of cramming in too many popular bits and pieces, story doesn't develop fully.

Streaming                     Synopsis:             After he sees a particularly skillful player during a televised futsal match, high schooler Haru Yamato becomes inspired to play the sport, despite some uncomfortable associations with it. He enrolls at Koyo Gakuen with the intent to play on their team, only to find that it's very small and perhaps doesn't have the greatest track record. Undeterred, he and his fellow players work their hardest to propel Koyo into the national spotlight, but that will require more than just improving their individual skills: they've got a lot to learn about playing as a team before they can even begin to rise to the heights they aspire to.      Review:         Synopsis:        After he sees a particularly skillful player during a televised futsal match, high schooler Haru Yamato becomes inspired to play the sport, despite some uncomfortable associations with it. He enrolls at Koyo Gakuen with the intent to play on their team, only to find that it's very small and perhaps doesn't have the greatest track record. Undeterred, he and his fellow players work their hardest to propel Koyo into the national spotlight, but that will require more than just improving their individual skills: they've got a lot to learn about playing as a team before they can even begin to rise to the heights they aspire to.     Review:            In the novel Reaper Man, the late, great Terry Pratchett remarked that “Five exclamation marks [are] the sure sign of an insane mind.” While Futsal Boys!!!!! isn't alone in its enthusiasm for its own title, it also isn't up to the task of living up to it, either in terms of sports-related lunacy or its love of its subject matter – the series is clearly modeling itself after other, more successful sports titles and making that fact just a little too obvious as it strives to capture its audience and makes more than a few missteps along the way.    The most obvious influence on the series would appear to be volleyball series Haikyu!!. That's not just because it's about an underdog team playing a ball sport, but rather because the character dynamics are set up to mimic those which were so successful in Haikyu!!. We have the incredibly excited newcomer, Haru, to fill the Hinata role, grumpy egotistical former star player Sakaki as Kageyama, a bouncy duo, a stoic(ish) captain, and even a third-year player who spends most of the games on the bench so that the perky, talented first years can play. While these character types certainly aren't unique to Haikyu!!, that series is among the most recent to make them a roaring success, and the fact that they're all so easily recognizable in Futsal Boys!!!!! isn't a great sign – especially since the series doesn't give itself the time to develop them into characters beyond their tropes and as a result lacks any real sense of tension or urgency.    Mostly this is an issue of allocation. With only twelve episodes, the series is mostly invested in coming to a conclusion where we've seen the Koyo team improve but unwilling to spend the time to make us care that they've become better players. It isn't enough to harp on Sakaki's unwillingness to pass the ball to anyone; we need to understand why this is an issue long before we do, and the same could be said of most of the team. Captain Toi's preferred group dynamic isn't even mentioned before the final episode, and Taiga's anxiety issues are barely covered before they're once again shoved into the background. Likewise the fact that Haru was studying break dancing (and was really pretty good at it) is barely incorporated into the story, despite the fact that in the first game we see him play he whips out a move that helps him to score a goal. While that one specific move does come back every so often, it's still underutilized, as is his apparently very transferrable skill in general. Why bother to give him that piece of background if it's not going to be used on the regular, especially if it's established early on that using it isn't cheating? Similarly, the issue of Haru's father being a futsal star is barely touched on, which is perhaps the oddest of all of the series' omissions. Shouldn't the other players find this more interesting or significant? Granted, “Yamato” isn't exactly a unique last name, but it's still strikingly odd that his past gets barely any screentime.    What does get most of the series' attention is the vast number of pretty high school boys with oddball uniforms. Koyo plays against several teams in official matches, one of which has a truly unfortunate uniform that combines pastel pink with white tiger stripes (even worse when we consider that most of the Adelbert Gakuen boys have pastel hair), and we meet at least two others, one while at a training camp and the other in passing. The former is made up entirely of professional entertainers and seems to serve very little purpose besides making sure that “hot idols” is ticked off the checklist of “stuff that appeals to girls,” while the latter is the premier high school team in our heroes' region. In fact, their star player is the guy whose moves inspired Haru, but a couple of low-key meetings and a failed grudge match between the two of them doesn't quite merit their presence in the story, which could have moved along with Yamato's idol remaining an off-screen aspiration. That, at least, would have kept their “escaped from a marching band” school uniforms from assaulting our eyes.    This brings us to the series' main fault: it feels very much as if it's just going down a list of things that have done well in shows with male casts that appeal to female viewers in the past without actually realizing what made those shows work. In my own experience, what is primarily appealing about shows like Haikyu!! or IDOLiSH7 is not the fact that they're populated with pretty boys, but the character development and interactions. They could just as easily star garden slugs and be as good, because the ways that the various players evolve as characters is the draw. The team format simply allows for those interactions and developments to happen, and simply being a collection of attractive characters isn't enough to move things along. While Futsal Boys!!!!! does make a token effort in that direction, specifically with the Taiga/Ryu friendship and the Haru/Sakaki rivalry, it doesn't spend the time to make them stand out in the otherwise crowded series. Yes, it's fun to see them play a game and win, but that's not enough to carry an entire story, and just throwing in bits and pieces that have worked in other titles isn't going to make this one particularly memorable.    It's a shame, because futsal (a soccer/football variant developed in Uruguay) isn't a sport that gets a lot of anime airtime and there are elements of this series that are appealing. It also isn't helped by the fact that the art often has perspective issues and that post-action shots are often just a frame or two too long. The voice acting is also fine, although I feel as if there are more effort noises than are typical; possibly this is because the music is a bit underwhelming, making them stand out more. This just isn't as good a story as it could have been, bogged down by trying to throw in too many elements of other, more successful shows and not spending the time to develop any one of them. If you're desperate for a sports show that incorporates futsal, well, maybe check out DAYS instead. Otherwise, this will do in a pinch.             Grade:      Overall (sub) : C Story : C- Animation : B- Art : B- Music : C  + Decent premise and character designs, a few interesting story elements. − Premise and plot aren't used well in favor of cramming in too many popular bits and pieces, story doesn't develop fully.

Streaming                     Synopsis:             After he sees a particularly skillful player during a televised futsal match, high schooler Haru Yamato becomes inspired to play the sport, despite some uncomfortable associations with it. He enrolls at Koyo Gakuen with the intent to play on their team, only to find that it's very small and perhaps doesn't have the greatest track record. Undeterred, he and his fellow players work their hardest to propel Koyo into the national spotlight, but that will require more than just improving their individual skills: they've got a lot to learn about playing as a team before they can even begin to rise to the heights they aspire to.      Review:         Synopsis:        After he sees a particularly skillful player during a televised futsal match, high schooler Haru Yamato becomes inspired to play the sport, despite some uncomfortable associations with it. He enrolls at Koyo Gakuen with the intent to play on their team, only to find that it's very small and perhaps doesn't have the greatest track record. Undeterred, he and his fellow players work their hardest to propel Koyo into the national spotlight, but that will require more than just improving their individual skills: they've got a lot to learn about playing as a team before they can even begin to rise to the heights they aspire to.     Review:            In the novel Reaper Man, the late, great Terry Pratchett remarked that “Five exclamation marks [are] the sure sign of an insane mind.” While Futsal Boys!!!!! isn't alone in its enthusiasm for its own title, it also isn't up to the task of living up to it, either in terms of sports-related lunacy or its love of its subject matter – the series is clearly modeling itself after other, more successful sports titles and making that fact just a little too obvious as it strives to capture its audience and makes more than a few missteps along the way.    The most obvious influence on the series would appear to be volleyball series Haikyu!!. That's not just because it's about an underdog team playing a ball sport, but rather because the character dynamics are set up to mimic those which were so successful in Haikyu!!. We have the incredibly excited newcomer, Haru, to fill the Hinata role, grumpy egotistical former star player Sakaki as Kageyama, a bouncy duo, a stoic(ish) captain, and even a third-year player who spends most of the games on the bench so that the perky, talented first years can play. While these character types certainly aren't unique to Haikyu!!, that series is among the most recent to make them a roaring success, and the fact that they're all so easily recognizable in Futsal Boys!!!!! isn't a great sign – especially since the series doesn't give itself the time to develop them into characters beyond their tropes and as a result lacks any real sense of tension or urgency.    Mostly this is an issue of allocation. With only twelve episodes, the series is mostly invested in coming to a conclusion where we've seen the Koyo team improve but unwilling to spend the time to make us care that they've become better players. It isn't enough to harp on Sakaki's unwillingness to pass the ball to anyone; we need to understand why this is an issue long before we do, and the same could be said of most of the team. Captain Toi's preferred group dynamic isn't even mentioned before the final episode, and Taiga's anxiety issues are barely covered before they're once again shoved into the background. Likewise the fact that Haru was studying break dancing (and was really pretty good at it) is barely incorporated into the story, despite the fact that in the first game we see him play he whips out a move that helps him to score a goal. While that one specific move does come back every so often, it's still underutilized, as is his apparently very transferrable skill in general. Why bother to give him that piece of background if it's not going to be used on the regular, especially if it's established early on that using it isn't cheating? Similarly, the issue of Haru's father being a futsal star is barely touched on, which is perhaps the oddest of all of the series' omissions. Shouldn't the other players find this more interesting or significant? Granted, “Yamato” isn't exactly a unique last name, but it's still strikingly odd that his past gets barely any screentime.    What does get most of the series' attention is the vast number of pretty high school boys with oddball uniforms. Koyo plays against several teams in official matches, one of which has a truly unfortunate uniform that combines pastel pink with white tiger stripes (even worse when we consider that most of the Adelbert Gakuen boys have pastel hair), and we meet at least two others, one while at a training camp and the other in passing. The former is made up entirely of professional entertainers and seems to serve very little purpose besides making sure that “hot idols” is ticked off the checklist of “stuff that appeals to girls,” while the latter is the premier high school team in our heroes' region. In fact, their star player is the guy whose moves inspired Haru, but a couple of low-key meetings and a failed grudge match between the two of them doesn't quite merit their presence in the story, which could have moved along with Yamato's idol remaining an off-screen aspiration. That, at least, would have kept their “escaped from a marching band” school uniforms from assaulting our eyes.    This brings us to the series' main fault: it feels very much as if it's just going down a list of things that have done well in shows with male casts that appeal to female viewers in the past without actually realizing what made those shows work. In my own experience, what is primarily appealing about shows like Haikyu!! or IDOLiSH7 is not the fact that they're populated with pretty boys, but the character development and interactions. They could just as easily star garden slugs and be as good, because the ways that the various players evolve as characters is the draw. The team format simply allows for those interactions and developments to happen, and simply being a collection of attractive characters isn't enough to move things along. While Futsal Boys!!!!! does make a token effort in that direction, specifically with the Taiga/Ryu friendship and the Haru/Sakaki rivalry, it doesn't spend the time to make them stand out in the otherwise crowded series. Yes, it's fun to see them play a game and win, but that's not enough to carry an entire story, and just throwing in bits and pieces that have worked in other titles isn't going to make this one particularly memorable.    It's a shame, because futsal (a soccer/football variant developed in Uruguay) isn't a sport that gets a lot of anime airtime and there are elements of this series that are appealing. It also isn't helped by the fact that the art often has perspective issues and that post-action shots are often just a frame or two too long. The voice acting is also fine, although I feel as if there are more effort noises than are typical; possibly this is because the music is a bit underwhelming, making them stand out more. This just isn't as good a story as it could have been, bogged down by trying to throw in too many elements of other, more successful shows and not spending the time to develop any one of them. If you're desperate for a sports show that incorporates futsal, well, maybe check out DAYS instead. Otherwise, this will do in a pinch.             Grade:      Overall (sub) : C Story : C- Animation : B- Art : B- Music : C  + Decent premise and character designs, a few interesting story elements. − Premise and plot aren't used well in favor of cramming in too many popular bits and pieces, story doesn't develop fully.

It isn't enough to harp on Sakaki's unwillingness to pass the ball to anyone; we need to understand why this is an issue long before we do, and the same could be said of most of the team. Captain Toi's preferred group dynamic isn't even mentioned before the final episode, and Taiga's anxiety issues are barely covered before they're once again shoved into the background. Likewise the fact that Haru was studying break dancing (and was really pretty good at it) is barely incorporated into the story, despite the fact that in the first game we see him play he whips out a move that helps him to score a goal. While that one specific move does come back every so often, it's still underutilized, as is his apparently very transferrable skill in general. Why bother to give him that piece of background if it's not going to be used on the regular, especially if it's established early on that using it isn't cheating? Similarly, the issue of Haru's father being a futsal star is barely touched on, which is perhaps the oddest of all of the series' omissions. Shouldn't the other players find this more interesting or significant? Granted, “Yamato” isn't exactly a unique last name, but it's still strikingly odd that his past gets barely any screentime.    What does get most of the series' attention is the vast number of pretty high school boys with oddball uniforms. Koyo plays against several teams in official matches, one of which has a truly unfortunate uniform that combines pastel pink with white tiger stripes (even worse when we consider that most of the Adelbert Gakuen boys have pastel hair), and we meet at least two others, one while at a training camp and the other in passing. The former is made up entirely of professional entertainers and seems to serve very little purpose besides making sure that “hot idols” is ticked off the checklist of “stuff that appeals to girls,” while the latter is the premier high school team in our heroes' region. In fact, their star player is the guy whose moves inspired Haru, but a couple of low-key meetings and a failed grudge match between the two of them doesn't quite merit their presence in the story, which could have moved along with Yamato's idol remaining an off-screen aspiration. That, at least, would have kept their “escaped from a marching band” school uniforms from assaulting our eyes.    This brings us to the series' main fault: it feels very much as if it's just going down a list of things that have done well in shows with male casts that appeal to female viewers in the past without actually realizing what made those shows work. In my own experience, what is primarily appealing about shows like Haikyu!! or IDOLiSH7 is not the fact that they're populated with pretty boys, but the character development and interactions. They could just as easily star garden slugs and be as good, because the ways that the various players evolve as characters is the draw. The team format simply allows for those interactions and developments to happen, and simply being a collection of attractive characters isn't enough to move things along. While Futsal Boys!!!!! does make a token effort in that direction, specifically with the Taiga/Ryu friendship and the Haru/Sakaki rivalry, it doesn't spend the time to make them stand out in the otherwise crowded series. Yes, it's fun to see them play a game and win, but that's not enough to carry an entire story, and just throwing in bits and pieces that have worked in other titles isn't going to make this one particularly memorable.    It's a shame, because futsal (a soccer/football variant developed in Uruguay) isn't a sport that gets a lot of anime airtime and there are elements of this series that are appealing. It also isn't helped by the fact that the art often has perspective issues and that post-action shots are often just a frame or two too long. The voice acting is also fine, although I feel as if there are more effort noises than are typical; possibly this is because the music is a bit underwhelming, making them stand out more. This just isn't as good a story as it could have been, bogged down by trying to throw in too many elements of other, more successful shows and not spending the time to develop any one of them. If you're desperate for a sports show that incorporates futsal, well, maybe check out DAYS instead. Otherwise, this will do in a pinch.

The most obvious influence on the series would appear to be volleyball series Haikyu!!. That's not just because it's about an underdog team playing a ball sport, but rather because the character dynamics are set up to mimic those which were so successful in Haikyu!!. We have the incredibly excited newcomer, Haru, to fill the Hinata role, grumpy egotistical former star player Sakaki as Kageyama, a bouncy duo, a stoic(ish) captain, and even a third-year player who spends most of the games on the bench so that the perky, talented first years can play. While these character types certainly aren't unique to Haikyu!!, that series is among the most recent to make them a roaring success, and the fact that they're all so easily recognizable in Futsal Boys!!!!! isn't a great sign – especially since the series doesn't give itself the time to develop them into characters beyond their tropes and as a result lacks any real sense of tension or urgency.

Streaming - Review - Anime News Network:SEA,"                    Synopsis:             After he sees a particularly skillful player during a televised futsal match, high schooler Haru Yamato becomes inspired to play the sport, despite some uncomfortable associations with it. He enrolls at Koyo Gakuen with the intent to play on their team, only to find that it's very small and perhaps doesn't have the greatest track record. Undeterred, he and his fellow players work their hardest to propel Koyo into the national spotlight, but that will require more than just improving their individual skills: they've got a lot to learn about playing as a team before they can even begin to rise to the heights they aspire to.      Review:         Synopsis:        After he sees a particularly skillful player during a televised futsal match, high schooler Haru Yamato becomes inspired to play the sport, despite some uncomfortable associations with it. He enrolls at Koyo Gakuen with the intent to play on their team, only to find that it's very small and perhaps doesn't have the greatest track record. Undeterred, he and his fellow players work their hardest to propel Koyo into the national spotlight, but that will require more than just improving their individual skills: they've got a lot to learn about playing as a team before they can even begin to rise to the heights they aspire to.     Review:            In the novel Reaper Man, the late, great Terry Pratchett remarked that “Five exclamation marks [are] the sure sign of an insane mind.” While Futsal Boys!!!!! isn't alone in its enthusiasm for its own title, it also isn't up to the task of living up to it, either in terms of sports-related lunacy or its love of its subject matter – the series is clearly modeling itself after other, more successful sports titles and making that fact just a little too obvious as it strives to capture its audience and makes more than a few missteps along the way.    The most obvious influence on the series would appear to be volleyball series Haikyu!!. That's not just because it's about an underdog team playing a ball sport, but rather because the character dynamics are set up to mimic those which were so successful in Haikyu!!. We have the incredibly excited newcomer, Haru, to fill the Hinata role, grumpy egotistical former star player Sakaki as Kageyama, a bouncy duo, a stoic(ish) captain, and even a third-year player who spends most of the games on the bench so that the perky, talented first years can play. While these character types certainly aren't unique to Haikyu!!, that series is among the most recent to make them a roaring success, and the fact that they're all so easily recognizable in Futsal Boys!!!!! isn't a great sign – especially since the series doesn't give itself the time to develop them into characters beyond their tropes and as a result lacks any real sense of tension or urgency.    Mostly this is an issue of allocation. With only twelve episodes, the series is mostly invested in coming to a conclusion where we've seen the Koyo team improve but unwilling to spend the time to make us care that they've become better players. It isn't enough to harp on Sakaki's unwillingness to pass the ball to anyone; we need to understand why this is an issue long before we do, and the same could be said of most of the team. Captain Toi's preferred group dynamic isn't even mentioned before the final episode, and Taiga's anxiety issues are barely covered before they're once again shoved into the background. Likewise the fact that Haru was studying break dancing (and was really pretty good at it) is barely incorporated into the story, despite the fact that in the first game we see him play he whips out a move that helps him to score a goal. While that one specific move does come back every so often, it's still underutilized, as is his apparently very transferrable skill in general. Why bother to give him that piece of background if it's not going to be used on the regular, especially if it's established early on that using it isn't cheating? Similarly, the issue of Haru's father being a futsal star is barely touched on, which is perhaps the oddest of all of the series' omissions. Shouldn't the other players find this more interesting or significant? Granted, “Yamato” isn't exactly a unique last name, but it's still strikingly odd that his past gets barely any screentime.    What does get most of the series' attention is the vast number of pretty high school boys with oddball uniforms. Koyo plays against several teams in official matches, one of which has a truly unfortunate uniform that combines pastel pink with white tiger stripes (even worse when we consider that most of the Adelbert Gakuen boys have pastel hair), and we meet at least two others, one while at a training camp and the other in passing. The former is made up entirely of professional entertainers and seems to serve very little purpose besides making sure that “hot idols” is ticked off the checklist of “stuff that appeals to girls,” while the latter is the premier high school team in our heroes' region. In fact, their star player is the guy whose moves inspired Haru, but a couple of low-key meetings and a failed grudge match between the two of them doesn't quite merit their presence in the story, which could have moved along with Yamato's idol remaining an off-screen aspiration. That, at least, would have kept their “escaped from a marching band” school uniforms from assaulting our eyes.    This brings us to the series' main fault: it feels very much as if it's just going down a list of things that have done well in shows with male casts that appeal to female viewers in the past without actually realizing what made those shows work. In my own experience, what is primarily appealing about shows like Haikyu!! or IDOLiSH7 is not the fact that they're populated with pretty boys, but the character development and interactions. They could just as easily star garden slugs and be as good, because the ways that the various players evolve as characters is the draw. The team format simply allows for those interactions and developments to happen, and simply being a collection of attractive characters isn't enough to move things along. While Futsal Boys!!!!! does make a token effort in that direction, specifically with the Taiga/Ryu friendship and the Haru/Sakaki rivalry, it doesn't spend the time to make them stand out in the otherwise crowded series. Yes, it's fun to see them play a game and win, but that's not enough to carry an entire story, and just throwing in bits and pieces that have worked in other titles isn't going to make this one particularly memorable.    It's a shame, because futsal (a soccer/football variant developed in Uruguay) isn't a sport that gets a lot of anime airtime and there are elements of this series that are appealing. It also isn't helped by the fact that the art often has perspective issues and that post-action shots are often just a frame or two too long. The voice acting is also fine, although I feel as if there are more effort noises than are typical; possibly this is because the music is a bit underwhelming, making them stand out more. This just isn't as good a story as it could have been, bogged down by trying to throw in too many elements of other, more successful shows and not spending the time to develop any one of them. If you're desperate for a sports show that incorporates futsal, well, maybe check out DAYS instead. Otherwise, this will do in a pinch.

Interest A Couple of Cuckoos Launches Heroine Popularity Contest Ahead of Anime's Debut   posted on 2022-04-14 21:45 UTC-8 by Kim Morrissy         Wedding ceremony illustrations also revealed    Miki Yoshikawa's A Couple of Cuckoos (Kakkō no Iinazuke) manga launched its first heroine popularity contest in Kodansha's Weekly Shōnen Magazine on Wednesday, ahead of the television anime's April 23 debut. The winning girl will get a ""solo photo collection""; publication details will be announced with the results of the contest.       In addition, the magazine revealed wedding ceremony illustrations of the four heroines Erika Amano, Hiro Segawa, and Sachi Umino, and Ai Mochizuki (pictured above).    Miki Yoshikawa  (Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches, Yankee-kun to Megane-chan) launched the A Couple of Cuckoos (Kakkō no Iinazuke) manga in Kodansha's Weekly Shōnen Magazine in January 2020. Kodansha Comics publishes the manga in English, and it describes the romantic comedy:    16-year-old super-studier Nagi Umino, second-year student at the Megurogawa Academy high school, was switched at birth. On his way to a dinner to meet his birth parents, he accidentally meets the brash, outspoken, Erika Amano, who is determined to make Nagi her fake boyfriend as she never wants to actually marry. But once Nagi makes it to dinner, he finds his parents have decided to resolve the hospital switch by conveniently having him marry the daughter his birth parents raised...who turns out to be none other than Erika herself!   The anime will premiere in the NUMAnimation programming block on TV Asahi and its affiliates on April 23. Crunchyroll will stream the anime outside Japan. The anime will run for two cours (quarters of the year) with no breaks in between. The spinoff mini anime Kakkō no Iikagen will premiere on Kadokawa Anime's YouTube channel on April 28.

In addition, the magazine revealed wedding ceremony illustrations of the four heroines Erika Amano, Hiro Segawa, and Sachi Umino, and Ai Mochizuki (pictured above).    Miki Yoshikawa  (Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches, Yankee-kun to Megane-chan) launched the A Couple of Cuckoos (Kakkō no Iinazuke) manga in Kodansha's Weekly Shōnen Magazine in January 2020. Kodansha Comics publishes the manga in English, and it describes the romantic comedy:    16-year-old super-studier Nagi Umino, second-year student at the Megurogawa Academy high school, was switched at birth. On his way to a dinner to meet his birth parents, he accidentally meets the brash, outspoken, Erika Amano, who is determined to make Nagi her fake boyfriend as she never wants to actually marry. But once Nagi makes it to dinner, he finds his parents have decided to resolve the hospital switch by conveniently having him marry the daughter his birth parents raised...who turns out to be none other than Erika herself!   The anime will premiere in the NUMAnimation programming block on TV Asahi and its affiliates on April 23. Crunchyroll will stream the anime outside Japan.

Apr 11th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Don't Hurt Me, My Healer! ?                     Community score: 2.6              What is this?   The ""isekai burnt-out adventurer comedy"" centers on two adventurers: the hopeless swordsman Arvin, and the sarcastic dark-elf healer Karla, who seems to be more talented with ticking people off than healing. (from manga)   Don't Hurt Me, My Healer! is based on Tannen ni Hakkō's Kono Healer, Mendokusai (This Healer's a Handful) manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Sundays.      How was the first episode?   James Beckett  Rating:                Full disclosure: Before getting to the premiere of Don't Hurt Me, My Healer!, I watched the new film Everything Everywhere all at once, and without derailing this review to cover a completely irrelevant and non-anime project, the film left me on Cloud Nine, so much so that I was guaranteed to enjoy practically anything in my post-masterpiece haze. You could have walked up and socked me right in the face, and I probably would have given the experience at least a two out of five. So, take my relatively positive score here with a grain of salt.    I'm not going to pretend that Don't Hurt Me, My Healer! is a great anime, or anything. A lot of its tryhard manzai-style humor is the kind of stuff that I usually find pretty grating, since so much of it boils down to one person acting like a manic lunatic for no particular reason, while the straight-man of the group explains in excruciating detail how their partner's behavior defies conventional expectations. “Wah, I tried to heal you, but I accidentally cursed you instead, because I'm grossly incompetent at my chosen profession!” “Well, that isn't how it was supposed to go!” Insert slide-whistle sound effect here. Still, “comedy is subjective” and all that, and it's my job to be honest with you, so here it goes: This incredibly stupid show made me laugh a few times, and I was never actively bored while I watched it.    In retrospect, a lot of my appreciation of this episode comes from the befuddled bear-thing simply trying to keep the two numbskull humans that it has only just met from self-annihilation-by-way-of-shenanigans. Arvin and Carla are, themselves, not especially hilarious, so a lot of the show's potential will depend on whether the characters they meet every week can balance out the altogether-too-muchness of the pair's whole shtick. Will everyone enjoy Don't Hurt Me, My Healer!? Lord, no. But it might prove to be a decent way to kill a half-hour if nothing else is on.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               You know how they say humor is subjective? Well, for me, this anime is less funny and more like pulling teeth: long, drawn-out, and painful. However, this should be no surprise; it's right there in the title, after all. In Japanese, this show is called “Kono Healer, Mendokusai,” which translates directly to “This Healer is a Pain to Deal With.” And holy crap do I feel that after watching this episode. In fact, it's not just the healer but the warrior and the bear as well; they're all a pain and I didn't enjoy a single moment of this episode.    Honestly, more than anything else, watching this episode felt like reading a particularly volatile comment section on a subject I cared nothing about. Instead of addressing each other's points, they change the subject, passively-aggressively attack each other, move the goalposts, and drag other people into it. It was at the moment the bear started talking that I realized what we were in for—that this argument was going to be our entire episode—and my heart filled with dread.    The only thing that got me through this episode (you know, besides being paid to watch it) was thinking about the simple question: “Is Carla really that dense or is she just messing with everyone?” Because, while it's presented as the former, I'm starting to think it's the latter. The real reason she doesn't have a party is not that she's incompetent, it's that she's a born sadist who gets off on causing people emotional pain. Every move she makes is calculated to get what she wants—be that a new mace or a person to torture. I doubt the so-called “curse” even exists; it's just her way of keeping her new punching bag at arm's length (though, I wouldn't put it past her to put an actual curse on him for the same reason).    Luckily, I am not cursed to remain around Carla nor do I have any reason to watch—much less think about—this series ever again. Good luck, Alvin. I wouldn't wish this hell upon anyone.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               There's nothing objectively offensive about Don't Hurt Me, My Healer!. It's just incredibly annoying. Or rather, Carla, the eponymous healer, is incredibly annoying. The premise, as I understood it prior to going in, is that dark elf Carla is a pretty terrible healer, doing the opposite of helping people despite her class. That may be true, although we don't see much evidence of it in this episode apart from the bit where she curses Alvin instead of healing him. What she is instead is intensely irritating, the anime equivalent of that mosquito that you can hear buzzing around your head in the night but can never quite find to squash. Somehow this is made worse by the fact that she's clearly meant to be funny; her attempts to be cutesy instead come off as grating and her every action is plainly self-serving. When she says that she's never been in a party before and Alvin remarks that, given her personality, that's not surprising, it's the truest statement in the episode.    Carla basically weighs the entire thing down, which is a shame because the show's not without other merits. Bear, the horned bear magibeast Alvin is initially fighting, is at least moderately amusing with the way that she can't seem to settle on a cute verbal affectation, cycling through “kuma,” “gao,” and “bear” with each new utterance. The fact that we never get to see Alvin's entire face is also pretty good, and watching the show come up with new ways to ensure that it's mostly hidden is both a fun poke at censorship via strategically placed item and just generally fun, especially since both Mostly and Carla are under the impression that his face is some sort of horror show of dullness. I also appreciate that Carla's healer outfit is perfectly normal and fully covering, which is unusual for a fantasy show; that it's practical as well is especially nice.    It's just too bad that Carla is so grating, and since she's the main character (or at least one of them, though who knows how long Alvin will last), that's a real problem. This has the unfortunate combination of very little plot, a thus-far uninteresting RPG-inspired fantasy world, and a character who just really rubbed me the wrong way. Your mileage may vary, but this wouldn't be my first choice for something to watch this season, even if you're hurting for any of its purported genres.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               There's nothing quite as unbearable as an unfunny comedy, is there? There have been some stinkers this season, some of them quantifiably worse than Don't Hurt Me, My Healer!, but nothing has felt quite as protracted and interminable as watching this premiere hammer its weak, wafer-thin premise into the ground for a full 20 minutes. It has one joke, which is at best mildly funny on paper, and it proceeds to flub telling that joke in what feels like the most excruciating bit of sketch comedy ever made. That it's actually a scripted, fully-animated TV show just makes it harder to sit through.    Ok, there was one joke that kind of got me to smile. The reveal that the generic rhino/bear monster wasn't just some random monster, but a character in her own right and basically the mediator between our two leads, was kind of funny. But the longer it went on the less funny it got, and by the third minute the gag had just folded itself in with the unfunny manzai banter of Alvin and Clara. Thus the one spark of comedic hope in this premiere faded into the night, never to be seen again, and there were still 14 minutes of this sucker to get through. And every joke from then on followed the same formula: Carla says something rude or arrogant, Alvin gets upset. At one point there's a gag about Carla not being able to properly heal his face (which he doesn't actually have) that lasts for eons and repeats the punchline a dozen times before it mercifully ends.    This is just the antithesis of charming comedy for me. It's rote, boring, and repetitive. Half the jokes are just Alvin yelling that Carla is being rude, as if shouting the point of a scene is inherently funny. And since the show is so barebones in art and animation, there's nothing to distract from how unfunny it is. It made for a miserable time, and unless you have a totally different sense of humor, there's nothing here for you.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review                Odd Taxi: In the Woods   Apr 17, 00:00                 anime    By cleverly reframing its narrative around a series of interviews with the supporting cast, Odd Taxi: In the Woods succeeds where most recap films fail: it's an artistically cohesive film in its own right. ― Odd Taxi was 2021's sleeper anime hit, telling an intricate, original mystery that kept viewers guessing every week.

Apr 11th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Don't Hurt Me, My Healer! ?                     Community score: 2.6              What is this?   The ""isekai burnt-out adventurer comedy"" centers on two adventurers: the hopeless swordsman Arvin, and the sarcastic dark-elf healer Karla, who seems to be more talented with ticking people off than healing. (from manga)   Don't Hurt Me, My Healer! is based on Tannen ni Hakkō's Kono Healer, Mendokusai (This Healer's a Handful) manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Sundays.      How was the first episode?   James Beckett  Rating:                Full disclosure: Before getting to the premiere of Don't Hurt Me, My Healer!, I watched the new film Everything Everywhere all at once, and without derailing this review to cover a completely irrelevant and non-anime project, the film left me on Cloud Nine, so much so that I was guaranteed to enjoy practically anything in my post-masterpiece haze. You could have walked up and socked me right in the face, and I probably would have given the experience at least a two out of five. So, take my relatively positive score here with a grain of salt.    I'm not going to pretend that Don't Hurt Me, My Healer! is a great anime, or anything. A lot of its tryhard manzai-style humor is the kind of stuff that I usually find pretty grating, since so much of it boils down to one person acting like a manic lunatic for no particular reason, while the straight-man of the group explains in excruciating detail how their partner's behavior defies conventional expectations. “Wah, I tried to heal you, but I accidentally cursed you instead, because I'm grossly incompetent at my chosen profession!” “Well, that isn't how it was supposed to go!” Insert slide-whistle sound effect here. Still, “comedy is subjective” and all that, and it's my job to be honest with you, so here it goes: This incredibly stupid show made me laugh a few times, and I was never actively bored while I watched it.    In retrospect, a lot of my appreciation of this episode comes from the befuddled bear-thing simply trying to keep the two numbskull humans that it has only just met from self-annihilation-by-way-of-shenanigans. Arvin and Carla are, themselves, not especially hilarious, so a lot of the show's potential will depend on whether the characters they meet every week can balance out the altogether-too-muchness of the pair's whole shtick. Will everyone enjoy Don't Hurt Me, My Healer!? Lord, no. But it might prove to be a decent way to kill a half-hour if nothing else is on.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               You know how they say humor is subjective? Well, for me, this anime is less funny and more like pulling teeth: long, drawn-out, and painful. However, this should be no surprise; it's right there in the title, after all. In Japanese, this show is called “Kono Healer, Mendokusai,” which translates directly to “This Healer is a Pain to Deal With.” And holy crap do I feel that after watching this episode. In fact, it's not just the healer but the warrior and the bear as well; they're all a pain and I didn't enjoy a single moment of this episode.    Honestly, more than anything else, watching this episode felt like reading a particularly volatile comment section on a subject I cared nothing about. Instead of addressing each other's points, they change the subject, passively-aggressively attack each other, move the goalposts, and drag other people into it. It was at the moment the bear started talking that I realized what we were in for—that this argument was going to be our entire episode—and my heart filled with dread.    The only thing that got me through this episode (you know, besides being paid to watch it) was thinking about the simple question: “Is Carla really that dense or is she just messing with everyone?” Because, while it's presented as the former, I'm starting to think it's the latter. The real reason she doesn't have a party is not that she's incompetent, it's that she's a born sadist who gets off on causing people emotional pain. Every move she makes is calculated to get what she wants—be that a new mace or a person to torture. I doubt the so-called “curse” even exists; it's just her way of keeping her new punching bag at arm's length (though, I wouldn't put it past her to put an actual curse on him for the same reason).    Luckily, I am not cursed to remain around Carla nor do I have any reason to watch—much less think about—this series ever again. Good luck, Alvin. I wouldn't wish this hell upon anyone.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               There's nothing objectively offensive about Don't Hurt Me, My Healer!. It's just incredibly annoying. Or rather, Carla, the eponymous healer, is incredibly annoying. The premise, as I understood it prior to going in, is that dark elf Carla is a pretty terrible healer, doing the opposite of helping people despite her class. That may be true, although we don't see much evidence of it in this episode apart from the bit where she curses Alvin instead of healing him. What she is instead is intensely irritating, the anime equivalent of that mosquito that you can hear buzzing around your head in the night but can never quite find to squash. Somehow this is made worse by the fact that she's clearly meant to be funny; her attempts to be cutesy instead come off as grating and her every action is plainly self-serving. When she says that she's never been in a party before and Alvin remarks that, given her personality, that's not surprising, it's the truest statement in the episode.    Carla basically weighs the entire thing down, which is a shame because the show's not without other merits. Bear, the horned bear magibeast Alvin is initially fighting, is at least moderately amusing with the way that she can't seem to settle on a cute verbal affectation, cycling through “kuma,” “gao,” and “bear” with each new utterance. The fact that we never get to see Alvin's entire face is also pretty good, and watching the show come up with new ways to ensure that it's mostly hidden is both a fun poke at censorship via strategically placed item and just generally fun, especially since both Mostly and Carla are under the impression that his face is some sort of horror show of dullness. I also appreciate that Carla's healer outfit is perfectly normal and fully covering, which is unusual for a fantasy show; that it's practical as well is especially nice.    It's just too bad that Carla is so grating, and since she's the main character (or at least one of them, though who knows how long Alvin will last), that's a real problem. This has the unfortunate combination of very little plot, a thus-far uninteresting RPG-inspired fantasy world, and a character who just really rubbed me the wrong way. Your mileage may vary, but this wouldn't be my first choice for something to watch this season, even if you're hurting for any of its purported genres.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               There's nothing quite as unbearable as an unfunny comedy, is there? There have been some stinkers this season, some of them quantifiably worse than Don't Hurt Me, My Healer!, but nothing has felt quite as protracted and interminable as watching this premiere hammer its weak, wafer-thin premise into the ground for a full 20 minutes. It has one joke, which is at best mildly funny on paper, and it proceeds to flub telling that joke in what feels like the most excruciating bit of sketch comedy ever made. That it's actually a scripted, fully-animated TV show just makes it harder to sit through.    Ok, there was one joke that kind of got me to smile. The reveal that the generic rhino/bear monster wasn't just some random monster, but a character in her own right and basically the mediator between our two leads, was kind of funny. But the longer it went on the less funny it got, and by the third minute the gag had just folded itself in with the unfunny manzai banter of Alvin and Clara. Thus the one spark of comedic hope in this premiere faded into the night, never to be seen again, and there were still 14 minutes of this sucker to get through. And every joke from then on followed the same formula: Carla says something rude or arrogant, Alvin gets upset. At one point there's a gag about Carla not being able to properly heal his face (which he doesn't actually have) that lasts for eons and repeats the punchline a dozen times before it mercifully ends.    This is just the antithesis of charming comedy for me. It's rote, boring, and repetitive. Half the jokes are just Alvin yelling that Carla is being rude, as if shouting the point of a scene is inherently funny. And since the show is so barebones in art and animation, there's nothing to distract from how unfunny it is. It made for a miserable time, and unless you have a totally different sense of humor, there's nothing here for you.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review                Odd Taxi: In the Woods   Apr 17, 00:00                 anime    By cleverly reframing its narrative around a series of interviews with the supporting cast, Odd Taxi: In the Woods succeeds where most recap films fail: it's an artistically cohesive film in its own right. ― Odd Taxi was 2021's sleeper anime hit, telling an intricate, original mystery that kept viewers guessing every week.

Apr 11th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Don't Hurt Me, My Healer! ?                     Community score: 2.6              What is this?   The ""isekai burnt-out adventurer comedy"" centers on two adventurers: the hopeless swordsman Arvin, and the sarcastic dark-elf healer Karla, who seems to be more talented with ticking people off than healing. (from manga)   Don't Hurt Me, My Healer! is based on Tannen ni Hakkō's Kono Healer, Mendokusai (This Healer's a Handful) manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Sundays.      How was the first episode?   James Beckett  Rating:                Full disclosure: Before getting to the premiere of Don't Hurt Me, My Healer!, I watched the new film Everything Everywhere all at once, and without derailing this review to cover a completely irrelevant and non-anime project, the film left me on Cloud Nine, so much so that I was guaranteed to enjoy practically anything in my post-masterpiece haze. You could have walked up and socked me right in the face, and I probably would have given the experience at least a two out of five. So, take my relatively positive score here with a grain of salt.    I'm not going to pretend that Don't Hurt Me, My Healer! is a great anime, or anything. A lot of its tryhard manzai-style humor is the kind of stuff that I usually find pretty grating, since so much of it boils down to one person acting like a manic lunatic for no particular reason, while the straight-man of the group explains in excruciating detail how their partner's behavior defies conventional expectations. “Wah, I tried to heal you, but I accidentally cursed you instead, because I'm grossly incompetent at my chosen profession!” “Well, that isn't how it was supposed to go!” Insert slide-whistle sound effect here. Still, “comedy is subjective” and all that, and it's my job to be honest with you, so here it goes: This incredibly stupid show made me laugh a few times, and I was never actively bored while I watched it.    In retrospect, a lot of my appreciation of this episode comes from the befuddled bear-thing simply trying to keep the two numbskull humans that it has only just met from self-annihilation-by-way-of-shenanigans. Arvin and Carla are, themselves, not especially hilarious, so a lot of the show's potential will depend on whether the characters they meet every week can balance out the altogether-too-muchness of the pair's whole shtick. Will everyone enjoy Don't Hurt Me, My Healer!? Lord, no. But it might prove to be a decent way to kill a half-hour if nothing else is on.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               You know how they say humor is subjective? Well, for me, this anime is less funny and more like pulling teeth: long, drawn-out, and painful. However, this should be no surprise; it's right there in the title, after all. In Japanese, this show is called “Kono Healer, Mendokusai,” which translates directly to “This Healer is a Pain to Deal With.” And holy crap do I feel that after watching this episode. In fact, it's not just the healer but the warrior and the bear as well; they're all a pain and I didn't enjoy a single moment of this episode.    Honestly, more than anything else, watching this episode felt like reading a particularly volatile comment section on a subject I cared nothing about. Instead of addressing each other's points, they change the subject, passively-aggressively attack each other, move the goalposts, and drag other people into it. It was at the moment the bear started talking that I realized what we were in for—that this argument was going to be our entire episode—and my heart filled with dread.    The only thing that got me through this episode (you know, besides being paid to watch it) was thinking about the simple question: “Is Carla really that dense or is she just messing with everyone?” Because, while it's presented as the former, I'm starting to think it's the latter. The real reason she doesn't have a party is not that she's incompetent, it's that she's a born sadist who gets off on causing people emotional pain. Every move she makes is calculated to get what she wants—be that a new mace or a person to torture. I doubt the so-called “curse” even exists; it's just her way of keeping her new punching bag at arm's length (though, I wouldn't put it past her to put an actual curse on him for the same reason).    Luckily, I am not cursed to remain around Carla nor do I have any reason to watch—much less think about—this series ever again. Good luck, Alvin. I wouldn't wish this hell upon anyone.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               There's nothing objectively offensive about Don't Hurt Me, My Healer!. It's just incredibly annoying. Or rather, Carla, the eponymous healer, is incredibly annoying. The premise, as I understood it prior to going in, is that dark elf Carla is a pretty terrible healer, doing the opposite of helping people despite her class. That may be true, although we don't see much evidence of it in this episode apart from the bit where she curses Alvin instead of healing him. What she is instead is intensely irritating, the anime equivalent of that mosquito that you can hear buzzing around your head in the night but can never quite find to squash. Somehow this is made worse by the fact that she's clearly meant to be funny; her attempts to be cutesy instead come off as grating and her every action is plainly self-serving. When she says that she's never been in a party before and Alvin remarks that, given her personality, that's not surprising, it's the truest statement in the episode.    Carla basically weighs the entire thing down, which is a shame because the show's not without other merits. Bear, the horned bear magibeast Alvin is initially fighting, is at least moderately amusing with the way that she can't seem to settle on a cute verbal affectation, cycling through “kuma,” “gao,” and “bear” with each new utterance. The fact that we never get to see Alvin's entire face is also pretty good, and watching the show come up with new ways to ensure that it's mostly hidden is both a fun poke at censorship via strategically placed item and just generally fun, especially since both Mostly and Carla are under the impression that his face is some sort of horror show of dullness. I also appreciate that Carla's healer outfit is perfectly normal and fully covering, which is unusual for a fantasy show; that it's practical as well is especially nice.    It's just too bad that Carla is so grating, and since she's the main character (or at least one of them, though who knows how long Alvin will last), that's a real problem. This has the unfortunate combination of very little plot, a thus-far uninteresting RPG-inspired fantasy world, and a character who just really rubbed me the wrong way. Your mileage may vary, but this wouldn't be my first choice for something to watch this season, even if you're hurting for any of its purported genres.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               There's nothing quite as unbearable as an unfunny comedy, is there? There have been some stinkers this season, some of them quantifiably worse than Don't Hurt Me, My Healer!, but nothing has felt quite as protracted and interminable as watching this premiere hammer its weak, wafer-thin premise into the ground for a full 20 minutes. It has one joke, which is at best mildly funny on paper, and it proceeds to flub telling that joke in what feels like the most excruciating bit of sketch comedy ever made. That it's actually a scripted, fully-animated TV show just makes it harder to sit through.    Ok, there was one joke that kind of got me to smile. The reveal that the generic rhino/bear monster wasn't just some random monster, but a character in her own right and basically the mediator between our two leads, was kind of funny. But the longer it went on the less funny it got, and by the third minute the gag had just folded itself in with the unfunny manzai banter of Alvin and Clara. Thus the one spark of comedic hope in this premiere faded into the night, never to be seen again, and there were still 14 minutes of this sucker to get through. And every joke from then on followed the same formula: Carla says something rude or arrogant, Alvin gets upset. At one point there's a gag about Carla not being able to properly heal his face (which he doesn't actually have) that lasts for eons and repeats the punchline a dozen times before it mercifully ends.    This is just the antithesis of charming comedy for me. It's rote, boring, and repetitive. Half the jokes are just Alvin yelling that Carla is being rude, as if shouting the point of a scene is inherently funny. And since the show is so barebones in art and animation, there's nothing to distract from how unfunny it is. It made for a miserable time, and unless you have a totally different sense of humor, there's nothing here for you.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review                Odd Taxi: In the Woods   Apr 17, 00:00                 anime    By cleverly reframing its narrative around a series of interviews with the supporting cast, Odd Taxi: In the Woods succeeds where most recap films fail: it's an artistically cohesive film in its own right. ― Odd Taxi was 2021's sleeper anime hit, telling an intricate, original mystery that kept viewers guessing every week.

Apr 11th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Don't Hurt Me, My Healer! ?                     Community score: 2.6              What is this?   The ""isekai burnt-out adventurer comedy"" centers on two adventurers: the hopeless swordsman Arvin, and the sarcastic dark-elf healer Karla, who seems to be more talented with ticking people off than healing. (from manga)   Don't Hurt Me, My Healer! is based on Tannen ni Hakkō's Kono Healer, Mendokusai (This Healer's a Handful) manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Sundays.      How was the first episode?   James Beckett  Rating:                Full disclosure: Before getting to the premiere of Don't Hurt Me, My Healer!, I watched the new film Everything Everywhere all at once, and without derailing this review to cover a completely irrelevant and non-anime project, the film left me on Cloud Nine, so much so that I was guaranteed to enjoy practically anything in my post-masterpiece haze. You could have walked up and socked me right in the face, and I probably would have given the experience at least a two out of five. So, take my relatively positive score here with a grain of salt.    I'm not going to pretend that Don't Hurt Me, My Healer! is a great anime, or anything. A lot of its tryhard manzai-style humor is the kind of stuff that I usually find pretty grating, since so much of it boils down to one person acting like a manic lunatic for no particular reason, while the straight-man of the group explains in excruciating detail how their partner's behavior defies conventional expectations. “Wah, I tried to heal you, but I accidentally cursed you instead, because I'm grossly incompetent at my chosen profession!” “Well, that isn't how it was supposed to go!” Insert slide-whistle sound effect here. Still, “comedy is subjective” and all that, and it's my job to be honest with you, so here it goes: This incredibly stupid show made me laugh a few times, and I was never actively bored while I watched it.    In retrospect, a lot of my appreciation of this episode comes from the befuddled bear-thing simply trying to keep the two numbskull humans that it has only just met from self-annihilation-by-way-of-shenanigans. Arvin and Carla are, themselves, not especially hilarious, so a lot of the show's potential will depend on whether the characters they meet every week can balance out the altogether-too-muchness of the pair's whole shtick. Will everyone enjoy Don't Hurt Me, My Healer!? Lord, no. But it might prove to be a decent way to kill a half-hour if nothing else is on.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               You know how they say humor is subjective? Well, for me, this anime is less funny and more like pulling teeth: long, drawn-out, and painful. However, this should be no surprise; it's right there in the title, after all. In Japanese, this show is called “Kono Healer, Mendokusai,” which translates directly to “This Healer is a Pain to Deal With.” And holy crap do I feel that after watching this episode. In fact, it's not just the healer but the warrior and the bear as well; they're all a pain and I didn't enjoy a single moment of this episode.    Honestly, more than anything else, watching this episode felt like reading a particularly volatile comment section on a subject I cared nothing about. Instead of addressing each other's points, they change the subject, passively-aggressively attack each other, move the goalposts, and drag other people into it. It was at the moment the bear started talking that I realized what we were in for—that this argument was going to be our entire episode—and my heart filled with dread.    The only thing that got me through this episode (you know, besides being paid to watch it) was thinking about the simple question: “Is Carla really that dense or is she just messing with everyone?” Because, while it's presented as the former, I'm starting to think it's the latter. The real reason she doesn't have a party is not that she's incompetent, it's that she's a born sadist who gets off on causing people emotional pain. Every move she makes is calculated to get what she wants—be that a new mace or a person to torture. I doubt the so-called “curse” even exists; it's just her way of keeping her new punching bag at arm's length (though, I wouldn't put it past her to put an actual curse on him for the same reason).    Luckily, I am not cursed to remain around Carla nor do I have any reason to watch—much less think about—this series ever again. Good luck, Alvin. I wouldn't wish this hell upon anyone.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               There's nothing objectively offensive about Don't Hurt Me, My Healer!. It's just incredibly annoying. Or rather, Carla, the eponymous healer, is incredibly annoying. The premise, as I understood it prior to going in, is that dark elf Carla is a pretty terrible healer, doing the opposite of helping people despite her class. That may be true, although we don't see much evidence of it in this episode apart from the bit where she curses Alvin instead of healing him. What she is instead is intensely irritating, the anime equivalent of that mosquito that you can hear buzzing around your head in the night but can never quite find to squash. Somehow this is made worse by the fact that she's clearly meant to be funny; her attempts to be cutesy instead come off as grating and her every action is plainly self-serving. When she says that she's never been in a party before and Alvin remarks that, given her personality, that's not surprising, it's the truest statement in the episode.    Carla basically weighs the entire thing down, which is a shame because the show's not without other merits. Bear, the horned bear magibeast Alvin is initially fighting, is at least moderately amusing with the way that she can't seem to settle on a cute verbal affectation, cycling through “kuma,” “gao,” and “bear” with each new utterance. The fact that we never get to see Alvin's entire face is also pretty good, and watching the show come up with new ways to ensure that it's mostly hidden is both a fun poke at censorship via strategically placed item and just generally fun, especially since both Mostly and Carla are under the impression that his face is some sort of horror show of dullness. I also appreciate that Carla's healer outfit is perfectly normal and fully covering, which is unusual for a fantasy show; that it's practical as well is especially nice.    It's just too bad that Carla is so grating, and since she's the main character (or at least one of them, though who knows how long Alvin will last), that's a real problem. This has the unfortunate combination of very little plot, a thus-far uninteresting RPG-inspired fantasy world, and a character who just really rubbed me the wrong way. Your mileage may vary, but this wouldn't be my first choice for something to watch this season, even if you're hurting for any of its purported genres.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               There's nothing quite as unbearable as an unfunny comedy, is there? There have been some stinkers this season, some of them quantifiably worse than Don't Hurt Me, My Healer!, but nothing has felt quite as protracted and interminable as watching this premiere hammer its weak, wafer-thin premise into the ground for a full 20 minutes. It has one joke, which is at best mildly funny on paper, and it proceeds to flub telling that joke in what feels like the most excruciating bit of sketch comedy ever made. That it's actually a scripted, fully-animated TV show just makes it harder to sit through.    Ok, there was one joke that kind of got me to smile. The reveal that the generic rhino/bear monster wasn't just some random monster, but a character in her own right and basically the mediator between our two leads, was kind of funny. But the longer it went on the less funny it got, and by the third minute the gag had just folded itself in with the unfunny manzai banter of Alvin and Clara. Thus the one spark of comedic hope in this premiere faded into the night, never to be seen again, and there were still 14 minutes of this sucker to get through. And every joke from then on followed the same formula: Carla says something rude or arrogant, Alvin gets upset. At one point there's a gag about Carla not being able to properly heal his face (which he doesn't actually have) that lasts for eons and repeats the punchline a dozen times before it mercifully ends.    This is just the antithesis of charming comedy for me. It's rote, boring, and repetitive. Half the jokes are just Alvin yelling that Carla is being rude, as if shouting the point of a scene is inherently funny. And since the show is so barebones in art and animation, there's nothing to distract from how unfunny it is. It made for a miserable time, and unless you have a totally different sense of humor, there's nothing here for you.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review                Odd Taxi: In the Woods   Apr 17, 00:00                 anime    By cleverly reframing its narrative around a series of interviews with the supporting cast, Odd Taxi: In the Woods succeeds where most recap films fail: it's an artistically cohesive film in its own right. ― Odd Taxi was 2021's sleeper anime hit, telling an intricate, original mystery that kept viewers guessing every week.

Thus the one spark of comedic hope in this premiere faded into the night, never to be seen again, and there were still 14 minutes of this sucker to get through. And every joke from then on followed the same formula: Carla says something rude or arrogant, Alvin gets upset. At one point there's a gag about Carla not being able to properly heal his face (which he doesn't actually have) that lasts for eons and repeats the punchline a dozen times before it mercifully ends.    This is just the antithesis of charming comedy for me. It's rote, boring, and repetitive. Half the jokes are just Alvin yelling that Carla is being rude, as if shouting the point of a scene is inherently funny. And since the show is so barebones in art and animation, there's nothing to distract from how unfunny it is.

Apr 11th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Don't Hurt Me, My Healer! ?                     Community score: 2.6              What is this?   The ""isekai burnt-out adventurer comedy"" centers on two adventurers: the hopeless swordsman Arvin, and the sarcastic dark-elf healer Karla, who seems to be more talented with ticking people off than healing. (from manga)   Don't Hurt Me, My Healer! is based on Tannen ni Hakkō's Kono Healer, Mendokusai (This Healer's a Handful) manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Sundays.      How was the first episode?   James Beckett  Rating:                Full disclosure: Before getting to the premiere of Don't Hurt Me, My Healer!, I watched the new film Everything Everywhere all at once, and without derailing this review to cover a completely irrelevant and non-anime project, the film left me on Cloud Nine, so much so that I was guaranteed to enjoy practically anything in my post-masterpiece haze. You could have walked up and socked me right in the face, and I probably would have given the experience at least a two out of five. So, take my relatively positive score here with a grain of salt.    I'm not going to pretend that Don't Hurt Me, My Healer! is a great anime, or anything. A lot of its tryhard manzai-style humor is the kind of stuff that I usually find pretty grating, since so much of it boils down to one person acting like a manic lunatic for no particular reason, while the straight-man of the group explains in excruciating detail how their partner's behavior defies conventional expectations. “Wah, I tried to heal you, but I accidentally cursed you instead, because I'm grossly incompetent at my chosen profession!” “Well, that isn't how it was supposed to go!” Insert slide-whistle sound effect here. Still, “comedy is subjective” and all that, and it's my job to be honest with you, so here it goes: This incredibly stupid show made me laugh a few times, and I was never actively bored while I watched it.    In retrospect, a lot of my appreciation of this episode comes from the befuddled bear-thing simply trying to keep the two numbskull humans that it has only just met from self-annihilation-by-way-of-shenanigans. Arvin and Carla are, themselves, not especially hilarious, so a lot of the show's potential will depend on whether the characters they meet every week can balance out the altogether-too-muchness of the pair's whole shtick. Will everyone enjoy Don't Hurt Me, My Healer!? Lord, no. But it might prove to be a decent way to kill a half-hour if nothing else is on.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               You know how they say humor is subjective? Well, for me, this anime is less funny and more like pulling teeth: long, drawn-out, and painful. However, this should be no surprise; it's right there in the title, after all. In Japanese, this show is called “Kono Healer, Mendokusai,” which translates directly to “This Healer is a Pain to Deal With.” And holy crap do I feel that after watching this episode. In fact, it's not just the healer but the warrior and the bear as well; they're all a pain and I didn't enjoy a single moment of this episode.    Honestly, more than anything else, watching this episode felt like reading a particularly volatile comment section on a subject I cared nothing about. Instead of addressing each other's points, they change the subject, passively-aggressively attack each other, move the goalposts, and drag other people into it. It was at the moment the bear started talking that I realized what we were in for—that this argument was going to be our entire episode—and my heart filled with dread.    The only thing that got me through this episode (you know, besides being paid to watch it) was thinking about the simple question: “Is Carla really that dense or is she just messing with everyone?” Because, while it's presented as the former, I'm starting to think it's the latter. The real reason she doesn't have a party is not that she's incompetent, it's that she's a born sadist who gets off on causing people emotional pain. Every move she makes is calculated to get what she wants—be that a new mace or a person to torture. I doubt the so-called “curse” even exists; it's just her way of keeping her new punching bag at arm's length (though, I wouldn't put it past her to put an actual curse on him for the same reason).    Luckily, I am not cursed to remain around Carla nor do I have any reason to watch—much less think about—this series ever again. Good luck, Alvin. I wouldn't wish this hell upon anyone.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               There's nothing objectively offensive about Don't Hurt Me, My Healer!. It's just incredibly annoying. Or rather, Carla, the eponymous healer, is incredibly annoying. The premise, as I understood it prior to going in, is that dark elf Carla is a pretty terrible healer, doing the opposite of helping people despite her class. That may be true, although we don't see much evidence of it in this episode apart from the bit where she curses Alvin instead of healing him. What she is instead is intensely irritating, the anime equivalent of that mosquito that you can hear buzzing around your head in the night but can never quite find to squash. Somehow this is made worse by the fact that she's clearly meant to be funny; her attempts to be cutesy instead come off as grating and her every action is plainly self-serving. When she says that she's never been in a party before and Alvin remarks that, given her personality, that's not surprising, it's the truest statement in the episode.    Carla basically weighs the entire thing down, which is a shame because the show's not without other merits. Bear, the horned bear magibeast Alvin is initially fighting, is at least moderately amusing with the way that she can't seem to settle on a cute verbal affectation, cycling through “kuma,” “gao,” and “bear” with each new utterance. The fact that we never get to see Alvin's entire face is also pretty good, and watching the show come up with new ways to ensure that it's mostly hidden is both a fun poke at censorship via strategically placed item and just generally fun, especially since both Mostly and Carla are under the impression that his face is some sort of horror show of dullness. I also appreciate that Carla's healer outfit is perfectly normal and fully covering, which is unusual for a fantasy show; that it's practical as well is especially nice.    It's just too bad that Carla is so grating, and since she's the main character (or at least one of them, though who knows how long Alvin will last), that's a real problem. This has the unfortunate combination of very little plot, a thus-far uninteresting RPG-inspired fantasy world, and a character who just really rubbed me the wrong way. Your mileage may vary, but this wouldn't be my first choice for something to watch this season, even if you're hurting for any of its purported genres.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               There's nothing quite as unbearable as an unfunny comedy, is there? There have been some stinkers this season, some of them quantifiably worse than Don't Hurt Me, My Healer!, but nothing has felt quite as protracted and interminable as watching this premiere hammer its weak, wafer-thin premise into the ground for a full 20 minutes. It has one joke, which is at best mildly funny on paper, and it proceeds to flub telling that joke in what feels like the most excruciating bit of sketch comedy ever made. That it's actually a scripted, fully-animated TV show just makes it harder to sit through.    Ok, there was one joke that kind of got me to smile. The reveal that the generic rhino/bear monster wasn't just some random monster, but a character in her own right and basically the mediator between our two leads, was kind of funny. But the longer it went on the less funny it got, and by the third minute the gag had just folded itself in with the unfunny manzai banter of Alvin and Clara.

Community score: 2.6              What is this?   The ""isekai burnt-out adventurer comedy"" centers on two adventurers: the hopeless swordsman Arvin, and the sarcastic dark-elf healer Karla, who seems to be more talented with ticking people off than healing. (from manga)   Don't Hurt Me, My Healer! is based on Tannen ni Hakkō's Kono Healer, Mendokusai (This Healer's a Handful) manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Sundays.      How was the first episode?   James Beckett  Rating:                Full disclosure: Before getting to the premiere of Don't Hurt Me, My Healer!, I watched the new film Everything Everywhere all at once, and without derailing this review to cover a completely irrelevant and non-anime project, the film left me on Cloud Nine, so much so that I was guaranteed to enjoy practically anything in my post-masterpiece haze. You could have walked up and socked me right in the face, and I probably would have given the experience at least a two out of five. So, take my relatively positive score here with a grain of salt.    I'm not going to pretend that Don't Hurt Me, My Healer! is a great anime, or anything. A lot of its tryhard manzai-style humor is the kind of stuff that I usually find pretty grating, since so much of it boils down to one person acting like a manic lunatic for no particular reason, while the straight-man of the group explains in excruciating detail how their partner's behavior defies conventional expectations. “Wah, I tried to heal you, but I accidentally cursed you instead, because I'm grossly incompetent at my chosen profession!” “Well, that isn't how it was supposed to go!” Insert slide-whistle sound effect here. Still, “comedy is subjective” and all that, and it's my job to be honest with you, so here it goes: This incredibly stupid show made me laugh a few times, and I was never actively bored while I watched it.    In retrospect, a lot of my appreciation of this episode comes from the befuddled bear-thing simply trying to keep the two numbskull humans that it has only just met from self-annihilation-by-way-of-shenanigans. Arvin and Carla are, themselves, not especially hilarious, so a lot of the show's potential will depend on whether the characters they meet every week can balance out the altogether-too-muchness of the pair's whole shtick. Will everyone enjoy Don't Hurt Me, My Healer!? Lord, no. But it might prove to be a decent way to kill a half-hour if nothing else is on.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               You know how they say humor is subjective? Well, for me, this anime is less funny and more like pulling teeth: long, drawn-out, and painful. However, this should be no surprise; it's right there in the title, after all. In Japanese, this show is called “Kono Healer, Mendokusai,” which translates directly to “This Healer is a Pain to Deal With.” And holy crap do I feel that after watching this episode. In fact, it's not just the healer but the warrior and the bear as well; they're all a pain and I didn't enjoy a single moment of this episode.    Honestly, more than anything else, watching this episode felt like reading a particularly volatile comment section on a subject I cared nothing about. Instead of addressing each other's points, they change the subject, passively-aggressively attack each other, move the goalposts, and drag other people into it. It was at the moment the bear started talking that I realized what we were in for—that this argument was going to be our entire episode—and my heart filled with dread.    The only thing that got me through this episode (you know, besides being paid to watch it) was thinking about the simple question: “Is Carla really that dense or is she just messing with everyone?” Because, while it's presented as the former, I'm starting to think it's the latter. The real reason she doesn't have a party is not that she's incompetent, it's that she's a born sadist who gets off on causing people emotional pain. Every move she makes is calculated to get what she wants—be that a new mace or a person to torture. I doubt the so-called “curse” even exists; it's just her way of keeping her new punching bag at arm's length (though, I wouldn't put it past her to put an actual curse on him for the same reason).    Luckily, I am not cursed to remain around Carla nor do I have any reason to watch—much less think about—this series ever again. Good luck, Alvin. I wouldn't wish this hell upon anyone.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               There's nothing objectively offensive about Don't Hurt Me, My Healer!. It's just incredibly annoying. Or rather, Carla, the eponymous healer, is incredibly annoying. The premise, as I understood it prior to going in, is that dark elf Carla is a pretty terrible healer, doing the opposite of helping people despite her class. That may be true, although we don't see much evidence of it in this episode apart from the bit where she curses Alvin instead of healing him. What she is instead is intensely irritating, the anime equivalent of that mosquito that you can hear buzzing around your head in the night but can never quite find to squash. Somehow this is made worse by the fact that she's clearly meant to be funny; her attempts to be cutesy instead come off as grating and her every action is plainly self-serving. When she says that she's never been in a party before and Alvin remarks that, given her personality, that's not surprising, it's the truest statement in the episode.    Carla basically weighs the entire thing down, which is a shame because the show's not without other merits. Bear, the horned bear magibeast Alvin is initially fighting, is at least moderately amusing with the way that she can't seem to settle on a cute verbal affectation, cycling through “kuma,” “gao,” and “bear” with each new utterance. The fact that we never get to see Alvin's entire face is also pretty good, and watching the show come up with new ways to ensure that it's mostly hidden is both a fun poke at censorship via strategically placed item and just generally fun, especially since both Mostly and Carla are under the impression that his face is some sort of horror show of dullness. I also appreciate that Carla's healer outfit is perfectly normal and fully covering, which is unusual for a fantasy show; that it's practical as well is especially nice.    It's just too bad that Carla is so grating, and since she's the main character (or at least one of them, though who knows how long Alvin will last), that's a real problem. This has the unfortunate combination of very little plot, a thus-far uninteresting RPG-inspired fantasy world, and a character who just really rubbed me the wrong way. Your mileage may vary, but this wouldn't be my first choice for something to watch this season, even if you're hurting for any of its purported genres.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               There's nothing quite as unbearable as an unfunny comedy, is there? There have been some stinkers this season, some of them quantifiably worse than Don't Hurt Me, My Healer!, but nothing has felt quite as protracted and interminable as watching this premiere hammer its weak, wafer-thin premise into the ground for a full 20 minutes. It has one joke, which is at best mildly funny on paper, and it proceeds to flub telling that joke in what feels like the most excruciating bit of sketch comedy ever made. That it's actually a scripted, fully-animated TV show just makes it harder to sit through.    Ok, there was one joke that kind of got me to smile. The reveal that the generic rhino/bear monster wasn't just some random monster, but a character in her own right and basically the mediator between our two leads, was kind of funny. But the longer it went on the less funny it got, and by the third minute the gag had just folded itself in with the unfunny manzai banter of Alvin and Clara. Thus the one spark of comedic hope in this premiere faded into the night, never to be seen again, and there were still 14 minutes of this sucker to get through. And every joke from then on followed the same formula: Carla says something rude or arrogant, Alvin gets upset. At one point there's a gag about Carla not being able to properly heal his face (which he doesn't actually have) that lasts for eons and repeats the punchline a dozen times before it mercifully ends.    This is just the antithesis of charming comedy for me. It's rote, boring, and repetitive. Half the jokes are just Alvin yelling that Carla is being rude, as if shouting the point of a scene is inherently funny.

A lot of its tryhard manzai-style humor is the kind of stuff that I usually find pretty grating, since so much of it boils down to one person acting like a manic lunatic for no particular reason, while the straight-man of the group explains in excruciating detail how their partner's behavior defies conventional expectations. “Wah, I tried to heal you, but I accidentally cursed you instead, because I'm grossly incompetent at my chosen profession!” “Well, that isn't how it was supposed to go!” Insert slide-whistle sound effect here. Still, “comedy is subjective” and all that, and it's my job to be honest with you, so here it goes: This incredibly stupid show made me laugh a few times, and I was never actively bored while I watched it.    In retrospect, a lot of my appreciation of this episode comes from the befuddled bear-thing simply trying to keep the two numbskull humans that it has only just met from self-annihilation-by-way-of-shenanigans. Arvin and Carla are, themselves, not especially hilarious, so a lot of the show's potential will depend on whether the characters they meet every week can balance out the altogether-too-muchness of the pair's whole shtick. Will everyone enjoy Don't Hurt Me, My Healer!? Lord, no. But it might prove to be a decent way to kill a half-hour if nothing else is on.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               You know how they say humor is subjective? Well, for me, this anime is less funny and more like pulling teeth: long, drawn-out, and painful. However, this should be no surprise; it's right there in the title, after all. In Japanese, this show is called “Kono Healer, Mendokusai,” which translates directly to “This Healer is a Pain to Deal With.” And holy crap do I feel that after watching this episode. In fact, it's not just the healer but the warrior and the bear as well; they're all a pain and I didn't enjoy a single moment of this episode.    Honestly, more than anything else, watching this episode felt like reading a particularly volatile comment section on a subject I cared nothing about. Instead of addressing each other's points, they change the subject, passively-aggressively attack each other, move the goalposts, and drag other people into it. It was at the moment the bear started talking that I realized what we were in for—that this argument was going to be our entire episode—and my heart filled with dread.    The only thing that got me through this episode (you know, besides being paid to watch it) was thinking about the simple question: “Is Carla really that dense or is she just messing with everyone?” Because, while it's presented as the former, I'm starting to think it's the latter. The real reason she doesn't have a party is not that she's incompetent, it's that she's a born sadist who gets off on causing people emotional pain. Every move she makes is calculated to get what she wants—be that a new mace or a person to torture. I doubt the so-called “curse” even exists; it's just her way of keeping her new punching bag at arm's length (though, I wouldn't put it past her to put an actual curse on him for the same reason).    Luckily, I am not cursed to remain around Carla nor do I have any reason to watch—much less think about—this series ever again. Good luck, Alvin. I wouldn't wish this hell upon anyone.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               There's nothing objectively offensive about Don't Hurt Me, My Healer!. It's just incredibly annoying. Or rather, Carla, the eponymous healer, is incredibly annoying. The premise, as I understood it prior to going in, is that dark elf Carla is a pretty terrible healer, doing the opposite of helping people despite her class. That may be true, although we don't see much evidence of it in this episode apart from the bit where she curses Alvin instead of healing him. What she is instead is intensely irritating, the anime equivalent of that mosquito that you can hear buzzing around your head in the night but can never quite find to squash. Somehow this is made worse by the fact that she's clearly meant to be funny; her attempts to be cutesy instead come off as grating and her every action is plainly self-serving. When she says that she's never been in a party before and Alvin remarks that, given her personality, that's not surprising, it's the truest statement in the episode.    Carla basically weighs the entire thing down, which is a shame because the show's not without other merits. Bear, the horned bear magibeast Alvin is initially fighting, is at least moderately amusing with the way that she can't seem to settle on a cute verbal affectation, cycling through “kuma,” “gao,” and “bear” with each new utterance. The fact that we never get to see Alvin's entire face is also pretty good, and watching the show come up with new ways to ensure that it's mostly hidden is both a fun poke at censorship via strategically placed item and just generally fun, especially since both Mostly and Carla are under the impression that his face is some sort of horror show of dullness. I also appreciate that Carla's healer outfit is perfectly normal and fully covering, which is unusual for a fantasy show; that it's practical as well is especially nice.    It's just too bad that Carla is so grating, and since she's the main character (or at least one of them, though who knows how long Alvin will last), that's a real problem. This has the unfortunate combination of very little plot, a thus-far uninteresting RPG-inspired fantasy world, and a character who just really rubbed me the wrong way. Your mileage may vary, but this wouldn't be my first choice for something to watch this season, even if you're hurting for any of its purported genres.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               There's nothing quite as unbearable as an unfunny comedy, is there? There have been some stinkers this season, some of them quantifiably worse than Don't Hurt Me, My Healer!, but nothing has felt quite as protracted and interminable as watching this premiere hammer its weak, wafer-thin premise into the ground for a full 20 minutes. It has one joke, which is at best mildly funny on paper, and it proceeds to flub telling that joke in what feels like the most excruciating bit of sketch comedy ever made. That it's actually a scripted, fully-animated TV show just makes it harder to sit through.    Ok, there was one joke that kind of got me to smile. The reveal that the generic rhino/bear monster wasn't just some random monster, but a character in her own right and basically the mediator between our two leads, was kind of funny. But the longer it went on the less funny it got, and by the third minute the gag had just folded itself in with the unfunny manzai banter of Alvin and Clara. Thus the one spark of comedic hope in this premiere faded into the night, never to be seen again, and there were still 14 minutes of this sucker to get through. And every joke from then on followed the same formula: Carla says something rude or arrogant, Alvin gets upset. At one point there's a gag about Carla not being able to properly heal his face (which he doesn't actually have) that lasts for eons and repeats the punchline a dozen times before it mercifully ends.    This is just the antithesis of charming comedy for me. It's rote, boring, and repetitive. Half the jokes are just Alvin yelling that Carla is being rude, as if shouting the point of a scene is inherently funny. And since the show is so barebones in art and animation, there's nothing to distract from how unfunny it is. It made for a miserable time, and unless you have a totally different sense of humor, there's nothing here for you.

Ranking of Kings Ending Explained   by Michael Basile, Apr 16th 2022            Across two anime seasons packed with heavy-hitting sequels and long-awaited adaptations, the fact that Ranking of Kings has managed to stay near the top of seasonal discussions for almost half a year is a testament to how engaging this series is and how many ideas it has within it to talk about. That said, for as solid as the project is on the whole, not all ideas are created equal, so join me on a dive into some of this show's disparate themes as we try to see what final conclusion this show arrived at.    Before we jump in I wanna do a brief recap of where this story ended up at the end just to keep it in mind as we discuss what led up to it, and I want to focus primarily on two of the major end results. Firstly, we have Bojji's final battle with Bosse. Whereas Bosse continues to fight Bojji with the same brute force he always has, though this time with Daida's body, Bojji's training under Despa has allowed him to become skilled in his own right through his superior agility and his talent for discovering an opponent's weak point, thus allowing him to triumph over his father. Secondly, we have the resolution to Miranjo's plot against the kingdom. After Bojji destroys the mirror, Miranjo's soul is collected by the same demon that granted Bosse his immense strength, but through Daida's empathy and compassion, her soul is rescued and returned to a living body. Daida announces that he forgives Miranjo for her misdeeds, with Bojji following suit, and that he plans to marry her in order to share the burden of her sins moving forward.    We'll start with that first climax, as it ties into what is easily this anime's strongest idea, that being the conflict between appearance and ability. With our main character, Bojji, being deaf and unable to verbally communicate with those around him, the topic of disability is centered at the forefront of Bojji's characterization and makes his life inordinately difficult. Other children laugh at him for his disability, while many of the adults find him frustrating to deal with, leaving Bojji with few people he can connect to. What's more, his disability often leads others to assume that he is of lesser skill or intelligence than those who are more able-bodied. One the one hand, this is true in terms of pure brute force, as it's revealed that his father, Bosse, made a deal with a demon that sapped Bojji of all his potential strength. As such, Bojji is looked down on by those who expect him to become a great king like his father despite his obvious physical disadvantage, asking something of him that he simply cannot give.    On the other hand, this disability also causes those around Bojji to perceive him as less intelligent, though this aspect of Bojji is an entirely false assumption. Because he often can't communicate what he wants in order to get his point across or just goes about life in ways that seem entirely foreign or nonsensical, those who observe Bojji simply attribute this to him being dumb, as it's easier to just write off his eccentricities as a part of his disability rather than try to understand him, thus adding to the issues that Bojji faces in both his social life and in his perception as a potential leader. Bojji is not mentally inept in any way. In fact, he often exhibits a keen sense of perception and intuition that vastly outpaces those around him, but because he has difficulties communicating these ideas to others, or more often so is unable to find people who will even try to understand to him, his reputation as a dunce becomes more pervasive despite his skills.    That said, even Bojji himself doesn't fully understand this concept until later on in the series. For at least the first couple episodes, Bojji and Kage are dead set on finding someone or some way to make Bojji physically stronger, as they too see Bosse as the ideal to be strived towards. This is readily apparent in how Bojji's more agile swordsmanship is bluntly rejected by the entire castle staff in favor of Daida's more straightforward and supposedly “honorable” style of fighting, and so Bojji and Kage seek out someone who can make him more adept with brute force. It isn't until both Desha and Despa lay it out plain as day that Bojji has zero potential for physical growth that they even attempt to find an alternative, and even that takes some persuasion on Despa's part. In this instance, even Bojji has gotten too wrapped up in his perception of himself and how he believes he should be viewed by others, rather than taking himself as he is and shaping his kingly identity around that.    Then we have Kage, our thief with a heart of gold. Kage is a descendant of the infamous shadow clan, a legendary group of assassins that had been purged some time before he appears on-screen. After losing his mother, Kage is treated with disdain by everyone around him, often as the result of his appearance, and ends up starving on the streets. Even after he finds somewhere to live, the person he lives with seems to hone in on Kage's heritage and starts using him to rob homes and other locations. Here, we have an instance that less appearance vs ability, but rather appearance vs personality. Kage doesn't want to be the bad guy, and we even see in a flashback that he saw his clan as good guys who loyally served their king, but the shady nature of their line of work causes people to constantly misread Kage's intentions, which we see with Bebin during the first few episodes. As such, Kage's experiences put him in the perfect position to understand Bojji. Though he too misinterprets Bojji's talents at first, he quickly comes around and is able to see all the good in him, and so makes it his goal to support Bojji in any way he can.    Finally, one of the more fascinating, yet somewhat understated examples of this contrasting of appearance against ability is presented through the brotherly relationship between Desha and Despa,  albeit in a much less clear-cut manner. Desha, the king of the Underworld, is portrayed to be much less attractive and amiable than his brother, and, according to Despa, he would occasionally get hung up on his own appearance, as displayed by him defacing his own monument. Despite this, Desha's supreme power and charisma allowed him to gain popularity and become a great king for his nation, freeing his people from the tyrannical rule of his father.    On the flip side of that, we have Despa, highly intelligent and incredibly handsome, yet lacking in the physical strength and extraordinary powers that his brother possesses, and much like Desha, he too envies that which his brother has that he does not, as shown in a flashback where Despa mourns his lack of physical prowess in comparison to his kin. Despite this, much like Desha, Despa eventually grows wise enough to recognize the usefulness of his own talents, shaping his persona and combat tendencies in ways that only he can and not simply trying to mimic his brother, a trait that he has endeavored to pass on to Bojji so that he too can carve out his own path without trying to follow in his father's footsteps or compete with Daida solely through strength. Bojji's incredible agility and insight into discovering an opponent's weakness is his greatest asset in combat and something he achieved precisely because of his disability, and Despa recognizes how wasteful it would be to squander that talent, thus allowing Bojji to overcome his lack of strength and stand on equal footing with Daida and Bosse.    This aspect of Bojji is symbolized perfectly by his choice of weapon, a small rapier given to him by Despa. While deciding on what weapon to train with, Bojji initially tries to use an axe, as it's the same weapon his father, who is portrayed as the ideal powerful king, uses on the battlefield, but even the smallest of axes proves too unwieldy. Thus, Bojji ultimately chooses the rapier, one that seems to have very little offensive power at all and tricks even Kage into thinking that it's worthless. Yet, Bojji is able to draw out the full potential of this weapon by using a fighting style best suited for him, one that emphasizes agility and small strikes over heavy hitting attacks. This allows Bojji to completely incapacite his opponents with no bloodshed, a perfect representation of Bojji's endless altruism towards even those who seek to harm him.    In a sense, Bojji's arc is not so much about gaining the physical strength to become a better leader, but more so about coming to understand himself so as to highlight the talents he already has. Bojji being deaf does not automatically make him lesser, but it does change the set of talents and ability preferences that he is endowed with, and so Bojji's arc is almost entirely one of internal growth and learning to see past the expectations of others in order to discover what will actually help him succeed, and this internal growth is also loosely tied to this anime's second major theme that becomes much more readily apparent in its second half: forgiveness.    With this being a fantasy series centered around a monarchical power struggle, betrayal and backstabbing are very much the order of the day for a large chunk of the plot, especially with Bojji being a potential rival for the throne. Even after the high ranking officials of the kingdom supplant Bojji's claim and choose Daida as the new king, Miranjo still convinces Daida that Bojji must be disposed of, and so Domas, Bojji's sword instructor, is tasked with his assassination and would have succeeded if Kage had not been there to save Bojji from his fate.    When Bojji and Domas meet again after this incident, Bojji is nearly paralyzed by fear, still believing Domas to be someone who will bring him harm. Even after Domas apologizes profusely and begs for forgiveness, Bojji runs away, unable to fully process the conflicting emotions swirling around in his head. He wants to forgive Domas, the person who's been by his side so often and tried his best to help Bojji improve his swordsmanship, even going so far as to learn sign language in order to better communicate with him, but Domas's betrayal still hangs heavy in his mind, and so he's simply not ready to forgive him yet. Kage seems to recognize this and, rather than keep trying to convince Bojji to forgive him, he runs off with Bojji to support him, knowing that this issue will take some time. It's a complicated and interesting topic to tackle, recognizing that forgiveness should occur, but simply not being ready to fully resolve those emotions, making Bojji's emotional arc regarding this issue quite compelling.    That said, as strong as that specific plotline is, not everyone seems to be given the same level of care and depth when it comes to the idea of forgiveness. Quite frankly, most of the characters are unusually quick to forgive their enemies and welcome them back into the fold despite the transgressions they've committed, and it begins to strain credibility on all parties involved. With Bojji, a quick forgiveness would make sense since he's just a wholesome little ball of wonder, but even he had to pump the brakes a bit before forgiving Domas.    It feels as though the story is trying to transfer the emotional arc Bojji experienced onto every other character in the show and it's just not landing for me, especially when it comes to the central antagonist, Miranjo. With her being the mastermind behind the attempted coup and destruction of Bosse's kingdom, her list of offenses is easily the longest from this cast, and she's also the only one to bring about the death of a named character, that being Bojji's mother, Shiina, who dies horrifically in front of Bojji as Miranjo is laying siege to the kingdom while Bosse is away.    Despite this connection, Bojji is not the one who gets tied to Miranjo in this series. It's Daida who is positioned as the one to play off of Miranjo during the present-day section of this plot, with Miranjo acting as his advisor through the magic mirror and her past self interacting with him inside his mind while Bosse is in control of his body. It's through Miranjo that Daida is led towards purging his advisors of dissent and even attempting to have his own brother killed, ultimately leading to him being trapped in his own mind after Miranjo used his body to resurrect Bosse. In theory, this should have led to a similar forgiveness arc in which Daida comes to terms with how Miranjo has wronged him, sorted through his feelings, and then eventually came around to forgiving her. Not exactly the same, but similar in that an arc should exist.    But, that's not what we got. Instead, Daida just skips straight to step three and not only forgives Miranjo immediately after learning that she had been deceiving him this whole time, but also declares that he will marry her in an attempt to lead her down the right path in the future. No intense thought given to how this situation has complicated his feelings for Miranjo. He just gets over it immediately and decides to reform her, glossing over what could have been a very interesting character dynamic.    Also, what about Bojji? Like I know that we'd kinda be repeating his forgiveness arc again, but he still had to watch his mother die in front of him because of Miranjo. That trauma is still very much baked into Bojji's character, and yet the only thing we get from Bojji on the matter is him telling Hiling that's Miranjo's cool now. It's uh…a bit hollow in my opinion, and that's to say nothing of all the other people Miranjo has wronged throughout the series on various levels. Yes Daida basically orders them to forgive her, but they certainly don't seem to be holding in any conflicting emotions. With the very brief exception of Hiling, everyone's totally on the same page about forgiving Miranjo, and it feels kind of insincere.    The story tries to dance around this by not having Miranjo, or really any character for that matter, actually get anyone killed during the present-day of this story, but this also ends up coming back to bite it as massive tonal dissonance with its own set of issues. Despite the dismemberments and desanguinations and all other methods of inflicting pain in battle, the fact that pretty much no one is killed by another person, with the exception of Bojji's mother and one other example we'll discuss in just a moment, relieves the story of having to answer that final question. Could these characters forgive each other if they actually did kill their friend or apprentice or any kind of close relation? We know Bojji can because his life has naturally sculpted him into being the most altruistic and kind-hearted person in the show, but it never forces the other characters to follow suit. Everyone makes it out of this coup alive, and even those with severe injuries like dismemberment get prosthetics attachments out of nowhere, so it never has to test the resolve of these other characters and see whether they could follow Bojji's lead in the face of something that really can't be taken back.    This does, however, bring us to the incredibly unpleasant elephant in the room: episode 18, in which we are shown Miranjo's back story and how she came to suffer the trauma conveyed to us through her talks with Daida. Now, before we dive into this, I do want to at least present the notion that most of this information is conveyed through Bosse, who, due to the circumstances we're about to discuss, could be considered an unreliable narrator. However, the story still has yet to present anything that even remotely disputes what Bosse says, and we even see the perspective of other characters that line up with this story, so to me, the validity of this interpretation leans more towards truth than fiction. Perhaps a somewhat exaggerated truth, but a truth nonetheless. In any case, Miranjo and her mother were residents of Houma, a kingdom that sought to “modernize” the kingdom of Gyakuza so as to borrow their aid in the fight against the gods. Despite the goodwill of Houma, the people of Gyakuza remained ever-skeptical and deceitful, which the show directly states is a fundamental trait of all of Gyakuza's citizens as a result of their geopolitical history, a shockingly black-and-white statement considering how nuanced the story has been previously.    Because of this, Miranjo's mother is killed in cold blood by the people of Gyakuza and Miranjo herself is horrifically maimed, with her hands cut off and the skin on her face peeled away. This heinous treatment sends Bosse into a blind rage in which he kills seemingly every resident of the town, even young children. In a more nuanced circumstance, this moment would actually play into the theme of forgiveness and show that Bosse and Miranjo were lacking in the same willpower that Bojji possesses. However, because the people of Gyakuza are presented as unambiguously and unilaterally evil and cruel, there is no reason to forgive them because there is no suggestion that they are deserving of forgiveness. The story has completely dehumanized these people to the point of them barely being human anymore.    Again, this could very well be the result of Bosse being an unreliable narrator regarding his interaction with Gyakuza, but because we are never shown evidence to the contrary and we see the perspective of a third party, we kinda have to assume that this is the truth until proven otherwise, and that's extremely troubling. This incredibly yikes portrayal of an entire civilian population gets upgraded to YIKES when you see the immensely uncomfortable parallels to the real life history of Japan's colonization of Korea, complete with visual similarities. This is a very deep and troubling nationalistic hole to go down, but even without the historical parallels, these events feel obscenely out of character for this series, as though it didn't know how to justify Miranjo's tragic back story, and it ends up making said back story weaker as a result because of how comically evil it is.    This effect can also be seen to a lesser degree with Ouken, an immortal with a thirst for blood and violence. What irks me about this character is that his plight is only conveyed in words spoken by other characters, not through his own actions. We see what he's like after immortality has driven him mad, and we see what he was like before his immortality, but the steps in-between have been cut entirely, steps that are arguably the most important part of a character whose defining personality trait is being driven to insanity. There's nothing to empathize with in Ouken because his entire descent into madness was not elaborated on, and his character wasn't exactly really fleshed-out beforehand, making him nothing more than a rampaging monster who enjoys slitting wrists and torturing his opponents. Much like the people of Gyakuza, Ouken has been completely dehumanized, thus removing him entirely from the forgiveness equation even though he easily gives Miranjo a run for her money in terms of the most harm done to other characters. I do hope that this will eventually be resolved since Ouken still remains part of the story at the end, but for now he just feels hollow and disappointing.    And so, in the end, I'm left with half a story I really love and another half I just don't feel invested in at all. The dynamic between physical appearance and actual ability was immensely interesting and truly endeared me to characters like Bojji and Kage who were desperately trying to live as equals to everyone else in the world they inhabit, and I'm very curious as to what direction the manga takes these characters after the events we've seen thus far. On the other hand, the severe lack of true consequences for a large bulk of this plot makes the theme of forgiveness feel rather infantile, almost contrived at times. The idea that everyone's getting along just fine after this cheapens the depth of this message. It's easy to forgive someone when everything's completely healed up at the end, but it's quite another when there's actual fallout to deal with, and Ranking of Kings clumsily sidesteps said fallout and comes out weaker for it. I still enjoyed my experience on the whole, especially considering the insanely strong animation and artwork provided by Wit Studio, but it's still a much shallower enjoyment than what could have been.

Ranking of Kings Ending Explained   by Michael Basile, Apr 16th 2022            Across two anime seasons packed with heavy-hitting sequels and long-awaited adaptations, the fact that Ranking of Kings has managed to stay near the top of seasonal discussions for almost half a year is a testament to how engaging this series is and how many ideas it has within it to talk about. That said, for as solid as the project is on the whole, not all ideas are created equal, so join me on a dive into some of this show's disparate themes as we try to see what final conclusion this show arrived at.    Before we jump in I wanna do a brief recap of where this story ended up at the end just to keep it in mind as we discuss what led up to it, and I want to focus primarily on two of the major end results. Firstly, we have Bojji's final battle with Bosse. Whereas Bosse continues to fight Bojji with the same brute force he always has, though this time with Daida's body, Bojji's training under Despa has allowed him to become skilled in his own right through his superior agility and his talent for discovering an opponent's weak point, thus allowing him to triumph over his father. Secondly, we have the resolution to Miranjo's plot against the kingdom. After Bojji destroys the mirror, Miranjo's soul is collected by the same demon that granted Bosse his immense strength, but through Daida's empathy and compassion, her soul is rescued and returned to a living body. Daida announces that he forgives Miranjo for her misdeeds, with Bojji following suit, and that he plans to marry her in order to share the burden of her sins moving forward.    We'll start with that first climax, as it ties into what is easily this anime's strongest idea, that being the conflict between appearance and ability. With our main character, Bojji, being deaf and unable to verbally communicate with those around him, the topic of disability is centered at the forefront of Bojji's characterization and makes his life inordinately difficult. Other children laugh at him for his disability, while many of the adults find him frustrating to deal with, leaving Bojji with few people he can connect to. What's more, his disability often leads others to assume that he is of lesser skill or intelligence than those who are more able-bodied. One the one hand, this is true in terms of pure brute force, as it's revealed that his father, Bosse, made a deal with a demon that sapped Bojji of all his potential strength. As such, Bojji is looked down on by those who expect him to become a great king like his father despite his obvious physical disadvantage, asking something of him that he simply cannot give.    On the other hand, this disability also causes those around Bojji to perceive him as less intelligent, though this aspect of Bojji is an entirely false assumption. Because he often can't communicate what he wants in order to get his point across or just goes about life in ways that seem entirely foreign or nonsensical, those who observe Bojji simply attribute this to him being dumb, as it's easier to just write off his eccentricities as a part of his disability rather than try to understand him, thus adding to the issues that Bojji faces in both his social life and in his perception as a potential leader. Bojji is not mentally inept in any way. In fact, he often exhibits a keen sense of perception and intuition that vastly outpaces those around him, but because he has difficulties communicating these ideas to others, or more often so is unable to find people who will even try to understand to him, his reputation as a dunce becomes more pervasive despite his skills.    That said, even Bojji himself doesn't fully understand this concept until later on in the series. For at least the first couple episodes, Bojji and Kage are dead set on finding someone or some way to make Bojji physically stronger, as they too see Bosse as the ideal to be strived towards. This is readily apparent in how Bojji's more agile swordsmanship is bluntly rejected by the entire castle staff in favor of Daida's more straightforward and supposedly “honorable” style of fighting, and so Bojji and Kage seek out someone who can make him more adept with brute force. It isn't until both Desha and Despa lay it out plain as day that Bojji has zero potential for physical growth that they even attempt to find an alternative, and even that takes some persuasion on Despa's part. In this instance, even Bojji has gotten too wrapped up in his perception of himself and how he believes he should be viewed by others, rather than taking himself as he is and shaping his kingly identity around that.    Then we have Kage, our thief with a heart of gold. Kage is a descendant of the infamous shadow clan, a legendary group of assassins that had been purged some time before he appears on-screen. After losing his mother, Kage is treated with disdain by everyone around him, often as the result of his appearance, and ends up starving on the streets. Even after he finds somewhere to live, the person he lives with seems to hone in on Kage's heritage and starts using him to rob homes and other locations. Here, we have an instance that less appearance vs ability, but rather appearance vs personality. Kage doesn't want to be the bad guy, and we even see in a flashback that he saw his clan as good guys who loyally served their king, but the shady nature of their line of work causes people to constantly misread Kage's intentions, which we see with Bebin during the first few episodes. As such, Kage's experiences put him in the perfect position to understand Bojji. Though he too misinterprets Bojji's talents at first, he quickly comes around and is able to see all the good in him, and so makes it his goal to support Bojji in any way he can.    Finally, one of the more fascinating, yet somewhat understated examples of this contrasting of appearance against ability is presented through the brotherly relationship between Desha and Despa,  albeit in a much less clear-cut manner. Desha, the king of the Underworld, is portrayed to be much less attractive and amiable than his brother, and, according to Despa, he would occasionally get hung up on his own appearance, as displayed by him defacing his own monument. Despite this, Desha's supreme power and charisma allowed him to gain popularity and become a great king for his nation, freeing his people from the tyrannical rule of his father.    On the flip side of that, we have Despa, highly intelligent and incredibly handsome, yet lacking in the physical strength and extraordinary powers that his brother possesses, and much like Desha, he too envies that which his brother has that he does not, as shown in a flashback where Despa mourns his lack of physical prowess in comparison to his kin. Despite this, much like Desha, Despa eventually grows wise enough to recognize the usefulness of his own talents, shaping his persona and combat tendencies in ways that only he can and not simply trying to mimic his brother, a trait that he has endeavored to pass on to Bojji so that he too can carve out his own path without trying to follow in his father's footsteps or compete with Daida solely through strength. Bojji's incredible agility and insight into discovering an opponent's weakness is his greatest asset in combat and something he achieved precisely because of his disability, and Despa recognizes how wasteful it would be to squander that talent, thus allowing Bojji to overcome his lack of strength and stand on equal footing with Daida and Bosse.    This aspect of Bojji is symbolized perfectly by his choice of weapon, a small rapier given to him by Despa. While deciding on what weapon to train with, Bojji initially tries to use an axe, as it's the same weapon his father, who is portrayed as the ideal powerful king, uses on the battlefield, but even the smallest of axes proves too unwieldy. Thus, Bojji ultimately chooses the rapier, one that seems to have very little offensive power at all and tricks even Kage into thinking that it's worthless. Yet, Bojji is able to draw out the full potential of this weapon by using a fighting style best suited for him, one that emphasizes agility and small strikes over heavy hitting attacks. This allows Bojji to completely incapacite his opponents with no bloodshed, a perfect representation of Bojji's endless altruism towards even those who seek to harm him.    In a sense, Bojji's arc is not so much about gaining the physical strength to become a better leader, but more so about coming to understand himself so as to highlight the talents he already has. Bojji being deaf does not automatically make him lesser, but it does change the set of talents and ability preferences that he is endowed with, and so Bojji's arc is almost entirely one of internal growth and learning to see past the expectations of others in order to discover what will actually help him succeed, and this internal growth is also loosely tied to this anime's second major theme that becomes much more readily apparent in its second half: forgiveness.    With this being a fantasy series centered around a monarchical power struggle, betrayal and backstabbing are very much the order of the day for a large chunk of the plot, especially with Bojji being a potential rival for the throne. Even after the high ranking officials of the kingdom supplant Bojji's claim and choose Daida as the new king, Miranjo still convinces Daida that Bojji must be disposed of, and so Domas, Bojji's sword instructor, is tasked with his assassination and would have succeeded if Kage had not been there to save Bojji from his fate.    When Bojji and Domas meet again after this incident, Bojji is nearly paralyzed by fear, still believing Domas to be someone who will bring him harm. Even after Domas apologizes profusely and begs for forgiveness, Bojji runs away, unable to fully process the conflicting emotions swirling around in his head. He wants to forgive Domas, the person who's been by his side so often and tried his best to help Bojji improve his swordsmanship, even going so far as to learn sign language in order to better communicate with him, but Domas's betrayal still hangs heavy in his mind, and so he's simply not ready to forgive him yet. Kage seems to recognize this and, rather than keep trying to convince Bojji to forgive him, he runs off with Bojji to support him, knowing that this issue will take some time. It's a complicated and interesting topic to tackle, recognizing that forgiveness should occur, but simply not being ready to fully resolve those emotions, making Bojji's emotional arc regarding this issue quite compelling.    That said, as strong as that specific plotline is, not everyone seems to be given the same level of care and depth when it comes to the idea of forgiveness. Quite frankly, most of the characters are unusually quick to forgive their enemies and welcome them back into the fold despite the transgressions they've committed, and it begins to strain credibility on all parties involved. With Bojji, a quick forgiveness would make sense since he's just a wholesome little ball of wonder, but even he had to pump the brakes a bit before forgiving Domas.    It feels as though the story is trying to transfer the emotional arc Bojji experienced onto every other character in the show and it's just not landing for me, especially when it comes to the central antagonist, Miranjo. With her being the mastermind behind the attempted coup and destruction of Bosse's kingdom, her list of offenses is easily the longest from this cast, and she's also the only one to bring about the death of a named character, that being Bojji's mother, Shiina, who dies horrifically in front of Bojji as Miranjo is laying siege to the kingdom while Bosse is away.    Despite this connection, Bojji is not the one who gets tied to Miranjo in this series. It's Daida who is positioned as the one to play off of Miranjo during the present-day section of this plot, with Miranjo acting as his advisor through the magic mirror and her past self interacting with him inside his mind while Bosse is in control of his body. It's through Miranjo that Daida is led towards purging his advisors of dissent and even attempting to have his own brother killed, ultimately leading to him being trapped in his own mind after Miranjo used his body to resurrect Bosse. In theory, this should have led to a similar forgiveness arc in which Daida comes to terms with how Miranjo has wronged him, sorted through his feelings, and then eventually came around to forgiving her. Not exactly the same, but similar in that an arc should exist.    But, that's not what we got. Instead, Daida just skips straight to step three and not only forgives Miranjo immediately after learning that she had been deceiving him this whole time, but also declares that he will marry her in an attempt to lead her down the right path in the future. No intense thought given to how this situation has complicated his feelings for Miranjo. He just gets over it immediately and decides to reform her, glossing over what could have been a very interesting character dynamic.    Also, what about Bojji? Like I know that we'd kinda be repeating his forgiveness arc again, but he still had to watch his mother die in front of him because of Miranjo. That trauma is still very much baked into Bojji's character, and yet the only thing we get from Bojji on the matter is him telling Hiling that's Miranjo's cool now. It's uh…a bit hollow in my opinion, and that's to say nothing of all the other people Miranjo has wronged throughout the series on various levels. Yes Daida basically orders them to forgive her, but they certainly don't seem to be holding in any conflicting emotions. With the very brief exception of Hiling, everyone's totally on the same page about forgiving Miranjo, and it feels kind of insincere.    The story tries to dance around this by not having Miranjo, or really any character for that matter, actually get anyone killed during the present-day of this story, but this also ends up coming back to bite it as massive tonal dissonance with its own set of issues. Despite the dismemberments and desanguinations and all other methods of inflicting pain in battle, the fact that pretty much no one is killed by another person, with the exception of Bojji's mother and one other example we'll discuss in just a moment, relieves the story of having to answer that final question. Could these characters forgive each other if they actually did kill their friend or apprentice or any kind of close relation? We know Bojji can because his life has naturally sculpted him into being the most altruistic and kind-hearted person in the show, but it never forces the other characters to follow suit. Everyone makes it out of this coup alive, and even those with severe injuries like dismemberment get prosthetics attachments out of nowhere, so it never has to test the resolve of these other characters and see whether they could follow Bojji's lead in the face of something that really can't be taken back.    This does, however, bring us to the incredibly unpleasant elephant in the room: episode 18, in which we are shown Miranjo's back story and how she came to suffer the trauma conveyed to us through her talks with Daida. Now, before we dive into this, I do want to at least present the notion that most of this information is conveyed through Bosse, who, due to the circumstances we're about to discuss, could be considered an unreliable narrator. However, the story still has yet to present anything that even remotely disputes what Bosse says, and we even see the perspective of other characters that line up with this story, so to me, the validity of this interpretation leans more towards truth than fiction. Perhaps a somewhat exaggerated truth, but a truth nonetheless. In any case, Miranjo and her mother were residents of Houma, a kingdom that sought to “modernize” the kingdom of Gyakuza so as to borrow their aid in the fight against the gods. Despite the goodwill of Houma, the people of Gyakuza remained ever-skeptical and deceitful, which the show directly states is a fundamental trait of all of Gyakuza's citizens as a result of their geopolitical history, a shockingly black-and-white statement considering how nuanced the story has been previously.    Because of this, Miranjo's mother is killed in cold blood by the people of Gyakuza and Miranjo herself is horrifically maimed, with her hands cut off and the skin on her face peeled away. This heinous treatment sends Bosse into a blind rage in which he kills seemingly every resident of the town, even young children. In a more nuanced circumstance, this moment would actually play into the theme of forgiveness and show that Bosse and Miranjo were lacking in the same willpower that Bojji possesses. However, because the people of Gyakuza are presented as unambiguously and unilaterally evil and cruel, there is no reason to forgive them because there is no suggestion that they are deserving of forgiveness. The story has completely dehumanized these people to the point of them barely being human anymore.    Again, this could very well be the result of Bosse being an unreliable narrator regarding his interaction with Gyakuza, but because we are never shown evidence to the contrary and we see the perspective of a third party, we kinda have to assume that this is the truth until proven otherwise, and that's extremely troubling. This incredibly yikes portrayal of an entire civilian population gets upgraded to YIKES when you see the immensely uncomfortable parallels to the real life history of Japan's colonization of Korea, complete with visual similarities. This is a very deep and troubling nationalistic hole to go down, but even without the historical parallels, these events feel obscenely out of character for this series, as though it didn't know how to justify Miranjo's tragic back story, and it ends up making said back story weaker as a result because of how comically evil it is.    This effect can also be seen to a lesser degree with Ouken, an immortal with a thirst for blood and violence. What irks me about this character is that his plight is only conveyed in words spoken by other characters, not through his own actions. We see what he's like after immortality has driven him mad, and we see what he was like before his immortality, but the steps in-between have been cut entirely, steps that are arguably the most important part of a character whose defining personality trait is being driven to insanity. There's nothing to empathize with in Ouken because his entire descent into madness was not elaborated on, and his character wasn't exactly really fleshed-out beforehand, making him nothing more than a rampaging monster who enjoys slitting wrists and torturing his opponents. Much like the people of Gyakuza, Ouken has been completely dehumanized, thus removing him entirely from the forgiveness equation even though he easily gives Miranjo a run for her money in terms of the most harm done to other characters. I do hope that this will eventually be resolved since Ouken still remains part of the story at the end, but for now he just feels hollow and disappointing.    And so, in the end, I'm left with half a story I really love and another half I just don't feel invested in at all. The dynamic between physical appearance and actual ability was immensely interesting and truly endeared me to characters like Bojji and Kage who were desperately trying to live as equals to everyone else in the world they inhabit, and I'm very curious as to what direction the manga takes these characters after the events we've seen thus far. On the other hand, the severe lack of true consequences for a large bulk of this plot makes the theme of forgiveness feel rather infantile, almost contrived at times. The idea that everyone's getting along just fine after this cheapens the depth of this message. It's easy to forgive someone when everything's completely healed up at the end, but it's quite another when there's actual fallout to deal with, and Ranking of Kings clumsily sidesteps said fallout and comes out weaker for it. I still enjoyed my experience on the whole, especially considering the insanely strong animation and artwork provided by Wit Studio, but it's still a much shallower enjoyment than what could have been.

Ranking of Kings Ending Explained   by Michael Basile, Apr 16th 2022            Across two anime seasons packed with heavy-hitting sequels and long-awaited adaptations, the fact that Ranking of Kings has managed to stay near the top of seasonal discussions for almost half a year is a testament to how engaging this series is and how many ideas it has within it to talk about. That said, for as solid as the project is on the whole, not all ideas are created equal, so join me on a dive into some of this show's disparate themes as we try to see what final conclusion this show arrived at.    Before we jump in I wanna do a brief recap of where this story ended up at the end just to keep it in mind as we discuss what led up to it, and I want to focus primarily on two of the major end results. Firstly, we have Bojji's final battle with Bosse. Whereas Bosse continues to fight Bojji with the same brute force he always has, though this time with Daida's body, Bojji's training under Despa has allowed him to become skilled in his own right through his superior agility and his talent for discovering an opponent's weak point, thus allowing him to triumph over his father. Secondly, we have the resolution to Miranjo's plot against the kingdom. After Bojji destroys the mirror, Miranjo's soul is collected by the same demon that granted Bosse his immense strength, but through Daida's empathy and compassion, her soul is rescued and returned to a living body. Daida announces that he forgives Miranjo for her misdeeds, with Bojji following suit, and that he plans to marry her in order to share the burden of her sins moving forward.    We'll start with that first climax, as it ties into what is easily this anime's strongest idea, that being the conflict between appearance and ability. With our main character, Bojji, being deaf and unable to verbally communicate with those around him, the topic of disability is centered at the forefront of Bojji's characterization and makes his life inordinately difficult. Other children laugh at him for his disability, while many of the adults find him frustrating to deal with, leaving Bojji with few people he can connect to. What's more, his disability often leads others to assume that he is of lesser skill or intelligence than those who are more able-bodied. One the one hand, this is true in terms of pure brute force, as it's revealed that his father, Bosse, made a deal with a demon that sapped Bojji of all his potential strength. As such, Bojji is looked down on by those who expect him to become a great king like his father despite his obvious physical disadvantage, asking something of him that he simply cannot give.    On the other hand, this disability also causes those around Bojji to perceive him as less intelligent, though this aspect of Bojji is an entirely false assumption. Because he often can't communicate what he wants in order to get his point across or just goes about life in ways that seem entirely foreign or nonsensical, those who observe Bojji simply attribute this to him being dumb, as it's easier to just write off his eccentricities as a part of his disability rather than try to understand him, thus adding to the issues that Bojji faces in both his social life and in his perception as a potential leader. Bojji is not mentally inept in any way. In fact, he often exhibits a keen sense of perception and intuition that vastly outpaces those around him, but because he has difficulties communicating these ideas to others, or more often so is unable to find people who will even try to understand to him, his reputation as a dunce becomes more pervasive despite his skills.    That said, even Bojji himself doesn't fully understand this concept until later on in the series. For at least the first couple episodes, Bojji and Kage are dead set on finding someone or some way to make Bojji physically stronger, as they too see Bosse as the ideal to be strived towards. This is readily apparent in how Bojji's more agile swordsmanship is bluntly rejected by the entire castle staff in favor of Daida's more straightforward and supposedly “honorable” style of fighting, and so Bojji and Kage seek out someone who can make him more adept with brute force. It isn't until both Desha and Despa lay it out plain as day that Bojji has zero potential for physical growth that they even attempt to find an alternative, and even that takes some persuasion on Despa's part. In this instance, even Bojji has gotten too wrapped up in his perception of himself and how he believes he should be viewed by others, rather than taking himself as he is and shaping his kingly identity around that.    Then we have Kage, our thief with a heart of gold. Kage is a descendant of the infamous shadow clan, a legendary group of assassins that had been purged some time before he appears on-screen. After losing his mother, Kage is treated with disdain by everyone around him, often as the result of his appearance, and ends up starving on the streets. Even after he finds somewhere to live, the person he lives with seems to hone in on Kage's heritage and starts using him to rob homes and other locations. Here, we have an instance that less appearance vs ability, but rather appearance vs personality. Kage doesn't want to be the bad guy, and we even see in a flashback that he saw his clan as good guys who loyally served their king, but the shady nature of their line of work causes people to constantly misread Kage's intentions, which we see with Bebin during the first few episodes. As such, Kage's experiences put him in the perfect position to understand Bojji. Though he too misinterprets Bojji's talents at first, he quickly comes around and is able to see all the good in him, and so makes it his goal to support Bojji in any way he can.    Finally, one of the more fascinating, yet somewhat understated examples of this contrasting of appearance against ability is presented through the brotherly relationship between Desha and Despa,  albeit in a much less clear-cut manner. Desha, the king of the Underworld, is portrayed to be much less attractive and amiable than his brother, and, according to Despa, he would occasionally get hung up on his own appearance, as displayed by him defacing his own monument. Despite this, Desha's supreme power and charisma allowed him to gain popularity and become a great king for his nation, freeing his people from the tyrannical rule of his father.    On the flip side of that, we have Despa, highly intelligent and incredibly handsome, yet lacking in the physical strength and extraordinary powers that his brother possesses, and much like Desha, he too envies that which his brother has that he does not, as shown in a flashback where Despa mourns his lack of physical prowess in comparison to his kin. Despite this, much like Desha, Despa eventually grows wise enough to recognize the usefulness of his own talents, shaping his persona and combat tendencies in ways that only he can and not simply trying to mimic his brother, a trait that he has endeavored to pass on to Bojji so that he too can carve out his own path without trying to follow in his father's footsteps or compete with Daida solely through strength. Bojji's incredible agility and insight into discovering an opponent's weakness is his greatest asset in combat and something he achieved precisely because of his disability, and Despa recognizes how wasteful it would be to squander that talent, thus allowing Bojji to overcome his lack of strength and stand on equal footing with Daida and Bosse.    This aspect of Bojji is symbolized perfectly by his choice of weapon, a small rapier given to him by Despa. While deciding on what weapon to train with, Bojji initially tries to use an axe, as it's the same weapon his father, who is portrayed as the ideal powerful king, uses on the battlefield, but even the smallest of axes proves too unwieldy. Thus, Bojji ultimately chooses the rapier, one that seems to have very little offensive power at all and tricks even Kage into thinking that it's worthless. Yet, Bojji is able to draw out the full potential of this weapon by using a fighting style best suited for him, one that emphasizes agility and small strikes over heavy hitting attacks. This allows Bojji to completely incapacite his opponents with no bloodshed, a perfect representation of Bojji's endless altruism towards even those who seek to harm him.    In a sense, Bojji's arc is not so much about gaining the physical strength to become a better leader, but more so about coming to understand himself so as to highlight the talents he already has. Bojji being deaf does not automatically make him lesser, but it does change the set of talents and ability preferences that he is endowed with, and so Bojji's arc is almost entirely one of internal growth and learning to see past the expectations of others in order to discover what will actually help him succeed, and this internal growth is also loosely tied to this anime's second major theme that becomes much more readily apparent in its second half: forgiveness.    With this being a fantasy series centered around a monarchical power struggle, betrayal and backstabbing are very much the order of the day for a large chunk of the plot, especially with Bojji being a potential rival for the throne. Even after the high ranking officials of the kingdom supplant Bojji's claim and choose Daida as the new king, Miranjo still convinces Daida that Bojji must be disposed of, and so Domas, Bojji's sword instructor, is tasked with his assassination and would have succeeded if Kage had not been there to save Bojji from his fate.    When Bojji and Domas meet again after this incident, Bojji is nearly paralyzed by fear, still believing Domas to be someone who will bring him harm. Even after Domas apologizes profusely and begs for forgiveness, Bojji runs away, unable to fully process the conflicting emotions swirling around in his head. He wants to forgive Domas, the person who's been by his side so often and tried his best to help Bojji improve his swordsmanship, even going so far as to learn sign language in order to better communicate with him, but Domas's betrayal still hangs heavy in his mind, and so he's simply not ready to forgive him yet. Kage seems to recognize this and, rather than keep trying to convince Bojji to forgive him, he runs off with Bojji to support him, knowing that this issue will take some time. It's a complicated and interesting topic to tackle, recognizing that forgiveness should occur, but simply not being ready to fully resolve those emotions, making Bojji's emotional arc regarding this issue quite compelling.    That said, as strong as that specific plotline is, not everyone seems to be given the same level of care and depth when it comes to the idea of forgiveness. Quite frankly, most of the characters are unusually quick to forgive their enemies and welcome them back into the fold despite the transgressions they've committed, and it begins to strain credibility on all parties involved. With Bojji, a quick forgiveness would make sense since he's just a wholesome little ball of wonder, but even he had to pump the brakes a bit before forgiving Domas.    It feels as though the story is trying to transfer the emotional arc Bojji experienced onto every other character in the show and it's just not landing for me, especially when it comes to the central antagonist, Miranjo. With her being the mastermind behind the attempted coup and destruction of Bosse's kingdom, her list of offenses is easily the longest from this cast, and she's also the only one to bring about the death of a named character, that being Bojji's mother, Shiina, who dies horrifically in front of Bojji as Miranjo is laying siege to the kingdom while Bosse is away.    Despite this connection, Bojji is not the one who gets tied to Miranjo in this series. It's Daida who is positioned as the one to play off of Miranjo during the present-day section of this plot, with Miranjo acting as his advisor through the magic mirror and her past self interacting with him inside his mind while Bosse is in control of his body. It's through Miranjo that Daida is led towards purging his advisors of dissent and even attempting to have his own brother killed, ultimately leading to him being trapped in his own mind after Miranjo used his body to resurrect Bosse. In theory, this should have led to a similar forgiveness arc in which Daida comes to terms with how Miranjo has wronged him, sorted through his feelings, and then eventually came around to forgiving her. Not exactly the same, but similar in that an arc should exist.    But, that's not what we got. Instead, Daida just skips straight to step three and not only forgives Miranjo immediately after learning that she had been deceiving him this whole time, but also declares that he will marry her in an attempt to lead her down the right path in the future. No intense thought given to how this situation has complicated his feelings for Miranjo. He just gets over it immediately and decides to reform her, glossing over what could have been a very interesting character dynamic.    Also, what about Bojji? Like I know that we'd kinda be repeating his forgiveness arc again, but he still had to watch his mother die in front of him because of Miranjo. That trauma is still very much baked into Bojji's character, and yet the only thing we get from Bojji on the matter is him telling Hiling that's Miranjo's cool now. It's uh…a bit hollow in my opinion, and that's to say nothing of all the other people Miranjo has wronged throughout the series on various levels. Yes Daida basically orders them to forgive her, but they certainly don't seem to be holding in any conflicting emotions. With the very brief exception of Hiling, everyone's totally on the same page about forgiving Miranjo, and it feels kind of insincere.    The story tries to dance around this by not having Miranjo, or really any character for that matter, actually get anyone killed during the present-day of this story, but this also ends up coming back to bite it as massive tonal dissonance with its own set of issues. Despite the dismemberments and desanguinations and all other methods of inflicting pain in battle, the fact that pretty much no one is killed by another person, with the exception of Bojji's mother and one other example we'll discuss in just a moment, relieves the story of having to answer that final question. Could these characters forgive each other if they actually did kill their friend or apprentice or any kind of close relation? We know Bojji can because his life has naturally sculpted him into being the most altruistic and kind-hearted person in the show, but it never forces the other characters to follow suit. Everyone makes it out of this coup alive, and even those with severe injuries like dismemberment get prosthetics attachments out of nowhere, so it never has to test the resolve of these other characters and see whether they could follow Bojji's lead in the face of something that really can't be taken back.    This does, however, bring us to the incredibly unpleasant elephant in the room: episode 18, in which we are shown Miranjo's back story and how she came to suffer the trauma conveyed to us through her talks with Daida. Now, before we dive into this, I do want to at least present the notion that most of this information is conveyed through Bosse, who, due to the circumstances we're about to discuss, could be considered an unreliable narrator. However, the story still has yet to present anything that even remotely disputes what Bosse says, and we even see the perspective of other characters that line up with this story, so to me, the validity of this interpretation leans more towards truth than fiction. Perhaps a somewhat exaggerated truth, but a truth nonetheless. In any case, Miranjo and her mother were residents of Houma, a kingdom that sought to “modernize” the kingdom of Gyakuza so as to borrow their aid in the fight against the gods. Despite the goodwill of Houma, the people of Gyakuza remained ever-skeptical and deceitful, which the show directly states is a fundamental trait of all of Gyakuza's citizens as a result of their geopolitical history, a shockingly black-and-white statement considering how nuanced the story has been previously.    Because of this, Miranjo's mother is killed in cold blood by the people of Gyakuza and Miranjo herself is horrifically maimed, with her hands cut off and the skin on her face peeled away. This heinous treatment sends Bosse into a blind rage in which he kills seemingly every resident of the town, even young children. In a more nuanced circumstance, this moment would actually play into the theme of forgiveness and show that Bosse and Miranjo were lacking in the same willpower that Bojji possesses. However, because the people of Gyakuza are presented as unambiguously and unilaterally evil and cruel, there is no reason to forgive them because there is no suggestion that they are deserving of forgiveness. The story has completely dehumanized these people to the point of them barely being human anymore.    Again, this could very well be the result of Bosse being an unreliable narrator regarding his interaction with Gyakuza, but because we are never shown evidence to the contrary and we see the perspective of a third party, we kinda have to assume that this is the truth until proven otherwise, and that's extremely troubling. This incredibly yikes portrayal of an entire civilian population gets upgraded to YIKES when you see the immensely uncomfortable parallels to the real life history of Japan's colonization of Korea, complete with visual similarities. This is a very deep and troubling nationalistic hole to go down, but even without the historical parallels, these events feel obscenely out of character for this series, as though it didn't know how to justify Miranjo's tragic back story, and it ends up making said back story weaker as a result because of how comically evil it is.    This effect can also be seen to a lesser degree with Ouken, an immortal with a thirst for blood and violence. What irks me about this character is that his plight is only conveyed in words spoken by other characters, not through his own actions. We see what he's like after immortality has driven him mad, and we see what he was like before his immortality, but the steps in-between have been cut entirely, steps that are arguably the most important part of a character whose defining personality trait is being driven to insanity. There's nothing to empathize with in Ouken because his entire descent into madness was not elaborated on, and his character wasn't exactly really fleshed-out beforehand, making him nothing more than a rampaging monster who enjoys slitting wrists and torturing his opponents. Much like the people of Gyakuza, Ouken has been completely dehumanized, thus removing him entirely from the forgiveness equation even though he easily gives Miranjo a run for her money in terms of the most harm done to other characters. I do hope that this will eventually be resolved since Ouken still remains part of the story at the end, but for now he just feels hollow and disappointing.    And so, in the end, I'm left with half a story I really love and another half I just don't feel invested in at all. The dynamic between physical appearance and actual ability was immensely interesting and truly endeared me to characters like Bojji and Kage who were desperately trying to live as equals to everyone else in the world they inhabit, and I'm very curious as to what direction the manga takes these characters after the events we've seen thus far. On the other hand, the severe lack of true consequences for a large bulk of this plot makes the theme of forgiveness feel rather infantile, almost contrived at times. The idea that everyone's getting along just fine after this cheapens the depth of this message. It's easy to forgive someone when everything's completely healed up at the end, but it's quite another when there's actual fallout to deal with, and Ranking of Kings clumsily sidesteps said fallout and comes out weaker for it. I still enjoyed my experience on the whole, especially considering the insanely strong animation and artwork provided by Wit Studio, but it's still a much shallower enjoyment than what could have been.

Ranking of Kings Ending Explained   by Michael Basile, Apr 16th 2022            Across two anime seasons packed with heavy-hitting sequels and long-awaited adaptations, the fact that Ranking of Kings has managed to stay near the top of seasonal discussions for almost half a year is a testament to how engaging this series is and how many ideas it has within it to talk about. That said, for as solid as the project is on the whole, not all ideas are created equal, so join me on a dive into some of this show's disparate themes as we try to see what final conclusion this show arrived at.    Before we jump in I wanna do a brief recap of where this story ended up at the end just to keep it in mind as we discuss what led up to it, and I want to focus primarily on two of the major end results. Firstly, we have Bojji's final battle with Bosse. Whereas Bosse continues to fight Bojji with the same brute force he always has, though this time with Daida's body, Bojji's training under Despa has allowed him to become skilled in his own right through his superior agility and his talent for discovering an opponent's weak point, thus allowing him to triumph over his father. Secondly, we have the resolution to Miranjo's plot against the kingdom. After Bojji destroys the mirror, Miranjo's soul is collected by the same demon that granted Bosse his immense strength, but through Daida's empathy and compassion, her soul is rescued and returned to a living body. Daida announces that he forgives Miranjo for her misdeeds, with Bojji following suit, and that he plans to marry her in order to share the burden of her sins moving forward.    We'll start with that first climax, as it ties into what is easily this anime's strongest idea, that being the conflict between appearance and ability. With our main character, Bojji, being deaf and unable to verbally communicate with those around him, the topic of disability is centered at the forefront of Bojji's characterization and makes his life inordinately difficult. Other children laugh at him for his disability, while many of the adults find him frustrating to deal with, leaving Bojji with few people he can connect to. What's more, his disability often leads others to assume that he is of lesser skill or intelligence than those who are more able-bodied. One the one hand, this is true in terms of pure brute force, as it's revealed that his father, Bosse, made a deal with a demon that sapped Bojji of all his potential strength. As such, Bojji is looked down on by those who expect him to become a great king like his father despite his obvious physical disadvantage, asking something of him that he simply cannot give.    On the other hand, this disability also causes those around Bojji to perceive him as less intelligent, though this aspect of Bojji is an entirely false assumption. Because he often can't communicate what he wants in order to get his point across or just goes about life in ways that seem entirely foreign or nonsensical, those who observe Bojji simply attribute this to him being dumb, as it's easier to just write off his eccentricities as a part of his disability rather than try to understand him, thus adding to the issues that Bojji faces in both his social life and in his perception as a potential leader. Bojji is not mentally inept in any way. In fact, he often exhibits a keen sense of perception and intuition that vastly outpaces those around him, but because he has difficulties communicating these ideas to others, or more often so is unable to find people who will even try to understand to him, his reputation as a dunce becomes more pervasive despite his skills.    That said, even Bojji himself doesn't fully understand this concept until later on in the series. For at least the first couple episodes, Bojji and Kage are dead set on finding someone or some way to make Bojji physically stronger, as they too see Bosse as the ideal to be strived towards. This is readily apparent in how Bojji's more agile swordsmanship is bluntly rejected by the entire castle staff in favor of Daida's more straightforward and supposedly “honorable” style of fighting, and so Bojji and Kage seek out someone who can make him more adept with brute force. It isn't until both Desha and Despa lay it out plain as day that Bojji has zero potential for physical growth that they even attempt to find an alternative, and even that takes some persuasion on Despa's part. In this instance, even Bojji has gotten too wrapped up in his perception of himself and how he believes he should be viewed by others, rather than taking himself as he is and shaping his kingly identity around that.    Then we have Kage, our thief with a heart of gold. Kage is a descendant of the infamous shadow clan, a legendary group of assassins that had been purged some time before he appears on-screen. After losing his mother, Kage is treated with disdain by everyone around him, often as the result of his appearance, and ends up starving on the streets. Even after he finds somewhere to live, the person he lives with seems to hone in on Kage's heritage and starts using him to rob homes and other locations. Here, we have an instance that less appearance vs ability, but rather appearance vs personality. Kage doesn't want to be the bad guy, and we even see in a flashback that he saw his clan as good guys who loyally served their king, but the shady nature of their line of work causes people to constantly misread Kage's intentions, which we see with Bebin during the first few episodes. As such, Kage's experiences put him in the perfect position to understand Bojji. Though he too misinterprets Bojji's talents at first, he quickly comes around and is able to see all the good in him, and so makes it his goal to support Bojji in any way he can.    Finally, one of the more fascinating, yet somewhat understated examples of this contrasting of appearance against ability is presented through the brotherly relationship between Desha and Despa,  albeit in a much less clear-cut manner. Desha, the king of the Underworld, is portrayed to be much less attractive and amiable than his brother, and, according to Despa, he would occasionally get hung up on his own appearance, as displayed by him defacing his own monument. Despite this, Desha's supreme power and charisma allowed him to gain popularity and become a great king for his nation, freeing his people from the tyrannical rule of his father.    On the flip side of that, we have Despa, highly intelligent and incredibly handsome, yet lacking in the physical strength and extraordinary powers that his brother possesses, and much like Desha, he too envies that which his brother has that he does not, as shown in a flashback where Despa mourns his lack of physical prowess in comparison to his kin. Despite this, much like Desha, Despa eventually grows wise enough to recognize the usefulness of his own talents, shaping his persona and combat tendencies in ways that only he can and not simply trying to mimic his brother, a trait that he has endeavored to pass on to Bojji so that he too can carve out his own path without trying to follow in his father's footsteps or compete with Daida solely through strength. Bojji's incredible agility and insight into discovering an opponent's weakness is his greatest asset in combat and something he achieved precisely because of his disability, and Despa recognizes how wasteful it would be to squander that talent, thus allowing Bojji to overcome his lack of strength and stand on equal footing with Daida and Bosse.    This aspect of Bojji is symbolized perfectly by his choice of weapon, a small rapier given to him by Despa. While deciding on what weapon to train with, Bojji initially tries to use an axe, as it's the same weapon his father, who is portrayed as the ideal powerful king, uses on the battlefield, but even the smallest of axes proves too unwieldy. Thus, Bojji ultimately chooses the rapier, one that seems to have very little offensive power at all and tricks even Kage into thinking that it's worthless. Yet, Bojji is able to draw out the full potential of this weapon by using a fighting style best suited for him, one that emphasizes agility and small strikes over heavy hitting attacks. This allows Bojji to completely incapacite his opponents with no bloodshed, a perfect representation of Bojji's endless altruism towards even those who seek to harm him.    In a sense, Bojji's arc is not so much about gaining the physical strength to become a better leader, but more so about coming to understand himself so as to highlight the talents he already has. Bojji being deaf does not automatically make him lesser, but it does change the set of talents and ability preferences that he is endowed with, and so Bojji's arc is almost entirely one of internal growth and learning to see past the expectations of others in order to discover what will actually help him succeed, and this internal growth is also loosely tied to this anime's second major theme that becomes much more readily apparent in its second half: forgiveness.    With this being a fantasy series centered around a monarchical power struggle, betrayal and backstabbing are very much the order of the day for a large chunk of the plot, especially with Bojji being a potential rival for the throne. Even after the high ranking officials of the kingdom supplant Bojji's claim and choose Daida as the new king, Miranjo still convinces Daida that Bojji must be disposed of, and so Domas, Bojji's sword instructor, is tasked with his assassination and would have succeeded if Kage had not been there to save Bojji from his fate.    When Bojji and Domas meet again after this incident, Bojji is nearly paralyzed by fear, still believing Domas to be someone who will bring him harm. Even after Domas apologizes profusely and begs for forgiveness, Bojji runs away, unable to fully process the conflicting emotions swirling around in his head. He wants to forgive Domas, the person who's been by his side so often and tried his best to help Bojji improve his swordsmanship, even going so far as to learn sign language in order to better communicate with him, but Domas's betrayal still hangs heavy in his mind, and so he's simply not ready to forgive him yet. Kage seems to recognize this and, rather than keep trying to convince Bojji to forgive him, he runs off with Bojji to support him, knowing that this issue will take some time. It's a complicated and interesting topic to tackle, recognizing that forgiveness should occur, but simply not being ready to fully resolve those emotions, making Bojji's emotional arc regarding this issue quite compelling.    That said, as strong as that specific plotline is, not everyone seems to be given the same level of care and depth when it comes to the idea of forgiveness. Quite frankly, most of the characters are unusually quick to forgive their enemies and welcome them back into the fold despite the transgressions they've committed, and it begins to strain credibility on all parties involved. With Bojji, a quick forgiveness would make sense since he's just a wholesome little ball of wonder, but even he had to pump the brakes a bit before forgiving Domas.    It feels as though the story is trying to transfer the emotional arc Bojji experienced onto every other character in the show and it's just not landing for me, especially when it comes to the central antagonist, Miranjo. With her being the mastermind behind the attempted coup and destruction of Bosse's kingdom, her list of offenses is easily the longest from this cast, and she's also the only one to bring about the death of a named character, that being Bojji's mother, Shiina, who dies horrifically in front of Bojji as Miranjo is laying siege to the kingdom while Bosse is away.    Despite this connection, Bojji is not the one who gets tied to Miranjo in this series. It's Daida who is positioned as the one to play off of Miranjo during the present-day section of this plot, with Miranjo acting as his advisor through the magic mirror and her past self interacting with him inside his mind while Bosse is in control of his body. It's through Miranjo that Daida is led towards purging his advisors of dissent and even attempting to have his own brother killed, ultimately leading to him being trapped in his own mind after Miranjo used his body to resurrect Bosse. In theory, this should have led to a similar forgiveness arc in which Daida comes to terms with how Miranjo has wronged him, sorted through his feelings, and then eventually came around to forgiving her. Not exactly the same, but similar in that an arc should exist.    But, that's not what we got. Instead, Daida just skips straight to step three and not only forgives Miranjo immediately after learning that she had been deceiving him this whole time, but also declares that he will marry her in an attempt to lead her down the right path in the future. No intense thought given to how this situation has complicated his feelings for Miranjo. He just gets over it immediately and decides to reform her, glossing over what could have been a very interesting character dynamic.    Also, what about Bojji? Like I know that we'd kinda be repeating his forgiveness arc again, but he still had to watch his mother die in front of him because of Miranjo. That trauma is still very much baked into Bojji's character, and yet the only thing we get from Bojji on the matter is him telling Hiling that's Miranjo's cool now. It's uh…a bit hollow in my opinion, and that's to say nothing of all the other people Miranjo has wronged throughout the series on various levels. Yes Daida basically orders them to forgive her, but they certainly don't seem to be holding in any conflicting emotions. With the very brief exception of Hiling, everyone's totally on the same page about forgiving Miranjo, and it feels kind of insincere.    The story tries to dance around this by not having Miranjo, or really any character for that matter, actually get anyone killed during the present-day of this story, but this also ends up coming back to bite it as massive tonal dissonance with its own set of issues. Despite the dismemberments and desanguinations and all other methods of inflicting pain in battle, the fact that pretty much no one is killed by another person, with the exception of Bojji's mother and one other example we'll discuss in just a moment, relieves the story of having to answer that final question. Could these characters forgive each other if they actually did kill their friend or apprentice or any kind of close relation? We know Bojji can because his life has naturally sculpted him into being the most altruistic and kind-hearted person in the show, but it never forces the other characters to follow suit. Everyone makes it out of this coup alive, and even those with severe injuries like dismemberment get prosthetics attachments out of nowhere, so it never has to test the resolve of these other characters and see whether they could follow Bojji's lead in the face of something that really can't be taken back.    This does, however, bring us to the incredibly unpleasant elephant in the room: episode 18, in which we are shown Miranjo's back story and how she came to suffer the trauma conveyed to us through her talks with Daida. Now, before we dive into this, I do want to at least present the notion that most of this information is conveyed through Bosse, who, due to the circumstances we're about to discuss, could be considered an unreliable narrator. However, the story still has yet to present anything that even remotely disputes what Bosse says, and we even see the perspective of other characters that line up with this story, so to me, the validity of this interpretation leans more towards truth than fiction. Perhaps a somewhat exaggerated truth, but a truth nonetheless. In any case, Miranjo and her mother were residents of Houma, a kingdom that sought to “modernize” the kingdom of Gyakuza so as to borrow their aid in the fight against the gods. Despite the goodwill of Houma, the people of Gyakuza remained ever-skeptical and deceitful, which the show directly states is a fundamental trait of all of Gyakuza's citizens as a result of their geopolitical history, a shockingly black-and-white statement considering how nuanced the story has been previously.    Because of this, Miranjo's mother is killed in cold blood by the people of Gyakuza and Miranjo herself is horrifically maimed, with her hands cut off and the skin on her face peeled away. This heinous treatment sends Bosse into a blind rage in which he kills seemingly every resident of the town, even young children. In a more nuanced circumstance, this moment would actually play into the theme of forgiveness and show that Bosse and Miranjo were lacking in the same willpower that Bojji possesses. However, because the people of Gyakuza are presented as unambiguously and unilaterally evil and cruel, there is no reason to forgive them because there is no suggestion that they are deserving of forgiveness. The story has completely dehumanized these people to the point of them barely being human anymore.    Again, this could very well be the result of Bosse being an unreliable narrator regarding his interaction with Gyakuza, but because we are never shown evidence to the contrary and we see the perspective of a third party, we kinda have to assume that this is the truth until proven otherwise, and that's extremely troubling. This incredibly yikes portrayal of an entire civilian population gets upgraded to YIKES when you see the immensely uncomfortable parallels to the real life history of Japan's colonization of Korea, complete with visual similarities. This is a very deep and troubling nationalistic hole to go down, but even without the historical parallels, these events feel obscenely out of character for this series, as though it didn't know how to justify Miranjo's tragic back story, and it ends up making said back story weaker as a result because of how comically evil it is.    This effect can also be seen to a lesser degree with Ouken, an immortal with a thirst for blood and violence. What irks me about this character is that his plight is only conveyed in words spoken by other characters, not through his own actions. We see what he's like after immortality has driven him mad, and we see what he was like before his immortality, but the steps in-between have been cut entirely, steps that are arguably the most important part of a character whose defining personality trait is being driven to insanity. There's nothing to empathize with in Ouken because his entire descent into madness was not elaborated on, and his character wasn't exactly really fleshed-out beforehand, making him nothing more than a rampaging monster who enjoys slitting wrists and torturing his opponents. Much like the people of Gyakuza, Ouken has been completely dehumanized, thus removing him entirely from the forgiveness equation even though he easily gives Miranjo a run for her money in terms of the most harm done to other characters. I do hope that this will eventually be resolved since Ouken still remains part of the story at the end, but for now he just feels hollow and disappointing.    And so, in the end, I'm left with half a story I really love and another half I just don't feel invested in at all. The dynamic between physical appearance and actual ability was immensely interesting and truly endeared me to characters like Bojji and Kage who were desperately trying to live as equals to everyone else in the world they inhabit, and I'm very curious as to what direction the manga takes these characters after the events we've seen thus far. On the other hand, the severe lack of true consequences for a large bulk of this plot makes the theme of forgiveness feel rather infantile, almost contrived at times. The idea that everyone's getting along just fine after this cheapens the depth of this message. It's easy to forgive someone when everything's completely healed up at the end, but it's quite another when there's actual fallout to deal with, and Ranking of Kings clumsily sidesteps said fallout and comes out weaker for it. I still enjoyed my experience on the whole, especially considering the insanely strong animation and artwork provided by Wit Studio, but it's still a much shallower enjoyment than what could have been.

Ranking of Kings Ending Explained   by Michael Basile, Apr 16th 2022            Across two anime seasons packed with heavy-hitting sequels and long-awaited adaptations, the fact that Ranking of Kings has managed to stay near the top of seasonal discussions for almost half a year is a testament to how engaging this series is and how many ideas it has within it to talk about. That said, for as solid as the project is on the whole, not all ideas are created equal, so join me on a dive into some of this show's disparate themes as we try to see what final conclusion this show arrived at.    Before we jump in I wanna do a brief recap of where this story ended up at the end just to keep it in mind as we discuss what led up to it, and I want to focus primarily on two of the major end results. Firstly, we have Bojji's final battle with Bosse. Whereas Bosse continues to fight Bojji with the same brute force he always has, though this time with Daida's body, Bojji's training under Despa has allowed him to become skilled in his own right through his superior agility and his talent for discovering an opponent's weak point, thus allowing him to triumph over his father. Secondly, we have the resolution to Miranjo's plot against the kingdom. After Bojji destroys the mirror, Miranjo's soul is collected by the same demon that granted Bosse his immense strength, but through Daida's empathy and compassion, her soul is rescued and returned to a living body. Daida announces that he forgives Miranjo for her misdeeds, with Bojji following suit, and that he plans to marry her in order to share the burden of her sins moving forward.    We'll start with that first climax, as it ties into what is easily this anime's strongest idea, that being the conflict between appearance and ability. With our main character, Bojji, being deaf and unable to verbally communicate with those around him, the topic of disability is centered at the forefront of Bojji's characterization and makes his life inordinately difficult. Other children laugh at him for his disability, while many of the adults find him frustrating to deal with, leaving Bojji with few people he can connect to. What's more, his disability often leads others to assume that he is of lesser skill or intelligence than those who are more able-bodied. One the one hand, this is true in terms of pure brute force, as it's revealed that his father, Bosse, made a deal with a demon that sapped Bojji of all his potential strength. As such, Bojji is looked down on by those who expect him to become a great king like his father despite his obvious physical disadvantage, asking something of him that he simply cannot give.    On the other hand, this disability also causes those around Bojji to perceive him as less intelligent, though this aspect of Bojji is an entirely false assumption. Because he often can't communicate what he wants in order to get his point across or just goes about life in ways that seem entirely foreign or nonsensical, those who observe Bojji simply attribute this to him being dumb, as it's easier to just write off his eccentricities as a part of his disability rather than try to understand him, thus adding to the issues that Bojji faces in both his social life and in his perception as a potential leader. Bojji is not mentally inept in any way. In fact, he often exhibits a keen sense of perception and intuition that vastly outpaces those around him, but because he has difficulties communicating these ideas to others, or more often so is unable to find people who will even try to understand to him, his reputation as a dunce becomes more pervasive despite his skills.    That said, even Bojji himself doesn't fully understand this concept until later on in the series. For at least the first couple episodes, Bojji and Kage are dead set on finding someone or some way to make Bojji physically stronger, as they too see Bosse as the ideal to be strived towards. This is readily apparent in how Bojji's more agile swordsmanship is bluntly rejected by the entire castle staff in favor of Daida's more straightforward and supposedly “honorable” style of fighting, and so Bojji and Kage seek out someone who can make him more adept with brute force. It isn't until both Desha and Despa lay it out plain as day that Bojji has zero potential for physical growth that they even attempt to find an alternative, and even that takes some persuasion on Despa's part. In this instance, even Bojji has gotten too wrapped up in his perception of himself and how he believes he should be viewed by others, rather than taking himself as he is and shaping his kingly identity around that.    Then we have Kage, our thief with a heart of gold. Kage is a descendant of the infamous shadow clan, a legendary group of assassins that had been purged some time before he appears on-screen. After losing his mother, Kage is treated with disdain by everyone around him, often as the result of his appearance, and ends up starving on the streets. Even after he finds somewhere to live, the person he lives with seems to hone in on Kage's heritage and starts using him to rob homes and other locations. Here, we have an instance that less appearance vs ability, but rather appearance vs personality. Kage doesn't want to be the bad guy, and we even see in a flashback that he saw his clan as good guys who loyally served their king, but the shady nature of their line of work causes people to constantly misread Kage's intentions, which we see with Bebin during the first few episodes. As such, Kage's experiences put him in the perfect position to understand Bojji. Though he too misinterprets Bojji's talents at first, he quickly comes around and is able to see all the good in him, and so makes it his goal to support Bojji in any way he can.    Finally, one of the more fascinating, yet somewhat understated examples of this contrasting of appearance against ability is presented through the brotherly relationship between Desha and Despa,  albeit in a much less clear-cut manner. Desha, the king of the Underworld, is portrayed to be much less attractive and amiable than his brother, and, according to Despa, he would occasionally get hung up on his own appearance, as displayed by him defacing his own monument. Despite this, Desha's supreme power and charisma allowed him to gain popularity and become a great king for his nation, freeing his people from the tyrannical rule of his father.    On the flip side of that, we have Despa, highly intelligent and incredibly handsome, yet lacking in the physical strength and extraordinary powers that his brother possesses, and much like Desha, he too envies that which his brother has that he does not, as shown in a flashback where Despa mourns his lack of physical prowess in comparison to his kin. Despite this, much like Desha, Despa eventually grows wise enough to recognize the usefulness of his own talents, shaping his persona and combat tendencies in ways that only he can and not simply trying to mimic his brother, a trait that he has endeavored to pass on to Bojji so that he too can carve out his own path without trying to follow in his father's footsteps or compete with Daida solely through strength. Bojji's incredible agility and insight into discovering an opponent's weakness is his greatest asset in combat and something he achieved precisely because of his disability, and Despa recognizes how wasteful it would be to squander that talent, thus allowing Bojji to overcome his lack of strength and stand on equal footing with Daida and Bosse.    This aspect of Bojji is symbolized perfectly by his choice of weapon, a small rapier given to him by Despa. While deciding on what weapon to train with, Bojji initially tries to use an axe, as it's the same weapon his father, who is portrayed as the ideal powerful king, uses on the battlefield, but even the smallest of axes proves too unwieldy. Thus, Bojji ultimately chooses the rapier, one that seems to have very little offensive power at all and tricks even Kage into thinking that it's worthless. Yet, Bojji is able to draw out the full potential of this weapon by using a fighting style best suited for him, one that emphasizes agility and small strikes over heavy hitting attacks. This allows Bojji to completely incapacite his opponents with no bloodshed, a perfect representation of Bojji's endless altruism towards even those who seek to harm him.    In a sense, Bojji's arc is not so much about gaining the physical strength to become a better leader, but more so about coming to understand himself so as to highlight the talents he already has. Bojji being deaf does not automatically make him lesser, but it does change the set of talents and ability preferences that he is endowed with, and so Bojji's arc is almost entirely one of internal growth and learning to see past the expectations of others in order to discover what will actually help him succeed, and this internal growth is also loosely tied to this anime's second major theme that becomes much more readily apparent in its second half: forgiveness.    With this being a fantasy series centered around a monarchical power struggle, betrayal and backstabbing are very much the order of the day for a large chunk of the plot, especially with Bojji being a potential rival for the throne. Even after the high ranking officials of the kingdom supplant Bojji's claim and choose Daida as the new king, Miranjo still convinces Daida that Bojji must be disposed of, and so Domas, Bojji's sword instructor, is tasked with his assassination and would have succeeded if Kage had not been there to save Bojji from his fate.    When Bojji and Domas meet again after this incident, Bojji is nearly paralyzed by fear, still believing Domas to be someone who will bring him harm. Even after Domas apologizes profusely and begs for forgiveness, Bojji runs away, unable to fully process the conflicting emotions swirling around in his head. He wants to forgive Domas, the person who's been by his side so often and tried his best to help Bojji improve his swordsmanship, even going so far as to learn sign language in order to better communicate with him, but Domas's betrayal still hangs heavy in his mind, and so he's simply not ready to forgive him yet. Kage seems to recognize this and, rather than keep trying to convince Bojji to forgive him, he runs off with Bojji to support him, knowing that this issue will take some time. It's a complicated and interesting topic to tackle, recognizing that forgiveness should occur, but simply not being ready to fully resolve those emotions, making Bojji's emotional arc regarding this issue quite compelling.    That said, as strong as that specific plotline is, not everyone seems to be given the same level of care and depth when it comes to the idea of forgiveness. Quite frankly, most of the characters are unusually quick to forgive their enemies and welcome them back into the fold despite the transgressions they've committed, and it begins to strain credibility on all parties involved. With Bojji, a quick forgiveness would make sense since he's just a wholesome little ball of wonder, but even he had to pump the brakes a bit before forgiving Domas.    It feels as though the story is trying to transfer the emotional arc Bojji experienced onto every other character in the show and it's just not landing for me, especially when it comes to the central antagonist, Miranjo. With her being the mastermind behind the attempted coup and destruction of Bosse's kingdom, her list of offenses is easily the longest from this cast, and she's also the only one to bring about the death of a named character, that being Bojji's mother, Shiina, who dies horrifically in front of Bojji as Miranjo is laying siege to the kingdom while Bosse is away.    Despite this connection, Bojji is not the one who gets tied to Miranjo in this series. It's Daida who is positioned as the one to play off of Miranjo during the present-day section of this plot, with Miranjo acting as his advisor through the magic mirror and her past self interacting with him inside his mind while Bosse is in control of his body. It's through Miranjo that Daida is led towards purging his advisors of dissent and even attempting to have his own brother killed, ultimately leading to him being trapped in his own mind after Miranjo used his body to resurrect Bosse. In theory, this should have led to a similar forgiveness arc in which Daida comes to terms with how Miranjo has wronged him, sorted through his feelings, and then eventually came around to forgiving her. Not exactly the same, but similar in that an arc should exist.    But, that's not what we got. Instead, Daida just skips straight to step three and not only forgives Miranjo immediately after learning that she had been deceiving him this whole time, but also declares that he will marry her in an attempt to lead her down the right path in the future. No intense thought given to how this situation has complicated his feelings for Miranjo. He just gets over it immediately and decides to reform her, glossing over what could have been a very interesting character dynamic.    Also, what about Bojji? Like I know that we'd kinda be repeating his forgiveness arc again, but he still had to watch his mother die in front of him because of Miranjo. That trauma is still very much baked into Bojji's character, and yet the only thing we get from Bojji on the matter is him telling Hiling that's Miranjo's cool now. It's uh…a bit hollow in my opinion, and that's to say nothing of all the other people Miranjo has wronged throughout the series on various levels. Yes Daida basically orders them to forgive her, but they certainly don't seem to be holding in any conflicting emotions. With the very brief exception of Hiling, everyone's totally on the same page about forgiving Miranjo, and it feels kind of insincere.    The story tries to dance around this by not having Miranjo, or really any character for that matter, actually get anyone killed during the present-day of this story, but this also ends up coming back to bite it as massive tonal dissonance with its own set of issues. Despite the dismemberments and desanguinations and all other methods of inflicting pain in battle, the fact that pretty much no one is killed by another person, with the exception of Bojji's mother and one other example we'll discuss in just a moment, relieves the story of having to answer that final question. Could these characters forgive each other if they actually did kill their friend or apprentice or any kind of close relation? We know Bojji can because his life has naturally sculpted him into being the most altruistic and kind-hearted person in the show, but it never forces the other characters to follow suit. Everyone makes it out of this coup alive, and even those with severe injuries like dismemberment get prosthetics attachments out of nowhere, so it never has to test the resolve of these other characters and see whether they could follow Bojji's lead in the face of something that really can't be taken back.    This does, however, bring us to the incredibly unpleasant elephant in the room: episode 18, in which we are shown Miranjo's back story and how she came to suffer the trauma conveyed to us through her talks with Daida. Now, before we dive into this, I do want to at least present the notion that most of this information is conveyed through Bosse, who, due to the circumstances we're about to discuss, could be considered an unreliable narrator. However, the story still has yet to present anything that even remotely disputes what Bosse says, and we even see the perspective of other characters that line up with this story, so to me, the validity of this interpretation leans more towards truth than fiction. Perhaps a somewhat exaggerated truth, but a truth nonetheless. In any case, Miranjo and her mother were residents of Houma, a kingdom that sought to “modernize” the kingdom of Gyakuza so as to borrow their aid in the fight against the gods. Despite the goodwill of Houma, the people of Gyakuza remained ever-skeptical and deceitful, which the show directly states is a fundamental trait of all of Gyakuza's citizens as a result of their geopolitical history, a shockingly black-and-white statement considering how nuanced the story has been previously.    Because of this, Miranjo's mother is killed in cold blood by the people of Gyakuza and Miranjo herself is horrifically maimed, with her hands cut off and the skin on her face peeled away. This heinous treatment sends Bosse into a blind rage in which he kills seemingly every resident of the town, even young children. In a more nuanced circumstance, this moment would actually play into the theme of forgiveness and show that Bosse and Miranjo were lacking in the same willpower that Bojji possesses. However, because the people of Gyakuza are presented as unambiguously and unilaterally evil and cruel, there is no reason to forgive them because there is no suggestion that they are deserving of forgiveness. The story has completely dehumanized these people to the point of them barely being human anymore.    Again, this could very well be the result of Bosse being an unreliable narrator regarding his interaction with Gyakuza, but because we are never shown evidence to the contrary and we see the perspective of a third party, we kinda have to assume that this is the truth until proven otherwise, and that's extremely troubling. This incredibly yikes portrayal of an entire civilian population gets upgraded to YIKES when you see the immensely uncomfortable parallels to the real life history of Japan's colonization of Korea, complete with visual similarities. This is a very deep and troubling nationalistic hole to go down, but even without the historical parallels, these events feel obscenely out of character for this series, as though it didn't know how to justify Miranjo's tragic back story, and it ends up making said back story weaker as a result because of how comically evil it is.    This effect can also be seen to a lesser degree with Ouken, an immortal with a thirst for blood and violence. What irks me about this character is that his plight is only conveyed in words spoken by other characters, not through his own actions. We see what he's like after immortality has driven him mad, and we see what he was like before his immortality, but the steps in-between have been cut entirely, steps that are arguably the most important part of a character whose defining personality trait is being driven to insanity. There's nothing to empathize with in Ouken because his entire descent into madness was not elaborated on, and his character wasn't exactly really fleshed-out beforehand, making him nothing more than a rampaging monster who enjoys slitting wrists and torturing his opponents. Much like the people of Gyakuza, Ouken has been completely dehumanized, thus removing him entirely from the forgiveness equation even though he easily gives Miranjo a run for her money in terms of the most harm done to other characters. I do hope that this will eventually be resolved since Ouken still remains part of the story at the end, but for now he just feels hollow and disappointing.    And so, in the end, I'm left with half a story I really love and another half I just don't feel invested in at all. The dynamic between physical appearance and actual ability was immensely interesting and truly endeared me to characters like Bojji and Kage who were desperately trying to live as equals to everyone else in the world they inhabit, and I'm very curious as to what direction the manga takes these characters after the events we've seen thus far. On the other hand, the severe lack of true consequences for a large bulk of this plot makes the theme of forgiveness feel rather infantile, almost contrived at times. The idea that everyone's getting along just fine after this cheapens the depth of this message. It's easy to forgive someone when everything's completely healed up at the end, but it's quite another when there's actual fallout to deal with, and Ranking of Kings clumsily sidesteps said fallout and comes out weaker for it. I still enjoyed my experience on the whole, especially considering the insanely strong animation and artwork provided by Wit Studio, but it's still a much shallower enjoyment than what could have been.

Ranking of Kings Ending Explained   by Michael Basile, Apr 16th 2022            Across two anime seasons packed with heavy-hitting sequels and long-awaited adaptations, the fact that Ranking of Kings has managed to stay near the top of seasonal discussions for almost half a year is a testament to how engaging this series is and how many ideas it has within it to talk about. That said, for as solid as the project is on the whole, not all ideas are created equal, so join me on a dive into some of this show's disparate themes as we try to see what final conclusion this show arrived at.    Before we jump in I wanna do a brief recap of where this story ended up at the end just to keep it in mind as we discuss what led up to it, and I want to focus primarily on two of the major end results. Firstly, we have Bojji's final battle with Bosse. Whereas Bosse continues to fight Bojji with the same brute force he always has, though this time with Daida's body, Bojji's training under Despa has allowed him to become skilled in his own right through his superior agility and his talent for discovering an opponent's weak point, thus allowing him to triumph over his father. Secondly, we have the resolution to Miranjo's plot against the kingdom. After Bojji destroys the mirror, Miranjo's soul is collected by the same demon that granted Bosse his immense strength, but through Daida's empathy and compassion, her soul is rescued and returned to a living body. Daida announces that he forgives Miranjo for her misdeeds, with Bojji following suit, and that he plans to marry her in order to share the burden of her sins moving forward.    We'll start with that first climax, as it ties into what is easily this anime's strongest idea, that being the conflict between appearance and ability. With our main character, Bojji, being deaf and unable to verbally communicate with those around him, the topic of disability is centered at the forefront of Bojji's characterization and makes his life inordinately difficult. Other children laugh at him for his disability, while many of the adults find him frustrating to deal with, leaving Bojji with few people he can connect to. What's more, his disability often leads others to assume that he is of lesser skill or intelligence than those who are more able-bodied. One the one hand, this is true in terms of pure brute force, as it's revealed that his father, Bosse, made a deal with a demon that sapped Bojji of all his potential strength. As such, Bojji is looked down on by those who expect him to become a great king like his father despite his obvious physical disadvantage, asking something of him that he simply cannot give.    On the other hand, this disability also causes those around Bojji to perceive him as less intelligent, though this aspect of Bojji is an entirely false assumption. Because he often can't communicate what he wants in order to get his point across or just goes about life in ways that seem entirely foreign or nonsensical, those who observe Bojji simply attribute this to him being dumb, as it's easier to just write off his eccentricities as a part of his disability rather than try to understand him, thus adding to the issues that Bojji faces in both his social life and in his perception as a potential leader. Bojji is not mentally inept in any way. In fact, he often exhibits a keen sense of perception and intuition that vastly outpaces those around him, but because he has difficulties communicating these ideas to others, or more often so is unable to find people who will even try to understand to him, his reputation as a dunce becomes more pervasive despite his skills.    That said, even Bojji himself doesn't fully understand this concept until later on in the series. For at least the first couple episodes, Bojji and Kage are dead set on finding someone or some way to make Bojji physically stronger, as they too see Bosse as the ideal to be strived towards. This is readily apparent in how Bojji's more agile swordsmanship is bluntly rejected by the entire castle staff in favor of Daida's more straightforward and supposedly “honorable” style of fighting, and so Bojji and Kage seek out someone who can make him more adept with brute force. It isn't until both Desha and Despa lay it out plain as day that Bojji has zero potential for physical growth that they even attempt to find an alternative, and even that takes some persuasion on Despa's part. In this instance, even Bojji has gotten too wrapped up in his perception of himself and how he believes he should be viewed by others, rather than taking himself as he is and shaping his kingly identity around that.    Then we have Kage, our thief with a heart of gold. Kage is a descendant of the infamous shadow clan, a legendary group of assassins that had been purged some time before he appears on-screen. After losing his mother, Kage is treated with disdain by everyone around him, often as the result of his appearance, and ends up starving on the streets. Even after he finds somewhere to live, the person he lives with seems to hone in on Kage's heritage and starts using him to rob homes and other locations. Here, we have an instance that less appearance vs ability, but rather appearance vs personality. Kage doesn't want to be the bad guy, and we even see in a flashback that he saw his clan as good guys who loyally served their king, but the shady nature of their line of work causes people to constantly misread Kage's intentions, which we see with Bebin during the first few episodes. As such, Kage's experiences put him in the perfect position to understand Bojji. Though he too misinterprets Bojji's talents at first, he quickly comes around and is able to see all the good in him, and so makes it his goal to support Bojji in any way he can.    Finally, one of the more fascinating, yet somewhat understated examples of this contrasting of appearance against ability is presented through the brotherly relationship between Desha and Despa,  albeit in a much less clear-cut manner. Desha, the king of the Underworld, is portrayed to be much less attractive and amiable than his brother, and, according to Despa, he would occasionally get hung up on his own appearance, as displayed by him defacing his own monument. Despite this, Desha's supreme power and charisma allowed him to gain popularity and become a great king for his nation, freeing his people from the tyrannical rule of his father.    On the flip side of that, we have Despa, highly intelligent and incredibly handsome, yet lacking in the physical strength and extraordinary powers that his brother possesses, and much like Desha, he too envies that which his brother has that he does not, as shown in a flashback where Despa mourns his lack of physical prowess in comparison to his kin. Despite this, much like Desha, Despa eventually grows wise enough to recognize the usefulness of his own talents, shaping his persona and combat tendencies in ways that only he can and not simply trying to mimic his brother, a trait that he has endeavored to pass on to Bojji so that he too can carve out his own path without trying to follow in his father's footsteps or compete with Daida solely through strength. Bojji's incredible agility and insight into discovering an opponent's weakness is his greatest asset in combat and something he achieved precisely because of his disability, and Despa recognizes how wasteful it would be to squander that talent, thus allowing Bojji to overcome his lack of strength and stand on equal footing with Daida and Bosse.    This aspect of Bojji is symbolized perfectly by his choice of weapon, a small rapier given to him by Despa. While deciding on what weapon to train with, Bojji initially tries to use an axe, as it's the same weapon his father, who is portrayed as the ideal powerful king, uses on the battlefield, but even the smallest of axes proves too unwieldy. Thus, Bojji ultimately chooses the rapier, one that seems to have very little offensive power at all and tricks even Kage into thinking that it's worthless. Yet, Bojji is able to draw out the full potential of this weapon by using a fighting style best suited for him, one that emphasizes agility and small strikes over heavy hitting attacks. This allows Bojji to completely incapacite his opponents with no bloodshed, a perfect representation of Bojji's endless altruism towards even those who seek to harm him.    In a sense, Bojji's arc is not so much about gaining the physical strength to become a better leader, but more so about coming to understand himself so as to highlight the talents he already has. Bojji being deaf does not automatically make him lesser, but it does change the set of talents and ability preferences that he is endowed with, and so Bojji's arc is almost entirely one of internal growth and learning to see past the expectations of others in order to discover what will actually help him succeed, and this internal growth is also loosely tied to this anime's second major theme that becomes much more readily apparent in its second half: forgiveness.    With this being a fantasy series centered around a monarchical power struggle, betrayal and backstabbing are very much the order of the day for a large chunk of the plot, especially with Bojji being a potential rival for the throne. Even after the high ranking officials of the kingdom supplant Bojji's claim and choose Daida as the new king, Miranjo still convinces Daida that Bojji must be disposed of, and so Domas, Bojji's sword instructor, is tasked with his assassination and would have succeeded if Kage had not been there to save Bojji from his fate.    When Bojji and Domas meet again after this incident, Bojji is nearly paralyzed by fear, still believing Domas to be someone who will bring him harm. Even after Domas apologizes profusely and begs for forgiveness, Bojji runs away, unable to fully process the conflicting emotions swirling around in his head. He wants to forgive Domas, the person who's been by his side so often and tried his best to help Bojji improve his swordsmanship, even going so far as to learn sign language in order to better communicate with him, but Domas's betrayal still hangs heavy in his mind, and so he's simply not ready to forgive him yet. Kage seems to recognize this and, rather than keep trying to convince Bojji to forgive him, he runs off with Bojji to support him, knowing that this issue will take some time. It's a complicated and interesting topic to tackle, recognizing that forgiveness should occur, but simply not being ready to fully resolve those emotions, making Bojji's emotional arc regarding this issue quite compelling.

Ranking of Kings Ending Explained - Anime News Network:SEA,"       How Far Does Forgiveness Go? Ranking of Kings Ending Explained   by Michael Basile, Apr 16th 2022            Across two anime seasons packed with heavy-hitting sequels and long-awaited adaptations, the fact that Ranking of Kings has managed to stay near the top of seasonal discussions for almost half a year is a testament to how engaging this series is and how many ideas it has within it to talk about. That said, for as solid as the project is on the whole, not all ideas are created equal, so join me on a dive into some of this show's disparate themes as we try to see what final conclusion this show arrived at.    Before we jump in I wanna do a brief recap of where this story ended up at the end just to keep it in mind as we discuss what led up to it, and I want to focus primarily on two of the major end results. Firstly, we have Bojji's final battle with Bosse. Whereas Bosse continues to fight Bojji with the same brute force he always has, though this time with Daida's body, Bojji's training under Despa has allowed him to become skilled in his own right through his superior agility and his talent for discovering an opponent's weak point, thus allowing him to triumph over his father. Secondly, we have the resolution to Miranjo's plot against the kingdom. After Bojji destroys the mirror, Miranjo's soul is collected by the same demon that granted Bosse his immense strength, but through Daida's empathy and compassion, her soul is rescued and returned to a living body. Daida announces that he forgives Miranjo for her misdeeds, with Bojji following suit, and that he plans to marry her in order to share the burden of her sins moving forward.    We'll start with that first climax, as it ties into what is easily this anime's strongest idea, that being the conflict between appearance and ability. With our main character, Bojji, being deaf and unable to verbally communicate with those around him, the topic of disability is centered at the forefront of Bojji's characterization and makes his life inordinately difficult. Other children laugh at him for his disability, while many of the adults find him frustrating to deal with, leaving Bojji with few people he can connect to. What's more, his disability often leads others to assume that he is of lesser skill or intelligence than those who are more able-bodied. One the one hand, this is true in terms of pure brute force, as it's revealed that his father, Bosse, made a deal with a demon that sapped Bojji of all his potential strength. As such, Bojji is looked down on by those who expect him to become a great king like his father despite his obvious physical disadvantage, asking something of him that he simply cannot give.    On the other hand, this disability also causes those around Bojji to perceive him as less intelligent, though this aspect of Bojji is an entirely false assumption. Because he often can't communicate what he wants in order to get his point across or just goes about life in ways that seem entirely foreign or nonsensical, those who observe Bojji simply attribute this to him being dumb, as it's easier to just write off his eccentricities as a part of his disability rather than try to understand him, thus adding to the issues that Bojji faces in both his social life and in his perception as a potential leader. Bojji is not mentally inept in any way. In fact, he often exhibits a keen sense of perception and intuition that vastly outpaces those around him, but because he has difficulties communicating these ideas to others, or more often so is unable to find people who will even try to understand to him, his reputation as a dunce becomes more pervasive despite his skills.    That said, even Bojji himself doesn't fully understand this concept until later on in the series. For at least the first couple episodes, Bojji and Kage are dead set on finding someone or some way to make Bojji physically stronger, as they too see Bosse as the ideal to be strived towards. This is readily apparent in how Bojji's more agile swordsmanship is bluntly rejected by the entire castle staff in favor of Daida's more straightforward and supposedly “honorable” style of fighting, and so Bojji and Kage seek out someone who can make him more adept with brute force. It isn't until both Desha and Despa lay it out plain as day that Bojji has zero potential for physical growth that they even attempt to find an alternative, and even that takes some persuasion on Despa's part. In this instance, even Bojji has gotten too wrapped up in his perception of himself and how he believes he should be viewed by others, rather than taking himself as he is and shaping his kingly identity around that.    Then we have Kage, our thief with a heart of gold. Kage is a descendant of the infamous shadow clan, a legendary group of assassins that had been purged some time before he appears on-screen. After losing his mother, Kage is treated with disdain by everyone around him, often as the result of his appearance, and ends up starving on the streets. Even after he finds somewhere to live, the person he lives with seems to hone in on Kage's heritage and starts using him to rob homes and other locations. Here, we have an instance that less appearance vs ability, but rather appearance vs personality. Kage doesn't want to be the bad guy, and we even see in a flashback that he saw his clan as good guys who loyally served their king, but the shady nature of their line of work causes people to constantly misread Kage's intentions, which we see with Bebin during the first few episodes. As such, Kage's experiences put him in the perfect position to understand Bojji. Though he too misinterprets Bojji's talents at first, he quickly comes around and is able to see all the good in him, and so makes it his goal to support Bojji in any way he can.    Finally, one of the more fascinating, yet somewhat understated examples of this contrasting of appearance against ability is presented through the brotherly relationship between Desha and Despa,  albeit in a much less clear-cut manner. Desha, the king of the Underworld, is portrayed to be much less attractive and amiable than his brother, and, according to Despa, he would occasionally get hung up on his own appearance, as displayed by him defacing his own monument. Despite this, Desha's supreme power and charisma allowed him to gain popularity and become a great king for his nation, freeing his people from the tyrannical rule of his father.    On the flip side of that, we have Despa, highly intelligent and incredibly handsome, yet lacking in the physical strength and extraordinary powers that his brother possesses, and much like Desha, he too envies that which his brother has that he does not, as shown in a flashback where Despa mourns his lack of physical prowess in comparison to his kin. Despite this, much like Desha, Despa eventually grows wise enough to recognize the usefulness of his own talents, shaping his persona and combat tendencies in ways that only he can and not simply trying to mimic his brother, a trait that he has endeavored to pass on to Bojji so that he too can carve out his own path without trying to follow in his father's footsteps or compete with Daida solely through strength. Bojji's incredible agility and insight into discovering an opponent's weakness is his greatest asset in combat and something he achieved precisely because of his disability, and Despa recognizes how wasteful it would be to squander that talent, thus allowing Bojji to overcome his lack of strength and stand on equal footing with Daida and Bosse.    This aspect of Bojji is symbolized perfectly by his choice of weapon, a small rapier given to him by Despa. While deciding on what weapon to train with, Bojji initially tries to use an axe, as it's the same weapon his father, who is portrayed as the ideal powerful king, uses on the battlefield, but even the smallest of axes proves too unwieldy. Thus, Bojji ultimately chooses the rapier, one that seems to have very little offensive power at all and tricks even Kage into thinking that it's worthless. Yet, Bojji is able to draw out the full potential of this weapon by using a fighting style best suited for him, one that emphasizes agility and small strikes over heavy hitting attacks. This allows Bojji to completely incapacite his opponents with no bloodshed, a perfect representation of Bojji's endless altruism towards even those who seek to harm him.    In a sense, Bojji's arc is not so much about gaining the physical strength to become a better leader, but more so about coming to understand himself so as to highlight the talents he already has. Bojji being deaf does not automatically make him lesser, but it does change the set of talents and ability preferences that he is endowed with, and so Bojji's arc is almost entirely one of internal growth and learning to see past the expectations of others in order to discover what will actually help him succeed, and this internal growth is also loosely tied to this anime's second major theme that becomes much more readily apparent in its second half: forgiveness.    With this being a fantasy series centered around a monarchical power struggle, betrayal and backstabbing are very much the order of the day for a large chunk of the plot, especially with Bojji being a potential rival for the throne. Even after the high ranking officials of the kingdom supplant Bojji's claim and choose Daida as the new king, Miranjo still convinces Daida that Bojji must be disposed of, and so Domas, Bojji's sword instructor, is tasked with his assassination and would have succeeded if Kage had not been there to save Bojji from his fate.    When Bojji and Domas meet again after this incident, Bojji is nearly paralyzed by fear, still believing Domas to be someone who will bring him harm. Even after Domas apologizes profusely and begs for forgiveness, Bojji runs away, unable to fully process the conflicting emotions swirling around in his head. He wants to forgive Domas, the person who's been by his side so often and tried his best to help Bojji improve his swordsmanship, even going so far as to learn sign language in order to better communicate with him, but Domas's betrayal still hangs heavy in his mind, and so he's simply not ready to forgive him yet. Kage seems to recognize this and, rather than keep trying to convince Bojji to forgive him, he runs off with Bojji to support him, knowing that this issue will take some time. It's a complicated and interesting topic to tackle, recognizing that forgiveness should occur, but simply not being ready to fully resolve those emotions, making Bojji's emotional arc regarding this issue quite compelling.    That said, as strong as that specific plotline is, not everyone seems to be given the same level of care and depth when it comes to the idea of forgiveness. Quite frankly, most of the characters are unusually quick to forgive their enemies and welcome them back into the fold despite the transgressions they've committed, and it begins to strain credibility on all parties involved. With Bojji, a quick forgiveness would make sense since he's just a wholesome little ball of wonder, but even he had to pump the brakes a bit before forgiving Domas.    It feels as though the story is trying to transfer the emotional arc Bojji experienced onto every other character in the show and it's just not landing for me, especially when it comes to the central antagonist, Miranjo. With her being the mastermind behind the attempted coup and destruction of Bosse's kingdom, her list of offenses is easily the longest from this cast, and she's also the only one to bring about the death of a named character, that being Bojji's mother, Shiina, who dies horrifically in front of Bojji as Miranjo is laying siege to the kingdom while Bosse is away.    Despite this connection, Bojji is not the one who gets tied to Miranjo in this series. It's Daida who is positioned as the one to play off of Miranjo during the present-day section of this plot, with Miranjo acting as his advisor through the magic mirror and her past self interacting with him inside his mind while Bosse is in control of his body. It's through Miranjo that Daida is led towards purging his advisors of dissent and even attempting to have his own brother killed, ultimately leading to him being trapped in his own mind after Miranjo used his body to resurrect Bosse. In theory, this should have led to a similar forgiveness arc in which Daida comes to terms with how Miranjo has wronged him, sorted through his feelings, and then eventually came around to forgiving her. Not exactly the same, but similar in that an arc should exist.    But, that's not what we got. Instead, Daida just skips straight to step three and not only forgives Miranjo immediately after learning that she had been deceiving him this whole time, but also declares that he will marry her in an attempt to lead her down the right path in the future. No intense thought given to how this situation has complicated his feelings for Miranjo. He just gets over it immediately and decides to reform her, glossing over what could have been a very interesting character dynamic.    Also, what about Bojji? Like I know that we'd kinda be repeating his forgiveness arc again, but he still had to watch his mother die in front of him because of Miranjo. That trauma is still very much baked into Bojji's character, and yet the only thing we get from Bojji on the matter is him telling Hiling that's Miranjo's cool now. It's uh…a bit hollow in my opinion, and that's to say nothing of all the other people Miranjo has wronged throughout the series on various levels. Yes Daida basically orders them to forgive her, but they certainly don't seem to be holding in any conflicting emotions. With the very brief exception of Hiling, everyone's totally on the same page about forgiving Miranjo, and it feels kind of insincere.    The story tries to dance around this by not having Miranjo, or really any character for that matter, actually get anyone killed during the present-day of this story, but this also ends up coming back to bite it as massive tonal dissonance with its own set of issues. Despite the dismemberments and desanguinations and all other methods of inflicting pain in battle, the fact that pretty much no one is killed by another person, with the exception of Bojji's mother and one other example we'll discuss in just a moment, relieves the story of having to answer that final question. Could these characters forgive each other if they actually did kill their friend or apprentice or any kind of close relation? We know Bojji can because his life has naturally sculpted him into being the most altruistic and kind-hearted person in the show, but it never forces the other characters to follow suit. Everyone makes it out of this coup alive, and even those with severe injuries like dismemberment get prosthetics attachments out of nowhere, so it never has to test the resolve of these other characters and see whether they could follow Bojji's lead in the face of something that really can't be taken back.    This does, however, bring us to the incredibly unpleasant elephant in the room: episode 18, in which we are shown Miranjo's back story and how she came to suffer the trauma conveyed to us through her talks with Daida. Now, before we dive into this, I do want to at least present the notion that most of this information is conveyed through Bosse, who, due to the circumstances we're about to discuss, could be considered an unreliable narrator. However, the story still has yet to present anything that even remotely disputes what Bosse says, and we even see the perspective of other characters that line up with this story, so to me, the validity of this interpretation leans more towards truth than fiction. Perhaps a somewhat exaggerated truth, but a truth nonetheless. In any case, Miranjo and her mother were residents of Houma, a kingdom that sought to “modernize” the kingdom of Gyakuza so as to borrow their aid in the fight against the gods. Despite the goodwill of Houma, the people of Gyakuza remained ever-skeptical and deceitful, which the show directly states is a fundamental trait of all of Gyakuza's citizens as a result of their geopolitical history, a shockingly black-and-white statement considering how nuanced the story has been previously.    Because of this, Miranjo's mother is killed in cold blood by the people of Gyakuza and Miranjo herself is horrifically maimed, with her hands cut off and the skin on her face peeled away. This heinous treatment sends Bosse into a blind rage in which he kills seemingly every resident of the town, even young children. In a more nuanced circumstance, this moment would actually play into the theme of forgiveness and show that Bosse and Miranjo were lacking in the same willpower that Bojji possesses. However, because the people of Gyakuza are presented as unambiguously and unilaterally evil and cruel, there is no reason to forgive them because there is no suggestion that they are deserving of forgiveness. The story has completely dehumanized these people to the point of them barely being human anymore.    Again, this could very well be the result of Bosse being an unreliable narrator regarding his interaction with Gyakuza, but because we are never shown evidence to the contrary and we see the perspective of a third party, we kinda have to assume that this is the truth until proven otherwise, and that's extremely troubling. This incredibly yikes portrayal of an entire civilian population gets upgraded to YIKES when you see the immensely uncomfortable parallels to the real life history of Japan's colonization of Korea, complete with visual similarities. This is a very deep and troubling nationalistic hole to go down, but even without the historical parallels, these events feel obscenely out of character for this series, as though it didn't know how to justify Miranjo's tragic back story, and it ends up making said back story weaker as a result because of how comically evil it is.    This effect can also be seen to a lesser degree with Ouken, an immortal with a thirst for blood and violence. What irks me about this character is that his plight is only conveyed in words spoken by other characters, not through his own actions. We see what he's like after immortality has driven him mad, and we see what he was like before his immortality, but the steps in-between have been cut entirely, steps that are arguably the most important part of a character whose defining personality trait is being driven to insanity. There's nothing to empathize with in Ouken because his entire descent into madness was not elaborated on, and his character wasn't exactly really fleshed-out beforehand, making him nothing more than a rampaging monster who enjoys slitting wrists and torturing his opponents. Much like the people of Gyakuza, Ouken has been completely dehumanized, thus removing him entirely from the forgiveness equation even though he easily gives Miranjo a run for her money in terms of the most harm done to other characters. I do hope that this will eventually be resolved since Ouken still remains part of the story at the end, but for now he just feels hollow and disappointing.    And so, in the end, I'm left with half a story I really love and another half I just don't feel invested in at all. The dynamic between physical appearance and actual ability was immensely interesting and truly endeared me to characters like Bojji and Kage who were desperately trying to live as equals to everyone else in the world they inhabit, and I'm very curious as to what direction the manga takes these characters after the events we've seen thus far. On the other hand, the severe lack of true consequences for a large bulk of this plot makes the theme of forgiveness feel rather infantile, almost contrived at times. The idea that everyone's getting along just fine after this cheapens the depth of this message. It's easy to forgive someone when everything's completely healed up at the end, but it's quite another when there's actual fallout to deal with, and Ranking of Kings clumsily sidesteps said fallout and comes out weaker for it. I still enjoyed my experience on the whole, especially considering the insanely strong animation and artwork provided by Wit Studio, but it's still a much shallower enjoyment than what could have been.

Not exactly the same, but similar in that an arc should exist.    But, that's not what we got. Instead, Daida just skips straight to step three and not only forgives Miranjo immediately after learning that she had been deceiving him this whole time, but also declares that he will marry her in an attempt to lead her down the right path in the future. No intense thought given to how this situation has complicated his feelings for Miranjo. He just gets over it immediately and decides to reform her, glossing over what could have been a very interesting character dynamic.    Also, what about Bojji? Like I know that we'd kinda be repeating his forgiveness arc again, but he still had to watch his mother die in front of him because of Miranjo. That trauma is still very much baked into Bojji's character, and yet the only thing we get from Bojji on the matter is him telling Hiling that's Miranjo's cool now. It's uh…a bit hollow in my opinion, and that's to say nothing of all the other people Miranjo has wronged throughout the series on various levels. Yes Daida basically orders them to forgive her, but they certainly don't seem to be holding in any conflicting emotions. With the very brief exception of Hiling, everyone's totally on the same page about forgiving Miranjo, and it feels kind of insincere.    The story tries to dance around this by not having Miranjo, or really any character for that matter, actually get anyone killed during the present-day of this story, but this also ends up coming back to bite it as massive tonal dissonance with its own set of issues. Despite the dismemberments and desanguinations and all other methods of inflicting pain in battle, the fact that pretty much no one is killed by another person, with the exception of Bojji's mother and one other example we'll discuss in just a moment, relieves the story of having to answer that final question. Could these characters forgive each other if they actually did kill their friend or apprentice or any kind of close relation? We know Bojji can because his life has naturally sculpted him into being the most altruistic and kind-hearted person in the show, but it never forces the other characters to follow suit. Everyone makes it out of this coup alive, and even those with severe injuries like dismemberment get prosthetics attachments out of nowhere, so it never has to test the resolve of these other characters and see whether they could follow Bojji's lead in the face of something that really can't be taken back.    This does, however, bring us to the incredibly unpleasant elephant in the room: episode 18, in which we are shown Miranjo's back story and how she came to suffer the trauma conveyed to us through her talks with Daida. Now, before we dive into this, I do want to at least present the notion that most of this information is conveyed through Bosse, who, due to the circumstances we're about to discuss, could be considered an unreliable narrator. However, the story still has yet to present anything that even remotely disputes what Bosse says, and we even see the perspective of other characters that line up with this story, so to me, the validity of this interpretation leans more towards truth than fiction. Perhaps a somewhat exaggerated truth, but a truth nonetheless. In any case, Miranjo and her mother were residents of Houma, a kingdom that sought to “modernize” the kingdom of Gyakuza so as to borrow their aid in the fight against the gods. Despite the goodwill of Houma, the people of Gyakuza remained ever-skeptical and deceitful, which the show directly states is a fundamental trait of all of Gyakuza's citizens as a result of their geopolitical history, a shockingly black-and-white statement considering how nuanced the story has been previously.    Because of this, Miranjo's mother is killed in cold blood by the people of Gyakuza and Miranjo herself is horrifically maimed, with her hands cut off and the skin on her face peeled away. This heinous treatment sends Bosse into a blind rage in which he kills seemingly every resident of the town, even young children. In a more nuanced circumstance, this moment would actually play into the theme of forgiveness and show that Bosse and Miranjo were lacking in the same willpower that Bojji possesses. However, because the people of Gyakuza are presented as unambiguously and unilaterally evil and cruel, there is no reason to forgive them because there is no suggestion that they are deserving of forgiveness. The story has completely dehumanized these people to the point of them barely being human anymore.    Again, this could very well be the result of Bosse being an unreliable narrator regarding his interaction with Gyakuza, but because we are never shown evidence to the contrary and we see the perspective of a third party, we kinda have to assume that this is the truth until proven otherwise, and that's extremely troubling. This incredibly yikes portrayal of an entire civilian population gets upgraded to YIKES when you see the immensely uncomfortable parallels to the real life history of Japan's colonization of Korea, complete with visual similarities. This is a very deep and troubling nationalistic hole to go down, but even without the historical parallels, these events feel obscenely out of character for this series, as though it didn't know how to justify Miranjo's tragic back story, and it ends up making said back story weaker as a result because of how comically evil it is.    This effect can also be seen to a lesser degree with Ouken, an immortal with a thirst for blood and violence. What irks me about this character is that his plight is only conveyed in words spoken by other characters, not through his own actions. We see what he's like after immortality has driven him mad, and we see what he was like before his immortality, but the steps in-between have been cut entirely, steps that are arguably the most important part of a character whose defining personality trait is being driven to insanity. There's nothing to empathize with in Ouken because his entire descent into madness was not elaborated on, and his character wasn't exactly really fleshed-out beforehand, making him nothing more than a rampaging monster who enjoys slitting wrists and torturing his opponents. Much like the people of Gyakuza, Ouken has been completely dehumanized, thus removing him entirely from the forgiveness equation even though he easily gives Miranjo a run for her money in terms of the most harm done to other characters. I do hope that this will eventually be resolved since Ouken still remains part of the story at the end, but for now he just feels hollow and disappointing.    And so, in the end, I'm left with half a story I really love and another half I just don't feel invested in at all. The dynamic between physical appearance and actual ability was immensely interesting and truly endeared me to characters like Bojji and Kage who were desperately trying to live as equals to everyone else in the world they inhabit, and I'm very curious as to what direction the manga takes these characters after the events we've seen thus far. On the other hand, the severe lack of true consequences for a large bulk of this plot makes the theme of forgiveness feel rather infantile, almost contrived at times. The idea that everyone's getting along just fine after this cheapens the depth of this message. It's easy to forgive someone when everything's completely healed up at the end, but it's quite another when there's actual fallout to deal with, and Ranking of Kings clumsily sidesteps said fallout and comes out weaker for it. I still enjoyed my experience on the whole, especially considering the insanely strong animation and artwork provided by Wit Studio, but it's still a much shallower enjoyment than what could have been.

Ranking of Kings Ending Explained - Anime News Network:SEA,"          Across two anime seasons packed with heavy-hitting sequels and long-awaited adaptations, the fact that Ranking of Kings has managed to stay near the top of seasonal discussions for almost half a year is a testament to how engaging this series is and how many ideas it has within it to talk about. That said, for as solid as the project is on the whole, not all ideas are created equal, so join me on a dive into some of this show's disparate themes as we try to see what final conclusion this show arrived at.    Before we jump in I wanna do a brief recap of where this story ended up at the end just to keep it in mind as we discuss what led up to it, and I want to focus primarily on two of the major end results. Firstly, we have Bojji's final battle with Bosse. Whereas Bosse continues to fight Bojji with the same brute force he always has, though this time with Daida's body, Bojji's training under Despa has allowed him to become skilled in his own right through his superior agility and his talent for discovering an opponent's weak point, thus allowing him to triumph over his father. Secondly, we have the resolution to Miranjo's plot against the kingdom. After Bojji destroys the mirror, Miranjo's soul is collected by the same demon that granted Bosse his immense strength, but through Daida's empathy and compassion, her soul is rescued and returned to a living body. Daida announces that he forgives Miranjo for her misdeeds, with Bojji following suit, and that he plans to marry her in order to share the burden of her sins moving forward.    We'll start with that first climax, as it ties into what is easily this anime's strongest idea, that being the conflict between appearance and ability. With our main character, Bojji, being deaf and unable to verbally communicate with those around him, the topic of disability is centered at the forefront of Bojji's characterization and makes his life inordinately difficult. Other children laugh at him for his disability, while many of the adults find him frustrating to deal with, leaving Bojji with few people he can connect to. What's more, his disability often leads others to assume that he is of lesser skill or intelligence than those who are more able-bodied. One the one hand, this is true in terms of pure brute force, as it's revealed that his father, Bosse, made a deal with a demon that sapped Bojji of all his potential strength. As such, Bojji is looked down on by those who expect him to become a great king like his father despite his obvious physical disadvantage, asking something of him that he simply cannot give.    On the other hand, this disability also causes those around Bojji to perceive him as less intelligent, though this aspect of Bojji is an entirely false assumption. Because he often can't communicate what he wants in order to get his point across or just goes about life in ways that seem entirely foreign or nonsensical, those who observe Bojji simply attribute this to him being dumb, as it's easier to just write off his eccentricities as a part of his disability rather than try to understand him, thus adding to the issues that Bojji faces in both his social life and in his perception as a potential leader. Bojji is not mentally inept in any way. In fact, he often exhibits a keen sense of perception and intuition that vastly outpaces those around him, but because he has difficulties communicating these ideas to others, or more often so is unable to find people who will even try to understand to him, his reputation as a dunce becomes more pervasive despite his skills.    That said, even Bojji himself doesn't fully understand this concept until later on in the series. For at least the first couple episodes, Bojji and Kage are dead set on finding someone or some way to make Bojji physically stronger, as they too see Bosse as the ideal to be strived towards. This is readily apparent in how Bojji's more agile swordsmanship is bluntly rejected by the entire castle staff in favor of Daida's more straightforward and supposedly “honorable” style of fighting, and so Bojji and Kage seek out someone who can make him more adept with brute force. It isn't until both Desha and Despa lay it out plain as day that Bojji has zero potential for physical growth that they even attempt to find an alternative, and even that takes some persuasion on Despa's part. In this instance, even Bojji has gotten too wrapped up in his perception of himself and how he believes he should be viewed by others, rather than taking himself as he is and shaping his kingly identity around that.    Then we have Kage, our thief with a heart of gold. Kage is a descendant of the infamous shadow clan, a legendary group of assassins that had been purged some time before he appears on-screen. After losing his mother, Kage is treated with disdain by everyone around him, often as the result of his appearance, and ends up starving on the streets. Even after he finds somewhere to live, the person he lives with seems to hone in on Kage's heritage and starts using him to rob homes and other locations. Here, we have an instance that less appearance vs ability, but rather appearance vs personality. Kage doesn't want to be the bad guy, and we even see in a flashback that he saw his clan as good guys who loyally served their king, but the shady nature of their line of work causes people to constantly misread Kage's intentions, which we see with Bebin during the first few episodes. As such, Kage's experiences put him in the perfect position to understand Bojji. Though he too misinterprets Bojji's talents at first, he quickly comes around and is able to see all the good in him, and so makes it his goal to support Bojji in any way he can.    Finally, one of the more fascinating, yet somewhat understated examples of this contrasting of appearance against ability is presented through the brotherly relationship between Desha and Despa,  albeit in a much less clear-cut manner. Desha, the king of the Underworld, is portrayed to be much less attractive and amiable than his brother, and, according to Despa, he would occasionally get hung up on his own appearance, as displayed by him defacing his own monument. Despite this, Desha's supreme power and charisma allowed him to gain popularity and become a great king for his nation, freeing his people from the tyrannical rule of his father.    On the flip side of that, we have Despa, highly intelligent and incredibly handsome, yet lacking in the physical strength and extraordinary powers that his brother possesses, and much like Desha, he too envies that which his brother has that he does not, as shown in a flashback where Despa mourns his lack of physical prowess in comparison to his kin. Despite this, much like Desha, Despa eventually grows wise enough to recognize the usefulness of his own talents, shaping his persona and combat tendencies in ways that only he can and not simply trying to mimic his brother, a trait that he has endeavored to pass on to Bojji so that he too can carve out his own path without trying to follow in his father's footsteps or compete with Daida solely through strength. Bojji's incredible agility and insight into discovering an opponent's weakness is his greatest asset in combat and something he achieved precisely because of his disability, and Despa recognizes how wasteful it would be to squander that talent, thus allowing Bojji to overcome his lack of strength and stand on equal footing with Daida and Bosse.    This aspect of Bojji is symbolized perfectly by his choice of weapon, a small rapier given to him by Despa. While deciding on what weapon to train with, Bojji initially tries to use an axe, as it's the same weapon his father, who is portrayed as the ideal powerful king, uses on the battlefield, but even the smallest of axes proves too unwieldy. Thus, Bojji ultimately chooses the rapier, one that seems to have very little offensive power at all and tricks even Kage into thinking that it's worthless. Yet, Bojji is able to draw out the full potential of this weapon by using a fighting style best suited for him, one that emphasizes agility and small strikes over heavy hitting attacks. This allows Bojji to completely incapacite his opponents with no bloodshed, a perfect representation of Bojji's endless altruism towards even those who seek to harm him.    In a sense, Bojji's arc is not so much about gaining the physical strength to become a better leader, but more so about coming to understand himself so as to highlight the talents he already has. Bojji being deaf does not automatically make him lesser, but it does change the set of talents and ability preferences that he is endowed with, and so Bojji's arc is almost entirely one of internal growth and learning to see past the expectations of others in order to discover what will actually help him succeed, and this internal growth is also loosely tied to this anime's second major theme that becomes much more readily apparent in its second half: forgiveness.    With this being a fantasy series centered around a monarchical power struggle, betrayal and backstabbing are very much the order of the day for a large chunk of the plot, especially with Bojji being a potential rival for the throne. Even after the high ranking officials of the kingdom supplant Bojji's claim and choose Daida as the new king, Miranjo still convinces Daida that Bojji must be disposed of, and so Domas, Bojji's sword instructor, is tasked with his assassination and would have succeeded if Kage had not been there to save Bojji from his fate.    When Bojji and Domas meet again after this incident, Bojji is nearly paralyzed by fear, still believing Domas to be someone who will bring him harm. Even after Domas apologizes profusely and begs for forgiveness, Bojji runs away, unable to fully process the conflicting emotions swirling around in his head. He wants to forgive Domas, the person who's been by his side so often and tried his best to help Bojji improve his swordsmanship, even going so far as to learn sign language in order to better communicate with him, but Domas's betrayal still hangs heavy in his mind, and so he's simply not ready to forgive him yet. Kage seems to recognize this and, rather than keep trying to convince Bojji to forgive him, he runs off with Bojji to support him, knowing that this issue will take some time. It's a complicated and interesting topic to tackle, recognizing that forgiveness should occur, but simply not being ready to fully resolve those emotions, making Bojji's emotional arc regarding this issue quite compelling.    That said, as strong as that specific plotline is, not everyone seems to be given the same level of care and depth when it comes to the idea of forgiveness. Quite frankly, most of the characters are unusually quick to forgive their enemies and welcome them back into the fold despite the transgressions they've committed, and it begins to strain credibility on all parties involved. With Bojji, a quick forgiveness would make sense since he's just a wholesome little ball of wonder, but even he had to pump the brakes a bit before forgiving Domas.    It feels as though the story is trying to transfer the emotional arc Bojji experienced onto every other character in the show and it's just not landing for me, especially when it comes to the central antagonist, Miranjo. With her being the mastermind behind the attempted coup and destruction of Bosse's kingdom, her list of offenses is easily the longest from this cast, and she's also the only one to bring about the death of a named character, that being Bojji's mother, Shiina, who dies horrifically in front of Bojji as Miranjo is laying siege to the kingdom while Bosse is away.    Despite this connection, Bojji is not the one who gets tied to Miranjo in this series. It's Daida who is positioned as the one to play off of Miranjo during the present-day section of this plot, with Miranjo acting as his advisor through the magic mirror and her past self interacting with him inside his mind while Bosse is in control of his body. It's through Miranjo that Daida is led towards purging his advisors of dissent and even attempting to have his own brother killed, ultimately leading to him being trapped in his own mind after Miranjo used his body to resurrect Bosse. In theory, this should have led to a similar forgiveness arc in which Daida comes to terms with how Miranjo has wronged him, sorted through his feelings, and then eventually came around to forgiving her. Not exactly the same, but similar in that an arc should exist.    But, that's not what we got. Instead, Daida just skips straight to step three and not only forgives Miranjo immediately after learning that she had been deceiving him this whole time, but also declares that he will marry her in an attempt to lead her down the right path in the future. No intense thought given to how this situation has complicated his feelings for Miranjo. He just gets over it immediately and decides to reform her, glossing over what could have been a very interesting character dynamic.    Also, what about Bojji? Like I know that we'd kinda be repeating his forgiveness arc again, but he still had to watch his mother die in front of him because of Miranjo. That trauma is still very much baked into Bojji's character, and yet the only thing we get from Bojji on the matter is him telling Hiling that's Miranjo's cool now. It's uh…a bit hollow in my opinion, and that's to say nothing of all the other people Miranjo has wronged throughout the series on various levels. Yes Daida basically orders them to forgive her, but they certainly don't seem to be holding in any conflicting emotions. With the very brief exception of Hiling, everyone's totally on the same page about forgiving Miranjo, and it feels kind of insincere.    The story tries to dance around this by not having Miranjo, or really any character for that matter, actually get anyone killed during the present-day of this story, but this also ends up coming back to bite it as massive tonal dissonance with its own set of issues. Despite the dismemberments and desanguinations and all other methods of inflicting pain in battle, the fact that pretty much no one is killed by another person, with the exception of Bojji's mother and one other example we'll discuss in just a moment, relieves the story of having to answer that final question. Could these characters forgive each other if they actually did kill their friend or apprentice or any kind of close relation? We know Bojji can because his life has naturally sculpted him into being the most altruistic and kind-hearted person in the show, but it never forces the other characters to follow suit. Everyone makes it out of this coup alive, and even those with severe injuries like dismemberment get prosthetics attachments out of nowhere, so it never has to test the resolve of these other characters and see whether they could follow Bojji's lead in the face of something that really can't be taken back.    This does, however, bring us to the incredibly unpleasant elephant in the room: episode 18, in which we are shown Miranjo's back story and how she came to suffer the trauma conveyed to us through her talks with Daida. Now, before we dive into this, I do want to at least present the notion that most of this information is conveyed through Bosse, who, due to the circumstances we're about to discuss, could be considered an unreliable narrator. However, the story still has yet to present anything that even remotely disputes what Bosse says, and we even see the perspective of other characters that line up with this story, so to me, the validity of this interpretation leans more towards truth than fiction. Perhaps a somewhat exaggerated truth, but a truth nonetheless. In any case, Miranjo and her mother were residents of Houma, a kingdom that sought to “modernize” the kingdom of Gyakuza so as to borrow their aid in the fight against the gods. Despite the goodwill of Houma, the people of Gyakuza remained ever-skeptical and deceitful, which the show directly states is a fundamental trait of all of Gyakuza's citizens as a result of their geopolitical history, a shockingly black-and-white statement considering how nuanced the story has been previously.    Because of this, Miranjo's mother is killed in cold blood by the people of Gyakuza and Miranjo herself is horrifically maimed, with her hands cut off and the skin on her face peeled away.

Ranking of Kings Ending Explained - Anime News Network:SEA,"         Across two anime seasons packed with heavy-hitting sequels and long-awaited adaptations, the fact that Ranking of Kings has managed to stay near the top of seasonal discussions for almost half a year is a testament to how engaging this series is and how many ideas it has within it to talk about. That said, for as solid as the project is on the whole, not all ideas are created equal, so join me on a dive into some of this show's disparate themes as we try to see what final conclusion this show arrived at.    Before we jump in I wanna do a brief recap of where this story ended up at the end just to keep it in mind as we discuss what led up to it, and I want to focus primarily on two of the major end results. Firstly, we have Bojji's final battle with Bosse. Whereas Bosse continues to fight Bojji with the same brute force he always has, though this time with Daida's body, Bojji's training under Despa has allowed him to become skilled in his own right through his superior agility and his talent for discovering an opponent's weak point, thus allowing him to triumph over his father. Secondly, we have the resolution to Miranjo's plot against the kingdom. After Bojji destroys the mirror, Miranjo's soul is collected by the same demon that granted Bosse his immense strength, but through Daida's empathy and compassion, her soul is rescued and returned to a living body. Daida announces that he forgives Miranjo for her misdeeds, with Bojji following suit, and that he plans to marry her in order to share the burden of her sins moving forward.    We'll start with that first climax, as it ties into what is easily this anime's strongest idea, that being the conflict between appearance and ability. With our main character, Bojji, being deaf and unable to verbally communicate with those around him, the topic of disability is centered at the forefront of Bojji's characterization and makes his life inordinately difficult. Other children laugh at him for his disability, while many of the adults find him frustrating to deal with, leaving Bojji with few people he can connect to. What's more, his disability often leads others to assume that he is of lesser skill or intelligence than those who are more able-bodied. One the one hand, this is true in terms of pure brute force, as it's revealed that his father, Bosse, made a deal with a demon that sapped Bojji of all his potential strength. As such, Bojji is looked down on by those who expect him to become a great king like his father despite his obvious physical disadvantage, asking something of him that he simply cannot give.    On the other hand, this disability also causes those around Bojji to perceive him as less intelligent, though this aspect of Bojji is an entirely false assumption. Because he often can't communicate what he wants in order to get his point across or just goes about life in ways that seem entirely foreign or nonsensical, those who observe Bojji simply attribute this to him being dumb, as it's easier to just write off his eccentricities as a part of his disability rather than try to understand him, thus adding to the issues that Bojji faces in both his social life and in his perception as a potential leader. Bojji is not mentally inept in any way. In fact, he often exhibits a keen sense of perception and intuition that vastly outpaces those around him, but because he has difficulties communicating these ideas to others, or more often so is unable to find people who will even try to understand to him, his reputation as a dunce becomes more pervasive despite his skills.    That said, even Bojji himself doesn't fully understand this concept until later on in the series. For at least the first couple episodes, Bojji and Kage are dead set on finding someone or some way to make Bojji physically stronger, as they too see Bosse as the ideal to be strived towards. This is readily apparent in how Bojji's more agile swordsmanship is bluntly rejected by the entire castle staff in favor of Daida's more straightforward and supposedly “honorable” style of fighting, and so Bojji and Kage seek out someone who can make him more adept with brute force. It isn't until both Desha and Despa lay it out plain as day that Bojji has zero potential for physical growth that they even attempt to find an alternative, and even that takes some persuasion on Despa's part. In this instance, even Bojji has gotten too wrapped up in his perception of himself and how he believes he should be viewed by others, rather than taking himself as he is and shaping his kingly identity around that.    Then we have Kage, our thief with a heart of gold. Kage is a descendant of the infamous shadow clan, a legendary group of assassins that had been purged some time before he appears on-screen. After losing his mother, Kage is treated with disdain by everyone around him, often as the result of his appearance, and ends up starving on the streets. Even after he finds somewhere to live, the person he lives with seems to hone in on Kage's heritage and starts using him to rob homes and other locations. Here, we have an instance that less appearance vs ability, but rather appearance vs personality. Kage doesn't want to be the bad guy, and we even see in a flashback that he saw his clan as good guys who loyally served their king, but the shady nature of their line of work causes people to constantly misread Kage's intentions, which we see with Bebin during the first few episodes. As such, Kage's experiences put him in the perfect position to understand Bojji. Though he too misinterprets Bojji's talents at first, he quickly comes around and is able to see all the good in him, and so makes it his goal to support Bojji in any way he can.    Finally, one of the more fascinating, yet somewhat understated examples of this contrasting of appearance against ability is presented through the brotherly relationship between Desha and Despa,  albeit in a much less clear-cut manner. Desha, the king of the Underworld, is portrayed to be much less attractive and amiable than his brother, and, according to Despa, he would occasionally get hung up on his own appearance, as displayed by him defacing his own monument. Despite this, Desha's supreme power and charisma allowed him to gain popularity and become a great king for his nation, freeing his people from the tyrannical rule of his father.    On the flip side of that, we have Despa, highly intelligent and incredibly handsome, yet lacking in the physical strength and extraordinary powers that his brother possesses, and much like Desha, he too envies that which his brother has that he does not, as shown in a flashback where Despa mourns his lack of physical prowess in comparison to his kin. Despite this, much like Desha, Despa eventually grows wise enough to recognize the usefulness of his own talents, shaping his persona and combat tendencies in ways that only he can and not simply trying to mimic his brother, a trait that he has endeavored to pass on to Bojji so that he too can carve out his own path without trying to follow in his father's footsteps or compete with Daida solely through strength. Bojji's incredible agility and insight into discovering an opponent's weakness is his greatest asset in combat and something he achieved precisely because of his disability, and Despa recognizes how wasteful it would be to squander that talent, thus allowing Bojji to overcome his lack of strength and stand on equal footing with Daida and Bosse.    This aspect of Bojji is symbolized perfectly by his choice of weapon, a small rapier given to him by Despa. While deciding on what weapon to train with, Bojji initially tries to use an axe, as it's the same weapon his father, who is portrayed as the ideal powerful king, uses on the battlefield, but even the smallest of axes proves too unwieldy. Thus, Bojji ultimately chooses the rapier, one that seems to have very little offensive power at all and tricks even Kage into thinking that it's worthless. Yet, Bojji is able to draw out the full potential of this weapon by using a fighting style best suited for him, one that emphasizes agility and small strikes over heavy hitting attacks. This allows Bojji to completely incapacite his opponents with no bloodshed, a perfect representation of Bojji's endless altruism towards even those who seek to harm him.    In a sense, Bojji's arc is not so much about gaining the physical strength to become a better leader, but more so about coming to understand himself so as to highlight the talents he already has. Bojji being deaf does not automatically make him lesser, but it does change the set of talents and ability preferences that he is endowed with, and so Bojji's arc is almost entirely one of internal growth and learning to see past the expectations of others in order to discover what will actually help him succeed, and this internal growth is also loosely tied to this anime's second major theme that becomes much more readily apparent in its second half: forgiveness.    With this being a fantasy series centered around a monarchical power struggle, betrayal and backstabbing are very much the order of the day for a large chunk of the plot, especially with Bojji being a potential rival for the throne. Even after the high ranking officials of the kingdom supplant Bojji's claim and choose Daida as the new king, Miranjo still convinces Daida that Bojji must be disposed of, and so Domas, Bojji's sword instructor, is tasked with his assassination and would have succeeded if Kage had not been there to save Bojji from his fate.    When Bojji and Domas meet again after this incident, Bojji is nearly paralyzed by fear, still believing Domas to be someone who will bring him harm. Even after Domas apologizes profusely and begs for forgiveness, Bojji runs away, unable to fully process the conflicting emotions swirling around in his head. He wants to forgive Domas, the person who's been by his side so often and tried his best to help Bojji improve his swordsmanship, even going so far as to learn sign language in order to better communicate with him, but Domas's betrayal still hangs heavy in his mind, and so he's simply not ready to forgive him yet. Kage seems to recognize this and, rather than keep trying to convince Bojji to forgive him, he runs off with Bojji to support him, knowing that this issue will take some time. It's a complicated and interesting topic to tackle, recognizing that forgiveness should occur, but simply not being ready to fully resolve those emotions, making Bojji's emotional arc regarding this issue quite compelling.    That said, as strong as that specific plotline is, not everyone seems to be given the same level of care and depth when it comes to the idea of forgiveness. Quite frankly, most of the characters are unusually quick to forgive their enemies and welcome them back into the fold despite the transgressions they've committed, and it begins to strain credibility on all parties involved. With Bojji, a quick forgiveness would make sense since he's just a wholesome little ball of wonder, but even he had to pump the brakes a bit before forgiving Domas.    It feels as though the story is trying to transfer the emotional arc Bojji experienced onto every other character in the show and it's just not landing for me, especially when it comes to the central antagonist, Miranjo. With her being the mastermind behind the attempted coup and destruction of Bosse's kingdom, her list of offenses is easily the longest from this cast, and she's also the only one to bring about the death of a named character, that being Bojji's mother, Shiina, who dies horrifically in front of Bojji as Miranjo is laying siege to the kingdom while Bosse is away.    Despite this connection, Bojji is not the one who gets tied to Miranjo in this series. It's Daida who is positioned as the one to play off of Miranjo during the present-day section of this plot, with Miranjo acting as his advisor through the magic mirror and her past self interacting with him inside his mind while Bosse is in control of his body. It's through Miranjo that Daida is led towards purging his advisors of dissent and even attempting to have his own brother killed, ultimately leading to him being trapped in his own mind after Miranjo used his body to resurrect Bosse. In theory, this should have led to a similar forgiveness arc in which Daida comes to terms with how Miranjo has wronged him, sorted through his feelings, and then eventually came around to forgiving her. Not exactly the same, but similar in that an arc should exist.    But, that's not what we got. Instead, Daida just skips straight to step three and not only forgives Miranjo immediately after learning that she had been deceiving him this whole time, but also declares that he will marry her in an attempt to lead her down the right path in the future. No intense thought given to how this situation has complicated his feelings for Miranjo. He just gets over it immediately and decides to reform her, glossing over what could have been a very interesting character dynamic.    Also, what about Bojji? Like I know that we'd kinda be repeating his forgiveness arc again, but he still had to watch his mother die in front of him because of Miranjo. That trauma is still very much baked into Bojji's character, and yet the only thing we get from Bojji on the matter is him telling Hiling that's Miranjo's cool now. It's uh…a bit hollow in my opinion, and that's to say nothing of all the other people Miranjo has wronged throughout the series on various levels. Yes Daida basically orders them to forgive her, but they certainly don't seem to be holding in any conflicting emotions. With the very brief exception of Hiling, everyone's totally on the same page about forgiving Miranjo, and it feels kind of insincere.    The story tries to dance around this by not having Miranjo, or really any character for that matter, actually get anyone killed during the present-day of this story, but this also ends up coming back to bite it as massive tonal dissonance with its own set of issues. Despite the dismemberments and desanguinations and all other methods of inflicting pain in battle, the fact that pretty much no one is killed by another person, with the exception of Bojji's mother and one other example we'll discuss in just a moment, relieves the story of having to answer that final question. Could these characters forgive each other if they actually did kill their friend or apprentice or any kind of close relation? We know Bojji can because his life has naturally sculpted him into being the most altruistic and kind-hearted person in the show, but it never forces the other characters to follow suit. Everyone makes it out of this coup alive, and even those with severe injuries like dismemberment get prosthetics attachments out of nowhere, so it never has to test the resolve of these other characters and see whether they could follow Bojji's lead in the face of something that really can't be taken back.    This does, however, bring us to the incredibly unpleasant elephant in the room: episode 18, in which we are shown Miranjo's back story and how she came to suffer the trauma conveyed to us through her talks with Daida. Now, before we dive into this, I do want to at least present the notion that most of this information is conveyed through Bosse, who, due to the circumstances we're about to discuss, could be considered an unreliable narrator. However, the story still has yet to present anything that even remotely disputes what Bosse says, and we even see the perspective of other characters that line up with this story, so to me, the validity of this interpretation leans more towards truth than fiction. Perhaps a somewhat exaggerated truth, but a truth nonetheless. In any case, Miranjo and her mother were residents of Houma, a kingdom that sought to “modernize” the kingdom of Gyakuza so as to borrow their aid in the fight against the gods. Despite the goodwill of Houma, the people of Gyakuza remained ever-skeptical and deceitful, which the show directly states is a fundamental trait of all of Gyakuza's citizens as a result of their geopolitical history, a shockingly black-and-white statement considering how nuanced the story has been previously.    Because of this, Miranjo's mother is killed in cold blood by the people of Gyakuza and Miranjo herself is horrifically maimed, with her hands cut off and the skin on her face peeled away. This heinous treatment sends Bosse into a blind rage in which he kills seemingly every resident of the town, even young children. In a more nuanced circumstance, this moment would actually play into the theme of forgiveness and show that Bosse and Miranjo were lacking in the same willpower that Bojji possesses. However, because the people of Gyakuza are presented as unambiguously and unilaterally evil and cruel, there is no reason to forgive them because there is no suggestion that they are deserving of forgiveness. The story has completely dehumanized these people to the point of them barely being human anymore.    Again, this could very well be the result of Bosse being an unreliable narrator regarding his interaction with Gyakuza, but because we are never shown evidence to the contrary and we see the perspective of a third party, we kinda have to assume that this is the truth until proven otherwise, and that's extremely troubling. This incredibly yikes portrayal of an entire civilian population gets upgraded to YIKES when you see the immensely uncomfortable parallels to the real life history of Japan's colonization of Korea, complete with visual similarities. This is a very deep and troubling nationalistic hole to go down, but even without the historical parallels, these events feel obscenely out of character for this series, as though it didn't know how to justify Miranjo's tragic back story, and it ends up making said back story weaker as a result because of how comically evil it is.    This effect can also be seen to a lesser degree with Ouken, an immortal with a thirst for blood and violence. What irks me about this character is that his plight is only conveyed in words spoken by other characters, not through his own actions. We see what he's like after immortality has driven him mad, and we see what he was like before his immortality, but the steps in-between have been cut entirely, steps that are arguably the most important part of a character whose defining personality trait is being driven to insanity. There's nothing to empathize with in Ouken because his entire descent into madness was not elaborated on, and his character wasn't exactly really fleshed-out beforehand, making him nothing more than a rampaging monster who enjoys slitting wrists and torturing his opponents. Much like the people of Gyakuza, Ouken has been completely dehumanized, thus removing him entirely from the forgiveness equation even though he easily gives Miranjo a run for her money in terms of the most harm done to other characters. I do hope that this will eventually be resolved since Ouken still remains part of the story at the end, but for now he just feels hollow and disappointing.    And so, in the end, I'm left with half a story I really love and another half I just don't feel invested in at all. The dynamic between physical appearance and actual ability was immensely interesting and truly endeared me to characters like Bojji and Kage who were desperately trying to live as equals to everyone else in the world they inhabit, and I'm very curious as to what direction the manga takes these characters after the events we've seen thus far. On the other hand, the severe lack of true consequences for a large bulk of this plot makes the theme of forgiveness feel rather infantile, almost contrived at times. The idea that everyone's getting along just fine after this cheapens the depth of this message. It's easy to forgive someone when everything's completely healed up at the end, but it's quite another when there's actual fallout to deal with, and Ranking of Kings clumsily sidesteps said fallout and comes out weaker for it. I still enjoyed my experience on the whole, especially considering the insanely strong animation and artwork provided by Wit Studio, but it's still a much shallower enjoyment than what could have been.

Ranking of Kings Ending Explained - Anime News Network:SEA,"      Across two anime seasons packed with heavy-hitting sequels and long-awaited adaptations, the fact that Ranking of Kings has managed to stay near the top of seasonal discussions for almost half a year is a testament to how engaging this series is and how many ideas it has within it to talk about. That said, for as solid as the project is on the whole, not all ideas are created equal, so join me on a dive into some of this show's disparate themes as we try to see what final conclusion this show arrived at.    Before we jump in I wanna do a brief recap of where this story ended up at the end just to keep it in mind as we discuss what led up to it, and I want to focus primarily on two of the major end results. Firstly, we have Bojji's final battle with Bosse. Whereas Bosse continues to fight Bojji with the same brute force he always has, though this time with Daida's body, Bojji's training under Despa has allowed him to become skilled in his own right through his superior agility and his talent for discovering an opponent's weak point, thus allowing him to triumph over his father. Secondly, we have the resolution to Miranjo's plot against the kingdom. After Bojji destroys the mirror, Miranjo's soul is collected by the same demon that granted Bosse his immense strength, but through Daida's empathy and compassion, her soul is rescued and returned to a living body. Daida announces that he forgives Miranjo for her misdeeds, with Bojji following suit, and that he plans to marry her in order to share the burden of her sins moving forward.    We'll start with that first climax, as it ties into what is easily this anime's strongest idea, that being the conflict between appearance and ability. With our main character, Bojji, being deaf and unable to verbally communicate with those around him, the topic of disability is centered at the forefront of Bojji's characterization and makes his life inordinately difficult. Other children laugh at him for his disability, while many of the adults find him frustrating to deal with, leaving Bojji with few people he can connect to. What's more, his disability often leads others to assume that he is of lesser skill or intelligence than those who are more able-bodied. One the one hand, this is true in terms of pure brute force, as it's revealed that his father, Bosse, made a deal with a demon that sapped Bojji of all his potential strength. As such, Bojji is looked down on by those who expect him to become a great king like his father despite his obvious physical disadvantage, asking something of him that he simply cannot give.    On the other hand, this disability also causes those around Bojji to perceive him as less intelligent, though this aspect of Bojji is an entirely false assumption. Because he often can't communicate what he wants in order to get his point across or just goes about life in ways that seem entirely foreign or nonsensical, those who observe Bojji simply attribute this to him being dumb, as it's easier to just write off his eccentricities as a part of his disability rather than try to understand him, thus adding to the issues that Bojji faces in both his social life and in his perception as a potential leader. Bojji is not mentally inept in any way. In fact, he often exhibits a keen sense of perception and intuition that vastly outpaces those around him, but because he has difficulties communicating these ideas to others, or more often so is unable to find people who will even try to understand to him, his reputation as a dunce becomes more pervasive despite his skills.    That said, even Bojji himself doesn't fully understand this concept until later on in the series. For at least the first couple episodes, Bojji and Kage are dead set on finding someone or some way to make Bojji physically stronger, as they too see Bosse as the ideal to be strived towards. This is readily apparent in how Bojji's more agile swordsmanship is bluntly rejected by the entire castle staff in favor of Daida's more straightforward and supposedly “honorable” style of fighting, and so Bojji and Kage seek out someone who can make him more adept with brute force. It isn't until both Desha and Despa lay it out plain as day that Bojji has zero potential for physical growth that they even attempt to find an alternative, and even that takes some persuasion on Despa's part. In this instance, even Bojji has gotten too wrapped up in his perception of himself and how he believes he should be viewed by others, rather than taking himself as he is and shaping his kingly identity around that.    Then we have Kage, our thief with a heart of gold. Kage is a descendant of the infamous shadow clan, a legendary group of assassins that had been purged some time before he appears on-screen. After losing his mother, Kage is treated with disdain by everyone around him, often as the result of his appearance, and ends up starving on the streets. Even after he finds somewhere to live, the person he lives with seems to hone in on Kage's heritage and starts using him to rob homes and other locations. Here, we have an instance that less appearance vs ability, but rather appearance vs personality. Kage doesn't want to be the bad guy, and we even see in a flashback that he saw his clan as good guys who loyally served their king, but the shady nature of their line of work causes people to constantly misread Kage's intentions, which we see with Bebin during the first few episodes. As such, Kage's experiences put him in the perfect position to understand Bojji. Though he too misinterprets Bojji's talents at first, he quickly comes around and is able to see all the good in him, and so makes it his goal to support Bojji in any way he can.    Finally, one of the more fascinating, yet somewhat understated examples of this contrasting of appearance against ability is presented through the brotherly relationship between Desha and Despa,  albeit in a much less clear-cut manner. Desha, the king of the Underworld, is portrayed to be much less attractive and amiable than his brother, and, according to Despa, he would occasionally get hung up on his own appearance, as displayed by him defacing his own monument. Despite this, Desha's supreme power and charisma allowed him to gain popularity and become a great king for his nation, freeing his people from the tyrannical rule of his father.    On the flip side of that, we have Despa, highly intelligent and incredibly handsome, yet lacking in the physical strength and extraordinary powers that his brother possesses, and much like Desha, he too envies that which his brother has that he does not, as shown in a flashback where Despa mourns his lack of physical prowess in comparison to his kin. Despite this, much like Desha, Despa eventually grows wise enough to recognize the usefulness of his own talents, shaping his persona and combat tendencies in ways that only he can and not simply trying to mimic his brother, a trait that he has endeavored to pass on to Bojji so that he too can carve out his own path without trying to follow in his father's footsteps or compete with Daida solely through strength. Bojji's incredible agility and insight into discovering an opponent's weakness is his greatest asset in combat and something he achieved precisely because of his disability, and Despa recognizes how wasteful it would be to squander that talent, thus allowing Bojji to overcome his lack of strength and stand on equal footing with Daida and Bosse.    This aspect of Bojji is symbolized perfectly by his choice of weapon, a small rapier given to him by Despa. While deciding on what weapon to train with, Bojji initially tries to use an axe, as it's the same weapon his father, who is portrayed as the ideal powerful king, uses on the battlefield, but even the smallest of axes proves too unwieldy. Thus, Bojji ultimately chooses the rapier, one that seems to have very little offensive power at all and tricks even Kage into thinking that it's worthless. Yet, Bojji is able to draw out the full potential of this weapon by using a fighting style best suited for him, one that emphasizes agility and small strikes over heavy hitting attacks. This allows Bojji to completely incapacite his opponents with no bloodshed, a perfect representation of Bojji's endless altruism towards even those who seek to harm him.    In a sense, Bojji's arc is not so much about gaining the physical strength to become a better leader, but more so about coming to understand himself so as to highlight the talents he already has. Bojji being deaf does not automatically make him lesser, but it does change the set of talents and ability preferences that he is endowed with, and so Bojji's arc is almost entirely one of internal growth and learning to see past the expectations of others in order to discover what will actually help him succeed, and this internal growth is also loosely tied to this anime's second major theme that becomes much more readily apparent in its second half: forgiveness.    With this being a fantasy series centered around a monarchical power struggle, betrayal and backstabbing are very much the order of the day for a large chunk of the plot, especially with Bojji being a potential rival for the throne. Even after the high ranking officials of the kingdom supplant Bojji's claim and choose Daida as the new king, Miranjo still convinces Daida that Bojji must be disposed of, and so Domas, Bojji's sword instructor, is tasked with his assassination and would have succeeded if Kage had not been there to save Bojji from his fate.    When Bojji and Domas meet again after this incident, Bojji is nearly paralyzed by fear, still believing Domas to be someone who will bring him harm. Even after Domas apologizes profusely and begs for forgiveness, Bojji runs away, unable to fully process the conflicting emotions swirling around in his head. He wants to forgive Domas, the person who's been by his side so often and tried his best to help Bojji improve his swordsmanship, even going so far as to learn sign language in order to better communicate with him, but Domas's betrayal still hangs heavy in his mind, and so he's simply not ready to forgive him yet. Kage seems to recognize this and, rather than keep trying to convince Bojji to forgive him, he runs off with Bojji to support him, knowing that this issue will take some time. It's a complicated and interesting topic to tackle, recognizing that forgiveness should occur, but simply not being ready to fully resolve those emotions, making Bojji's emotional arc regarding this issue quite compelling.    That said, as strong as that specific plotline is, not everyone seems to be given the same level of care and depth when it comes to the idea of forgiveness. Quite frankly, most of the characters are unusually quick to forgive their enemies and welcome them back into the fold despite the transgressions they've committed, and it begins to strain credibility on all parties involved. With Bojji, a quick forgiveness would make sense since he's just a wholesome little ball of wonder, but even he had to pump the brakes a bit before forgiving Domas.    It feels as though the story is trying to transfer the emotional arc Bojji experienced onto every other character in the show and it's just not landing for me, especially when it comes to the central antagonist, Miranjo. With her being the mastermind behind the attempted coup and destruction of Bosse's kingdom, her list of offenses is easily the longest from this cast, and she's also the only one to bring about the death of a named character, that being Bojji's mother, Shiina, who dies horrifically in front of Bojji as Miranjo is laying siege to the kingdom while Bosse is away.

It's Daida who is positioned as the one to play off of Miranjo during the present-day section of this plot, with Miranjo acting as his advisor through the magic mirror and her past self interacting with him inside his mind while Bosse is in control of his body. It's through Miranjo that Daida is led towards purging his advisors of dissent and even attempting to have his own brother killed, ultimately leading to him being trapped in his own mind after Miranjo used his body to resurrect Bosse. In theory, this should have led to a similar forgiveness arc in which Daida comes to terms with how Miranjo has wronged him, sorted through his feelings, and then eventually came around to forgiving her.

No intense thought given to how this situation has complicated his feelings for Miranjo. He just gets over it immediately and decides to reform her, glossing over what could have been a very interesting character dynamic.    Also, what about Bojji? Like I know that we'd kinda be repeating his forgiveness arc again, but he still had to watch his mother die in front of him because of Miranjo. That trauma is still very much baked into Bojji's character, and yet the only thing we get from Bojji on the matter is him telling Hiling that's Miranjo's cool now. It's uh…a bit hollow in my opinion, and that's to say nothing of all the other people Miranjo has wronged throughout the series on various levels. Yes Daida basically orders them to forgive her, but they certainly don't seem to be holding in any conflicting emotions. With the very brief exception of Hiling, everyone's totally on the same page about forgiving Miranjo, and it feels kind of insincere.    The story tries to dance around this by not having Miranjo, or really any character for that matter, actually get anyone killed during the present-day of this story, but this also ends up coming back to bite it as massive tonal dissonance with its own set of issues. Despite the dismemberments and desanguinations and all other methods of inflicting pain in battle, the fact that pretty much no one is killed by another person, with the exception of Bojji's mother and one other example we'll discuss in just a moment, relieves the story of having to answer that final question. Could these characters forgive each other if they actually did kill their friend or apprentice or any kind of close relation? We know Bojji can because his life has naturally sculpted him into being the most altruistic and kind-hearted person in the show, but it never forces the other characters to follow suit. Everyone makes it out of this coup alive, and even those with severe injuries like dismemberment get prosthetics attachments out of nowhere, so it never has to test the resolve of these other characters and see whether they could follow Bojji's lead in the face of something that really can't be taken back.    This does, however, bring us to the incredibly unpleasant elephant in the room: episode 18, in which we are shown Miranjo's back story and how she came to suffer the trauma conveyed to us through her talks with Daida. Now, before we dive into this, I do want to at least present the notion that most of this information is conveyed through Bosse, who, due to the circumstances we're about to discuss, could be considered an unreliable narrator. However, the story still has yet to present anything that even remotely disputes what Bosse says, and we even see the perspective of other characters that line up with this story, so to me, the validity of this interpretation leans more towards truth than fiction. Perhaps a somewhat exaggerated truth, but a truth nonetheless. In any case, Miranjo and her mother were residents of Houma, a kingdom that sought to “modernize” the kingdom of Gyakuza so as to borrow their aid in the fight against the gods. Despite the goodwill of Houma, the people of Gyakuza remained ever-skeptical and deceitful, which the show directly states is a fundamental trait of all of Gyakuza's citizens as a result of their geopolitical history, a shockingly black-and-white statement considering how nuanced the story has been previously.    Because of this, Miranjo's mother is killed in cold blood by the people of Gyakuza and Miranjo herself is horrifically maimed, with her hands cut off and the skin on her face peeled away. This heinous treatment sends Bosse into a blind rage in which he kills seemingly every resident of the town, even young children. In a more nuanced circumstance, this moment would actually play into the theme of forgiveness and show that Bosse and Miranjo were lacking in the same willpower that Bojji possesses. However, because the people of Gyakuza are presented as unambiguously and unilaterally evil and cruel, there is no reason to forgive them because there is no suggestion that they are deserving of forgiveness. The story has completely dehumanized these people to the point of them barely being human anymore.    Again, this could very well be the result of Bosse being an unreliable narrator regarding his interaction with Gyakuza, but because we are never shown evidence to the contrary and we see the perspective of a third party, we kinda have to assume that this is the truth until proven otherwise, and that's extremely troubling. This incredibly yikes portrayal of an entire civilian population gets upgraded to YIKES when you see the immensely uncomfortable parallels to the real life history of Japan's colonization of Korea, complete with visual similarities. This is a very deep and troubling nationalistic hole to go down, but even without the historical parallels, these events feel obscenely out of character for this series, as though it didn't know how to justify Miranjo's tragic back story, and it ends up making said back story weaker as a result because of how comically evil it is.    This effect can also be seen to a lesser degree with Ouken, an immortal with a thirst for blood and violence. What irks me about this character is that his plight is only conveyed in words spoken by other characters, not through his own actions. We see what he's like after immortality has driven him mad, and we see what he was like before his immortality, but the steps in-between have been cut entirely, steps that are arguably the most important part of a character whose defining personality trait is being driven to insanity. There's nothing to empathize with in Ouken because his entire descent into madness was not elaborated on, and his character wasn't exactly really fleshed-out beforehand, making him nothing more than a rampaging monster who enjoys slitting wrists and torturing his opponents. Much like the people of Gyakuza, Ouken has been completely dehumanized, thus removing him entirely from the forgiveness equation even though he easily gives Miranjo a run for her money in terms of the most harm done to other characters. I do hope that this will eventually be resolved since Ouken still remains part of the story at the end, but for now he just feels hollow and disappointing.    And so, in the end, I'm left with half a story I really love and another half I just don't feel invested in at all. The dynamic between physical appearance and actual ability was immensely interesting and truly endeared me to characters like Bojji and Kage who were desperately trying to live as equals to everyone else in the world they inhabit, and I'm very curious as to what direction the manga takes these characters after the events we've seen thus far. On the other hand, the severe lack of true consequences for a large bulk of this plot makes the theme of forgiveness feel rather infantile, almost contrived at times. The idea that everyone's getting along just fine after this cheapens the depth of this message. It's easy to forgive someone when everything's completely healed up at the end, but it's quite another when there's actual fallout to deal with, and Ranking of Kings clumsily sidesteps said fallout and comes out weaker for it. I still enjoyed my experience on the whole, especially considering the insanely strong animation and artwork provided by Wit Studio, but it's still a much shallower enjoyment than what could have been.

Ranking of Kings Ending Explained - Anime News Network:SEA,"     Across two anime seasons packed with heavy-hitting sequels and long-awaited adaptations, the fact that Ranking of Kings has managed to stay near the top of seasonal discussions for almost half a year is a testament to how engaging this series is and how many ideas it has within it to talk about. That said, for as solid as the project is on the whole, not all ideas are created equal, so join me on a dive into some of this show's disparate themes as we try to see what final conclusion this show arrived at.    Before we jump in I wanna do a brief recap of where this story ended up at the end just to keep it in mind as we discuss what led up to it, and I want to focus primarily on two of the major end results. Firstly, we have Bojji's final battle with Bosse. Whereas Bosse continues to fight Bojji with the same brute force he always has, though this time with Daida's body, Bojji's training under Despa has allowed him to become skilled in his own right through his superior agility and his talent for discovering an opponent's weak point, thus allowing him to triumph over his father. Secondly, we have the resolution to Miranjo's plot against the kingdom. After Bojji destroys the mirror, Miranjo's soul is collected by the same demon that granted Bosse his immense strength, but through Daida's empathy and compassion, her soul is rescued and returned to a living body. Daida announces that he forgives Miranjo for her misdeeds, with Bojji following suit, and that he plans to marry her in order to share the burden of her sins moving forward.    We'll start with that first climax, as it ties into what is easily this anime's strongest idea, that being the conflict between appearance and ability. With our main character, Bojji, being deaf and unable to verbally communicate with those around him, the topic of disability is centered at the forefront of Bojji's characterization and makes his life inordinately difficult. Other children laugh at him for his disability, while many of the adults find him frustrating to deal with, leaving Bojji with few people he can connect to. What's more, his disability often leads others to assume that he is of lesser skill or intelligence than those who are more able-bodied. One the one hand, this is true in terms of pure brute force, as it's revealed that his father, Bosse, made a deal with a demon that sapped Bojji of all his potential strength. As such, Bojji is looked down on by those who expect him to become a great king like his father despite his obvious physical disadvantage, asking something of him that he simply cannot give.    On the other hand, this disability also causes those around Bojji to perceive him as less intelligent, though this aspect of Bojji is an entirely false assumption. Because he often can't communicate what he wants in order to get his point across or just goes about life in ways that seem entirely foreign or nonsensical, those who observe Bojji simply attribute this to him being dumb, as it's easier to just write off his eccentricities as a part of his disability rather than try to understand him, thus adding to the issues that Bojji faces in both his social life and in his perception as a potential leader. Bojji is not mentally inept in any way. In fact, he often exhibits a keen sense of perception and intuition that vastly outpaces those around him, but because he has difficulties communicating these ideas to others, or more often so is unable to find people who will even try to understand to him, his reputation as a dunce becomes more pervasive despite his skills.    That said, even Bojji himself doesn't fully understand this concept until later on in the series. For at least the first couple episodes, Bojji and Kage are dead set on finding someone or some way to make Bojji physically stronger, as they too see Bosse as the ideal to be strived towards. This is readily apparent in how Bojji's more agile swordsmanship is bluntly rejected by the entire castle staff in favor of Daida's more straightforward and supposedly “honorable” style of fighting, and so Bojji and Kage seek out someone who can make him more adept with brute force. It isn't until both Desha and Despa lay it out plain as day that Bojji has zero potential for physical growth that they even attempt to find an alternative, and even that takes some persuasion on Despa's part. In this instance, even Bojji has gotten too wrapped up in his perception of himself and how he believes he should be viewed by others, rather than taking himself as he is and shaping his kingly identity around that.    Then we have Kage, our thief with a heart of gold. Kage is a descendant of the infamous shadow clan, a legendary group of assassins that had been purged some time before he appears on-screen. After losing his mother, Kage is treated with disdain by everyone around him, often as the result of his appearance, and ends up starving on the streets. Even after he finds somewhere to live, the person he lives with seems to hone in on Kage's heritage and starts using him to rob homes and other locations. Here, we have an instance that less appearance vs ability, but rather appearance vs personality. Kage doesn't want to be the bad guy, and we even see in a flashback that he saw his clan as good guys who loyally served their king, but the shady nature of their line of work causes people to constantly misread Kage's intentions, which we see with Bebin during the first few episodes. As such, Kage's experiences put him in the perfect position to understand Bojji. Though he too misinterprets Bojji's talents at first, he quickly comes around and is able to see all the good in him, and so makes it his goal to support Bojji in any way he can.    Finally, one of the more fascinating, yet somewhat understated examples of this contrasting of appearance against ability is presented through the brotherly relationship between Desha and Despa,  albeit in a much less clear-cut manner. Desha, the king of the Underworld, is portrayed to be much less attractive and amiable than his brother, and, according to Despa, he would occasionally get hung up on his own appearance, as displayed by him defacing his own monument. Despite this, Desha's supreme power and charisma allowed him to gain popularity and become a great king for his nation, freeing his people from the tyrannical rule of his father.    On the flip side of that, we have Despa, highly intelligent and incredibly handsome, yet lacking in the physical strength and extraordinary powers that his brother possesses, and much like Desha, he too envies that which his brother has that he does not, as shown in a flashback where Despa mourns his lack of physical prowess in comparison to his kin. Despite this, much like Desha, Despa eventually grows wise enough to recognize the usefulness of his own talents, shaping his persona and combat tendencies in ways that only he can and not simply trying to mimic his brother, a trait that he has endeavored to pass on to Bojji so that he too can carve out his own path without trying to follow in his father's footsteps or compete with Daida solely through strength. Bojji's incredible agility and insight into discovering an opponent's weakness is his greatest asset in combat and something he achieved precisely because of his disability, and Despa recognizes how wasteful it would be to squander that talent, thus allowing Bojji to overcome his lack of strength and stand on equal footing with Daida and Bosse.    This aspect of Bojji is symbolized perfectly by his choice of weapon, a small rapier given to him by Despa. While deciding on what weapon to train with, Bojji initially tries to use an axe, as it's the same weapon his father, who is portrayed as the ideal powerful king, uses on the battlefield, but even the smallest of axes proves too unwieldy. Thus, Bojji ultimately chooses the rapier, one that seems to have very little offensive power at all and tricks even Kage into thinking that it's worthless. Yet, Bojji is able to draw out the full potential of this weapon by using a fighting style best suited for him, one that emphasizes agility and small strikes over heavy hitting attacks. This allows Bojji to completely incapacite his opponents with no bloodshed, a perfect representation of Bojji's endless altruism towards even those who seek to harm him.    In a sense, Bojji's arc is not so much about gaining the physical strength to become a better leader, but more so about coming to understand himself so as to highlight the talents he already has. Bojji being deaf does not automatically make him lesser, but it does change the set of talents and ability preferences that he is endowed with, and so Bojji's arc is almost entirely one of internal growth and learning to see past the expectations of others in order to discover what will actually help him succeed, and this internal growth is also loosely tied to this anime's second major theme that becomes much more readily apparent in its second half: forgiveness.    With this being a fantasy series centered around a monarchical power struggle, betrayal and backstabbing are very much the order of the day for a large chunk of the plot, especially with Bojji being a potential rival for the throne. Even after the high ranking officials of the kingdom supplant Bojji's claim and choose Daida as the new king, Miranjo still convinces Daida that Bojji must be disposed of, and so Domas, Bojji's sword instructor, is tasked with his assassination and would have succeeded if Kage had not been there to save Bojji from his fate.    When Bojji and Domas meet again after this incident, Bojji is nearly paralyzed by fear, still believing Domas to be someone who will bring him harm. Even after Domas apologizes profusely and begs for forgiveness, Bojji runs away, unable to fully process the conflicting emotions swirling around in his head. He wants to forgive Domas, the person who's been by his side so often and tried his best to help Bojji improve his swordsmanship, even going so far as to learn sign language in order to better communicate with him, but Domas's betrayal still hangs heavy in his mind, and so he's simply not ready to forgive him yet. Kage seems to recognize this and, rather than keep trying to convince Bojji to forgive him, he runs off with Bojji to support him, knowing that this issue will take some time. It's a complicated and interesting topic to tackle, recognizing that forgiveness should occur, but simply not being ready to fully resolve those emotions, making Bojji's emotional arc regarding this issue quite compelling.    That said, as strong as that specific plotline is, not everyone seems to be given the same level of care and depth when it comes to the idea of forgiveness. Quite frankly, most of the characters are unusually quick to forgive their enemies and welcome them back into the fold despite the transgressions they've committed, and it begins to strain credibility on all parties involved. With Bojji, a quick forgiveness would make sense since he's just a wholesome little ball of wonder, but even he had to pump the brakes a bit before forgiving Domas.    It feels as though the story is trying to transfer the emotional arc Bojji experienced onto every other character in the show and it's just not landing for me, especially when it comes to the central antagonist, Miranjo. With her being the mastermind behind the attempted coup and destruction of Bosse's kingdom, her list of offenses is easily the longest from this cast, and she's also the only one to bring about the death of a named character, that being Bojji's mother, Shiina, who dies horrifically in front of Bojji as Miranjo is laying siege to the kingdom while Bosse is away.    Despite this connection, Bojji is not the one who gets tied to Miranjo in this series. It's Daida who is positioned as the one to play off of Miranjo during the present-day section of this plot, with Miranjo acting as his advisor through the magic mirror and her past self interacting with him inside his mind while Bosse is in control of his body. It's through Miranjo that Daida is led towards purging his advisors of dissent and even attempting to have his own brother killed, ultimately leading to him being trapped in his own mind after Miranjo used his body to resurrect Bosse. In theory, this should have led to a similar forgiveness arc in which Daida comes to terms with how Miranjo has wronged him, sorted through his feelings, and then eventually came around to forgiving her. Not exactly the same, but similar in that an arc should exist.    But, that's not what we got. Instead, Daida just skips straight to step three and not only forgives Miranjo immediately after learning that she had been deceiving him this whole time, but also declares that he will marry her in an attempt to lead her down the right path in the future. No intense thought given to how this situation has complicated his feelings for Miranjo. He just gets over it immediately and decides to reform her, glossing over what could have been a very interesting character dynamic.    Also, what about Bojji? Like I know that we'd kinda be repeating his forgiveness arc again, but he still had to watch his mother die in front of him because of Miranjo. That trauma is still very much baked into Bojji's character, and yet the only thing we get from Bojji on the matter is him telling Hiling that's Miranjo's cool now. It's uh…a bit hollow in my opinion, and that's to say nothing of all the other people Miranjo has wronged throughout the series on various levels. Yes Daida basically orders them to forgive her, but they certainly don't seem to be holding in any conflicting emotions. With the very brief exception of Hiling, everyone's totally on the same page about forgiving Miranjo, and it feels kind of insincere.    The story tries to dance around this by not having Miranjo, or really any character for that matter, actually get anyone killed during the present-day of this story, but this also ends up coming back to bite it as massive tonal dissonance with its own set of issues. Despite the dismemberments and desanguinations and all other methods of inflicting pain in battle, the fact that pretty much no one is killed by another person, with the exception of Bojji's mother and one other example we'll discuss in just a moment, relieves the story of having to answer that final question. Could these characters forgive each other if they actually did kill their friend or apprentice or any kind of close relation? We know Bojji can because his life has naturally sculpted him into being the most altruistic and kind-hearted person in the show, but it never forces the other characters to follow suit. Everyone makes it out of this coup alive, and even those with severe injuries like dismemberment get prosthetics attachments out of nowhere, so it never has to test the resolve of these other characters and see whether they could follow Bojji's lead in the face of something that really can't be taken back.    This does, however, bring us to the incredibly unpleasant elephant in the room: episode 18, in which we are shown Miranjo's back story and how she came to suffer the trauma conveyed to us through her talks with Daida. Now, before we dive into this, I do want to at least present the notion that most of this information is conveyed through Bosse, who, due to the circumstances we're about to discuss, could be considered an unreliable narrator. However, the story still has yet to present anything that even remotely disputes what Bosse says, and we even see the perspective of other characters that line up with this story, so to me, the validity of this interpretation leans more towards truth than fiction. Perhaps a somewhat exaggerated truth, but a truth nonetheless. In any case, Miranjo and her mother were residents of Houma, a kingdom that sought to “modernize” the kingdom of Gyakuza so as to borrow their aid in the fight against the gods. Despite the goodwill of Houma, the people of Gyakuza remained ever-skeptical and deceitful, which the show directly states is a fundamental trait of all of Gyakuza's citizens as a result of their geopolitical history, a shockingly black-and-white statement considering how nuanced the story has been previously.    Because of this, Miranjo's mother is killed in cold blood by the people of Gyakuza and Miranjo herself is horrifically maimed, with her hands cut off and the skin on her face peeled away. This heinous treatment sends Bosse into a blind rage in which he kills seemingly every resident of the town, even young children. In a more nuanced circumstance, this moment would actually play into the theme of forgiveness and show that Bosse and Miranjo were lacking in the same willpower that Bojji possesses. However, because the people of Gyakuza are presented as unambiguously and unilaterally evil and cruel, there is no reason to forgive them because there is no suggestion that they are deserving of forgiveness. The story has completely dehumanized these people to the point of them barely being human anymore.    Again, this could very well be the result of Bosse being an unreliable narrator regarding his interaction with Gyakuza, but because we are never shown evidence to the contrary and we see the perspective of a third party, we kinda have to assume that this is the truth until proven otherwise, and that's extremely troubling. This incredibly yikes portrayal of an entire civilian population gets upgraded to YIKES when you see the immensely uncomfortable parallels to the real life history of Japan's colonization of Korea, complete with visual similarities. This is a very deep and troubling nationalistic hole to go down, but even without the historical parallels, these events feel obscenely out of character for this series, as though it didn't know how to justify Miranjo's tragic back story, and it ends up making said back story weaker as a result because of how comically evil it is.    This effect can also be seen to a lesser degree with Ouken, an immortal with a thirst for blood and violence. What irks me about this character is that his plight is only conveyed in words spoken by other characters, not through his own actions. We see what he's like after immortality has driven him mad, and we see what he was like before his immortality, but the steps in-between have been cut entirely, steps that are arguably the most important part of a character whose defining personality trait is being driven to insanity. There's nothing to empathize with in Ouken because his entire descent into madness was not elaborated on, and his character wasn't exactly really fleshed-out beforehand, making him nothing more than a rampaging monster who enjoys slitting wrists and torturing his opponents. Much like the people of Gyakuza, Ouken has been completely dehumanized, thus removing him entirely from the forgiveness equation even though he easily gives Miranjo a run for her money in terms of the most harm done to other characters. I do hope that this will eventually be resolved since Ouken still remains part of the story at the end, but for now he just feels hollow and disappointing.    And so, in the end, I'm left with half a story I really love and another half I just don't feel invested in at all. The dynamic between physical appearance and actual ability was immensely interesting and truly endeared me to characters like Bojji and Kage who were desperately trying to live as equals to everyone else in the world they inhabit, and I'm very curious as to what direction the manga takes these characters after the events we've seen thus far.

I know pretty much nothing about JJK other than it's not my cup of tea, but I am so in love with some of the cast that I may watch this of they do a livestream and it's not region-locked!   Ryuji is an absolute beast and I love him in everything I've seen him in. Truly a remarkable actor who has limitless energy. He's done multiple 1 1/2-2 hour solo performances with multiple costume changes with no breaks. It's incredible to watch.   Ray is another phenomenal actor! It's always such a treat to watch him! Masanari is also wonderful! I've only seen him in the drama King of Dance, but I really enjoyed his performance! Some of his stage performances are on my long list of plays to watch like KHR and TouSute. Kazuaki is great! I've seen him in Sanrio Danshi and Kyoto Samurai Boys and enjoyed both performances!   And Mokkun (Motohiro Ota)! I love Mokkun so much. He is an absolute treasure! His performance as Yuko in XXXHolic was stellar! He's also fantastic as Sengo in TouMyu. I do want to see his non-2.5D performances.   These actors (and likely the other actors and actresses I'm not familiar with) are very athletic and can certainly benchpress more than their cellphone. I'm so excited!

I know pretty much nothing about JJK other than it's not my cup of tea, but I am so in love with some of the cast that I may watch this of they do a livestream and it's not region-locked!   Ryuji is an absolute beast and I love him in everything I've seen him in. Truly a remarkable actor who has limitless energy. He's done multiple 1 1/2-2 hour solo performances with multiple costume changes with no breaks. It's incredible to watch.   Ray is another phenomenal actor! It's always such a treat to watch him! Masanari is also wonderful! I've only seen him in the drama King of Dance, but I really enjoyed his performance! Some of his stage performances are on my long list of plays to watch like KHR and TouSute. Kazuaki is great! I've seen him in Sanrio Danshi and Kyoto Samurai Boys and enjoyed both performances!   And Mokkun (Motohiro Ota)! I love Mokkun so much. He is an absolute treasure! His performance as Yuko in XXXHolic was stellar! He's also fantastic as Sengo in TouMyu. I do want to see his non-2.5D performances.   These actors (and likely the other actors and actresses I'm not familiar with) are very athletic and can certainly benchpress more than their cellphone. I'm so excited!

I know pretty much nothing about JJK other than it's not my cup of tea, but I am so in love with some of the cast that I may watch this of they do a livestream and it's not region-locked!   Ryuji is an absolute beast and I love him in everything I've seen him in. Truly a remarkable actor who has limitless energy. He's done multiple 1 1/2-2 hour solo performances with multiple costume changes with no breaks. It's incredible to watch.   Ray is another phenomenal actor! It's always such a treat to watch him! Masanari is also wonderful! I've only seen him in the drama King of Dance, but I really enjoyed his performance! Some of his stage performances are on my long list of plays to watch like KHR and TouSute. Kazuaki is great! I've seen him in Sanrio Danshi and Kyoto Samurai Boys and enjoyed both performances!   And Mokkun (Motohiro Ota)! I love Mokkun so much. He is an absolute treasure! His performance as Yuko in XXXHolic was stellar! He's also fantastic as Sengo in TouMyu. I do want to see his non-2.5D performances.   These actors (and likely the other actors and actresses I'm not familiar with) are very athletic and can certainly benchpress more than their cellphone. I'm so excited!

News Live-Action Kingdom Film Sequel Casts Chihiro Yamamoto as Kyō Shō   posted on 2022-04-14 13:04 UTC-8 by Egan Loo         Yamamoto plays Kyō Kai's adoptive sister in July 15 film    This year's 20th issue of Shueisha's Weekly Young Jump magazine announced a new cast member for Kingdom II: Harukanaru Daichi e (To Distant Lands), the sequel film based on Yasuhisa Hara's Kingdom manga, on Thursday. Chihiro Yamamoto will play Kyō Shō (Qiang Xiang), Kyō Kai's adoptive sister.        The film's staff also debuted new visuals on Thursday:         The film's new cast members also feature:    Amane Okayama as Bi Hei   Takahiro Miura as Bitо̄   Takayuki Hamatsu as Taku Kei    The cast includes Nana Seino as Kyо̄ Kai and Kento Yamazaki as Shin. These five characters are part of an infantry together (pictured above).     Other new cast members include (left to right in image above):     Tsutomu Takahashi as Kyū Gen   Yukiyoshi Ozawa as Go Kei   Etsushi Toyokawa as Duke Hyō   Kiyohiko Shibukawa as Baku Koshin       Shinsuke Satō (live-action Gantz, Death Note Light up the NEW world, Bleach) is returning as director. Kento Yamazaki, Ryō Yoshizawa, and Kanna Hashimoto are all reprising their respective characters Shin (Xin), Ei Sei (Yin Zheng), and Ka Ryō Ten (He Liao Diao) from the previous film. Tsutomu Kuroiwa (One Piece Film Gold, live-action Black Butler, GANTZ:O) joins Satō and Hara in writing the script, and  Yutaka Yamada (Tokyo Ghoul, Vinland Saga, live-action Bleach) is composing the music. Mr. Children contributes the  theme song ""Ikiro"" (Live).    The film will open on July 15.      The first film opened in Japan in April 2019 and sold 506,861 tickets to earn 690,219,500 yen (about US$6.17 million) in its first three days. The film later sold a total of 4.11 million tickets for 5,471,938,400 yen (about US$50.42 million), and eventually earned a cumulative total of 5.73 billion yen (about US$53.2 million). Funimation screened the film at Anime Expo in July 2019, and began screening the film in theaters in the United States and Canada in August 2019.    Hara's historical manga began with the slave boy Xin and his dream of becoming a great general for the state of Qin. Xin helps Ying Zheng, the young Qin king who shares his desire to unify China, rise to power within the state. Xin does all he can to become a superior commander of an army capable of defeating the Seven Warring States.    The record-setting manga launched in Shueisha's Weekly Young Jump magazine in 2006. Shueisha published the 64th compiled book volume on February 18. Hara said he is considering writing up to 100 volumes.    A television anime adaptation premiered in 2012, and a second season premiered in 2013. Funimation streamed the series in North America and released both seasons on DVD in 2016. The third anime series based on Yasuhisa Hara's Kingdom manga premiered on NHK General in April 2020.     The anime's fourth season premiered on NHK General on April 9 at 24:00 (effectively April 10 at 12:00 a.m.).

These five characters are part of an infantry together (pictured above).     Other new cast members include (left to right in image above):     Tsutomu Takahashi as Kyū Gen   Yukiyoshi Ozawa as Go Kei   Etsushi Toyokawa as Duke Hyō   Kiyohiko Shibukawa as Baku Koshin       Shinsuke Satō (live-action Gantz, Death Note Light up the NEW world, Bleach) is returning as director. Kento Yamazaki, Ryō Yoshizawa, and Kanna Hashimoto are all reprising their respective characters Shin (Xin), Ei Sei (Yin Zheng), and Ka Ryō Ten (He Liao Diao) from the previous film. Tsutomu Kuroiwa (One Piece Film Gold, live-action Black Butler, GANTZ:O) joins Satō and Hara in writing the script, and  Yutaka Yamada (Tokyo Ghoul, Vinland Saga, live-action Bleach) is composing the music.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Demon Girl Next Door Season 2   Apr  8th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Demon Girl Next Door (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.4              What is this?   Yūko Yoshida is a 15-year-old girl who awakens one morning with demonic power, and is tasked with defeating a local magical girl. She has horns and a tail, but truthfully less power than an ordinary girl. She struggles to lift the ""curse of a 40,000 yen (about US$365) per month living."" (from manga)   The Demon Girl Next Door is based on Izumo Ito's manga and streams on HIDIVE on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   James Beckett  Rating:                So, here's a funny story: I somehow got The Demon Girl Next Door confused with last year's The Great Jahy Will Not Be Defeated!. Once I realized my initial mix-up, I spent some time scouring wikis to give myself a crash course on the basic premise, but honestly, I was nowhere near as lost as I feared I would be. If you ever needed proof that The Preview Guide sometimes works in mysterious ways, it turns out that I loved every second of this sequel, and it is easily the best premiere I've seen all week.    I'm sure there are plenty of in-jokes and callbacks I missed, but it's easy enough to get the gist: It's a world of magical girls and demons living in modern Japan, and wacky shenanigans are going to ensue when they try to get along. Yuko (aka Shamiko) is a fiesty but but well-meaning demon; Momo is a reserved and somewhat awkward magical girl; Lilith is Shamiko's ancestor that looks like a cartoon mascot sex toy for some reason; Shamiko's father is a literal cardboard box called Daddy Box, and her family uses him as a kitchen appliance and dining table.    You know. Your everyday sort of stuff!    Here's the thing: If an anime manages to make me laugh, it's already earned a hell of a lot of goodwill in my book, and The Demon Girl Next Door had me absolutely cackling. Even better, all of the jokes were rooted in surprisingly strong and deliberate writing, so I was able to catch up on a lot of the character dynamics and backstory. I learned that Lilith is a charming little gremlin, that Mikan loves putting lemons in food, and that Momo is almost certainly the best girl of the series and also definitely in love with her rival Shamiko.    I know that this one will likely fly under the radar since it's only streaming on HIDIVE, but if you take only a single thing away from my Preview Guide dispatches this spring, let it be this: this one episode of The Demon Girl Next Door made me into a convert, and catching up on Season 1 is going to become a top priority. It's that good. Do yourself a favor and give the series a shot.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review                Odd Taxi: In the Woods   Apr 17, 00:00                 anime    By cleverly reframing its narrative around a series of interviews with the supporting cast, Odd Taxi: In the Woods succeeds where most recap films fail: it's an artistically cohesive film in its own right. ― Odd Taxi was 2021's sleeper anime hit, telling an intricate, original mystery that kept viewers guessing every week.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Demon Girl Next Door Season 2   Apr  8th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Demon Girl Next Door (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.4              What is this?   Yūko Yoshida is a 15-year-old girl who awakens one morning with demonic power, and is tasked with defeating a local magical girl. She has horns and a tail, but truthfully less power than an ordinary girl. She struggles to lift the ""curse of a 40,000 yen (about US$365) per month living."" (from manga)   The Demon Girl Next Door is based on Izumo Ito's manga and streams on HIDIVE on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   James Beckett  Rating:                So, here's a funny story: I somehow got The Demon Girl Next Door confused with last year's The Great Jahy Will Not Be Defeated!. Once I realized my initial mix-up, I spent some time scouring wikis to give myself a crash course on the basic premise, but honestly, I was nowhere near as lost as I feared I would be. If you ever needed proof that The Preview Guide sometimes works in mysterious ways, it turns out that I loved every second of this sequel, and it is easily the best premiere I've seen all week.    I'm sure there are plenty of in-jokes and callbacks I missed, but it's easy enough to get the gist: It's a world of magical girls and demons living in modern Japan, and wacky shenanigans are going to ensue when they try to get along. Yuko (aka Shamiko) is a fiesty but but well-meaning demon; Momo is a reserved and somewhat awkward magical girl; Lilith is Shamiko's ancestor that looks like a cartoon mascot sex toy for some reason; Shamiko's father is a literal cardboard box called Daddy Box, and her family uses him as a kitchen appliance and dining table.    You know. Your everyday sort of stuff!    Here's the thing: If an anime manages to make me laugh, it's already earned a hell of a lot of goodwill in my book, and The Demon Girl Next Door had me absolutely cackling. Even better, all of the jokes were rooted in surprisingly strong and deliberate writing, so I was able to catch up on a lot of the character dynamics and backstory. I learned that Lilith is a charming little gremlin, that Mikan loves putting lemons in food, and that Momo is almost certainly the best girl of the series and also definitely in love with her rival Shamiko.    I know that this one will likely fly under the radar since it's only streaming on HIDIVE, but if you take only a single thing away from my Preview Guide dispatches this spring, let it be this: this one episode of The Demon Girl Next Door made me into a convert, and catching up on Season 1 is going to become a top priority. It's that good. Do yourself a favor and give the series a shot.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review                Odd Taxi: In the Woods   Apr 17, 00:00                 anime    By cleverly reframing its narrative around a series of interviews with the supporting cast, Odd Taxi: In the Woods succeeds where most recap films fail: it's an artistically cohesive film in its own right. ― Odd Taxi was 2021's sleeper anime hit, telling an intricate, original mystery that kept viewers guessing every week.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Demon Girl Next Door Season 2   Apr  8th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Demon Girl Next Door (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.4              What is this?   Yūko Yoshida is a 15-year-old girl who awakens one morning with demonic power, and is tasked with defeating a local magical girl. She has horns and a tail, but truthfully less power than an ordinary girl. She struggles to lift the ""curse of a 40,000 yen (about US$365) per month living."" (from manga)   The Demon Girl Next Door is based on Izumo Ito's manga and streams on HIDIVE on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   James Beckett  Rating:                So, here's a funny story: I somehow got The Demon Girl Next Door confused with last year's The Great Jahy Will Not Be Defeated!. Once I realized my initial mix-up, I spent some time scouring wikis to give myself a crash course on the basic premise, but honestly, I was nowhere near as lost as I feared I would be. If you ever needed proof that The Preview Guide sometimes works in mysterious ways, it turns out that I loved every second of this sequel, and it is easily the best premiere I've seen all week.    I'm sure there are plenty of in-jokes and callbacks I missed, but it's easy enough to get the gist: It's a world of magical girls and demons living in modern Japan, and wacky shenanigans are going to ensue when they try to get along. Yuko (aka Shamiko) is a fiesty but but well-meaning demon; Momo is a reserved and somewhat awkward magical girl; Lilith is Shamiko's ancestor that looks like a cartoon mascot sex toy for some reason; Shamiko's father is a literal cardboard box called Daddy Box, and her family uses him as a kitchen appliance and dining table.    You know. Your everyday sort of stuff!    Here's the thing: If an anime manages to make me laugh, it's already earned a hell of a lot of goodwill in my book, and The Demon Girl Next Door had me absolutely cackling. Even better, all of the jokes were rooted in surprisingly strong and deliberate writing, so I was able to catch up on a lot of the character dynamics and backstory. I learned that Lilith is a charming little gremlin, that Mikan loves putting lemons in food, and that Momo is almost certainly the best girl of the series and also definitely in love with her rival Shamiko.    I know that this one will likely fly under the radar since it's only streaming on HIDIVE, but if you take only a single thing away from my Preview Guide dispatches this spring, let it be this: this one episode of The Demon Girl Next Door made me into a convert, and catching up on Season 1 is going to become a top priority. It's that good.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Demon Girl Next Door Season 2   Apr  8th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Demon Girl Next Door (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.4              What is this?   Yūko Yoshida is a 15-year-old girl who awakens one morning with demonic power, and is tasked with defeating a local magical girl. She has horns and a tail, but truthfully less power than an ordinary girl. She struggles to lift the ""curse of a 40,000 yen (about US$365) per month living."" (from manga)   The Demon Girl Next Door is based on Izumo Ito's manga and streams on HIDIVE on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   James Beckett  Rating:                So, here's a funny story: I somehow got The Demon Girl Next Door confused with last year's The Great Jahy Will Not Be Defeated!. Once I realized my initial mix-up, I spent some time scouring wikis to give myself a crash course on the basic premise, but honestly, I was nowhere near as lost as I feared I would be. If you ever needed proof that The Preview Guide sometimes works in mysterious ways, it turns out that I loved every second of this sequel, and it is easily the best premiere I've seen all week.    I'm sure there are plenty of in-jokes and callbacks I missed, but it's easy enough to get the gist: It's a world of magical girls and demons living in modern Japan, and wacky shenanigans are going to ensue when they try to get along. Yuko (aka Shamiko) is a fiesty but but well-meaning demon; Momo is a reserved and somewhat awkward magical girl; Lilith is Shamiko's ancestor that looks like a cartoon mascot sex toy for some reason; Shamiko's father is a literal cardboard box called Daddy Box, and her family uses him as a kitchen appliance and dining table.    You know. Your everyday sort of stuff!    Here's the thing: If an anime manages to make me laugh, it's already earned a hell of a lot of goodwill in my book, and The Demon Girl Next Door had me absolutely cackling. Even better, all of the jokes were rooted in surprisingly strong and deliberate writing, so I was able to catch up on a lot of the character dynamics and backstory. I learned that Lilith is a charming little gremlin, that Mikan loves putting lemons in food, and that Momo is almost certainly the best girl of the series and also definitely in love with her rival Shamiko.    I know that this one will likely fly under the radar since it's only streaming on HIDIVE, but if you take only a single thing away from my Preview Guide dispatches this spring, let it be this: this one episode of The Demon Girl Next Door made me into a convert, and catching up on Season 1 is going to become a top priority.

Community score: 4.4              What is this?   Yūko Yoshida is a 15-year-old girl who awakens one morning with demonic power, and is tasked with defeating a local magical girl. She has horns and a tail, but truthfully less power than an ordinary girl. She struggles to lift the ""curse of a 40,000 yen (about US$365) per month living."" (from manga)   The Demon Girl Next Door is based on Izumo Ito's manga and streams on HIDIVE on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   James Beckett  Rating:                So, here's a funny story: I somehow got The Demon Girl Next Door confused with last year's The Great Jahy Will Not Be Defeated!. Once I realized my initial mix-up, I spent some time scouring wikis to give myself a crash course on the basic premise, but honestly, I was nowhere near as lost as I feared I would be. If you ever needed proof that The Preview Guide sometimes works in mysterious ways, it turns out that I loved every second of this sequel, and it is easily the best premiere I've seen all week.    I'm sure there are plenty of in-jokes and callbacks I missed, but it's easy enough to get the gist: It's a world of magical girls and demons living in modern Japan, and wacky shenanigans are going to ensue when they try to get along. Yuko (aka Shamiko) is a fiesty but but well-meaning demon; Momo is a reserved and somewhat awkward magical girl; Lilith is Shamiko's ancestor that looks like a cartoon mascot sex toy for some reason; Shamiko's father is a literal cardboard box called Daddy Box, and her family uses him as a kitchen appliance and dining table.    You know. Your everyday sort of stuff!    Here's the thing: If an anime manages to make me laugh, it's already earned a hell of a lot of goodwill in my book, and The Demon Girl Next Door had me absolutely cackling. Even better, all of the jokes were rooted in surprisingly strong and deliberate writing, so I was able to catch up on a lot of the character dynamics and backstory. I learned that Lilith is a charming little gremlin, that Mikan loves putting lemons in food, and that Momo is almost certainly the best girl of the series and also definitely in love with her rival Shamiko.    I know that this one will likely fly under the radar since it's only streaming on HIDIVE, but if you take only a single thing away from my Preview Guide dispatches this spring, let it be this: this one episode of The Demon Girl Next Door made me into a convert, and catching up on Season 1 is going to become a top priority.
