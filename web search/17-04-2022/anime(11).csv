Requiem of the Rose King Episode 13  by Rebecca Silverman, Apr 11th 2022                   How would you rate episode 13 of Requiem of the Rose King ?                     Community score: 3.4            I may have anticipated this week's use of Richard's final speech to Henry in Henry the Sixth Part Three in the episode twelve review, but the line “I am myself alone” still informs Richard's character a great deal. Its myriad interpretations speak to the turmoil in his heart, even if he believes that, in killing Henry, he is currently without a soul. What's interesting is that although Richard says more than once that he has killed his own soul in that final encounter with his love, there's not that noticeable a difference in his actions now. He still laments his body, feels conflicted about the crown, and is quietly working behind the scenes, though to what end even he may not be fully aware of. We know what Edward wants, what Elizabeth wants, what Buckingham wants. But what does Richard want? And has he ever really known?    It's fitting that this point in the story is when Aya Kanno's version of the plays brings in Jane Shore. In Shakespearean terms, Jane isn't a named character in any of the plays, although some productions do give her name to one of the random court ladies and she is mentioned as “Mistress Shore.” (She is, however, a significant character in several other versions of the Richard III story, including a 1714 play named after her.) Historically she was in fact Edward's mistress beginning in 1476 until his death in 1483, and while she wasn't a witch, Richard did accuse her of conspiring against him when he took the throne. Ultimately Jane did pretty well for a player in the Wars of the Roses saga, outliving basically everyone else to die in her 80s. Her status as a witch in Requiem of the Rose King, at least as we see it in this episode, is yet another marker of Richard's discomfort with his feminine aspects; he compares her to Joan (also not a witch), and she makes him similarly uncomfortable as she seeks to manipulate him for her own ends. In Richard's world, women are witches like Jane and Joan, betrayers like Anne and Cecily, or schemers like Isabelle, Margaret, and Elizabeth. Why would he want to accept that part of himself when he can't like it in others?    Jane's entry into the scene is also a good way to show us how much time has passed. Prince Edward died in 1471 and King Edward is still alive, so we have to be somewhere between 1476 and 1483, a time frame borne out by the ages of the new sons present in the episode – and Buckingham's impressive growth spurt. (And guess what? The new kids are also all Edwards and Richards!) The king's slide into debauchery and George's descent into wine-fueled anger are what allow Jane to slip in and begin manipulating circumstances as she pleases, but if we're honest she doesn't have to work that hard, because both of Richard's older brothers aren't exactly leading healthy lives. Richard's exclusion – which he basically does himself – is what gives him a better view of what's going on but also what may be keeping him safer than either Edward or George, because he's not out there in plain sight most of the time. Sure people wonder why he and Anne have only one child (and we all know who that adorable kid really is), but for the most part he's just quietly lurking.    That's what makes the opening scene of this cour so striking. It features an actor as Richard, performing the scene I mentioned in the beginning. Richard is playing a part, it implies, reciting his lines as he moves through the world still feeling the pain of Henry's loss and does what he believes is his part for his father's dream. Heaven may not be in the circlet of the crown, but Hell most definitely is, and Richard's been staring down into that abyss for a while now. Will he slip over the edge and embrace Shakespearean villainy? The curtain has risen on Richard III. Let's watch and find out.

Requiem of the Rose King Episode 13  by Rebecca Silverman, Apr 11th 2022                   How would you rate episode 13 of Requiem of the Rose King ?                     Community score: 3.4            I may have anticipated this week's use of Richard's final speech to Henry in Henry the Sixth Part Three in the episode twelve review, but the line “I am myself alone” still informs Richard's character a great deal. Its myriad interpretations speak to the turmoil in his heart, even if he believes that, in killing Henry, he is currently without a soul. What's interesting is that although Richard says more than once that he has killed his own soul in that final encounter with his love, there's not that noticeable a difference in his actions now. He still laments his body, feels conflicted about the crown, and is quietly working behind the scenes, though to what end even he may not be fully aware of. We know what Edward wants, what Elizabeth wants, what Buckingham wants. But what does Richard want? And has he ever really known?    It's fitting that this point in the story is when Aya Kanno's version of the plays brings in Jane Shore. In Shakespearean terms, Jane isn't a named character in any of the plays, although some productions do give her name to one of the random court ladies and she is mentioned as “Mistress Shore.” (She is, however, a significant character in several other versions of the Richard III story, including a 1714 play named after her.) Historically she was in fact Edward's mistress beginning in 1476 until his death in 1483, and while she wasn't a witch, Richard did accuse her of conspiring against him when he took the throne. Ultimately Jane did pretty well for a player in the Wars of the Roses saga, outliving basically everyone else to die in her 80s. Her status as a witch in Requiem of the Rose King, at least as we see it in this episode, is yet another marker of Richard's discomfort with his feminine aspects; he compares her to Joan (also not a witch), and she makes him similarly uncomfortable as she seeks to manipulate him for her own ends. In Richard's world, women are witches like Jane and Joan, betrayers like Anne and Cecily, or schemers like Isabelle, Margaret, and Elizabeth. Why would he want to accept that part of himself when he can't like it in others?    Jane's entry into the scene is also a good way to show us how much time has passed. Prince Edward died in 1471 and King Edward is still alive, so we have to be somewhere between 1476 and 1483, a time frame borne out by the ages of the new sons present in the episode – and Buckingham's impressive growth spurt. (And guess what? The new kids are also all Edwards and Richards!) The king's slide into debauchery and George's descent into wine-fueled anger are what allow Jane to slip in and begin manipulating circumstances as she pleases, but if we're honest she doesn't have to work that hard, because both of Richard's older brothers aren't exactly leading healthy lives. Richard's exclusion – which he basically does himself – is what gives him a better view of what's going on but also what may be keeping him safer than either Edward or George, because he's not out there in plain sight most of the time. Sure people wonder why he and Anne have only one child (and we all know who that adorable kid really is), but for the most part he's just quietly lurking.    That's what makes the opening scene of this cour so striking. It features an actor as Richard, performing the scene I mentioned in the beginning. Richard is playing a part, it implies, reciting his lines as he moves through the world still feeling the pain of Henry's loss and does what he believes is his part for his father's dream. Heaven may not be in the circlet of the crown, but Hell most definitely is, and Richard's been staring down into that abyss for a while now. Will he slip over the edge and embrace Shakespearean villainy? The curtain has risen on Richard III. Let's watch and find out.

Requiem of the Rose King Episode 13  by Rebecca Silverman, Apr 11th 2022                   How would you rate episode 13 of Requiem of the Rose King ?                     Community score: 3.4            I may have anticipated this week's use of Richard's final speech to Henry in Henry the Sixth Part Three in the episode twelve review, but the line “I am myself alone” still informs Richard's character a great deal. Its myriad interpretations speak to the turmoil in his heart, even if he believes that, in killing Henry, he is currently without a soul. What's interesting is that although Richard says more than once that he has killed his own soul in that final encounter with his love, there's not that noticeable a difference in his actions now. He still laments his body, feels conflicted about the crown, and is quietly working behind the scenes, though to what end even he may not be fully aware of. We know what Edward wants, what Elizabeth wants, what Buckingham wants. But what does Richard want? And has he ever really known?    It's fitting that this point in the story is when Aya Kanno's version of the plays brings in Jane Shore. In Shakespearean terms, Jane isn't a named character in any of the plays, although some productions do give her name to one of the random court ladies and she is mentioned as “Mistress Shore.” (She is, however, a significant character in several other versions of the Richard III story, including a 1714 play named after her.) Historically she was in fact Edward's mistress beginning in 1476 until his death in 1483, and while she wasn't a witch, Richard did accuse her of conspiring against him when he took the throne. Ultimately Jane did pretty well for a player in the Wars of the Roses saga, outliving basically everyone else to die in her 80s. Her status as a witch in Requiem of the Rose King, at least as we see it in this episode, is yet another marker of Richard's discomfort with his feminine aspects; he compares her to Joan (also not a witch), and she makes him similarly uncomfortable as she seeks to manipulate him for her own ends. In Richard's world, women are witches like Jane and Joan, betrayers like Anne and Cecily, or schemers like Isabelle, Margaret, and Elizabeth. Why would he want to accept that part of himself when he can't like it in others?    Jane's entry into the scene is also a good way to show us how much time has passed. Prince Edward died in 1471 and King Edward is still alive, so we have to be somewhere between 1476 and 1483, a time frame borne out by the ages of the new sons present in the episode – and Buckingham's impressive growth spurt. (And guess what? The new kids are also all Edwards and Richards!) The king's slide into debauchery and George's descent into wine-fueled anger are what allow Jane to slip in and begin manipulating circumstances as she pleases, but if we're honest she doesn't have to work that hard, because both of Richard's older brothers aren't exactly leading healthy lives. Richard's exclusion – which he basically does himself – is what gives him a better view of what's going on but also what may be keeping him safer than either Edward or George, because he's not out there in plain sight most of the time. Sure people wonder why he and Anne have only one child (and we all know who that adorable kid really is), but for the most part he's just quietly lurking.    That's what makes the opening scene of this cour so striking. It features an actor as Richard, performing the scene I mentioned in the beginning. Richard is playing a part, it implies, reciting his lines as he moves through the world still feeling the pain of Henry's loss and does what he believes is his part for his father's dream. Heaven may not be in the circlet of the crown, but Hell most definitely is, and Richard's been staring down into that abyss for a while now. Will he slip over the edge and embrace Shakespearean villainy? The curtain has risen on Richard III. Let's watch and find out.

Requiem of the Rose King Episode 13  by Rebecca Silverman, Apr 11th 2022                   How would you rate episode 13 of Requiem of the Rose King ?                     Community score: 3.4            I may have anticipated this week's use of Richard's final speech to Henry in Henry the Sixth Part Three in the episode twelve review, but the line “I am myself alone” still informs Richard's character a great deal. Its myriad interpretations speak to the turmoil in his heart, even if he believes that, in killing Henry, he is currently without a soul. What's interesting is that although Richard says more than once that he has killed his own soul in that final encounter with his love, there's not that noticeable a difference in his actions now. He still laments his body, feels conflicted about the crown, and is quietly working behind the scenes, though to what end even he may not be fully aware of. We know what Edward wants, what Elizabeth wants, what Buckingham wants. But what does Richard want? And has he ever really known?    It's fitting that this point in the story is when Aya Kanno's version of the plays brings in Jane Shore. In Shakespearean terms, Jane isn't a named character in any of the plays, although some productions do give her name to one of the random court ladies and she is mentioned as “Mistress Shore.” (She is, however, a significant character in several other versions of the Richard III story, including a 1714 play named after her.) Historically she was in fact Edward's mistress beginning in 1476 until his death in 1483, and while she wasn't a witch, Richard did accuse her of conspiring against him when he took the throne. Ultimately Jane did pretty well for a player in the Wars of the Roses saga, outliving basically everyone else to die in her 80s. Her status as a witch in Requiem of the Rose King, at least as we see it in this episode, is yet another marker of Richard's discomfort with his feminine aspects; he compares her to Joan (also not a witch), and she makes him similarly uncomfortable as she seeks to manipulate him for her own ends. In Richard's world, women are witches like Jane and Joan, betrayers like Anne and Cecily, or schemers like Isabelle, Margaret, and Elizabeth. Why would he want to accept that part of himself when he can't like it in others?    Jane's entry into the scene is also a good way to show us how much time has passed. Prince Edward died in 1471 and King Edward is still alive, so we have to be somewhere between 1476 and 1483, a time frame borne out by the ages of the new sons present in the episode – and Buckingham's impressive growth spurt. (And guess what? The new kids are also all Edwards and Richards!) The king's slide into debauchery and George's descent into wine-fueled anger are what allow Jane to slip in and begin manipulating circumstances as she pleases, but if we're honest she doesn't have to work that hard, because both of Richard's older brothers aren't exactly leading healthy lives. Richard's exclusion – which he basically does himself – is what gives him a better view of what's going on but also what may be keeping him safer than either Edward or George, because he's not out there in plain sight most of the time. Sure people wonder why he and Anne have only one child (and we all know who that adorable kid really is), but for the most part he's just quietly lurking.    That's what makes the opening scene of this cour so striking. It features an actor as Richard, performing the scene I mentioned in the beginning. Richard is playing a part, it implies, reciting his lines as he moves through the world still feeling the pain of Henry's loss and does what he believes is his part for his father's dream. Heaven may not be in the circlet of the crown, but Hell most definitely is, and Richard's been staring down into that abyss for a while now. Will he slip over the edge and embrace Shakespearean villainy? The curtain has risen on Richard III. Let's watch and find out.

This Week in Anime Is Strong World Peak One Piece?  by Nicholas Dupree & Steve Jones, Apr 14th 2022           Suffering from One Piece withdrawal while the anime series is on hiatus? Netflix added One Piece Film Strong World to its line-up last month and it works as spectacular side story as we wait for the Wano arc to return.    This movie is streaming on Netflix   Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the participants in this chatlog are not the views of Anime News Network.Spoiler Warning for discussion of the series ahead.     @Lossthief    @mouse_inhouse    @NickyEnchilada    @vestenet      Steve  Nick, you know that evolutionary phenomenon where large island animals will, over generations, grow smaller to better adapt to their environment? Well, I just found out the same thing happens to shonen protagonists.     Nick  Oh trust me, that is nowhere near the surprising bit of evolution to happen in One Piece right now. But since you're still ages away from even knowing what ""Wano Fatigue"" means, and we're still waiting for the anime to return, we might as well visit an earlier point in the evoluffynary line.     Truth be told, I have not been keeping up with my One Piece homework since we last covered Stampede, so I ask that you be patient with me if I mix up which character is a skeleton and which character is a robot? I think? But Strong World makes an appropriately strong case for me diving back into the manga, because this movie kinda rules.   It's nostalgic for me in two senses. First, it was the most recent movie when I first caught up with One Piece. Which was only a scant..uh...13 years ago. And it's also the first time in years I've seen these characters in their pre-time skip forms.    By which I mean that Stoner Brooke is a thing of beauty.   My eyes were feasting on all of the fashion choices in that scene. Sanji's just wearing a loose tie over a sweater. Chopper looks like he was forced to wear that onesie on a dare. Luffy's working that cool-casual scarf. And I don't know what Usopp is thinking, but that's par for the course.         There's...a lot to say about the clothes in this movie. Like the fact Sanji's idea of adventuring clothes is this rhinestone cowboy getup.    Also I forgot how far along you were in the manga, but I assume the afro skeleton and Ace Ventura: Tech Detective are new to you?   Correct. I mean, I know the gist to them thanks to weeb osmosis, but the most recent main crewmember I'm intimately familiar with is Nico Robin.   Well, you're not gonna get a lot from any one of them in this movie, but you'll at least get to see more of the Straw Hats than in Stampede! That one was stuffed to bursting with the massively extended cast of this franchise, while Strong World is just filled with fucked up animals.     And honestly I don't need a whole lot more in a movie than that. The conceit of the film is that it takes place on a series of floating islands where evolution has been artificially accelerated in order to produce weaponized megafauna. And the creature designers apparently took this as their cue to go off and use every part of the buffalo, so to speak,—and then they attached those buffalo parts to other random animals. So we've got everything from giant land octopods to literal army ants to electric duck-peacocks to blue sabertooths. It's pure Looney Tunes.         It's great. Some of my fondest moments of early One Piece were just the spreads of weird animals Oda could come up with, and this scratches that itch 50 times in its first act alone. Just freaky, bloodthirsty beasts as far as the eye can see.     It's also just delightfully cartoonish, even in its carnage. Like, I love the denouement to that fish getting shredded.    He just like me fr   I'd forgotten just how many bone puns Brook packs into this thing.     A veritable skele-TON of them!     Yohoho~ Skull joke.   I regret that.   Don't be. That's just how this movie is. I mean they introduce our big villain via a dance number alongside a clown and a gorilla dressed like The New Radicals.     Rarely do I sympathize with fictional characters as much as I sympathized with Nami in this exact moment. Getting kidnapped is one thing, but getting kidnapped by clowns? That stings the soul.     It's even funnier if you know the larger lore around Shiki here. In the (vague movie-centric) canon he's a former rival of Gold Roger, the most legendary and central figure in the series' history. And here he is with sword legs dancing with a clown who makes fart sounds when he walks.   God, Kung Pow: Enter the Fist has the same exact joke, and it's just as good here. Exquisitely dumb comedy done for zero purpose. You love to see it.      It's also a great way to make Shiki look goofy right before we remember he's an extremely dangerous bastard and your local weather guy's worst nightmare.     Yeah! The film opens with this metal-as-hell backstory about him breaking out of prison, and then it keeps flipping back and forth between him workshopping manzai routines and him plotting a big ol' genocide. But it all feels congruous within the context of One Piece's overall loudness, which is a quality Strong World smartly emphasizes start to finish.   It also gives me something that has been in short supply during the recent years of the manga: the Straw Hats hanging out together and being total idiots.      That particular bit got me good. Like, speaking as someone a few several hundred chapters behind on One Piece, I thought it was completely reasonable to expect that Chopper, at some point, had received the ability to take off his fur. Wouldn't be the weirdest power I've seen in this series.   To be honest I think even Chopper forgets what his powers are half the time. Also I'm glad your introduction to Franky includes his ability to retrofit animals into automobiles. It's genuinely one of the best things ever.      Oh is that a recurring bit? I figured it just happened here because of the giant animal thing. And ""Crawley Davidson"" is chef's kiss brilliant.     I won't give away too much. You deserve to find out on your own. The point is, the Straw Hats are the stars of this thing, and it's super refreshing when most of them were sidelined in Stampede. Though some habits have never gone away, like the very necessary introductory scene of Nami at the pool.     Yeah, obviously I haven't gotten to the part in the manga where her proportions go completely off the deep end, but Strong World was sure to remind me of what's in store.     Thing is I actually like most of Nami's material in the movie. Despite the inciting incident being her getting kidnapped by Shiki, she's active through nearly the whole thing and is central to the emotional core. But also boy they like showing off her butt.     Do they ever. But you're right, she is also the film's emotional center, and she really carries the moodiest scene in particular. It's one of the few times Strong World takes itself entirely seriously, and despite all odds, it makes it work with intimate framing and strong character acting.         That's the magic of One Piece, baby. At its best you can slingshot from wacky cartoon hijinks to deathly serious stakes, then back again and it all lands perfectly. I also love the way they use lighting in that sequence. Whole thing starts off just before sunset and Shiki's power eventually blots out the sun entirely as he dominates the crew.      It's so good! And then a couple minutes later the movie tells you to get stickbugged. Multitudes!      Haha look at that goofy thing! A minute later it's destroying a village of bird people. One Piece!     Oh yeah, here's another great microcosm of that: Luffy tenderly reassures the adorable innocent villagers of their humanity, and immediately follows it up with a promise to clobber the crap out of Shiki. That's my guy.         The ultimate narrative of basically every One Piece story is simple: Inform Luffy who he needs to punch and get him within punching distance. This one just adds a little flair by getting everyone dripped out beforehand.     Earlier in the film, I had jokingly questioned why Shiki had instituted a dress code for his big evil pirate gathering, but then I saw the light. It was all for the eventual Straw Hat swag. I'm sorry I ever doubted you, One Piece.     One of the joys of One Piece movies is getting to see new outfits. Just look at this one for the new Red film. I love it.     That's absolutely adorable. He looks like a nephew on Halloween.   As a rule, Robin always has the best look, of course.      Impossible to argue with Nico Robin With a Gun. Nor would I want to. Luffy's badass mobster look here is very good too. Especially with the incongruous straw hat complement.     It's just great all around, and they really do lean into it feeling like a crime movie in the third act. You've got Shiki and his yakuza-style sake cup ceremony. The sliding doors revealing hundreds of guards in the rooms on either side of the main hall. And in the middle of it there's this guy.     You can even hear the music briefly riff on the Matrix soundtrack when they shoot up the place to their absurd degree. And then Usopp and Chopper run off to roleplay Elden Ring while everyone else is doing their own thing. It's an embarrassment of riches.    There's a snowboarding ape with nunchaku and it barely even registers among the chaos. That's the kind of third act we get.     Robin even fights Mothra for a hot second. It's great.     I like the part where Zoro stabs a clown so hard that he explodes.      Gotta love that Zoro's power up is just ""what if there were three of me?"" and he somehow makes that happen. 15 years later and I still don't know how that works, nor do I care to ask. Through probably my favorite goofy thing is when Nami does the stereotypical action movie thing and rips her fancy dress so she can run more easily. Except she never runs anywhere. Apparently she just can't navigate if her thighs are too covered up.     Come on, Nick, everyone knows that the zettai ryouiki is the part of your anatomy most sensitive to fluctuations in barometric pressure.   You joke but I wouldn't be surprised if somewhere in the One Piece universe there's somebody who can predict weather with their garter belt.   I'm not putting anything leg-related past Oda considering the climax of the film is Luffy crushing Shiki under his inflated electrified foot.         I love it. I love Gear Three so much. It's the best power Oda ever came up with (one extremely recent addition notwithstanding) and I love how it's just Luffy turning into the Anchor Arms episode from Spongebob.     I saw something recently about how you can tie pretty much all shonen action stories back to Popeye, and if I didn't believe that before, I sure do now.   Replace devil fruits with spinach and not much would actually change about One Piece. Though unlike the sailor man, Luffy doesn't skip leg day:     Just the one leg tho   Also if I have one nitpick of this movie, it's a little fucked up how they only think about the consequences of defeating the guy whose power is keeping all these islands in the sky AFTER they crack him in half. They're real lucky those villagers conveniently learned to fly with their vestigial arm wings just in time.      To be fair, I don't think anyone in the film, outside Nami, thinks about any consequences of anything. As cheesy as the ending is, though, what makes it for me is the montage of the enormous mutant animals all smiling and living together in harmony. We definitely saw a lot of those die, but it's all cool now. That rules.   It's also immensely funny to me that Lore Reasons require we check back in with Sengoku just long enough for him to admit the marines didn't do jack shit again. Just put him in a donut shop with a cup of joe and it'd be perfect.    That's the lesson of One Piece kids: Cops are either useless or will actively make things worse.   And that's why One Piece owns. On top of all the other cool shit we just talked about, of course. To repeat, I had a blast with Strong World, and I pledge the next time we cover one of these movies, I'll be more caught up with the manga. Turns out, I missed these losers and their large mouths.     And even as a veteran fan I really enjoyed coming back to it. This franchise is so massive and sprawling that it can be easy to get lost in the weeds, but this was a reminder that there's a lot of cool, fun stuff you can only really get with One Piece.    Now chop chop (fruit) on that reading, Steve. I expect you to be at Water Seven by this time next week.   Aye aye, Captain!

This Week in Anime Is Strong World Peak One Piece?  by Nicholas Dupree & Steve Jones, Apr 14th 2022           Suffering from One Piece withdrawal while the anime series is on hiatus? Netflix added One Piece Film Strong World to its line-up last month and it works as spectacular side story as we wait for the Wano arc to return.    This movie is streaming on Netflix   Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the participants in this chatlog are not the views of Anime News Network.Spoiler Warning for discussion of the series ahead.     @Lossthief    @mouse_inhouse    @NickyEnchilada    @vestenet      Steve  Nick, you know that evolutionary phenomenon where large island animals will, over generations, grow smaller to better adapt to their environment? Well, I just found out the same thing happens to shonen protagonists.     Nick  Oh trust me, that is nowhere near the surprising bit of evolution to happen in One Piece right now. But since you're still ages away from even knowing what ""Wano Fatigue"" means, and we're still waiting for the anime to return, we might as well visit an earlier point in the evoluffynary line.     Truth be told, I have not been keeping up with my One Piece homework since we last covered Stampede, so I ask that you be patient with me if I mix up which character is a skeleton and which character is a robot? I think? But Strong World makes an appropriately strong case for me diving back into the manga, because this movie kinda rules.   It's nostalgic for me in two senses. First, it was the most recent movie when I first caught up with One Piece. Which was only a scant..uh...13 years ago. And it's also the first time in years I've seen these characters in their pre-time skip forms.    By which I mean that Stoner Brooke is a thing of beauty.   My eyes were feasting on all of the fashion choices in that scene. Sanji's just wearing a loose tie over a sweater. Chopper looks like he was forced to wear that onesie on a dare. Luffy's working that cool-casual scarf. And I don't know what Usopp is thinking, but that's par for the course.         There's...a lot to say about the clothes in this movie. Like the fact Sanji's idea of adventuring clothes is this rhinestone cowboy getup.    Also I forgot how far along you were in the manga, but I assume the afro skeleton and Ace Ventura: Tech Detective are new to you?   Correct. I mean, I know the gist to them thanks to weeb osmosis, but the most recent main crewmember I'm intimately familiar with is Nico Robin.   Well, you're not gonna get a lot from any one of them in this movie, but you'll at least get to see more of the Straw Hats than in Stampede! That one was stuffed to bursting with the massively extended cast of this franchise, while Strong World is just filled with fucked up animals.     And honestly I don't need a whole lot more in a movie than that. The conceit of the film is that it takes place on a series of floating islands where evolution has been artificially accelerated in order to produce weaponized megafauna. And the creature designers apparently took this as their cue to go off and use every part of the buffalo, so to speak,—and then they attached those buffalo parts to other random animals. So we've got everything from giant land octopods to literal army ants to electric duck-peacocks to blue sabertooths. It's pure Looney Tunes.         It's great. Some of my fondest moments of early One Piece were just the spreads of weird animals Oda could come up with, and this scratches that itch 50 times in its first act alone. Just freaky, bloodthirsty beasts as far as the eye can see.     It's also just delightfully cartoonish, even in its carnage. Like, I love the denouement to that fish getting shredded.    He just like me fr   I'd forgotten just how many bone puns Brook packs into this thing.     A veritable skele-TON of them!     Yohoho~ Skull joke.   I regret that.   Don't be. That's just how this movie is. I mean they introduce our big villain via a dance number alongside a clown and a gorilla dressed like The New Radicals.     Rarely do I sympathize with fictional characters as much as I sympathized with Nami in this exact moment. Getting kidnapped is one thing, but getting kidnapped by clowns? That stings the soul.     It's even funnier if you know the larger lore around Shiki here. In the (vague movie-centric) canon he's a former rival of Gold Roger, the most legendary and central figure in the series' history. And here he is with sword legs dancing with a clown who makes fart sounds when he walks.   God, Kung Pow: Enter the Fist has the same exact joke, and it's just as good here. Exquisitely dumb comedy done for zero purpose. You love to see it.      It's also a great way to make Shiki look goofy right before we remember he's an extremely dangerous bastard and your local weather guy's worst nightmare.     Yeah! The film opens with this metal-as-hell backstory about him breaking out of prison, and then it keeps flipping back and forth between him workshopping manzai routines and him plotting a big ol' genocide. But it all feels congruous within the context of One Piece's overall loudness, which is a quality Strong World smartly emphasizes start to finish.   It also gives me something that has been in short supply during the recent years of the manga: the Straw Hats hanging out together and being total idiots.      That particular bit got me good. Like, speaking as someone a few several hundred chapters behind on One Piece, I thought it was completely reasonable to expect that Chopper, at some point, had received the ability to take off his fur. Wouldn't be the weirdest power I've seen in this series.   To be honest I think even Chopper forgets what his powers are half the time. Also I'm glad your introduction to Franky includes his ability to retrofit animals into automobiles. It's genuinely one of the best things ever.      Oh is that a recurring bit? I figured it just happened here because of the giant animal thing. And ""Crawley Davidson"" is chef's kiss brilliant.     I won't give away too much. You deserve to find out on your own. The point is, the Straw Hats are the stars of this thing, and it's super refreshing when most of them were sidelined in Stampede. Though some habits have never gone away, like the very necessary introductory scene of Nami at the pool.     Yeah, obviously I haven't gotten to the part in the manga where her proportions go completely off the deep end, but Strong World was sure to remind me of what's in store.     Thing is I actually like most of Nami's material in the movie. Despite the inciting incident being her getting kidnapped by Shiki, she's active through nearly the whole thing and is central to the emotional core. But also boy they like showing off her butt.     Do they ever. But you're right, she is also the film's emotional center, and she really carries the moodiest scene in particular. It's one of the few times Strong World takes itself entirely seriously, and despite all odds, it makes it work with intimate framing and strong character acting.         That's the magic of One Piece, baby. At its best you can slingshot from wacky cartoon hijinks to deathly serious stakes, then back again and it all lands perfectly. I also love the way they use lighting in that sequence. Whole thing starts off just before sunset and Shiki's power eventually blots out the sun entirely as he dominates the crew.      It's so good! And then a couple minutes later the movie tells you to get stickbugged. Multitudes!      Haha look at that goofy thing! A minute later it's destroying a village of bird people. One Piece!     Oh yeah, here's another great microcosm of that: Luffy tenderly reassures the adorable innocent villagers of their humanity, and immediately follows it up with a promise to clobber the crap out of Shiki. That's my guy.         The ultimate narrative of basically every One Piece story is simple: Inform Luffy who he needs to punch and get him within punching distance. This one just adds a little flair by getting everyone dripped out beforehand.     Earlier in the film, I had jokingly questioned why Shiki had instituted a dress code for his big evil pirate gathering, but then I saw the light. It was all for the eventual Straw Hat swag. I'm sorry I ever doubted you, One Piece.     One of the joys of One Piece movies is getting to see new outfits. Just look at this one for the new Red film. I love it.     That's absolutely adorable. He looks like a nephew on Halloween.   As a rule, Robin always has the best look, of course.      Impossible to argue with Nico Robin With a Gun. Nor would I want to. Luffy's badass mobster look here is very good too. Especially with the incongruous straw hat complement.     It's just great all around, and they really do lean into it feeling like a crime movie in the third act. You've got Shiki and his yakuza-style sake cup ceremony. The sliding doors revealing hundreds of guards in the rooms on either side of the main hall. And in the middle of it there's this guy.     You can even hear the music briefly riff on the Matrix soundtrack when they shoot up the place to their absurd degree. And then Usopp and Chopper run off to roleplay Elden Ring while everyone else is doing their own thing. It's an embarrassment of riches.    There's a snowboarding ape with nunchaku and it barely even registers among the chaos. That's the kind of third act we get.     Robin even fights Mothra for a hot second. It's great.     I like the part where Zoro stabs a clown so hard that he explodes.      Gotta love that Zoro's power up is just ""what if there were three of me?"" and he somehow makes that happen. 15 years later and I still don't know how that works, nor do I care to ask. Through probably my favorite goofy thing is when Nami does the stereotypical action movie thing and rips her fancy dress so she can run more easily. Except she never runs anywhere. Apparently she just can't navigate if her thighs are too covered up.     Come on, Nick, everyone knows that the zettai ryouiki is the part of your anatomy most sensitive to fluctuations in barometric pressure.   You joke but I wouldn't be surprised if somewhere in the One Piece universe there's somebody who can predict weather with their garter belt.   I'm not putting anything leg-related past Oda considering the climax of the film is Luffy crushing Shiki under his inflated electrified foot.         I love it. I love Gear Three so much. It's the best power Oda ever came up with (one extremely recent addition notwithstanding) and I love how it's just Luffy turning into the Anchor Arms episode from Spongebob.     I saw something recently about how you can tie pretty much all shonen action stories back to Popeye, and if I didn't believe that before, I sure do now.   Replace devil fruits with spinach and not much would actually change about One Piece. Though unlike the sailor man, Luffy doesn't skip leg day:     Just the one leg tho   Also if I have one nitpick of this movie, it's a little fucked up how they only think about the consequences of defeating the guy whose power is keeping all these islands in the sky AFTER they crack him in half. They're real lucky those villagers conveniently learned to fly with their vestigial arm wings just in time.      To be fair, I don't think anyone in the film, outside Nami, thinks about any consequences of anything. As cheesy as the ending is, though, what makes it for me is the montage of the enormous mutant animals all smiling and living together in harmony. We definitely saw a lot of those die, but it's all cool now. That rules.   It's also immensely funny to me that Lore Reasons require we check back in with Sengoku just long enough for him to admit the marines didn't do jack shit again. Just put him in a donut shop with a cup of joe and it'd be perfect.    That's the lesson of One Piece kids: Cops are either useless or will actively make things worse.   And that's why One Piece owns. On top of all the other cool shit we just talked about, of course. To repeat, I had a blast with Strong World, and I pledge the next time we cover one of these movies, I'll be more caught up with the manga. Turns out, I missed these losers and their large mouths.     And even as a veteran fan I really enjoyed coming back to it. This franchise is so massive and sprawling that it can be easy to get lost in the weeds, but this was a reminder that there's a lot of cool, fun stuff you can only really get with One Piece.    Now chop chop (fruit) on that reading, Steve. I expect you to be at Water Seven by this time next week.   Aye aye, Captain!

This Week in Anime Is Strong World Peak One Piece?  by Nicholas Dupree & Steve Jones, Apr 14th 2022           Suffering from One Piece withdrawal while the anime series is on hiatus? Netflix added One Piece Film Strong World to its line-up last month and it works as spectacular side story as we wait for the Wano arc to return.    This movie is streaming on Netflix   Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the participants in this chatlog are not the views of Anime News Network.Spoiler Warning for discussion of the series ahead.     @Lossthief    @mouse_inhouse    @NickyEnchilada    @vestenet      Steve  Nick, you know that evolutionary phenomenon where large island animals will, over generations, grow smaller to better adapt to their environment? Well, I just found out the same thing happens to shonen protagonists.     Nick  Oh trust me, that is nowhere near the surprising bit of evolution to happen in One Piece right now. But since you're still ages away from even knowing what ""Wano Fatigue"" means, and we're still waiting for the anime to return, we might as well visit an earlier point in the evoluffynary line.     Truth be told, I have not been keeping up with my One Piece homework since we last covered Stampede, so I ask that you be patient with me if I mix up which character is a skeleton and which character is a robot? I think? But Strong World makes an appropriately strong case for me diving back into the manga, because this movie kinda rules.   It's nostalgic for me in two senses. First, it was the most recent movie when I first caught up with One Piece. Which was only a scant..uh...13 years ago. And it's also the first time in years I've seen these characters in their pre-time skip forms.    By which I mean that Stoner Brooke is a thing of beauty.   My eyes were feasting on all of the fashion choices in that scene. Sanji's just wearing a loose tie over a sweater. Chopper looks like he was forced to wear that onesie on a dare. Luffy's working that cool-casual scarf. And I don't know what Usopp is thinking, but that's par for the course.         There's...a lot to say about the clothes in this movie. Like the fact Sanji's idea of adventuring clothes is this rhinestone cowboy getup.    Also I forgot how far along you were in the manga, but I assume the afro skeleton and Ace Ventura: Tech Detective are new to you?   Correct. I mean, I know the gist to them thanks to weeb osmosis, but the most recent main crewmember I'm intimately familiar with is Nico Robin.   Well, you're not gonna get a lot from any one of them in this movie, but you'll at least get to see more of the Straw Hats than in Stampede! That one was stuffed to bursting with the massively extended cast of this franchise, while Strong World is just filled with fucked up animals.     And honestly I don't need a whole lot more in a movie than that. The conceit of the film is that it takes place on a series of floating islands where evolution has been artificially accelerated in order to produce weaponized megafauna. And the creature designers apparently took this as their cue to go off and use every part of the buffalo, so to speak,—and then they attached those buffalo parts to other random animals. So we've got everything from giant land octopods to literal army ants to electric duck-peacocks to blue sabertooths. It's pure Looney Tunes.         It's great. Some of my fondest moments of early One Piece were just the spreads of weird animals Oda could come up with, and this scratches that itch 50 times in its first act alone. Just freaky, bloodthirsty beasts as far as the eye can see.     It's also just delightfully cartoonish, even in its carnage. Like, I love the denouement to that fish getting shredded.    He just like me fr   I'd forgotten just how many bone puns Brook packs into this thing.     A veritable skele-TON of them!     Yohoho~ Skull joke.   I regret that.   Don't be. That's just how this movie is. I mean they introduce our big villain via a dance number alongside a clown and a gorilla dressed like The New Radicals.     Rarely do I sympathize with fictional characters as much as I sympathized with Nami in this exact moment. Getting kidnapped is one thing, but getting kidnapped by clowns? That stings the soul.     It's even funnier if you know the larger lore around Shiki here. In the (vague movie-centric) canon he's a former rival of Gold Roger, the most legendary and central figure in the series' history. And here he is with sword legs dancing with a clown who makes fart sounds when he walks.   God, Kung Pow: Enter the Fist has the same exact joke, and it's just as good here. Exquisitely dumb comedy done for zero purpose. You love to see it.      It's also a great way to make Shiki look goofy right before we remember he's an extremely dangerous bastard and your local weather guy's worst nightmare.     Yeah! The film opens with this metal-as-hell backstory about him breaking out of prison, and then it keeps flipping back and forth between him workshopping manzai routines and him plotting a big ol' genocide. But it all feels congruous within the context of One Piece's overall loudness, which is a quality Strong World smartly emphasizes start to finish.   It also gives me something that has been in short supply during the recent years of the manga: the Straw Hats hanging out together and being total idiots.      That particular bit got me good. Like, speaking as someone a few several hundred chapters behind on One Piece, I thought it was completely reasonable to expect that Chopper, at some point, had received the ability to take off his fur. Wouldn't be the weirdest power I've seen in this series.   To be honest I think even Chopper forgets what his powers are half the time. Also I'm glad your introduction to Franky includes his ability to retrofit animals into automobiles. It's genuinely one of the best things ever.      Oh is that a recurring bit? I figured it just happened here because of the giant animal thing. And ""Crawley Davidson"" is chef's kiss brilliant.     I won't give away too much. You deserve to find out on your own. The point is, the Straw Hats are the stars of this thing, and it's super refreshing when most of them were sidelined in Stampede. Though some habits have never gone away, like the very necessary introductory scene of Nami at the pool.     Yeah, obviously I haven't gotten to the part in the manga where her proportions go completely off the deep end, but Strong World was sure to remind me of what's in store.     Thing is I actually like most of Nami's material in the movie. Despite the inciting incident being her getting kidnapped by Shiki, she's active through nearly the whole thing and is central to the emotional core. But also boy they like showing off her butt.     Do they ever. But you're right, she is also the film's emotional center, and she really carries the moodiest scene in particular. It's one of the few times Strong World takes itself entirely seriously, and despite all odds, it makes it work with intimate framing and strong character acting.         That's the magic of One Piece, baby. At its best you can slingshot from wacky cartoon hijinks to deathly serious stakes, then back again and it all lands perfectly. I also love the way they use lighting in that sequence. Whole thing starts off just before sunset and Shiki's power eventually blots out the sun entirely as he dominates the crew.      It's so good! And then a couple minutes later the movie tells you to get stickbugged. Multitudes!      Haha look at that goofy thing! A minute later it's destroying a village of bird people. One Piece!     Oh yeah, here's another great microcosm of that: Luffy tenderly reassures the adorable innocent villagers of their humanity, and immediately follows it up with a promise to clobber the crap out of Shiki. That's my guy.         The ultimate narrative of basically every One Piece story is simple: Inform Luffy who he needs to punch and get him within punching distance. This one just adds a little flair by getting everyone dripped out beforehand.     Earlier in the film, I had jokingly questioned why Shiki had instituted a dress code for his big evil pirate gathering, but then I saw the light. It was all for the eventual Straw Hat swag. I'm sorry I ever doubted you, One Piece.     One of the joys of One Piece movies is getting to see new outfits. Just look at this one for the new Red film. I love it.     That's absolutely adorable. He looks like a nephew on Halloween.   As a rule, Robin always has the best look, of course.      Impossible to argue with Nico Robin With a Gun. Nor would I want to. Luffy's badass mobster look here is very good too. Especially with the incongruous straw hat complement.     It's just great all around, and they really do lean into it feeling like a crime movie in the third act. You've got Shiki and his yakuza-style sake cup ceremony. The sliding doors revealing hundreds of guards in the rooms on either side of the main hall. And in the middle of it there's this guy.     You can even hear the music briefly riff on the Matrix soundtrack when they shoot up the place to their absurd degree. And then Usopp and Chopper run off to roleplay Elden Ring while everyone else is doing their own thing. It's an embarrassment of riches.    There's a snowboarding ape with nunchaku and it barely even registers among the chaos. That's the kind of third act we get.     Robin even fights Mothra for a hot second. It's great.     I like the part where Zoro stabs a clown so hard that he explodes.      Gotta love that Zoro's power up is just ""what if there were three of me?"" and he somehow makes that happen. 15 years later and I still don't know how that works, nor do I care to ask. Through probably my favorite goofy thing is when Nami does the stereotypical action movie thing and rips her fancy dress so she can run more easily. Except she never runs anywhere. Apparently she just can't navigate if her thighs are too covered up.     Come on, Nick, everyone knows that the zettai ryouiki is the part of your anatomy most sensitive to fluctuations in barometric pressure.   You joke but I wouldn't be surprised if somewhere in the One Piece universe there's somebody who can predict weather with their garter belt.   I'm not putting anything leg-related past Oda considering the climax of the film is Luffy crushing Shiki under his inflated electrified foot.         I love it. I love Gear Three so much. It's the best power Oda ever came up with (one extremely recent addition notwithstanding) and I love how it's just Luffy turning into the Anchor Arms episode from Spongebob.     I saw something recently about how you can tie pretty much all shonen action stories back to Popeye, and if I didn't believe that before, I sure do now.   Replace devil fruits with spinach and not much would actually change about One Piece. Though unlike the sailor man, Luffy doesn't skip leg day:     Just the one leg tho   Also if I have one nitpick of this movie, it's a little fucked up how they only think about the consequences of defeating the guy whose power is keeping all these islands in the sky AFTER they crack him in half. They're real lucky those villagers conveniently learned to fly with their vestigial arm wings just in time.      To be fair, I don't think anyone in the film, outside Nami, thinks about any consequences of anything. As cheesy as the ending is, though, what makes it for me is the montage of the enormous mutant animals all smiling and living together in harmony. We definitely saw a lot of those die, but it's all cool now. That rules.   It's also immensely funny to me that Lore Reasons require we check back in with Sengoku just long enough for him to admit the marines didn't do jack shit again. Just put him in a donut shop with a cup of joe and it'd be perfect.    That's the lesson of One Piece kids: Cops are either useless or will actively make things worse.   And that's why One Piece owns. On top of all the other cool shit we just talked about, of course. To repeat, I had a blast with Strong World, and I pledge the next time we cover one of these movies, I'll be more caught up with the manga. Turns out, I missed these losers and their large mouths.     And even as a veteran fan I really enjoyed coming back to it. This franchise is so massive and sprawling that it can be easy to get lost in the weeds, but this was a reminder that there's a lot of cool, fun stuff you can only really get with One Piece.

Truth be told, I have not been keeping up with my One Piece homework since we last covered Stampede, so I ask that you be patient with me if I mix up which character is a skeleton and which character is a robot? I think? But Strong World makes an appropriately strong case for me diving back into the manga, because this movie kinda rules.   It's nostalgic for me in two senses. First, it was the most recent movie when I first caught up with One Piece. Which was only a scant..uh...13 years ago. And it's also the first time in years I've seen these characters in their pre-time skip forms.    By which I mean that Stoner Brooke is a thing of beauty.   My eyes were feasting on all of the fashion choices in that scene. Sanji's just wearing a loose tie over a sweater. Chopper looks like he was forced to wear that onesie on a dare. Luffy's working that cool-casual scarf. And I don't know what Usopp is thinking, but that's par for the course.         There's...a lot to say about the clothes in this movie. Like the fact Sanji's idea of adventuring clothes is this rhinestone cowboy getup.    Also I forgot how far along you were in the manga, but I assume the afro skeleton and Ace Ventura: Tech Detective are new to you?   Correct. I mean, I know the gist to them thanks to weeb osmosis, but the most recent main crewmember I'm intimately familiar with is Nico Robin.   Well, you're not gonna get a lot from any one of them in this movie, but you'll at least get to see more of the Straw Hats than in Stampede! That one was stuffed to bursting with the massively extended cast of this franchise, while Strong World is just filled with fucked up animals.     And honestly I don't need a whole lot more in a movie than that. The conceit of the film is that it takes place on a series of floating islands where evolution has been artificially accelerated in order to produce weaponized megafauna. And the creature designers apparently took this as their cue to go off and use every part of the buffalo, so to speak,—and then they attached those buffalo parts to other random animals. So we've got everything from giant land octopods to literal army ants to electric duck-peacocks to blue sabertooths. It's pure Looney Tunes.         It's great. Some of my fondest moments of early One Piece were just the spreads of weird animals Oda could come up with, and this scratches that itch 50 times in its first act alone. Just freaky, bloodthirsty beasts as far as the eye can see.     It's also just delightfully cartoonish, even in its carnage. Like, I love the denouement to that fish getting shredded.    He just like me fr   I'd forgotten just how many bone puns Brook packs into this thing.     A veritable skele-TON of them!     Yohoho~ Skull joke.   I regret that.   Don't be. That's just how this movie is. I mean they introduce our big villain via a dance number alongside a clown and a gorilla dressed like The New Radicals.     Rarely do I sympathize with fictional characters as much as I sympathized with Nami in this exact moment. Getting kidnapped is one thing, but getting kidnapped by clowns? That stings the soul.     It's even funnier if you know the larger lore around Shiki here. In the (vague movie-centric) canon he's a former rival of Gold Roger, the most legendary and central figure in the series' history. And here he is with sword legs dancing with a clown who makes fart sounds when he walks.   God, Kung Pow: Enter the Fist has the same exact joke, and it's just as good here. Exquisitely dumb comedy done for zero purpose. You love to see it.      It's also a great way to make Shiki look goofy right before we remember he's an extremely dangerous bastard and your local weather guy's worst nightmare.     Yeah! The film opens with this metal-as-hell backstory about him breaking out of prison, and then it keeps flipping back and forth between him workshopping manzai routines and him plotting a big ol' genocide. But it all feels congruous within the context of One Piece's overall loudness, which is a quality Strong World smartly emphasizes start to finish.   It also gives me something that has been in short supply during the recent years of the manga: the Straw Hats hanging out together and being total idiots.      That particular bit got me good. Like, speaking as someone a few several hundred chapters behind on One Piece, I thought it was completely reasonable to expect that Chopper, at some point, had received the ability to take off his fur. Wouldn't be the weirdest power I've seen in this series.   To be honest I think even Chopper forgets what his powers are half the time. Also I'm glad your introduction to Franky includes his ability to retrofit animals into automobiles. It's genuinely one of the best things ever.      Oh is that a recurring bit? I figured it just happened here because of the giant animal thing. And ""Crawley Davidson"" is chef's kiss brilliant.     I won't give away too much. You deserve to find out on your own. The point is, the Straw Hats are the stars of this thing, and it's super refreshing when most of them were sidelined in Stampede. Though some habits have never gone away, like the very necessary introductory scene of Nami at the pool.     Yeah, obviously I haven't gotten to the part in the manga where her proportions go completely off the deep end, but Strong World was sure to remind me of what's in store.     Thing is I actually like most of Nami's material in the movie. Despite the inciting incident being her getting kidnapped by Shiki, she's active through nearly the whole thing and is central to the emotional core. But also boy they like showing off her butt.     Do they ever. But you're right, she is also the film's emotional center, and she really carries the moodiest scene in particular. It's one of the few times Strong World takes itself entirely seriously, and despite all odds, it makes it work with intimate framing and strong character acting.         That's the magic of One Piece, baby. At its best you can slingshot from wacky cartoon hijinks to deathly serious stakes, then back again and it all lands perfectly. I also love the way they use lighting in that sequence. Whole thing starts off just before sunset and Shiki's power eventually blots out the sun entirely as he dominates the crew.      It's so good! And then a couple minutes later the movie tells you to get stickbugged. Multitudes!      Haha look at that goofy thing! A minute later it's destroying a village of bird people. One Piece!     Oh yeah, here's another great microcosm of that: Luffy tenderly reassures the adorable innocent villagers of their humanity, and immediately follows it up with a promise to clobber the crap out of Shiki. That's my guy.         The ultimate narrative of basically every One Piece story is simple: Inform Luffy who he needs to punch and get him within punching distance. This one just adds a little flair by getting everyone dripped out beforehand.     Earlier in the film, I had jokingly questioned why Shiki had instituted a dress code for his big evil pirate gathering, but then I saw the light. It was all for the eventual Straw Hat swag. I'm sorry I ever doubted you, One Piece.     One of the joys of One Piece movies is getting to see new outfits. Just look at this one for the new Red film. I love it.     That's absolutely adorable. He looks like a nephew on Halloween.   As a rule, Robin always has the best look, of course.      Impossible to argue with Nico Robin With a Gun. Nor would I want to. Luffy's badass mobster look here is very good too. Especially with the incongruous straw hat complement.     It's just great all around, and they really do lean into it feeling like a crime movie in the third act. You've got Shiki and his yakuza-style sake cup ceremony. The sliding doors revealing hundreds of guards in the rooms on either side of the main hall. And in the middle of it there's this guy.     You can even hear the music briefly riff on the Matrix soundtrack when they shoot up the place to their absurd degree. And then Usopp and Chopper run off to roleplay Elden Ring while everyone else is doing their own thing. It's an embarrassment of riches.    There's a snowboarding ape with nunchaku and it barely even registers among the chaos. That's the kind of third act we get.     Robin even fights Mothra for a hot second. It's great.     I like the part where Zoro stabs a clown so hard that he explodes.      Gotta love that Zoro's power up is just ""what if there were three of me?"" and he somehow makes that happen. 15 years later and I still don't know how that works, nor do I care to ask. Through probably my favorite goofy thing is when Nami does the stereotypical action movie thing and rips her fancy dress so she can run more easily. Except she never runs anywhere. Apparently she just can't navigate if her thighs are too covered up.     Come on, Nick, everyone knows that the zettai ryouiki is the part of your anatomy most sensitive to fluctuations in barometric pressure.   You joke but I wouldn't be surprised if somewhere in the One Piece universe there's somebody who can predict weather with their garter belt.   I'm not putting anything leg-related past Oda considering the climax of the film is Luffy crushing Shiki under his inflated electrified foot.         I love it. I love Gear Three so much. It's the best power Oda ever came up with (one extremely recent addition notwithstanding) and I love how it's just Luffy turning into the Anchor Arms episode from Spongebob.     I saw something recently about how you can tie pretty much all shonen action stories back to Popeye, and if I didn't believe that before, I sure do now.   Replace devil fruits with spinach and not much would actually change about One Piece. Though unlike the sailor man, Luffy doesn't skip leg day:     Just the one leg tho   Also if I have one nitpick of this movie, it's a little fucked up how they only think about the consequences of defeating the guy whose power is keeping all these islands in the sky AFTER they crack him in half. They're real lucky those villagers conveniently learned to fly with their vestigial arm wings just in time.      To be fair, I don't think anyone in the film, outside Nami, thinks about any consequences of anything. As cheesy as the ending is, though, what makes it for me is the montage of the enormous mutant animals all smiling and living together in harmony. We definitely saw a lot of those die, but it's all cool now. That rules.   It's also immensely funny to me that Lore Reasons require we check back in with Sengoku just long enough for him to admit the marines didn't do jack shit again. Just put him in a donut shop with a cup of joe and it'd be perfect.    That's the lesson of One Piece kids: Cops are either useless or will actively make things worse.   And that's why One Piece owns. On top of all the other cool shit we just talked about, of course. To repeat, I had a blast with Strong World, and I pledge the next time we cover one of these movies, I'll be more caught up with the manga. Turns out, I missed these losers and their large mouths.     And even as a veteran fan I really enjoyed coming back to it. This franchise is so massive and sprawling that it can be easy to get lost in the weeds, but this was a reminder that there's a lot of cool, fun stuff you can only really get with One Piece.

Well, I just found out the same thing happens to shonen protagonists.     Nick  Oh trust me, that is nowhere near the surprising bit of evolution to happen in One Piece right now. But since you're still ages away from even knowing what ""Wano Fatigue"" means, and we're still waiting for the anime to return, we might as well visit an earlier point in the evoluffynary line.     Truth be told, I have not been keeping up with my One Piece homework since we last covered Stampede, so I ask that you be patient with me if I mix up which character is a skeleton and which character is a robot? I think? But Strong World makes an appropriately strong case for me diving back into the manga, because this movie kinda rules.   It's nostalgic for me in two senses. First, it was the most recent movie when I first caught up with One Piece. Which was only a scant..uh...13 years ago. And it's also the first time in years I've seen these characters in their pre-time skip forms.    By which I mean that Stoner Brooke is a thing of beauty.   My eyes were feasting on all of the fashion choices in that scene. Sanji's just wearing a loose tie over a sweater. Chopper looks like he was forced to wear that onesie on a dare. Luffy's working that cool-casual scarf. And I don't know what Usopp is thinking, but that's par for the course.         There's...a lot to say about the clothes in this movie. Like the fact Sanji's idea of adventuring clothes is this rhinestone cowboy getup.    Also I forgot how far along you were in the manga, but I assume the afro skeleton and Ace Ventura: Tech Detective are new to you?   Correct. I mean, I know the gist to them thanks to weeb osmosis, but the most recent main crewmember I'm intimately familiar with is Nico Robin.   Well, you're not gonna get a lot from any one of them in this movie, but you'll at least get to see more of the Straw Hats than in Stampede! That one was stuffed to bursting with the massively extended cast of this franchise, while Strong World is just filled with fucked up animals.     And honestly I don't need a whole lot more in a movie than that. The conceit of the film is that it takes place on a series of floating islands where evolution has been artificially accelerated in order to produce weaponized megafauna. And the creature designers apparently took this as their cue to go off and use every part of the buffalo, so to speak,—and then they attached those buffalo parts to other random animals. So we've got everything from giant land octopods to literal army ants to electric duck-peacocks to blue sabertooths. It's pure Looney Tunes.         It's great. Some of my fondest moments of early One Piece were just the spreads of weird animals Oda could come up with, and this scratches that itch 50 times in its first act alone. Just freaky, bloodthirsty beasts as far as the eye can see.     It's also just delightfully cartoonish, even in its carnage. Like, I love the denouement to that fish getting shredded.

That's just how this movie is. I mean they introduce our big villain via a dance number alongside a clown and a gorilla dressed like The New Radicals.     Rarely do I sympathize with fictional characters as much as I sympathized with Nami in this exact moment. Getting kidnapped is one thing, but getting kidnapped by clowns? That stings the soul.     It's even funnier if you know the larger lore around Shiki here. In the (vague movie-centric) canon he's a former rival of Gold Roger, the most legendary and central figure in the series' history. And here he is with sword legs dancing with a clown who makes fart sounds when he walks.   God, Kung Pow: Enter the Fist has the same exact joke, and it's just as good here. Exquisitely dumb comedy done for zero purpose. You love to see it.      It's also a great way to make Shiki look goofy right before we remember he's an extremely dangerous bastard and your local weather guy's worst nightmare.     Yeah! The film opens with this metal-as-hell backstory about him breaking out of prison, and then it keeps flipping back and forth between him workshopping manzai routines and him plotting a big ol' genocide. But it all feels congruous within the context of One Piece's overall loudness, which is a quality Strong World smartly emphasizes start to finish.   It also gives me something that has been in short supply during the recent years of the manga: the Straw Hats hanging out together and being total idiots.      That particular bit got me good. Like, speaking as someone a few several hundred chapters behind on One Piece, I thought it was completely reasonable to expect that Chopper, at some point, had received the ability to take off his fur. Wouldn't be the weirdest power I've seen in this series.   To be honest I think even Chopper forgets what his powers are half the time. Also I'm glad your introduction to Franky includes his ability to retrofit animals into automobiles. It's genuinely one of the best things ever.      Oh is that a recurring bit? I figured it just happened here because of the giant animal thing. And ""Crawley Davidson"" is chef's kiss brilliant.     I won't give away too much. You deserve to find out on your own.

It's one of the few times Strong World takes itself entirely seriously, and despite all odds, it makes it work with intimate framing and strong character acting.         That's the magic of One Piece, baby. At its best you can slingshot from wacky cartoon hijinks to deathly serious stakes, then back again and it all lands perfectly. I also love the way they use lighting in that sequence. Whole thing starts off just before sunset and Shiki's power eventually blots out the sun entirely as he dominates the crew.      It's so good! And then a couple minutes later the movie tells you to get stickbugged. Multitudes!      Haha look at that goofy thing! A minute later it's destroying a village of bird people. One Piece!     Oh yeah, here's another great microcosm of that: Luffy tenderly reassures the adorable innocent villagers of their humanity, and immediately follows it up with a promise to clobber the crap out of Shiki. That's my guy.         The ultimate narrative of basically every One Piece story is simple: Inform Luffy who he needs to punch and get him within punching distance. This one just adds a little flair by getting everyone dripped out beforehand.     Earlier in the film, I had jokingly questioned why Shiki had instituted a dress code for his big evil pirate gathering, but then I saw the light. It was all for the eventual Straw Hat swag. I'm sorry I ever doubted you, One Piece.     One of the joys of One Piece movies is getting to see new outfits. Just look at this one for the new Red film. I love it.     That's absolutely adorable. He looks like a nephew on Halloween.   As a rule, Robin always has the best look, of course.      Impossible to argue with Nico Robin With a Gun. Nor would I want to. Luffy's badass mobster look here is very good too. Especially with the incongruous straw hat complement.     It's just great all around, and they really do lean into it feeling like a crime movie in the third act. You've got Shiki and his yakuza-style sake cup ceremony. The sliding doors revealing hundreds of guards in the rooms on either side of the main hall. And in the middle of it there's this guy.     You can even hear the music briefly riff on the Matrix soundtrack when they shoot up the place to their absurd degree. And then Usopp and Chopper run off to roleplay Elden Ring while everyone else is doing their own thing. It's an embarrassment of riches.    There's a snowboarding ape with nunchaku and it barely even registers among the chaos. That's the kind of third act we get.     Robin even fights Mothra for a hot second. It's great.     I like the part where Zoro stabs a clown so hard that he explodes.      Gotta love that Zoro's power up is just ""what if there were three of me?"" and he somehow makes that happen. 15 years later and I still don't know how that works, nor do I care to ask. Through probably my favorite goofy thing is when Nami does the stereotypical action movie thing and rips her fancy dress so she can run more easily. Except she never runs anywhere. Apparently she just can't navigate if her thighs are too covered up.     Come on, Nick, everyone knows that the zettai ryouiki is the part of your anatomy most sensitive to fluctuations in barometric pressure.   You joke but I wouldn't be surprised if somewhere in the One Piece universe there's somebody who can predict weather with their garter belt.   I'm not putting anything leg-related past Oda considering the climax of the film is Luffy crushing Shiki under his inflated electrified foot.         I love it. I love Gear Three so much. It's the best power Oda ever came up with (one extremely recent addition notwithstanding) and I love how it's just Luffy turning into the Anchor Arms episode from Spongebob.     I saw something recently about how you can tie pretty much all shonen action stories back to Popeye, and if I didn't believe that before, I sure do now.   Replace devil fruits with spinach and not much would actually change about One Piece. Though unlike the sailor man, Luffy doesn't skip leg day:     Just the one leg tho   Also if I have one nitpick of this movie, it's a little fucked up how they only think about the consequences of defeating the guy whose power is keeping all these islands in the sky AFTER they crack him in half. They're real lucky those villagers conveniently learned to fly with their vestigial arm wings just in time.      To be fair, I don't think anyone in the film, outside Nami, thinks about any consequences of anything. As cheesy as the ending is, though, what makes it for me is the montage of the enormous mutant animals all smiling and living together in harmony. We definitely saw a lot of those die, but it's all cool now. That rules.   It's also immensely funny to me that Lore Reasons require we check back in with Sengoku just long enough for him to admit the marines didn't do jack shit again. Just put him in a donut shop with a cup of joe and it'd be perfect.    That's the lesson of One Piece kids: Cops are either useless or will actively make things worse.   And that's why One Piece owns. On top of all the other cool shit we just talked about, of course. To repeat, I had a blast with Strong World, and I pledge the next time we cover one of these movies, I'll be more caught up with the manga. Turns out, I missed these losers and their large mouths.     And even as a veteran fan I really enjoyed coming back to it. This franchise is so massive and sprawling that it can be easy to get lost in the weeds, but this was a reminder that there's a lot of cool, fun stuff you can only really get with One Piece.    Now chop chop (fruit) on that reading, Steve. I expect you to be at Water Seven by this time next week.   Aye aye, Captain!

This Week in Anime Is Strong World Peak One Piece?  by Nicholas Dupree & Steve Jones, Apr 14th 2022           Suffering from One Piece withdrawal while the anime series is on hiatus? Netflix added One Piece Film Strong World to its line-up last month and it works as spectacular side story as we wait for the Wano arc to return.    This movie is streaming on Netflix   Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the participants in this chatlog are not the views of Anime News Network.Spoiler Warning for discussion of the series ahead.     @Lossthief    @mouse_inhouse    @NickyEnchilada    @vestenet      Steve  Nick, you know that evolutionary phenomenon where large island animals will, over generations, grow smaller to better adapt to their environment? Well, I just found out the same thing happens to shonen protagonists.     Nick  Oh trust me, that is nowhere near the surprising bit of evolution to happen in One Piece right now. But since you're still ages away from even knowing what ""Wano Fatigue"" means, and we're still waiting for the anime to return, we might as well visit an earlier point in the evoluffynary line.     Truth be told, I have not been keeping up with my One Piece homework since we last covered Stampede, so I ask that you be patient with me if I mix up which character is a skeleton and which character is a robot? I think? But Strong World makes an appropriately strong case for me diving back into the manga, because this movie kinda rules.   It's nostalgic for me in two senses. First, it was the most recent movie when I first caught up with One Piece. Which was only a scant..uh...13 years ago. And it's also the first time in years I've seen these characters in their pre-time skip forms.    By which I mean that Stoner Brooke is a thing of beauty.   My eyes were feasting on all of the fashion choices in that scene. Sanji's just wearing a loose tie over a sweater. Chopper looks like he was forced to wear that onesie on a dare. Luffy's working that cool-casual scarf. And I don't know what Usopp is thinking, but that's par for the course.         There's...a lot to say about the clothes in this movie. Like the fact Sanji's idea of adventuring clothes is this rhinestone cowboy getup.    Also I forgot how far along you were in the manga, but I assume the afro skeleton and Ace Ventura: Tech Detective are new to you?   Correct. I mean, I know the gist to them thanks to weeb osmosis, but the most recent main crewmember I'm intimately familiar with is Nico Robin.   Well, you're not gonna get a lot from any one of them in this movie, but you'll at least get to see more of the Straw Hats than in Stampede! That one was stuffed to bursting with the massively extended cast of this franchise, while Strong World is just filled with fucked up animals.     And honestly I don't need a whole lot more in a movie than that. The conceit of the film is that it takes place on a series of floating islands where evolution has been artificially accelerated in order to produce weaponized megafauna. And the creature designers apparently took this as their cue to go off and use every part of the buffalo, so to speak,—and then they attached those buffalo parts to other random animals. So we've got everything from giant land octopods to literal army ants to electric duck-peacocks to blue sabertooths. It's pure Looney Tunes.         It's great. Some of my fondest moments of early One Piece were just the spreads of weird animals Oda could come up with, and this scratches that itch 50 times in its first act alone. Just freaky, bloodthirsty beasts as far as the eye can see.     It's also just delightfully cartoonish, even in its carnage. Like, I love the denouement to that fish getting shredded.    He just like me fr   I'd forgotten just how many bone puns Brook packs into this thing.     A veritable skele-TON of them!     Yohoho~ Skull joke.   I regret that.   Don't be. That's just how this movie is. I mean they introduce our big villain via a dance number alongside a clown and a gorilla dressed like The New Radicals.     Rarely do I sympathize with fictional characters as much as I sympathized with Nami in this exact moment. Getting kidnapped is one thing, but getting kidnapped by clowns? That stings the soul.     It's even funnier if you know the larger lore around Shiki here. In the (vague movie-centric) canon he's a former rival of Gold Roger, the most legendary and central figure in the series' history. And here he is with sword legs dancing with a clown who makes fart sounds when he walks.   God, Kung Pow: Enter the Fist has the same exact joke, and it's just as good here. Exquisitely dumb comedy done for zero purpose. You love to see it.      It's also a great way to make Shiki look goofy right before we remember he's an extremely dangerous bastard and your local weather guy's worst nightmare.     Yeah! The film opens with this metal-as-hell backstory about him breaking out of prison, and then it keeps flipping back and forth between him workshopping manzai routines and him plotting a big ol' genocide. But it all feels congruous within the context of One Piece's overall loudness, which is a quality Strong World smartly emphasizes start to finish.   It also gives me something that has been in short supply during the recent years of the manga: the Straw Hats hanging out together and being total idiots.      That particular bit got me good. Like, speaking as someone a few several hundred chapters behind on One Piece, I thought it was completely reasonable to expect that Chopper, at some point, had received the ability to take off his fur. Wouldn't be the weirdest power I've seen in this series.   To be honest I think even Chopper forgets what his powers are half the time. Also I'm glad your introduction to Franky includes his ability to retrofit animals into automobiles. It's genuinely one of the best things ever.      Oh is that a recurring bit? I figured it just happened here because of the giant animal thing. And ""Crawley Davidson"" is chef's kiss brilliant.     I won't give away too much. You deserve to find out on your own. The point is, the Straw Hats are the stars of this thing, and it's super refreshing when most of them were sidelined in Stampede. Though some habits have never gone away, like the very necessary introductory scene of Nami at the pool.     Yeah, obviously I haven't gotten to the part in the manga where her proportions go completely off the deep end, but Strong World was sure to remind me of what's in store.     Thing is I actually like most of Nami's material in the movie. Despite the inciting incident being her getting kidnapped by Shiki, she's active through nearly the whole thing and is central to the emotional core. But also boy they like showing off her butt.     Do they ever. But you're right, she is also the film's emotional center, and she really carries the moodiest scene in particular.

You joke but I wouldn't be surprised if somewhere in the One Piece universe there's somebody who can predict weather with their garter belt.   I'm not putting anything leg-related past Oda considering the climax of the film is Luffy crushing Shiki under his inflated electrified foot.         I love it. I love Gear Three so much. It's the best power Oda ever came up with (one extremely recent addition notwithstanding) and I love how it's just Luffy turning into the Anchor Arms episode from Spongebob.     I saw something recently about how you can tie pretty much all shonen action stories back to Popeye, and if I didn't believe that before, I sure do now.   Replace devil fruits with spinach and not much would actually change about One Piece. Though unlike the sailor man, Luffy doesn't skip leg day:     Just the one leg tho   Also if I have one nitpick of this movie, it's a little fucked up how they only think about the consequences of defeating the guy whose power is keeping all these islands in the sky AFTER they crack him in half. They're real lucky those villagers conveniently learned to fly with their vestigial arm wings just in time.      To be fair, I don't think anyone in the film, outside Nami, thinks about any consequences of anything. As cheesy as the ending is, though, what makes it for me is the montage of the enormous mutant animals all smiling and living together in harmony. We definitely saw a lot of those die, but it's all cool now. That rules.   It's also immensely funny to me that Lore Reasons require we check back in with Sengoku just long enough for him to admit the marines didn't do jack shit again. Just put him in a donut shop with a cup of joe and it'd be perfect.    That's the lesson of One Piece kids: Cops are either useless or will actively make things worse.   And that's why One Piece owns. On top of all the other cool shit we just talked about, of course. To repeat, I had a blast with Strong World, and I pledge the next time we cover one of these movies, I'll be more caught up with the manga. Turns out, I missed these losers and their large mouths.     And even as a veteran fan I really enjoyed coming back to it. This franchise is so massive and sprawling that it can be easy to get lost in the weeds, but this was a reminder that there's a lot of cool, fun stuff you can only really get with One Piece.    Now chop chop (fruit) on that reading, Steve. I expect you to be at Water Seven by this time next week.   Aye aye, Captain!

17-04-2022,anime,2,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/this-week-in-anime/2022-04-14/.184603,Is Strong World Peak One Piece? - This Week in Anime - Anime News Network:SEA,"      This Week in Anime Is Strong World Peak One Piece?  by Nicholas Dupree & Steve Jones, Apr 14th 2022           Suffering from One Piece withdrawal while the anime series is on hiatus? Netflix added One Piece Film Strong World to its line-up last month and it works as spectacular side story as we wait for the Wano arc to return.    This movie is streaming on Netflix   Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the participants in this chatlog are not the views of Anime News Network.Spoiler Warning for discussion of the series ahead.     @Lossthief    @mouse_inhouse    @NickyEnchilada    @vestenet      Steve  Nick, you know that evolutionary phenomenon where large island animals will, over generations, grow smaller to better adapt to their environment? Well, I just found out the same thing happens to shonen protagonists.     Nick  Oh trust me, that is nowhere near the surprising bit of evolution to happen in One Piece right now. But since you're still ages away from even knowing what ""Wano Fatigue"" means, and we're still waiting for the anime to return, we might as well visit an earlier point in the evoluffynary line.     Truth be told, I have not been keeping up with my One Piece homework since we last covered Stampede, so I ask that you be patient with me if I mix up which character is a skeleton and which character is a robot? I think? But Strong World makes an appropriately strong case for me diving back into the manga, because this movie kinda rules.   It's nostalgic for me in two senses. First, it was the most recent movie when I first caught up with One Piece. Which was only a scant..uh...13 years ago. And it's also the first time in years I've seen these characters in their pre-time skip forms.    By which I mean that Stoner Brooke is a thing of beauty.   My eyes were feasting on all of the fashion choices in that scene. Sanji's just wearing a loose tie over a sweater. Chopper looks like he was forced to wear that onesie on a dare. Luffy's working that cool-casual scarf. And I don't know what Usopp is thinking, but that's par for the course.         There's...a lot to say about the clothes in this movie. Like the fact Sanji's idea of adventuring clothes is this rhinestone cowboy getup.    Also I forgot how far along you were in the manga, but I assume the afro skeleton and Ace Ventura: Tech Detective are new to you?   Correct. I mean, I know the gist to them thanks to weeb osmosis, but the most recent main crewmember I'm intimately familiar with is Nico Robin.   Well, you're not gonna get a lot from any one of them in this movie, but you'll at least get to see more of the Straw Hats than in Stampede! That one was stuffed to bursting with the massively extended cast of this franchise, while Strong World is just filled with fucked up animals.     And honestly I don't need a whole lot more in a movie than that. The conceit of the film is that it takes place on a series of floating islands where evolution has been artificially accelerated in order to produce weaponized megafauna. And the creature designers apparently took this as their cue to go off and use every part of the buffalo, so to speak,—and then they attached those buffalo parts to other random animals. So we've got everything from giant land octopods to literal army ants to electric duck-peacocks to blue sabertooths. It's pure Looney Tunes.         It's great. Some of my fondest moments of early One Piece were just the spreads of weird animals Oda could come up with, and this scratches that itch 50 times in its first act alone. Just freaky, bloodthirsty beasts as far as the eye can see.     It's also just delightfully cartoonish, even in its carnage. Like, I love the denouement to that fish getting shredded.    He just like me fr   I'd forgotten just how many bone puns Brook packs into this thing.     A veritable skele-TON of them!     Yohoho~ Skull joke.   I regret that.   Don't be. That's just how this movie is. I mean they introduce our big villain via a dance number alongside a clown and a gorilla dressed like The New Radicals.     Rarely do I sympathize with fictional characters as much as I sympathized with Nami in this exact moment. Getting kidnapped is one thing, but getting kidnapped by clowns? That stings the soul.     It's even funnier if you know the larger lore around Shiki here. In the (vague movie-centric) canon he's a former rival of Gold Roger, the most legendary and central figure in the series' history. And here he is with sword legs dancing with a clown who makes fart sounds when he walks.   God, Kung Pow: Enter the Fist has the same exact joke, and it's just as good here. Exquisitely dumb comedy done for zero purpose. You love to see it.      It's also a great way to make Shiki look goofy right before we remember he's an extremely dangerous bastard and your local weather guy's worst nightmare.     Yeah! The film opens with this metal-as-hell backstory about him breaking out of prison, and then it keeps flipping back and forth between him workshopping manzai routines and him plotting a big ol' genocide. But it all feels congruous within the context of One Piece's overall loudness, which is a quality Strong World smartly emphasizes start to finish.   It also gives me something that has been in short supply during the recent years of the manga: the Straw Hats hanging out together and being total idiots.      That particular bit got me good. Like, speaking as someone a few several hundred chapters behind on One Piece, I thought it was completely reasonable to expect that Chopper, at some point, had received the ability to take off his fur. Wouldn't be the weirdest power I've seen in this series.   To be honest I think even Chopper forgets what his powers are half the time. Also I'm glad your introduction to Franky includes his ability to retrofit animals into automobiles. It's genuinely one of the best things ever.      Oh is that a recurring bit? I figured it just happened here because of the giant animal thing. And ""Crawley Davidson"" is chef's kiss brilliant.     I won't give away too much. You deserve to find out on your own. The point is, the Straw Hats are the stars of this thing, and it's super refreshing when most of them were sidelined in Stampede. Though some habits have never gone away, like the very necessary introductory scene of Nami at the pool.     Yeah, obviously I haven't gotten to the part in the manga where her proportions go completely off the deep end, but Strong World was sure to remind me of what's in store.     Thing is I actually like most of Nami's material in the movie. Despite the inciting incident being her getting kidnapped by Shiki, she's active through nearly the whole thing and is central to the emotional core. But also boy they like showing off her butt.     Do they ever. But you're right, she is also the film's emotional center, and she really carries the moodiest scene in particular. It's one of the few times Strong World takes itself entirely seriously, and despite all odds, it makes it work with intimate framing and strong character acting.         That's the magic of One Piece, baby. At its best you can slingshot from wacky cartoon hijinks to deathly serious stakes, then back again and it all lands perfectly. I also love the way they use lighting in that sequence. Whole thing starts off just before sunset and Shiki's power eventually blots out the sun entirely as he dominates the crew.      It's so good! And then a couple minutes later the movie tells you to get stickbugged. Multitudes!      Haha look at that goofy thing! A minute later it's destroying a village of bird people. One Piece!     Oh yeah, here's another great microcosm of that: Luffy tenderly reassures the adorable innocent villagers of their humanity, and immediately follows it up with a promise to clobber the crap out of Shiki. That's my guy.         The ultimate narrative of basically every One Piece story is simple: Inform Luffy who he needs to punch and get him within punching distance. This one just adds a little flair by getting everyone dripped out beforehand.     Earlier in the film, I had jokingly questioned why Shiki had instituted a dress code for his big evil pirate gathering, but then I saw the light. It was all for the eventual Straw Hat swag. I'm sorry I ever doubted you, One Piece.     One of the joys of One Piece movies is getting to see new outfits. Just look at this one for the new Red film. I love it.     That's absolutely adorable. He looks like a nephew on Halloween.   As a rule, Robin always has the best look, of course.      Impossible to argue with Nico Robin With a Gun. Nor would I want to. Luffy's badass mobster look here is very good too. Especially with the incongruous straw hat complement.     It's just great all around, and they really do lean into it feeling like a crime movie in the third act. You've got Shiki and his yakuza-style sake cup ceremony. The sliding doors revealing hundreds of guards in the rooms on either side of the main hall. And in the middle of it there's this guy.     You can even hear the music briefly riff on the Matrix soundtrack when they shoot up the place to their absurd degree. And then Usopp and Chopper run off to roleplay Elden Ring while everyone else is doing their own thing. It's an embarrassment of riches.    There's a snowboarding ape with nunchaku and it barely even registers among the chaos. That's the kind of third act we get.     Robin even fights Mothra for a hot second. It's great.     I like the part where Zoro stabs a clown so hard that he explodes.      Gotta love that Zoro's power up is just ""what if there were three of me?"" and he somehow makes that happen. 15 years later and I still don't know how that works, nor do I care to ask. Through probably my favorite goofy thing is when Nami does the stereotypical action movie thing and rips her fancy dress so she can run more easily. Except she never runs anywhere. Apparently she just can't navigate if her thighs are too covered up.     Come on, Nick, everyone knows that the zettai ryouiki is the part of your anatomy most sensitive to fluctuations in barometric pressure.   You joke but I wouldn't be surprised if somewhere in the One Piece universe there's somebody who can predict weather with their garter belt.   I'm not putting anything leg-related past Oda considering the climax of the film is Luffy crushing Shiki under his inflated electrified foot.         I love it. I love Gear Three so much.

Truth be told, I have not been keeping up with my One Piece homework since we last covered Stampede, so I ask that you be patient with me if I mix up which character is a skeleton and which character is a robot? I think? But Strong World makes an appropriately strong case for me diving back into the manga, because this movie kinda rules.   It's nostalgic for me in two senses. First, it was the most recent movie when I first caught up with One Piece. Which was only a scant..uh...13 years ago. And it's also the first time in years I've seen these characters in their pre-time skip forms.    By which I mean that Stoner Brooke is a thing of beauty.   My eyes were feasting on all of the fashion choices in that scene. Sanji's just wearing a loose tie over a sweater. Chopper looks like he was forced to wear that onesie on a dare. Luffy's working that cool-casual scarf. And I don't know what Usopp is thinking, but that's par for the course.         There's...a lot to say about the clothes in this movie. Like the fact Sanji's idea of adventuring clothes is this rhinestone cowboy getup.    Also I forgot how far along you were in the manga, but I assume the afro skeleton and Ace Ventura: Tech Detective are new to you?   Correct. I mean, I know the gist to them thanks to weeb osmosis, but the most recent main crewmember I'm intimately familiar with is Nico Robin.   Well, you're not gonna get a lot from any one of them in this movie, but you'll at least get to see more of the Straw Hats than in Stampede! That one was stuffed to bursting with the massively extended cast of this franchise, while Strong World is just filled with fucked up animals.     And honestly I don't need a whole lot more in a movie than that. The conceit of the film is that it takes place on a series of floating islands where evolution has been artificially accelerated in order to produce weaponized megafauna. And the creature designers apparently took this as their cue to go off and use every part of the buffalo, so to speak,—and then they attached those buffalo parts to other random animals. So we've got everything from giant land octopods to literal army ants to electric duck-peacocks to blue sabertooths. It's pure Looney Tunes.         It's great. Some of my fondest moments of early One Piece were just the spreads of weird animals Oda could come up with, and this scratches that itch 50 times in its first act alone. Just freaky, bloodthirsty beasts as far as the eye can see.     It's also just delightfully cartoonish, even in its carnage. Like, I love the denouement to that fish getting shredded.    He just like me fr   I'd forgotten just how many bone puns Brook packs into this thing.     A veritable skele-TON of them!     Yohoho~ Skull joke.   I regret that.   Don't be. That's just how this movie is. I mean they introduce our big villain via a dance number alongside a clown and a gorilla dressed like The New Radicals.     Rarely do I sympathize with fictional characters as much as I sympathized with Nami in this exact moment. Getting kidnapped is one thing, but getting kidnapped by clowns? That stings the soul.     It's even funnier if you know the larger lore around Shiki here. In the (vague movie-centric) canon he's a former rival of Gold Roger, the most legendary and central figure in the series' history. And here he is with sword legs dancing with a clown who makes fart sounds when he walks.   God, Kung Pow: Enter the Fist has the same exact joke, and it's just as good here. Exquisitely dumb comedy done for zero purpose. You love to see it.      It's also a great way to make Shiki look goofy right before we remember he's an extremely dangerous bastard and your local weather guy's worst nightmare.     Yeah! The film opens with this metal-as-hell backstory about him breaking out of prison, and then it keeps flipping back and forth between him workshopping manzai routines and him plotting a big ol' genocide. But it all feels congruous within the context of One Piece's overall loudness, which is a quality Strong World smartly emphasizes start to finish.   It also gives me something that has been in short supply during the recent years of the manga: the Straw Hats hanging out together and being total idiots.      That particular bit got me good. Like, speaking as someone a few several hundred chapters behind on One Piece, I thought it was completely reasonable to expect that Chopper, at some point, had received the ability to take off his fur. Wouldn't be the weirdest power I've seen in this series.   To be honest I think even Chopper forgets what his powers are half the time. Also I'm glad your introduction to Franky includes his ability to retrofit animals into automobiles. It's genuinely one of the best things ever.      Oh is that a recurring bit? I figured it just happened here because of the giant animal thing. And ""Crawley Davidson"" is chef's kiss brilliant.     I won't give away too much. You deserve to find out on your own. The point is, the Straw Hats are the stars of this thing, and it's super refreshing when most of them were sidelined in Stampede. Though some habits have never gone away, like the very necessary introductory scene of Nami at the pool.     Yeah, obviously I haven't gotten to the part in the manga where her proportions go completely off the deep end, but Strong World was sure to remind me of what's in store.     Thing is I actually like most of Nami's material in the movie. Despite the inciting incident being her getting kidnapped by Shiki, she's active through nearly the whole thing and is central to the emotional core. But also boy they like showing off her butt.     Do they ever. But you're right, she is also the film's emotional center, and she really carries the moodiest scene in particular. It's one of the few times Strong World takes itself entirely seriously, and despite all odds, it makes it work with intimate framing and strong character acting.         That's the magic of One Piece, baby. At its best you can slingshot from wacky cartoon hijinks to deathly serious stakes, then back again and it all lands perfectly. I also love the way they use lighting in that sequence. Whole thing starts off just before sunset and Shiki's power eventually blots out the sun entirely as he dominates the crew.      It's so good! And then a couple minutes later the movie tells you to get stickbugged. Multitudes!      Haha look at that goofy thing! A minute later it's destroying a village of bird people. One Piece!     Oh yeah, here's another great microcosm of that: Luffy tenderly reassures the adorable innocent villagers of their humanity, and immediately follows it up with a promise to clobber the crap out of Shiki. That's my guy.         The ultimate narrative of basically every One Piece story is simple: Inform Luffy who he needs to punch and get him within punching distance. This one just adds a little flair by getting everyone dripped out beforehand.     Earlier in the film, I had jokingly questioned why Shiki had instituted a dress code for his big evil pirate gathering, but then I saw the light. It was all for the eventual Straw Hat swag. I'm sorry I ever doubted you, One Piece.     One of the joys of One Piece movies is getting to see new outfits. Just look at this one for the new Red film. I love it.     That's absolutely adorable. He looks like a nephew on Halloween.   As a rule, Robin always has the best look, of course.      Impossible to argue with Nico Robin With a Gun. Nor would I want to. Luffy's badass mobster look here is very good too. Especially with the incongruous straw hat complement.     It's just great all around, and they really do lean into it feeling like a crime movie in the third act. You've got Shiki and his yakuza-style sake cup ceremony. The sliding doors revealing hundreds of guards in the rooms on either side of the main hall. And in the middle of it there's this guy.     You can even hear the music briefly riff on the Matrix soundtrack when they shoot up the place to their absurd degree. And then Usopp and Chopper run off to roleplay Elden Ring while everyone else is doing their own thing. It's an embarrassment of riches.    There's a snowboarding ape with nunchaku and it barely even registers among the chaos. That's the kind of third act we get.     Robin even fights Mothra for a hot second. It's great.     I like the part where Zoro stabs a clown so hard that he explodes.      Gotta love that Zoro's power up is just ""what if there were three of me?"" and he somehow makes that happen. 15 years later and I still don't know how that works, nor do I care to ask. Through probably my favorite goofy thing is when Nami does the stereotypical action movie thing and rips her fancy dress so she can run more easily. Except she never runs anywhere. Apparently she just can't navigate if her thighs are too covered up.     Come on, Nick, everyone knows that the zettai ryouiki is the part of your anatomy most sensitive to fluctuations in barometric pressure.   You joke but I wouldn't be surprised if somewhere in the One Piece universe there's somebody who can predict weather with their garter belt.   I'm not putting anything leg-related past Oda considering the climax of the film is Luffy crushing Shiki under his inflated electrified foot.         I love it. I love Gear Three so much. It's the best power Oda ever came up with (one extremely recent addition notwithstanding) and I love how it's just Luffy turning into the Anchor Arms episode from Spongebob.     I saw something recently about how you can tie pretty much all shonen action stories back to Popeye, and if I didn't believe that before, I sure do now.   Replace devil fruits with spinach and not much would actually change about One Piece. Though unlike the sailor man, Luffy doesn't skip leg day:     Just the one leg tho   Also if I have one nitpick of this movie, it's a little fucked up how they only think about the consequences of defeating the guy whose power is keeping all these islands in the sky AFTER they crack him in half. They're real lucky those villagers conveniently learned to fly with their vestigial arm wings just in time.      To be fair, I don't think anyone in the film, outside Nami, thinks about any consequences of anything. As cheesy as the ending is, though, what makes it for me is the montage of the enormous mutant animals all smiling and living together in harmony. We definitely saw a lot of those die, but it's all cool now. That rules.   It's also immensely funny to me that Lore Reasons require we check back in with Sengoku just long enough for him to admit the marines didn't do jack shit again. Just put him in a donut shop with a cup of joe and it'd be perfect.    That's the lesson of One Piece kids: Cops are either useless or will actively make things worse.   And that's why One Piece owns. On top of all the other cool shit we just talked about, of course. To repeat, I had a blast with Strong World, and I pledge the next time we cover one of these movies, I'll be more caught up with the manga. Turns out, I missed these losers and their large mouths.     And even as a veteran fan I really enjoyed coming back to it. This franchise is so massive and sprawling that it can be easy to get lost in the weeds, but this was a reminder that there's a lot of cool, fun stuff you can only really get with One Piece.    Now chop chop (fruit) on that reading, Steve. I expect you to be at Water Seven by this time next week.   Aye aye, Captain!

I figured it just happened here because of the giant animal thing. And ""Crawley Davidson"" is chef's kiss brilliant.     I won't give away too much. You deserve to find out on your own. The point is, the Straw Hats are the stars of this thing, and it's super refreshing when most of them were sidelined in Stampede. Though some habits have never gone away, like the very necessary introductory scene of Nami at the pool.     Yeah, obviously I haven't gotten to the part in the manga where her proportions go completely off the deep end, but Strong World was sure to remind me of what's in store.     Thing is I actually like most of Nami's material in the movie. Despite the inciting incident being her getting kidnapped by Shiki, she's active through nearly the whole thing and is central to the emotional core. But also boy they like showing off her butt.     Do they ever. But you're right, she is also the film's emotional center, and she really carries the moodiest scene in particular. It's one of the few times Strong World takes itself entirely seriously, and despite all odds, it makes it work with intimate framing and strong character acting.         That's the magic of One Piece, baby. At its best you can slingshot from wacky cartoon hijinks to deathly serious stakes, then back again and it all lands perfectly. I also love the way they use lighting in that sequence. Whole thing starts off just before sunset and Shiki's power eventually blots out the sun entirely as he dominates the crew.      It's so good! And then a couple minutes later the movie tells you to get stickbugged. Multitudes!      Haha look at that goofy thing! A minute later it's destroying a village of bird people. One Piece!     Oh yeah, here's another great microcosm of that: Luffy tenderly reassures the adorable innocent villagers of their humanity, and immediately follows it up with a promise to clobber the crap out of Shiki. That's my guy.         The ultimate narrative of basically every One Piece story is simple: Inform Luffy who he needs to punch and get him within punching distance. This one just adds a little flair by getting everyone dripped out beforehand.     Earlier in the film, I had jokingly questioned why Shiki had instituted a dress code for his big evil pirate gathering, but then I saw the light. It was all for the eventual Straw Hat swag. I'm sorry I ever doubted you, One Piece.     One of the joys of One Piece movies is getting to see new outfits. Just look at this one for the new Red film. I love it.     That's absolutely adorable. He looks like a nephew on Halloween.   As a rule, Robin always has the best look, of course.      Impossible to argue with Nico Robin With a Gun. Nor would I want to. Luffy's badass mobster look here is very good too. Especially with the incongruous straw hat complement.     It's just great all around, and they really do lean into it feeling like a crime movie in the third act. You've got Shiki and his yakuza-style sake cup ceremony. The sliding doors revealing hundreds of guards in the rooms on either side of the main hall. And in the middle of it there's this guy.     You can even hear the music briefly riff on the Matrix soundtrack when they shoot up the place to their absurd degree. And then Usopp and Chopper run off to roleplay Elden Ring while everyone else is doing their own thing. It's an embarrassment of riches.    There's a snowboarding ape with nunchaku and it barely even registers among the chaos. That's the kind of third act we get.     Robin even fights Mothra for a hot second. It's great.     I like the part where Zoro stabs a clown so hard that he explodes.      Gotta love that Zoro's power up is just ""what if there were three of me?"" and he somehow makes that happen. 15 years later and I still don't know how that works, nor do I care to ask. Through probably my favorite goofy thing is when Nami does the stereotypical action movie thing and rips her fancy dress so she can run more easily. Except she never runs anywhere. Apparently she just can't navigate if her thighs are too covered up.     Come on, Nick, everyone knows that the zettai ryouiki is the part of your anatomy most sensitive to fluctuations in barometric pressure.   You joke but I wouldn't be surprised if somewhere in the One Piece universe there's somebody who can predict weather with their garter belt.   I'm not putting anything leg-related past Oda considering the climax of the film is Luffy crushing Shiki under his inflated electrified foot.         I love it. I love Gear Three so much. It's the best power Oda ever came up with (one extremely recent addition notwithstanding) and I love how it's just Luffy turning into the Anchor Arms episode from Spongebob.     I saw something recently about how you can tie pretty much all shonen action stories back to Popeye, and if I didn't believe that before, I sure do now.   Replace devil fruits with spinach and not much would actually change about One Piece. Though unlike the sailor man, Luffy doesn't skip leg day:     Just the one leg tho   Also if I have one nitpick of this movie, it's a little fucked up how they only think about the consequences of defeating the guy whose power is keeping all these islands in the sky AFTER they crack him in half. They're real lucky those villagers conveniently learned to fly with their vestigial arm wings just in time.      To be fair, I don't think anyone in the film, outside Nami, thinks about any consequences of anything. As cheesy as the ending is, though, what makes it for me is the montage of the enormous mutant animals all smiling and living together in harmony. We definitely saw a lot of those die, but it's all cool now. That rules.   It's also immensely funny to me that Lore Reasons require we check back in with Sengoku just long enough for him to admit the marines didn't do jack shit again. Just put him in a donut shop with a cup of joe and it'd be perfect.    That's the lesson of One Piece kids: Cops are either useless or will actively make things worse.   And that's why One Piece owns. On top of all the other cool shit we just talked about, of course. To repeat, I had a blast with Strong World, and I pledge the next time we cover one of these movies, I'll be more caught up with the manga. Turns out, I missed these losers and their large mouths.     And even as a veteran fan I really enjoyed coming back to it. This franchise is so massive and sprawling that it can be easy to get lost in the weeds, but this was a reminder that there's a lot of cool, fun stuff you can only really get with One Piece.    Now chop chop (fruit) on that reading, Steve. I expect you to be at Water Seven by this time next week.   Aye aye, Captain! I'm on my way!

Co-author Shaenon Garrity counts down her favorite manga from the column. ―  Shaenon's Ten Favorite 'House' Manga It falls upon my bowed shoulders to announce the news: House of 1,000 Manga is ending.

House of 1000 Manga is due in four hours, and I've read everything in the house.

Shaenon investigates. ―  The Earl and the Fairy I admit it: I feel like I'm behind on the shojo manga these days. The most popular shonen series make enough noise in fandom that even an old Dirty Pair-reading fart like myself knows more or less what's up, and anyway right now it's mostly Attack on Titan ...                    column          10 comments       House of 1000 Manga - Poverty, Princesses and Zombies   2015 May  8, 00:00 10 comments                 manga    Jason checks out three prose novels about the life and challenges of working as a mangaka. ―  The Poverty, The Princess and the Zombies The way reading about food makes you hungry, reading about manga makes me want to read manga.

I wish Tatsumi, who passed away earlier this year, could have drawn a sequel about the second half of his career, during which he b...                    column          9 comments       House of 1000 Manga - Kakukaku Shikajika   2015 Apr 24, 00:00 9 comments                 manga    If you were ever curious what life was like for the woman who created Princess Jellyfish, Jason has the manga for you. ―  Kakukaku Shikajika “I want to go back in time and beat up that moron.” —Akiko Higashimura, and many other artists, talking about their younger self Few artists “live the dream” of becoming a professional when they're still a teenager.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Love After World Domination   Apr  9th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Love After World Domination ?                     Community score: 4.0              What is this?   Fudo Aikawa and Desumi Magahara are in love. There's only one small problem: they are mortal enemies. Fudo is the red ranger and leader of the fighting force Gelato 5, while Desumi is the reaper princess of the evil organization Gekko. To make matters worse, neither of them have ever been in a relationship before. They have to keep their budding romance a secret, while figuring out how to be in a relationship and juggle their real life responsibilities along the way.    Love After World Domination is based on Hiroshi Noda and Takahiro Wakamatsu's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?   James Beckett  Rating:                Look, what do you want from me? Love After World Domination is an extremely cute and surprisingly well-produced romantic comedy featuring two catastrophically dorky young lovers that are fighting their way through the awkwardness of their own inexperience because they like each other so gosh darned much, and it's a loving homage/spoof of Super Sentai. This show was literally made specifically for me. I am not a strong man. There was never any chance that I would be able to resist the charms of this one.    I could just make this review a straightforward list of the things I loved about this premiere. The sentai team is themed after gelato flavors, which is hilarious; the fight scenes are actually pretty fun and cool-looking; one of the evil minions is a giant bear; Fudo the Red Gelato is King Himbo of Good Boy Mountain; Desumi's little skull mask is cute as heck, and she also has a chonky cat that she loves, which makes her perfect girlfriend material.    Honestly, I only have one real complaint with Love After World Domination, and it isn't even entirely fair to the show's own qualities. It just had the unfortunate luck of coming after Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic on today's schedule, and 99% of every other rom-com anime out there would pale in comparison to that show. Love After World Domination is plenty cute, and plenty funny, but it is standing in the shadow of one of the GOATs that is operating at the peak of its powers, which is bound to make it seem maybe a touch modest in comparison.    I suppose that this is also one of those productions that could easily suffer from diminishing returns, especially if the animation starts to suffer and the show has to rely on the same round of jokes about dating etiquette and Super Sentai tropes. Then again, real Super Sentai series have gotten by on recycling tried and true cliches on a limited budget for, like, 50 years straight, so I doubt LAWD will have too difficult a time at keeping things fresh. Either way, I had a rollicking good time with this premiere, and I'm going to add it to this season's growing list of must-watch comedies.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Love After World Domination is one of those premieres that I enjoyed for the most part but worry about the longevity of the concept. As it stands, the first episode really only has two core jokes—if they can even be called that. The first is the ultra-cute love story between Fudo and Desumi. While they are battlefield enemies engaging in a scandalous relationship, the crux of the humor comes from the fact that neither of them know a thing about romance. They clearly like each other, but are basically resorting to Google to figure out how this “dating” thing works. It's cute, innocent fun with a sprinkle of social commentary (like when it pokes fun at the creepiness of cyber-stalking your crush and how it changes the traditional dating process).    The other core joke of the show is its parody of the Japanese superhero genre, tokusatsu. This is also where the show falters a bit. While its five gelato-flavored heroes and their appropriately themed attacks seem like an attempt to make fun of the general concept of tokusatsu, it's not really out of the realm of believability for an actual toku show to be themed like this. I mean, Kamen Rider Gaim, penned by Madoka Magica creator Gen Urobuchi, was fruit-themed, after all. Moreover, there is no subversion of Japanese superhero tropes here. Everyone is 100% serious about what is going on—from the villains who stand back and make speeches even as the rangers go to town on the low level mooks, to the rangers who are earnest and friendly even when off duty. Because of this, the show feels painfully predictable and almost boring whenever its not solidly focused on the relationship between Fudo and Desumi.    So even though I have a soft spot for both Power Rangers and hero/villain romances, I'm not really as into this anime as I feel I should be. Even within this premiere alone, it feels like the concept is already running out of steam. I don't see myself coming back for more next week, though I may check out a bit of the manga and see if that is able to change my mind.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Move over, Romeo and Juliet. Fudo and Desumi are here to show you how real star-crossed lovers do it: by not just having feuding families, but being on completely opposite sides of a major fight. Or at least a ridiculous fight? Even if the superheroes weren't the Gelato 5 – complete with flavor-themed colors – and the villains seeking to take over the world didn't employ a giant talking bear named Culverin Bear, there's not much about the two warring sides for us to take seriously. Even the people populating the story's world don't – when Gekko attacks a public park, the screams for help from the general public are…let's go with “underwhelming.” Simply put, this is equal parts super sentai sendup and gooey romcom, and it looks like those two things are going to mesh just as well here as they do in the source manga.    The central romance is between Desumi, AKA Reaper Princess, and Fudo, Red Gelato (strawberry flavor). Fudo falls in love at first sight, which is impressive since his “first sight” is of Desumi in her battle “gear,” which consists of fancy lingerie and a face-hiding mask. (So maybe not impressive.) But there's a real sense that it's not so much that he fell in love with what he saw as he did with her fighting skills and her parting words, which are about his battle prowess. Since there's a definite sense that the rest of the Gelato 5 think he's just some muscle head, Desumi's remarks may be the nicest thing anyone's said to him about all that training he's done. Likewise, Fudo's heartfelt confession to her is clearly her first brush with romance and she's flattered and more than a little charmed by his earnestness.    It's a cute mix of tropes made even more fun by their efforts at hiding the fact that they're dating from both Gelato 5 and Gekko, although technically Fudo did get permission from Professor Gelato to ask Desumi out. Not that the good professor knew who Fudo was crushing on when he urged him to go forth and speak his feelings, something Fudo may be realizing in hindsight. Or he may not; Fudo's perhaps not the sharpest tool in the proverbial shed. When you combine that with Desumi's incredible naivete in matters romantic (holding hands practically sends her into a fainting fit), it's the recipe for peach-pink love – at least as far as Pink Gelato's definition of the color goes.    While there are some awkward things about the character designs – specifically the way people fit into their clothes, or don't, as the case may be – this looks better than I was expecting and the animation is up to some flashy fights and over-the-top transformation scenes. As a fan of the manga, I'm happy with how this looks in its first episode, and I'm looking forward to seeing more.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Finally, some good god damn food. Don't get me wrong: I enjoyed Aharen-san wa Hakarenai perfectly fine, and I'm looking forward to some other romcoms that have yet to debut. But I have been craving another goofy-ass show about a pair of idiots blushing their way into the next dimension, and this show has given me all I could ever ask for.    There's really not a whole lot else to dig into here, though. I could try to talk about how hard the show goes on its Super Sentai parody, complete with a full five-person transformation sequence where our gelato-themed Power Rangers sound off increasingly goofy battle cries. But I'm far from an expert on this stuff so all I can say is that I refuse to believe pistachio is “the flavor of peace” no matter how hard Gelato Green insists. And outside of some sharp gags and moments of parody, this entire premiere is just watching our adorable, awkward leads together – either when they're already dating or when Fudo first made his confession. That means most of this episode is just iterations on a single joke that, while funny and well-delivered, also means you have to really like that joke to get onboard with it.    The production does help a lot in keeping that joke fresh, though. Unlike the similarly toku-themed Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department, this show actually has the production values to show off some cool fight choreography to go along with its jokes, and it especially has room to make our dorky central couple expressive and appealing to watch. This is just some A+ romcom blushing, and it makes the two of them tip-toeing through the “steps” of dating fun to watch all on its own. There's even room to add some actual detail to their fanservice, like making sure Desumi has her garters on right to avoid a bathroom death trap. In a year that's already featured World’s End Harem and its horny JPEG artifacts, having cheesecake that actually knows how to properly present itself shouldn't be taken for granted, so if this show's gonna be a little horny I'm glad they actually know what they're doing.    I'm not going to tell you this show is deep or thought-provoking or even particularly romantic, but what I will say is I had a big dumb grin on my face the entire episode. I love these losers and I want to see them go on a hundred secret dates where they suddenly have to turn a kiss into a clashing headbutt to avoid suspicion. I want to see them send flirty texts in code that make it look like threatening letters. This show was made for me, and I plan to embrace it with both arms.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review                Odd Taxi: In the Woods   Apr 17, 00:00                 anime    By cleverly reframing its narrative around a series of interviews with the supporting cast, Odd Taxi: In the Woods succeeds where most recap films fail: it's an artistically cohesive film in its own right. ― Odd Taxi was 2021's sleeper anime hit, telling an intricate, original mystery that kept viewers guessing every week.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Love After World Domination   Apr  9th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Love After World Domination ?                     Community score: 4.0              What is this?   Fudo Aikawa and Desumi Magahara are in love. There's only one small problem: they are mortal enemies. Fudo is the red ranger and leader of the fighting force Gelato 5, while Desumi is the reaper princess of the evil organization Gekko. To make matters worse, neither of them have ever been in a relationship before. They have to keep their budding romance a secret, while figuring out how to be in a relationship and juggle their real life responsibilities along the way.    Love After World Domination is based on Hiroshi Noda and Takahiro Wakamatsu's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?   James Beckett  Rating:                Look, what do you want from me? Love After World Domination is an extremely cute and surprisingly well-produced romantic comedy featuring two catastrophically dorky young lovers that are fighting their way through the awkwardness of their own inexperience because they like each other so gosh darned much, and it's a loving homage/spoof of Super Sentai. This show was literally made specifically for me. I am not a strong man. There was never any chance that I would be able to resist the charms of this one.    I could just make this review a straightforward list of the things I loved about this premiere. The sentai team is themed after gelato flavors, which is hilarious; the fight scenes are actually pretty fun and cool-looking; one of the evil minions is a giant bear; Fudo the Red Gelato is King Himbo of Good Boy Mountain; Desumi's little skull mask is cute as heck, and she also has a chonky cat that she loves, which makes her perfect girlfriend material.    Honestly, I only have one real complaint with Love After World Domination, and it isn't even entirely fair to the show's own qualities. It just had the unfortunate luck of coming after Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic on today's schedule, and 99% of every other rom-com anime out there would pale in comparison to that show. Love After World Domination is plenty cute, and plenty funny, but it is standing in the shadow of one of the GOATs that is operating at the peak of its powers, which is bound to make it seem maybe a touch modest in comparison.    I suppose that this is also one of those productions that could easily suffer from diminishing returns, especially if the animation starts to suffer and the show has to rely on the same round of jokes about dating etiquette and Super Sentai tropes. Then again, real Super Sentai series have gotten by on recycling tried and true cliches on a limited budget for, like, 50 years straight, so I doubt LAWD will have too difficult a time at keeping things fresh. Either way, I had a rollicking good time with this premiere, and I'm going to add it to this season's growing list of must-watch comedies.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Love After World Domination is one of those premieres that I enjoyed for the most part but worry about the longevity of the concept. As it stands, the first episode really only has two core jokes—if they can even be called that. The first is the ultra-cute love story between Fudo and Desumi. While they are battlefield enemies engaging in a scandalous relationship, the crux of the humor comes from the fact that neither of them know a thing about romance. They clearly like each other, but are basically resorting to Google to figure out how this “dating” thing works. It's cute, innocent fun with a sprinkle of social commentary (like when it pokes fun at the creepiness of cyber-stalking your crush and how it changes the traditional dating process).    The other core joke of the show is its parody of the Japanese superhero genre, tokusatsu. This is also where the show falters a bit. While its five gelato-flavored heroes and their appropriately themed attacks seem like an attempt to make fun of the general concept of tokusatsu, it's not really out of the realm of believability for an actual toku show to be themed like this. I mean, Kamen Rider Gaim, penned by Madoka Magica creator Gen Urobuchi, was fruit-themed, after all. Moreover, there is no subversion of Japanese superhero tropes here. Everyone is 100% serious about what is going on—from the villains who stand back and make speeches even as the rangers go to town on the low level mooks, to the rangers who are earnest and friendly even when off duty. Because of this, the show feels painfully predictable and almost boring whenever its not solidly focused on the relationship between Fudo and Desumi.    So even though I have a soft spot for both Power Rangers and hero/villain romances, I'm not really as into this anime as I feel I should be. Even within this premiere alone, it feels like the concept is already running out of steam. I don't see myself coming back for more next week, though I may check out a bit of the manga and see if that is able to change my mind.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Move over, Romeo and Juliet. Fudo and Desumi are here to show you how real star-crossed lovers do it: by not just having feuding families, but being on completely opposite sides of a major fight. Or at least a ridiculous fight? Even if the superheroes weren't the Gelato 5 – complete with flavor-themed colors – and the villains seeking to take over the world didn't employ a giant talking bear named Culverin Bear, there's not much about the two warring sides for us to take seriously. Even the people populating the story's world don't – when Gekko attacks a public park, the screams for help from the general public are…let's go with “underwhelming.” Simply put, this is equal parts super sentai sendup and gooey romcom, and it looks like those two things are going to mesh just as well here as they do in the source manga.    The central romance is between Desumi, AKA Reaper Princess, and Fudo, Red Gelato (strawberry flavor). Fudo falls in love at first sight, which is impressive since his “first sight” is of Desumi in her battle “gear,” which consists of fancy lingerie and a face-hiding mask. (So maybe not impressive.) But there's a real sense that it's not so much that he fell in love with what he saw as he did with her fighting skills and her parting words, which are about his battle prowess. Since there's a definite sense that the rest of the Gelato 5 think he's just some muscle head, Desumi's remarks may be the nicest thing anyone's said to him about all that training he's done. Likewise, Fudo's heartfelt confession to her is clearly her first brush with romance and she's flattered and more than a little charmed by his earnestness.    It's a cute mix of tropes made even more fun by their efforts at hiding the fact that they're dating from both Gelato 5 and Gekko, although technically Fudo did get permission from Professor Gelato to ask Desumi out. Not that the good professor knew who Fudo was crushing on when he urged him to go forth and speak his feelings, something Fudo may be realizing in hindsight. Or he may not; Fudo's perhaps not the sharpest tool in the proverbial shed. When you combine that with Desumi's incredible naivete in matters romantic (holding hands practically sends her into a fainting fit), it's the recipe for peach-pink love – at least as far as Pink Gelato's definition of the color goes.    While there are some awkward things about the character designs – specifically the way people fit into their clothes, or don't, as the case may be – this looks better than I was expecting and the animation is up to some flashy fights and over-the-top transformation scenes. As a fan of the manga, I'm happy with how this looks in its first episode, and I'm looking forward to seeing more.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Finally, some good god damn food. Don't get me wrong: I enjoyed Aharen-san wa Hakarenai perfectly fine, and I'm looking forward to some other romcoms that have yet to debut. But I have been craving another goofy-ass show about a pair of idiots blushing their way into the next dimension, and this show has given me all I could ever ask for.    There's really not a whole lot else to dig into here, though. I could try to talk about how hard the show goes on its Super Sentai parody, complete with a full five-person transformation sequence where our gelato-themed Power Rangers sound off increasingly goofy battle cries. But I'm far from an expert on this stuff so all I can say is that I refuse to believe pistachio is “the flavor of peace” no matter how hard Gelato Green insists. And outside of some sharp gags and moments of parody, this entire premiere is just watching our adorable, awkward leads together – either when they're already dating or when Fudo first made his confession. That means most of this episode is just iterations on a single joke that, while funny and well-delivered, also means you have to really like that joke to get onboard with it.    The production does help a lot in keeping that joke fresh, though. Unlike the similarly toku-themed Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department, this show actually has the production values to show off some cool fight choreography to go along with its jokes, and it especially has room to make our dorky central couple expressive and appealing to watch. This is just some A+ romcom blushing, and it makes the two of them tip-toeing through the “steps” of dating fun to watch all on its own. There's even room to add some actual detail to their fanservice, like making sure Desumi has her garters on right to avoid a bathroom death trap. In a year that's already featured World’s End Harem and its horny JPEG artifacts, having cheesecake that actually knows how to properly present itself shouldn't be taken for granted, so if this show's gonna be a little horny I'm glad they actually know what they're doing.    I'm not going to tell you this show is deep or thought-provoking or even particularly romantic, but what I will say is I had a big dumb grin on my face the entire episode. I love these losers and I want to see them go on a hundred secret dates where they suddenly have to turn a kiss into a clashing headbutt to avoid suspicion. I want to see them send flirty texts in code that make it look like threatening letters. This show was made for me, and I plan to embrace it with both arms.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review                Odd Taxi: In the Woods   Apr 17, 00:00                 anime    By cleverly reframing its narrative around a series of interviews with the supporting cast, Odd Taxi: In the Woods succeeds where most recap films fail: it's an artistically cohesive film in its own right. ― Odd Taxi was 2021's sleeper anime hit, telling an intricate, original mystery that kept viewers guessing every week.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Love After World Domination   Apr  9th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Love After World Domination ?                     Community score: 4.0              What is this?   Fudo Aikawa and Desumi Magahara are in love. There's only one small problem: they are mortal enemies. Fudo is the red ranger and leader of the fighting force Gelato 5, while Desumi is the reaper princess of the evil organization Gekko. To make matters worse, neither of them have ever been in a relationship before. They have to keep their budding romance a secret, while figuring out how to be in a relationship and juggle their real life responsibilities along the way.    Love After World Domination is based on Hiroshi Noda and Takahiro Wakamatsu's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?   James Beckett  Rating:                Look, what do you want from me? Love After World Domination is an extremely cute and surprisingly well-produced romantic comedy featuring two catastrophically dorky young lovers that are fighting their way through the awkwardness of their own inexperience because they like each other so gosh darned much, and it's a loving homage/spoof of Super Sentai. This show was literally made specifically for me. I am not a strong man. There was never any chance that I would be able to resist the charms of this one.    I could just make this review a straightforward list of the things I loved about this premiere. The sentai team is themed after gelato flavors, which is hilarious; the fight scenes are actually pretty fun and cool-looking; one of the evil minions is a giant bear; Fudo the Red Gelato is King Himbo of Good Boy Mountain; Desumi's little skull mask is cute as heck, and she also has a chonky cat that she loves, which makes her perfect girlfriend material.    Honestly, I only have one real complaint with Love After World Domination, and it isn't even entirely fair to the show's own qualities. It just had the unfortunate luck of coming after Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic on today's schedule, and 99% of every other rom-com anime out there would pale in comparison to that show. Love After World Domination is plenty cute, and plenty funny, but it is standing in the shadow of one of the GOATs that is operating at the peak of its powers, which is bound to make it seem maybe a touch modest in comparison.    I suppose that this is also one of those productions that could easily suffer from diminishing returns, especially if the animation starts to suffer and the show has to rely on the same round of jokes about dating etiquette and Super Sentai tropes. Then again, real Super Sentai series have gotten by on recycling tried and true cliches on a limited budget for, like, 50 years straight, so I doubt LAWD will have too difficult a time at keeping things fresh. Either way, I had a rollicking good time with this premiere, and I'm going to add it to this season's growing list of must-watch comedies.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Love After World Domination is one of those premieres that I enjoyed for the most part but worry about the longevity of the concept. As it stands, the first episode really only has two core jokes—if they can even be called that. The first is the ultra-cute love story between Fudo and Desumi. While they are battlefield enemies engaging in a scandalous relationship, the crux of the humor comes from the fact that neither of them know a thing about romance. They clearly like each other, but are basically resorting to Google to figure out how this “dating” thing works. It's cute, innocent fun with a sprinkle of social commentary (like when it pokes fun at the creepiness of cyber-stalking your crush and how it changes the traditional dating process).    The other core joke of the show is its parody of the Japanese superhero genre, tokusatsu. This is also where the show falters a bit. While its five gelato-flavored heroes and their appropriately themed attacks seem like an attempt to make fun of the general concept of tokusatsu, it's not really out of the realm of believability for an actual toku show to be themed like this. I mean, Kamen Rider Gaim, penned by Madoka Magica creator Gen Urobuchi, was fruit-themed, after all. Moreover, there is no subversion of Japanese superhero tropes here. Everyone is 100% serious about what is going on—from the villains who stand back and make speeches even as the rangers go to town on the low level mooks, to the rangers who are earnest and friendly even when off duty. Because of this, the show feels painfully predictable and almost boring whenever its not solidly focused on the relationship between Fudo and Desumi.    So even though I have a soft spot for both Power Rangers and hero/villain romances, I'm not really as into this anime as I feel I should be. Even within this premiere alone, it feels like the concept is already running out of steam. I don't see myself coming back for more next week, though I may check out a bit of the manga and see if that is able to change my mind.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Move over, Romeo and Juliet. Fudo and Desumi are here to show you how real star-crossed lovers do it: by not just having feuding families, but being on completely opposite sides of a major fight. Or at least a ridiculous fight? Even if the superheroes weren't the Gelato 5 – complete with flavor-themed colors – and the villains seeking to take over the world didn't employ a giant talking bear named Culverin Bear, there's not much about the two warring sides for us to take seriously. Even the people populating the story's world don't – when Gekko attacks a public park, the screams for help from the general public are…let's go with “underwhelming.” Simply put, this is equal parts super sentai sendup and gooey romcom, and it looks like those two things are going to mesh just as well here as they do in the source manga.    The central romance is between Desumi, AKA Reaper Princess, and Fudo, Red Gelato (strawberry flavor). Fudo falls in love at first sight, which is impressive since his “first sight” is of Desumi in her battle “gear,” which consists of fancy lingerie and a face-hiding mask. (So maybe not impressive.) But there's a real sense that it's not so much that he fell in love with what he saw as he did with her fighting skills and her parting words, which are about his battle prowess. Since there's a definite sense that the rest of the Gelato 5 think he's just some muscle head, Desumi's remarks may be the nicest thing anyone's said to him about all that training he's done. Likewise, Fudo's heartfelt confession to her is clearly her first brush with romance and she's flattered and more than a little charmed by his earnestness.    It's a cute mix of tropes made even more fun by their efforts at hiding the fact that they're dating from both Gelato 5 and Gekko, although technically Fudo did get permission from Professor Gelato to ask Desumi out. Not that the good professor knew who Fudo was crushing on when he urged him to go forth and speak his feelings, something Fudo may be realizing in hindsight. Or he may not; Fudo's perhaps not the sharpest tool in the proverbial shed. When you combine that with Desumi's incredible naivete in matters romantic (holding hands practically sends her into a fainting fit), it's the recipe for peach-pink love – at least as far as Pink Gelato's definition of the color goes.    While there are some awkward things about the character designs – specifically the way people fit into their clothes, or don't, as the case may be – this looks better than I was expecting and the animation is up to some flashy fights and over-the-top transformation scenes. As a fan of the manga, I'm happy with how this looks in its first episode, and I'm looking forward to seeing more.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Finally, some good god damn food. Don't get me wrong: I enjoyed Aharen-san wa Hakarenai perfectly fine, and I'm looking forward to some other romcoms that have yet to debut. But I have been craving another goofy-ass show about a pair of idiots blushing their way into the next dimension, and this show has given me all I could ever ask for.    There's really not a whole lot else to dig into here, though. I could try to talk about how hard the show goes on its Super Sentai parody, complete with a full five-person transformation sequence where our gelato-themed Power Rangers sound off increasingly goofy battle cries. But I'm far from an expert on this stuff so all I can say is that I refuse to believe pistachio is “the flavor of peace” no matter how hard Gelato Green insists. And outside of some sharp gags and moments of parody, this entire premiere is just watching our adorable, awkward leads together – either when they're already dating or when Fudo first made his confession. That means most of this episode is just iterations on a single joke that, while funny and well-delivered, also means you have to really like that joke to get onboard with it.    The production does help a lot in keeping that joke fresh, though. Unlike the similarly toku-themed Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department, this show actually has the production values to show off some cool fight choreography to go along with its jokes, and it especially has room to make our dorky central couple expressive and appealing to watch. This is just some A+ romcom blushing, and it makes the two of them tip-toeing through the “steps” of dating fun to watch all on its own. There's even room to add some actual detail to their fanservice, like making sure Desumi has her garters on right to avoid a bathroom death trap. In a year that's already featured World’s End Harem and its horny JPEG artifacts, having cheesecake that actually knows how to properly present itself shouldn't be taken for granted, so if this show's gonna be a little horny I'm glad they actually know what they're doing.    I'm not going to tell you this show is deep or thought-provoking or even particularly romantic, but what I will say is I had a big dumb grin on my face the entire episode. I love these losers and I want to see them go on a hundred secret dates where they suddenly have to turn a kiss into a clashing headbutt to avoid suspicion. I want to see them send flirty texts in code that make it look like threatening letters.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Love After World Domination   Apr  9th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Love After World Domination ?                     Community score: 4.0              What is this?   Fudo Aikawa and Desumi Magahara are in love. There's only one small problem: they are mortal enemies. Fudo is the red ranger and leader of the fighting force Gelato 5, while Desumi is the reaper princess of the evil organization Gekko. To make matters worse, neither of them have ever been in a relationship before. They have to keep their budding romance a secret, while figuring out how to be in a relationship and juggle their real life responsibilities along the way.    Love After World Domination is based on Hiroshi Noda and Takahiro Wakamatsu's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?   James Beckett  Rating:                Look, what do you want from me? Love After World Domination is an extremely cute and surprisingly well-produced romantic comedy featuring two catastrophically dorky young lovers that are fighting their way through the awkwardness of their own inexperience because they like each other so gosh darned much, and it's a loving homage/spoof of Super Sentai. This show was literally made specifically for me. I am not a strong man. There was never any chance that I would be able to resist the charms of this one.    I could just make this review a straightforward list of the things I loved about this premiere. The sentai team is themed after gelato flavors, which is hilarious; the fight scenes are actually pretty fun and cool-looking; one of the evil minions is a giant bear; Fudo the Red Gelato is King Himbo of Good Boy Mountain; Desumi's little skull mask is cute as heck, and she also has a chonky cat that she loves, which makes her perfect girlfriend material.    Honestly, I only have one real complaint with Love After World Domination, and it isn't even entirely fair to the show's own qualities. It just had the unfortunate luck of coming after Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic on today's schedule, and 99% of every other rom-com anime out there would pale in comparison to that show. Love After World Domination is plenty cute, and plenty funny, but it is standing in the shadow of one of the GOATs that is operating at the peak of its powers, which is bound to make it seem maybe a touch modest in comparison.    I suppose that this is also one of those productions that could easily suffer from diminishing returns, especially if the animation starts to suffer and the show has to rely on the same round of jokes about dating etiquette and Super Sentai tropes. Then again, real Super Sentai series have gotten by on recycling tried and true cliches on a limited budget for, like, 50 years straight, so I doubt LAWD will have too difficult a time at keeping things fresh. Either way, I had a rollicking good time with this premiere, and I'm going to add it to this season's growing list of must-watch comedies.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Love After World Domination is one of those premieres that I enjoyed for the most part but worry about the longevity of the concept. As it stands, the first episode really only has two core jokes—if they can even be called that. The first is the ultra-cute love story between Fudo and Desumi. While they are battlefield enemies engaging in a scandalous relationship, the crux of the humor comes from the fact that neither of them know a thing about romance. They clearly like each other, but are basically resorting to Google to figure out how this “dating” thing works. It's cute, innocent fun with a sprinkle of social commentary (like when it pokes fun at the creepiness of cyber-stalking your crush and how it changes the traditional dating process).    The other core joke of the show is its parody of the Japanese superhero genre, tokusatsu. This is also where the show falters a bit. While its five gelato-flavored heroes and their appropriately themed attacks seem like an attempt to make fun of the general concept of tokusatsu, it's not really out of the realm of believability for an actual toku show to be themed like this. I mean, Kamen Rider Gaim, penned by Madoka Magica creator Gen Urobuchi, was fruit-themed, after all. Moreover, there is no subversion of Japanese superhero tropes here. Everyone is 100% serious about what is going on—from the villains who stand back and make speeches even as the rangers go to town on the low level mooks, to the rangers who are earnest and friendly even when off duty. Because of this, the show feels painfully predictable and almost boring whenever its not solidly focused on the relationship between Fudo and Desumi.    So even though I have a soft spot for both Power Rangers and hero/villain romances, I'm not really as into this anime as I feel I should be.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Love After World Domination   Apr  9th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Love After World Domination ?                     Community score: 4.0              What is this?   Fudo Aikawa and Desumi Magahara are in love. There's only one small problem: they are mortal enemies. Fudo is the red ranger and leader of the fighting force Gelato 5, while Desumi is the reaper princess of the evil organization Gekko. To make matters worse, neither of them have ever been in a relationship before. They have to keep their budding romance a secret, while figuring out how to be in a relationship and juggle their real life responsibilities along the way.    Love After World Domination is based on Hiroshi Noda and Takahiro Wakamatsu's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?   James Beckett  Rating:                Look, what do you want from me? Love After World Domination is an extremely cute and surprisingly well-produced romantic comedy featuring two catastrophically dorky young lovers that are fighting their way through the awkwardness of their own inexperience because they like each other so gosh darned much, and it's a loving homage/spoof of Super Sentai. This show was literally made specifically for me. I am not a strong man. There was never any chance that I would be able to resist the charms of this one.    I could just make this review a straightforward list of the things I loved about this premiere. The sentai team is themed after gelato flavors, which is hilarious; the fight scenes are actually pretty fun and cool-looking; one of the evil minions is a giant bear; Fudo the Red Gelato is King Himbo of Good Boy Mountain; Desumi's little skull mask is cute as heck, and she also has a chonky cat that she loves, which makes her perfect girlfriend material.    Honestly, I only have one real complaint with Love After World Domination, and it isn't even entirely fair to the show's own qualities. It just had the unfortunate luck of coming after Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic on today's schedule, and 99% of every other rom-com anime out there would pale in comparison to that show. Love After World Domination is plenty cute, and plenty funny, but it is standing in the shadow of one of the GOATs that is operating at the peak of its powers, which is bound to make it seem maybe a touch modest in comparison.    I suppose that this is also one of those productions that could easily suffer from diminishing returns, especially if the animation starts to suffer and the show has to rely on the same round of jokes about dating etiquette and Super Sentai tropes. Then again, real Super Sentai series have gotten by on recycling tried and true cliches on a limited budget for, like, 50 years straight, so I doubt LAWD will have too difficult a time at keeping things fresh. Either way, I had a rollicking good time with this premiere, and I'm going to add it to this season's growing list of must-watch comedies.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Love After World Domination is one of those premieres that I enjoyed for the most part but worry about the longevity of the concept. As it stands, the first episode really only has two core jokes—if they can even be called that. The first is the ultra-cute love story between Fudo and Desumi. While they are battlefield enemies engaging in a scandalous relationship, the crux of the humor comes from the fact that neither of them know a thing about romance. They clearly like each other, but are basically resorting to Google to figure out how this “dating” thing works. It's cute, innocent fun with a sprinkle of social commentary (like when it pokes fun at the creepiness of cyber-stalking your crush and how it changes the traditional dating process).    The other core joke of the show is its parody of the Japanese superhero genre, tokusatsu. This is also where the show falters a bit. While its five gelato-flavored heroes and their appropriately themed attacks seem like an attempt to make fun of the general concept of tokusatsu, it's not really out of the realm of believability for an actual toku show to be themed like this. I mean, Kamen Rider Gaim, penned by Madoka Magica creator Gen Urobuchi, was fruit-themed, after all. Moreover, there is no subversion of Japanese superhero tropes here. Everyone is 100% serious about what is going on—from the villains who stand back and make speeches even as the rangers go to town on the low level mooks, to the rangers who are earnest and friendly even when off duty. Because of this, the show feels painfully predictable and almost boring whenever its not solidly focused on the relationship between Fudo and Desumi.    So even though I have a soft spot for both Power Rangers and hero/villain romances, I'm not really as into this anime as I feel I should be. Even within this premiere alone, it feels like the concept is already running out of steam. I don't see myself coming back for more next week, though I may check out a bit of the manga and see if that is able to change my mind.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Move over, Romeo and Juliet. Fudo and Desumi are here to show you how real star-crossed lovers do it: by not just having feuding families, but being on completely opposite sides of a major fight. Or at least a ridiculous fight? Even if the superheroes weren't the Gelato 5 – complete with flavor-themed colors – and the villains seeking to take over the world didn't employ a giant talking bear named Culverin Bear, there's not much about the two warring sides for us to take seriously. Even the people populating the story's world don't – when Gekko attacks a public park, the screams for help from the general public are…let's go with “underwhelming.” Simply put, this is equal parts super sentai sendup and gooey romcom, and it looks like those two things are going to mesh just as well here as they do in the source manga.    The central romance is between Desumi, AKA Reaper Princess, and Fudo, Red Gelato (strawberry flavor). Fudo falls in love at first sight, which is impressive since his “first sight” is of Desumi in her battle “gear,” which consists of fancy lingerie and a face-hiding mask. (So maybe not impressive.) But there's a real sense that it's not so much that he fell in love with what he saw as he did with her fighting skills and her parting words, which are about his battle prowess. Since there's a definite sense that the rest of the Gelato 5 think he's just some muscle head, Desumi's remarks may be the nicest thing anyone's said to him about all that training he's done. Likewise, Fudo's heartfelt confession to her is clearly her first brush with romance and she's flattered and more than a little charmed by his earnestness.    It's a cute mix of tropes made even more fun by their efforts at hiding the fact that they're dating from both Gelato 5 and Gekko, although technically Fudo did get permission from Professor Gelato to ask Desumi out. Not that the good professor knew who Fudo was crushing on when he urged him to go forth and speak his feelings, something Fudo may be realizing in hindsight. Or he may not; Fudo's perhaps not the sharpest tool in the proverbial shed. When you combine that with Desumi's incredible naivete in matters romantic (holding hands practically sends her into a fainting fit), it's the recipe for peach-pink love – at least as far as Pink Gelato's definition of the color goes.    While there are some awkward things about the character designs – specifically the way people fit into their clothes, or don't, as the case may be – this looks better than I was expecting and the animation is up to some flashy fights and over-the-top transformation scenes. As a fan of the manga, I'm happy with how this looks in its first episode, and I'm looking forward to seeing more.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Finally, some good god damn food. Don't get me wrong: I enjoyed Aharen-san wa Hakarenai perfectly fine, and I'm looking forward to some other romcoms that have yet to debut. But I have been craving another goofy-ass show about a pair of idiots blushing their way into the next dimension, and this show has given me all I could ever ask for.    There's really not a whole lot else to dig into here, though. I could try to talk about how hard the show goes on its Super Sentai parody, complete with a full five-person transformation sequence where our gelato-themed Power Rangers sound off increasingly goofy battle cries. But I'm far from an expert on this stuff so all I can say is that I refuse to believe pistachio is “the flavor of peace” no matter how hard Gelato Green insists. And outside of some sharp gags and moments of parody, this entire premiere is just watching our adorable, awkward leads together – either when they're already dating or when Fudo first made his confession. That means most of this episode is just iterations on a single joke that, while funny and well-delivered, also means you have to really like that joke to get onboard with it.    The production does help a lot in keeping that joke fresh, though. Unlike the similarly toku-themed Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department, this show actually has the production values to show off some cool fight choreography to go along with its jokes, and it especially has room to make our dorky central couple expressive and appealing to watch. This is just some A+ romcom blushing, and it makes the two of them tip-toeing through the “steps” of dating fun to watch all on its own. There's even room to add some actual detail to their fanservice, like making sure Desumi has her garters on right to avoid a bathroom death trap. In a year that's already featured World’s End Harem and its horny JPEG artifacts, having cheesecake that actually knows how to properly present itself shouldn't be taken for granted, so if this show's gonna be a little horny I'm glad they actually know what they're doing.    I'm not going to tell you this show is deep or thought-provoking or even particularly romantic, but what I will say is I had a big dumb grin on my face the entire episode. I love these losers and I want to see them go on a hundred secret dates where they suddenly have to turn a kiss into a clashing headbutt to avoid suspicion. I want to see them send flirty texts in code that make it look like threatening letters. This show was made for me, and I plan to embrace it with both arms.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Don't get me wrong: I enjoyed Aharen-san wa Hakarenai perfectly fine, and I'm looking forward to some other romcoms that have yet to debut. But I have been craving another goofy-ass show about a pair of idiots blushing their way into the next dimension, and this show has given me all I could ever ask for.    There's really not a whole lot else to dig into here, though. I could try to talk about how hard the show goes on its Super Sentai parody, complete with a full five-person transformation sequence where our gelato-themed Power Rangers sound off increasingly goofy battle cries. But I'm far from an expert on this stuff so all I can say is that I refuse to believe pistachio is “the flavor of peace” no matter how hard Gelato Green insists. And outside of some sharp gags and moments of parody, this entire premiere is just watching our adorable, awkward leads together – either when they're already dating or when Fudo first made his confession. That means most of this episode is just iterations on a single joke that, while funny and well-delivered, also means you have to really like that joke to get onboard with it.    The production does help a lot in keeping that joke fresh, though. Unlike the similarly toku-themed Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department, this show actually has the production values to show off some cool fight choreography to go along with its jokes, and it especially has room to make our dorky central couple expressive and appealing to watch. This is just some A+ romcom blushing, and it makes the two of them tip-toeing through the “steps” of dating fun to watch all on its own. There's even room to add some actual detail to their fanservice, like making sure Desumi has her garters on right to avoid a bathroom death trap. In a year that's already featured World’s End Harem and its horny JPEG artifacts, having cheesecake that actually knows how to properly present itself shouldn't be taken for granted, so if this show's gonna be a little horny I'm glad they actually know what they're doing.    I'm not going to tell you this show is deep or thought-provoking or even particularly romantic, but what I will say is I had a big dumb grin on my face the entire episode. I love these losers and I want to see them go on a hundred secret dates where they suddenly have to turn a kiss into a clashing headbutt to avoid suspicion. I want to see them send flirty texts in code that make it look like threatening letters. This show was made for me, and I plan to embrace it with both arms.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More     ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 4.0              What is this?   Fudo Aikawa and Desumi Magahara are in love. There's only one small problem: they are mortal enemies. Fudo is the red ranger and leader of the fighting force Gelato 5, while Desumi is the reaper princess of the evil organization Gekko. To make matters worse, neither of them have ever been in a relationship before. They have to keep their budding romance a secret, while figuring out how to be in a relationship and juggle their real life responsibilities along the way.    Love After World Domination is based on Hiroshi Noda and Takahiro Wakamatsu's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?   James Beckett  Rating:                Look, what do you want from me? Love After World Domination is an extremely cute and surprisingly well-produced romantic comedy featuring two catastrophically dorky young lovers that are fighting their way through the awkwardness of their own inexperience because they like each other so gosh darned much, and it's a loving homage/spoof of Super Sentai. This show was literally made specifically for me. I am not a strong man. There was never any chance that I would be able to resist the charms of this one.    I could just make this review a straightforward list of the things I loved about this premiere. The sentai team is themed after gelato flavors, which is hilarious; the fight scenes are actually pretty fun and cool-looking; one of the evil minions is a giant bear; Fudo the Red Gelato is King Himbo of Good Boy Mountain; Desumi's little skull mask is cute as heck, and she also has a chonky cat that she loves, which makes her perfect girlfriend material.    Honestly, I only have one real complaint with Love After World Domination, and it isn't even entirely fair to the show's own qualities. It just had the unfortunate luck of coming after Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic on today's schedule, and 99% of every other rom-com anime out there would pale in comparison to that show. Love After World Domination is plenty cute, and plenty funny, but it is standing in the shadow of one of the GOATs that is operating at the peak of its powers, which is bound to make it seem maybe a touch modest in comparison.    I suppose that this is also one of those productions that could easily suffer from diminishing returns, especially if the animation starts to suffer and the show has to rely on the same round of jokes about dating etiquette and Super Sentai tropes. Then again, real Super Sentai series have gotten by on recycling tried and true cliches on a limited budget for, like, 50 years straight, so I doubt LAWD will have too difficult a time at keeping things fresh. Either way, I had a rollicking good time with this premiere, and I'm going to add it to this season's growing list of must-watch comedies.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Love After World Domination is one of those premieres that I enjoyed for the most part but worry about the longevity of the concept. As it stands, the first episode really only has two core jokes—if they can even be called that. The first is the ultra-cute love story between Fudo and Desumi. While they are battlefield enemies engaging in a scandalous relationship, the crux of the humor comes from the fact that neither of them know a thing about romance. They clearly like each other, but are basically resorting to Google to figure out how this “dating” thing works. It's cute, innocent fun with a sprinkle of social commentary (like when it pokes fun at the creepiness of cyber-stalking your crush and how it changes the traditional dating process).    The other core joke of the show is its parody of the Japanese superhero genre, tokusatsu. This is also where the show falters a bit. While its five gelato-flavored heroes and their appropriately themed attacks seem like an attempt to make fun of the general concept of tokusatsu, it's not really out of the realm of believability for an actual toku show to be themed like this. I mean, Kamen Rider Gaim, penned by Madoka Magica creator Gen Urobuchi, was fruit-themed, after all. Moreover, there is no subversion of Japanese superhero tropes here. Everyone is 100% serious about what is going on—from the villains who stand back and make speeches even as the rangers go to town on the low level mooks, to the rangers who are earnest and friendly even when off duty. Because of this, the show feels painfully predictable and almost boring whenever its not solidly focused on the relationship between Fudo and Desumi.    So even though I have a soft spot for both Power Rangers and hero/villain romances, I'm not really as into this anime as I feel I should be. Even within this premiere alone, it feels like the concept is already running out of steam. I don't see myself coming back for more next week, though I may check out a bit of the manga and see if that is able to change my mind.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Move over, Romeo and Juliet. Fudo and Desumi are here to show you how real star-crossed lovers do it: by not just having feuding families, but being on completely opposite sides of a major fight. Or at least a ridiculous fight? Even if the superheroes weren't the Gelato 5 – complete with flavor-themed colors – and the villains seeking to take over the world didn't employ a giant talking bear named Culverin Bear, there's not much about the two warring sides for us to take seriously. Even the people populating the story's world don't – when Gekko attacks a public park, the screams for help from the general public are…let's go with “underwhelming.” Simply put, this is equal parts super sentai sendup and gooey romcom, and it looks like those two things are going to mesh just as well here as they do in the source manga.    The central romance is between Desumi, AKA Reaper Princess, and Fudo, Red Gelato (strawberry flavor). Fudo falls in love at first sight, which is impressive since his “first sight” is of Desumi in her battle “gear,” which consists of fancy lingerie and a face-hiding mask. (So maybe not impressive.) But there's a real sense that it's not so much that he fell in love with what he saw as he did with her fighting skills and her parting words, which are about his battle prowess. Since there's a definite sense that the rest of the Gelato 5 think he's just some muscle head, Desumi's remarks may be the nicest thing anyone's said to him about all that training he's done. Likewise, Fudo's heartfelt confession to her is clearly her first brush with romance and she's flattered and more than a little charmed by his earnestness.    It's a cute mix of tropes made even more fun by their efforts at hiding the fact that they're dating from both Gelato 5 and Gekko, although technically Fudo did get permission from Professor Gelato to ask Desumi out. Not that the good professor knew who Fudo was crushing on when he urged him to go forth and speak his feelings, something Fudo may be realizing in hindsight. Or he may not; Fudo's perhaps not the sharpest tool in the proverbial shed. When you combine that with Desumi's incredible naivete in matters romantic (holding hands practically sends her into a fainting fit), it's the recipe for peach-pink love – at least as far as Pink Gelato's definition of the color goes.    While there are some awkward things about the character designs – specifically the way people fit into their clothes, or don't, as the case may be – this looks better than I was expecting and the animation is up to some flashy fights and over-the-top transformation scenes.

Even the people populating the story's world don't – when Gekko attacks a public park, the screams for help from the general public are…let's go with “underwhelming.” Simply put, this is equal parts super sentai sendup and gooey romcom, and it looks like those two things are going to mesh just as well here as they do in the source manga.    The central romance is between Desumi, AKA Reaper Princess, and Fudo, Red Gelato (strawberry flavor). Fudo falls in love at first sight, which is impressive since his “first sight” is of Desumi in her battle “gear,” which consists of fancy lingerie and a face-hiding mask. (So maybe not impressive.) But there's a real sense that it's not so much that he fell in love with what he saw as he did with her fighting skills and her parting words, which are about his battle prowess. Since there's a definite sense that the rest of the Gelato 5 think he's just some muscle head, Desumi's remarks may be the nicest thing anyone's said to him about all that training he's done. Likewise, Fudo's heartfelt confession to her is clearly her first brush with romance and she's flattered and more than a little charmed by his earnestness.    It's a cute mix of tropes made even more fun by their efforts at hiding the fact that they're dating from both Gelato 5 and Gekko, although technically Fudo did get permission from Professor Gelato to ask Desumi out. Not that the good professor knew who Fudo was crushing on when he urged him to go forth and speak his feelings, something Fudo may be realizing in hindsight. Or he may not; Fudo's perhaps not the sharpest tool in the proverbial shed. When you combine that with Desumi's incredible naivete in matters romantic (holding hands practically sends her into a fainting fit), it's the recipe for peach-pink love – at least as far as Pink Gelato's definition of the color goes.    While there are some awkward things about the character designs – specifically the way people fit into their clothes, or don't, as the case may be – this looks better than I was expecting and the animation is up to some flashy fights and over-the-top transformation scenes. As a fan of the manga, I'm happy with how this looks in its first episode, and I'm looking forward to seeing more.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Finally, some good god damn food. Don't get me wrong: I enjoyed Aharen-san wa Hakarenai perfectly fine, and I'm looking forward to some other romcoms that have yet to debut. But I have been craving another goofy-ass show about a pair of idiots blushing their way into the next dimension, and this show has given me all I could ever ask for.    There's really not a whole lot else to dig into here, though. I could try to talk about how hard the show goes on its Super Sentai parody, complete with a full five-person transformation sequence where our gelato-themed Power Rangers sound off increasingly goofy battle cries. But I'm far from an expert on this stuff so all I can say is that I refuse to believe pistachio is “the flavor of peace” no matter how hard Gelato Green insists. And outside of some sharp gags and moments of parody, this entire premiere is just watching our adorable, awkward leads together – either when they're already dating or when Fudo first made his confession. That means most of this episode is just iterations on a single joke that, while funny and well-delivered, also means you have to really like that joke to get onboard with it.    The production does help a lot in keeping that joke fresh, though. Unlike the similarly toku-themed Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department, this show actually has the production values to show off some cool fight choreography to go along with its jokes, and it especially has room to make our dorky central couple expressive and appealing to watch. This is just some A+ romcom blushing, and it makes the two of them tip-toeing through the “steps” of dating fun to watch all on its own. There's even room to add some actual detail to their fanservice, like making sure Desumi has her garters on right to avoid a bathroom death trap. In a year that's already featured World’s End Harem and its horny JPEG artifacts, having cheesecake that actually knows how to properly present itself shouldn't be taken for granted, so if this show's gonna be a little horny I'm glad they actually know what they're doing.    I'm not going to tell you this show is deep or thought-provoking or even particularly romantic, but what I will say is I had a big dumb grin on my face the entire episode. I love these losers and I want to see them go on a hundred secret dates where they suddenly have to turn a kiss into a clashing headbutt to avoid suspicion. I want to see them send flirty texts in code that make it look like threatening letters. This show was made for me, and I plan to embrace it with both arms.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives    ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 4.0              What is this?   Fudo Aikawa and Desumi Magahara are in love. There's only one small problem: they are mortal enemies. Fudo is the red ranger and leader of the fighting force Gelato 5, while Desumi is the reaper princess of the evil organization Gekko. To make matters worse, neither of them have ever been in a relationship before. They have to keep their budding romance a secret, while figuring out how to be in a relationship and juggle their real life responsibilities along the way.    Love After World Domination is based on Hiroshi Noda and Takahiro Wakamatsu's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?   James Beckett  Rating:                Look, what do you want from me? Love After World Domination is an extremely cute and surprisingly well-produced romantic comedy featuring two catastrophically dorky young lovers that are fighting their way through the awkwardness of their own inexperience because they like each other so gosh darned much, and it's a loving homage/spoof of Super Sentai. This show was literally made specifically for me. I am not a strong man. There was never any chance that I would be able to resist the charms of this one.    I could just make this review a straightforward list of the things I loved about this premiere. The sentai team is themed after gelato flavors, which is hilarious; the fight scenes are actually pretty fun and cool-looking; one of the evil minions is a giant bear; Fudo the Red Gelato is King Himbo of Good Boy Mountain; Desumi's little skull mask is cute as heck, and she also has a chonky cat that she loves, which makes her perfect girlfriend material.    Honestly, I only have one real complaint with Love After World Domination, and it isn't even entirely fair to the show's own qualities. It just had the unfortunate luck of coming after Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic on today's schedule, and 99% of every other rom-com anime out there would pale in comparison to that show. Love After World Domination is plenty cute, and plenty funny, but it is standing in the shadow of one of the GOATs that is operating at the peak of its powers, which is bound to make it seem maybe a touch modest in comparison.    I suppose that this is also one of those productions that could easily suffer from diminishing returns, especially if the animation starts to suffer and the show has to rely on the same round of jokes about dating etiquette and Super Sentai tropes. Then again, real Super Sentai series have gotten by on recycling tried and true cliches on a limited budget for, like, 50 years straight, so I doubt LAWD will have too difficult a time at keeping things fresh. Either way, I had a rollicking good time with this premiere, and I'm going to add it to this season's growing list of must-watch comedies.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Love After World Domination is one of those premieres that I enjoyed for the most part but worry about the longevity of the concept. As it stands, the first episode really only has two core jokes—if they can even be called that. The first is the ultra-cute love story between Fudo and Desumi. While they are battlefield enemies engaging in a scandalous relationship, the crux of the humor comes from the fact that neither of them know a thing about romance. They clearly like each other, but are basically resorting to Google to figure out how this “dating” thing works. It's cute, innocent fun with a sprinkle of social commentary (like when it pokes fun at the creepiness of cyber-stalking your crush and how it changes the traditional dating process).    The other core joke of the show is its parody of the Japanese superhero genre, tokusatsu. This is also where the show falters a bit. While its five gelato-flavored heroes and their appropriately themed attacks seem like an attempt to make fun of the general concept of tokusatsu, it's not really out of the realm of believability for an actual toku show to be themed like this. I mean, Kamen Rider Gaim, penned by Madoka Magica creator Gen Urobuchi, was fruit-themed, after all. Moreover, there is no subversion of Japanese superhero tropes here. Everyone is 100% serious about what is going on—from the villains who stand back and make speeches even as the rangers go to town on the low level mooks, to the rangers who are earnest and friendly even when off duty. Because of this, the show feels painfully predictable and almost boring whenever its not solidly focused on the relationship between Fudo and Desumi.    So even though I have a soft spot for both Power Rangers and hero/villain romances, I'm not really as into this anime as I feel I should be. Even within this premiere alone, it feels like the concept is already running out of steam. I don't see myself coming back for more next week, though I may check out a bit of the manga and see if that is able to change my mind.

I mean, Kamen Rider Gaim, penned by Madoka Magica creator Gen Urobuchi, was fruit-themed, after all. Moreover, there is no subversion of Japanese superhero tropes here. Everyone is 100% serious about what is going on—from the villains who stand back and make speeches even as the rangers go to town on the low level mooks, to the rangers who are earnest and friendly even when off duty. Because of this, the show feels painfully predictable and almost boring whenever its not solidly focused on the relationship between Fudo and Desumi.    So even though I have a soft spot for both Power Rangers and hero/villain romances, I'm not really as into this anime as I feel I should be. Even within this premiere alone, it feels like the concept is already running out of steam. I don't see myself coming back for more next week, though I may check out a bit of the manga and see if that is able to change my mind.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Move over, Romeo and Juliet. Fudo and Desumi are here to show you how real star-crossed lovers do it: by not just having feuding families, but being on completely opposite sides of a major fight. Or at least a ridiculous fight? Even if the superheroes weren't the Gelato 5 – complete with flavor-themed colors – and the villains seeking to take over the world didn't employ a giant talking bear named Culverin Bear, there's not much about the two warring sides for us to take seriously. Even the people populating the story's world don't – when Gekko attacks a public park, the screams for help from the general public are…let's go with “underwhelming.” Simply put, this is equal parts super sentai sendup and gooey romcom, and it looks like those two things are going to mesh just as well here as they do in the source manga.    The central romance is between Desumi, AKA Reaper Princess, and Fudo, Red Gelato (strawberry flavor). Fudo falls in love at first sight, which is impressive since his “first sight” is of Desumi in her battle “gear,” which consists of fancy lingerie and a face-hiding mask. (So maybe not impressive.) But there's a real sense that it's not so much that he fell in love with what he saw as he did with her fighting skills and her parting words, which are about his battle prowess. Since there's a definite sense that the rest of the Gelato 5 think he's just some muscle head, Desumi's remarks may be the nicest thing anyone's said to him about all that training he's done. Likewise, Fudo's heartfelt confession to her is clearly her first brush with romance and she's flattered and more than a little charmed by his earnestness.    It's a cute mix of tropes made even more fun by their efforts at hiding the fact that they're dating from both Gelato 5 and Gekko, although technically Fudo did get permission from Professor Gelato to ask Desumi out. Not that the good professor knew who Fudo was crushing on when he urged him to go forth and speak his feelings, something Fudo may be realizing in hindsight. Or he may not; Fudo's perhaps not the sharpest tool in the proverbial shed. When you combine that with Desumi's incredible naivete in matters romantic (holding hands practically sends her into a fainting fit), it's the recipe for peach-pink love – at least as far as Pink Gelato's definition of the color goes.    While there are some awkward things about the character designs – specifically the way people fit into their clothes, or don't, as the case may be – this looks better than I was expecting and the animation is up to some flashy fights and over-the-top transformation scenes. As a fan of the manga, I'm happy with how this looks in its first episode, and I'm looking forward to seeing more.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Finally, some good god damn food. Don't get me wrong: I enjoyed Aharen-san wa Hakarenai perfectly fine, and I'm looking forward to some other romcoms that have yet to debut. But I have been craving another goofy-ass show about a pair of idiots blushing their way into the next dimension, and this show has given me all I could ever ask for.    There's really not a whole lot else to dig into here, though. I could try to talk about how hard the show goes on its Super Sentai parody, complete with a full five-person transformation sequence where our gelato-themed Power Rangers sound off increasingly goofy battle cries. But I'm far from an expert on this stuff so all I can say is that I refuse to believe pistachio is “the flavor of peace” no matter how hard Gelato Green insists. And outside of some sharp gags and moments of parody, this entire premiere is just watching our adorable, awkward leads together – either when they're already dating or when Fudo first made his confession. That means most of this episode is just iterations on a single joke that, while funny and well-delivered, also means you have to really like that joke to get onboard with it.    The production does help a lot in keeping that joke fresh, though. Unlike the similarly toku-themed Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department, this show actually has the production values to show off some cool fight choreography to go along with its jokes, and it especially has room to make our dorky central couple expressive and appealing to watch. This is just some A+ romcom blushing, and it makes the two of them tip-toeing through the “steps” of dating fun to watch all on its own. There's even room to add some actual detail to their fanservice, like making sure Desumi has her garters on right to avoid a bathroom death trap. In a year that's already featured World’s End Harem and its horny JPEG artifacts, having cheesecake that actually knows how to properly present itself shouldn't be taken for granted, so if this show's gonna be a little horny I'm glad they actually know what they're doing.    I'm not going to tell you this show is deep or thought-provoking or even particularly romantic, but what I will say is I had a big dumb grin on my face the entire episode. I love these losers and I want to see them go on a hundred secret dates where they suddenly have to turn a kiss into a clashing headbutt to avoid suspicion. I want to see them send flirty texts in code that make it look like threatening letters. This show was made for me, and I plan to embrace it with both arms.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody   Apr  7th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody ?                     Community score: 3.5              What is this?   The greatest demon lord in all of history, Varvatos, has reigned for several millennia as an absolute ruler. Now, there's only one thing left for him to do: enjoy the life of an average commoner. When he's reincarnated as a villager in a non-descript town, everything seems to be going as he hoped, but there's just one slight problem—even when he holds back, Varvatos is still too strong. Soon, rumors about him spread, and he's approached by all sorts of men, women, and assailants.    The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody is based on Myōjin Katō's novels and streams on Crunchyroll.      How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Hands down, this was one of the cringiest 22 minutes of anime I have ever watched—and I am certain that is by design. Ard is a reincarnated Demon Lord who had no equals in his past life and, thus, no friends. He sees his position as the reason he was friendless, but as we see in this episode, that's not really the case.    Rather, Ard's problem is that he lacks social skills. And like many who share that problem, he is searching for a set of hard and fast rules to follow when meeting people. Unfortunately, no such thing exists. This is only exacerbated by his tendency to deal in extremes. When talking down to potential friends as their superior doesn't get the results he wants, he talks like a knight addressing a princess. Worse still is that he keeps trying over and over on the same people. It's trying to cross a bridge that is already burnt. He's already a wierdo in their eyes, yet Ard truly believes if he can find the right words, all will work out just as he intends.    And let's face it, to anyone who is or was socially awkward, Ard's struggles are relatable—that's the main reason it's so cringey. In fact, even the whole thing where he badgers Litz incessantly, might have been cute if it weren't for the fact that he is a 40+ year-old man stalking a literal child. Moreover, Ard doesn't really learn his lesson. Instead, he lucks into becoming Litz's friend by rescuing her from danger and getting her to open up about being friendless herself.    Lacking any kind of teachable moral or character growth, I'm not sure what this anime is trying to say or where it plans on going in the future. This might have been one of those shows that should have started in media res, because as it stands now, I have no idea.       Caitlin Moore  Rating:                You know, I have to hand it to light novel anime: every time a cliché dies out, a new one pops up to take its place. How many series in the last few years have there been where a powerful mage (often, but not always a demon lord) decides he's weary of his life at the top and decides to be reincarnated? And then, in his new era, he discovers that magic has degraded significantly since his reign but he's just as powerful as ever? Also he struggles socially but has one or two devoted female friends/followers? I'm ready to declare this overdone, and The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody is just yet another entry into the trend.    If you're into series of this ilk, it's not too bad a premiere. Ard's social struggles come from a mix of overenthusiasm and lack of skill, which is much more entertaining than his stone-faced equivalents. It's a little puzzling, though, how he ended up ten years old, raised by a nice, normal family in what appears to be a good neighborhood full of children, seemingly without ever having talked to a child his age. The effect is more that Ard sprung fully formed into his ten-year-old body, rather than having been born and raised in it. Maybe it's intentional? But the flashbacks to him studying magic and practicing sword indicate that no, he really is ten years old. It even turns out that the girl he spent most of the episode pursuing is the daughter of his parents' best friend, who he has somehow never met before despite being familiar with her father.    Speaking of Ireena, his dogged pursuit of her is what gave me the most misgivings about the episode. It's played for comedy, but I'm not comfortable with a little boy chasing after a little girl while she screams for him to leave her alone. When this became the main joke about ten minutes in, I had to fight not to check out. Even without the cultural baggage, it was repetitive and unfunny, and went on for almost half the episode. When she was surrounded by goblins and obliquely threatened with rape (they only showed little girls running from them), it took all my power not to turn off the episode.    The other parts of the episode aren't too bad. Ard's parents seem like good, caring people, as does Ireena's father. The jokes about Ard trying and failing to connect to the other children aren't especially funny, but some of the visual gags got a chuckle out of me. But boy, does he spend a lot of time chasing Ireena. No thanks.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I remember roughly two things from reading the first light novel this series is based on: that it was very dull and that the title was awfully misleading. While I don't feel that this was quite as boring as I thought the book was, the title thing is still an issue, albeit a nit-picky one, because while Ard is absolutely something of a nobody, he's in no way at all typical. I suppose that could be the point – that in his previous life as Varvatos, a human who won the appellation of “demon lord” for his prowess and fear factor, Ard was so out of touch with what “normal” and “typical” were that when he was reborn with his memories intact, he remained blissfully ignorant. But I can't help but feel that Ard's absurd levels of power and overwrought manner of speaking isn't helping the series that much, instead giving him leave to be the typical overpowered protagonist, albeit one with the social skills of a radish.    There is something a little sad about that, of course. Varvatos seems to have been in the same position as Leo from I'm Quitting Heroing in that his skill only served to make people fear him. Varvatos got to rule while Leo was kicked out of the kingdom, but both seem to be looking for friendship and acceptance that isn't forthcoming. As Ard, the former demon lord at least has some very loving parents (even if they seem more into each other than invested in their kid), but that doesn't translate into him having any luck at making friends. Largely that's because he's the most unchildlike child in the entire village – even Ireena (who is probably the reincarnation of Lydia, Varvatos' queen) does a better job being a kid while being ludicrously powerful; Ard is basically the anime incarnation of the old “hello, fellow kids” meme. Presumably this is meant to be funny, but I'm with the rest of the village children that it comes off as a bit creepy – especially once Ard focuses his friendly ardor on Ireena. Of course, once they “grow up” Ireena's doing the old “sneak into his bed when she comes to see him in the morning” routine, so my sense of creepy may be skewed.    But hey, if you're not content to watch a reborn adult continue acting like an adult in a child's body while exercising a ridiculous amount of magical power, don't worry! Because it looks like we're headed into magical school territory very soon. Even if this looked better or had a better executed story it's hard not to compare it to roughly half a dozen other similar shows that had slightly better hooks, and while it isn't precisely a bad episode, it's also not really a good one either. Since the story does look to be headed in a relatively different direction with episode two, it may be worth the three episode test to see where the plot settles, but otherwise there really isn't much here to recommend it, the entertaining scene of Ard snapping his fingers and frying monster hordes behind him notwithstanding.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               It's always weird when a show manages to exceed your expectations, but still can't make it all the way up the stairs to being good. I went into The Greatest Demon Lord blah blah blah expecting basically the same show as last season's The Strongest Sage With the Weakest Crest, and that wound up being half true. There's still a plainfaced, OP potato boy at the center of things who has all his memories of being the biggest badass to ever wield a magic circle, and by the end of this episode he's on his way to both magic school and a harem of adoring anime girls to impress. But along the way there are at least a few sparks of charm that made it an overall more memorable watch than a lot of these kinds of shows.    Pretty much all of that comes down to Ard and his pre-pubescent demon lord shtick. The guy talks like a total weenie, and seeing a grown man in a child's body completely fumble through basic conversation is pretty funny. Small gags like monsters attacking him in the background only to be set ablaze by a snap of the fingers are silly enough to complement the goofy tone of his quest for friendship without being overbearing. And there's genuinely something funny about his first friend hating his guts for most of the premiere and fleeing from him in the streets. It's not laugh-out-loud funny, and if you start thinking about it you do feel a little icky about a grown man chasing a little girl around in spite of her constant protests, but on a basic comedy level it at least gives this show some personality.    That's something it's desperately lacking everywhere else. The visuals are cheap and rough, failing to sell any of the action or even the basic visual of Ard flying. Character designs are that particular kind of generic that would let you slot them into damn near any LN fantasy world without trouble, and they leave basically no impression. Once the jokes stop and the show tries to be serious and emotional, it becomes a slog. Ard and Ireena are flat and boring archetypes, and despite the show's best(?) efforts there's no weight to their eventual friendship, especially once we skip to their teenage years and she's clearly in love with him, as all anime girls must be in the presence of a potatoman.    So yeah, “better than expected” is sadly not the same as “good” and this premiere is here to prove it. This wasn't as hefty a chore as I figured going in, but that just means it felt like taking out the trash rather than mowing the lawn.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review                Odd Taxi: In the Woods   Apr 17, 00:00                 anime    By cleverly reframing its narrative around a series of interviews with the supporting cast, Odd Taxi: In the Woods succeeds where most recap films fail: it's an artistically cohesive film in its own right. ― Odd Taxi was 2021's sleeper anime hit, telling an intricate, original mystery that kept viewers guessing every week.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody   Apr  7th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody ?                     Community score: 3.5              What is this?   The greatest demon lord in all of history, Varvatos, has reigned for several millennia as an absolute ruler. Now, there's only one thing left for him to do: enjoy the life of an average commoner. When he's reincarnated as a villager in a non-descript town, everything seems to be going as he hoped, but there's just one slight problem—even when he holds back, Varvatos is still too strong. Soon, rumors about him spread, and he's approached by all sorts of men, women, and assailants.    The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody is based on Myōjin Katō's novels and streams on Crunchyroll.      How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Hands down, this was one of the cringiest 22 minutes of anime I have ever watched—and I am certain that is by design. Ard is a reincarnated Demon Lord who had no equals in his past life and, thus, no friends. He sees his position as the reason he was friendless, but as we see in this episode, that's not really the case.    Rather, Ard's problem is that he lacks social skills. And like many who share that problem, he is searching for a set of hard and fast rules to follow when meeting people. Unfortunately, no such thing exists. This is only exacerbated by his tendency to deal in extremes. When talking down to potential friends as their superior doesn't get the results he wants, he talks like a knight addressing a princess. Worse still is that he keeps trying over and over on the same people. It's trying to cross a bridge that is already burnt. He's already a wierdo in their eyes, yet Ard truly believes if he can find the right words, all will work out just as he intends.    And let's face it, to anyone who is or was socially awkward, Ard's struggles are relatable—that's the main reason it's so cringey. In fact, even the whole thing where he badgers Litz incessantly, might have been cute if it weren't for the fact that he is a 40+ year-old man stalking a literal child. Moreover, Ard doesn't really learn his lesson. Instead, he lucks into becoming Litz's friend by rescuing her from danger and getting her to open up about being friendless herself.    Lacking any kind of teachable moral or character growth, I'm not sure what this anime is trying to say or where it plans on going in the future. This might have been one of those shows that should have started in media res, because as it stands now, I have no idea.       Caitlin Moore  Rating:                You know, I have to hand it to light novel anime: every time a cliché dies out, a new one pops up to take its place. How many series in the last few years have there been where a powerful mage (often, but not always a demon lord) decides he's weary of his life at the top and decides to be reincarnated? And then, in his new era, he discovers that magic has degraded significantly since his reign but he's just as powerful as ever? Also he struggles socially but has one or two devoted female friends/followers? I'm ready to declare this overdone, and The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody is just yet another entry into the trend.    If you're into series of this ilk, it's not too bad a premiere. Ard's social struggles come from a mix of overenthusiasm and lack of skill, which is much more entertaining than his stone-faced equivalents. It's a little puzzling, though, how he ended up ten years old, raised by a nice, normal family in what appears to be a good neighborhood full of children, seemingly without ever having talked to a child his age. The effect is more that Ard sprung fully formed into his ten-year-old body, rather than having been born and raised in it. Maybe it's intentional? But the flashbacks to him studying magic and practicing sword indicate that no, he really is ten years old. It even turns out that the girl he spent most of the episode pursuing is the daughter of his parents' best friend, who he has somehow never met before despite being familiar with her father.    Speaking of Ireena, his dogged pursuit of her is what gave me the most misgivings about the episode. It's played for comedy, but I'm not comfortable with a little boy chasing after a little girl while she screams for him to leave her alone. When this became the main joke about ten minutes in, I had to fight not to check out. Even without the cultural baggage, it was repetitive and unfunny, and went on for almost half the episode. When she was surrounded by goblins and obliquely threatened with rape (they only showed little girls running from them), it took all my power not to turn off the episode.    The other parts of the episode aren't too bad. Ard's parents seem like good, caring people, as does Ireena's father. The jokes about Ard trying and failing to connect to the other children aren't especially funny, but some of the visual gags got a chuckle out of me. But boy, does he spend a lot of time chasing Ireena. No thanks.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I remember roughly two things from reading the first light novel this series is based on: that it was very dull and that the title was awfully misleading. While I don't feel that this was quite as boring as I thought the book was, the title thing is still an issue, albeit a nit-picky one, because while Ard is absolutely something of a nobody, he's in no way at all typical. I suppose that could be the point – that in his previous life as Varvatos, a human who won the appellation of “demon lord” for his prowess and fear factor, Ard was so out of touch with what “normal” and “typical” were that when he was reborn with his memories intact, he remained blissfully ignorant. But I can't help but feel that Ard's absurd levels of power and overwrought manner of speaking isn't helping the series that much, instead giving him leave to be the typical overpowered protagonist, albeit one with the social skills of a radish.    There is something a little sad about that, of course. Varvatos seems to have been in the same position as Leo from I'm Quitting Heroing in that his skill only served to make people fear him. Varvatos got to rule while Leo was kicked out of the kingdom, but both seem to be looking for friendship and acceptance that isn't forthcoming. As Ard, the former demon lord at least has some very loving parents (even if they seem more into each other than invested in their kid), but that doesn't translate into him having any luck at making friends. Largely that's because he's the most unchildlike child in the entire village – even Ireena (who is probably the reincarnation of Lydia, Varvatos' queen) does a better job being a kid while being ludicrously powerful; Ard is basically the anime incarnation of the old “hello, fellow kids” meme. Presumably this is meant to be funny, but I'm with the rest of the village children that it comes off as a bit creepy – especially once Ard focuses his friendly ardor on Ireena. Of course, once they “grow up” Ireena's doing the old “sneak into his bed when she comes to see him in the morning” routine, so my sense of creepy may be skewed.    But hey, if you're not content to watch a reborn adult continue acting like an adult in a child's body while exercising a ridiculous amount of magical power, don't worry! Because it looks like we're headed into magical school territory very soon. Even if this looked better or had a better executed story it's hard not to compare it to roughly half a dozen other similar shows that had slightly better hooks, and while it isn't precisely a bad episode, it's also not really a good one either. Since the story does look to be headed in a relatively different direction with episode two, it may be worth the three episode test to see where the plot settles, but otherwise there really isn't much here to recommend it, the entertaining scene of Ard snapping his fingers and frying monster hordes behind him notwithstanding.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               It's always weird when a show manages to exceed your expectations, but still can't make it all the way up the stairs to being good. I went into The Greatest Demon Lord blah blah blah expecting basically the same show as last season's The Strongest Sage With the Weakest Crest, and that wound up being half true. There's still a plainfaced, OP potato boy at the center of things who has all his memories of being the biggest badass to ever wield a magic circle, and by the end of this episode he's on his way to both magic school and a harem of adoring anime girls to impress. But along the way there are at least a few sparks of charm that made it an overall more memorable watch than a lot of these kinds of shows.    Pretty much all of that comes down to Ard and his pre-pubescent demon lord shtick. The guy talks like a total weenie, and seeing a grown man in a child's body completely fumble through basic conversation is pretty funny. Small gags like monsters attacking him in the background only to be set ablaze by a snap of the fingers are silly enough to complement the goofy tone of his quest for friendship without being overbearing. And there's genuinely something funny about his first friend hating his guts for most of the premiere and fleeing from him in the streets. It's not laugh-out-loud funny, and if you start thinking about it you do feel a little icky about a grown man chasing a little girl around in spite of her constant protests, but on a basic comedy level it at least gives this show some personality.    That's something it's desperately lacking everywhere else. The visuals are cheap and rough, failing to sell any of the action or even the basic visual of Ard flying. Character designs are that particular kind of generic that would let you slot them into damn near any LN fantasy world without trouble, and they leave basically no impression. Once the jokes stop and the show tries to be serious and emotional, it becomes a slog. Ard and Ireena are flat and boring archetypes, and despite the show's best(?) efforts there's no weight to their eventual friendship, especially once we skip to their teenage years and she's clearly in love with him, as all anime girls must be in the presence of a potatoman.    So yeah, “better than expected” is sadly not the same as “good” and this premiere is here to prove it. This wasn't as hefty a chore as I figured going in, but that just means it felt like taking out the trash rather than mowing the lawn.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review                Odd Taxi: In the Woods   Apr 17, 00:00                 anime    By cleverly reframing its narrative around a series of interviews with the supporting cast, Odd Taxi: In the Woods succeeds where most recap films fail: it's an artistically cohesive film in its own right. ― Odd Taxi was 2021's sleeper anime hit, telling an intricate, original mystery that kept viewers guessing every week.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody   Apr  7th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody ?                     Community score: 3.5              What is this?   The greatest demon lord in all of history, Varvatos, has reigned for several millennia as an absolute ruler. Now, there's only one thing left for him to do: enjoy the life of an average commoner. When he's reincarnated as a villager in a non-descript town, everything seems to be going as he hoped, but there's just one slight problem—even when he holds back, Varvatos is still too strong. Soon, rumors about him spread, and he's approached by all sorts of men, women, and assailants.    The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody is based on Myōjin Katō's novels and streams on Crunchyroll.      How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Hands down, this was one of the cringiest 22 minutes of anime I have ever watched—and I am certain that is by design. Ard is a reincarnated Demon Lord who had no equals in his past life and, thus, no friends. He sees his position as the reason he was friendless, but as we see in this episode, that's not really the case.    Rather, Ard's problem is that he lacks social skills. And like many who share that problem, he is searching for a set of hard and fast rules to follow when meeting people. Unfortunately, no such thing exists. This is only exacerbated by his tendency to deal in extremes. When talking down to potential friends as their superior doesn't get the results he wants, he talks like a knight addressing a princess. Worse still is that he keeps trying over and over on the same people. It's trying to cross a bridge that is already burnt. He's already a wierdo in their eyes, yet Ard truly believes if he can find the right words, all will work out just as he intends.    And let's face it, to anyone who is or was socially awkward, Ard's struggles are relatable—that's the main reason it's so cringey. In fact, even the whole thing where he badgers Litz incessantly, might have been cute if it weren't for the fact that he is a 40+ year-old man stalking a literal child. Moreover, Ard doesn't really learn his lesson. Instead, he lucks into becoming Litz's friend by rescuing her from danger and getting her to open up about being friendless herself.    Lacking any kind of teachable moral or character growth, I'm not sure what this anime is trying to say or where it plans on going in the future. This might have been one of those shows that should have started in media res, because as it stands now, I have no idea.       Caitlin Moore  Rating:                You know, I have to hand it to light novel anime: every time a cliché dies out, a new one pops up to take its place. How many series in the last few years have there been where a powerful mage (often, but not always a demon lord) decides he's weary of his life at the top and decides to be reincarnated? And then, in his new era, he discovers that magic has degraded significantly since his reign but he's just as powerful as ever? Also he struggles socially but has one or two devoted female friends/followers? I'm ready to declare this overdone, and The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody is just yet another entry into the trend.    If you're into series of this ilk, it's not too bad a premiere. Ard's social struggles come from a mix of overenthusiasm and lack of skill, which is much more entertaining than his stone-faced equivalents. It's a little puzzling, though, how he ended up ten years old, raised by a nice, normal family in what appears to be a good neighborhood full of children, seemingly without ever having talked to a child his age. The effect is more that Ard sprung fully formed into his ten-year-old body, rather than having been born and raised in it. Maybe it's intentional? But the flashbacks to him studying magic and practicing sword indicate that no, he really is ten years old. It even turns out that the girl he spent most of the episode pursuing is the daughter of his parents' best friend, who he has somehow never met before despite being familiar with her father.    Speaking of Ireena, his dogged pursuit of her is what gave me the most misgivings about the episode. It's played for comedy, but I'm not comfortable with a little boy chasing after a little girl while she screams for him to leave her alone. When this became the main joke about ten minutes in, I had to fight not to check out. Even without the cultural baggage, it was repetitive and unfunny, and went on for almost half the episode. When she was surrounded by goblins and obliquely threatened with rape (they only showed little girls running from them), it took all my power not to turn off the episode.    The other parts of the episode aren't too bad. Ard's parents seem like good, caring people, as does Ireena's father. The jokes about Ard trying and failing to connect to the other children aren't especially funny, but some of the visual gags got a chuckle out of me. But boy, does he spend a lot of time chasing Ireena. No thanks.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I remember roughly two things from reading the first light novel this series is based on: that it was very dull and that the title was awfully misleading. While I don't feel that this was quite as boring as I thought the book was, the title thing is still an issue, albeit a nit-picky one, because while Ard is absolutely something of a nobody, he's in no way at all typical. I suppose that could be the point – that in his previous life as Varvatos, a human who won the appellation of “demon lord” for his prowess and fear factor, Ard was so out of touch with what “normal” and “typical” were that when he was reborn with his memories intact, he remained blissfully ignorant. But I can't help but feel that Ard's absurd levels of power and overwrought manner of speaking isn't helping the series that much, instead giving him leave to be the typical overpowered protagonist, albeit one with the social skills of a radish.    There is something a little sad about that, of course. Varvatos seems to have been in the same position as Leo from I'm Quitting Heroing in that his skill only served to make people fear him. Varvatos got to rule while Leo was kicked out of the kingdom, but both seem to be looking for friendship and acceptance that isn't forthcoming. As Ard, the former demon lord at least has some very loving parents (even if they seem more into each other than invested in their kid), but that doesn't translate into him having any luck at making friends. Largely that's because he's the most unchildlike child in the entire village – even Ireena (who is probably the reincarnation of Lydia, Varvatos' queen) does a better job being a kid while being ludicrously powerful; Ard is basically the anime incarnation of the old “hello, fellow kids” meme. Presumably this is meant to be funny, but I'm with the rest of the village children that it comes off as a bit creepy – especially once Ard focuses his friendly ardor on Ireena. Of course, once they “grow up” Ireena's doing the old “sneak into his bed when she comes to see him in the morning” routine, so my sense of creepy may be skewed.    But hey, if you're not content to watch a reborn adult continue acting like an adult in a child's body while exercising a ridiculous amount of magical power, don't worry! Because it looks like we're headed into magical school territory very soon. Even if this looked better or had a better executed story it's hard not to compare it to roughly half a dozen other similar shows that had slightly better hooks, and while it isn't precisely a bad episode, it's also not really a good one either. Since the story does look to be headed in a relatively different direction with episode two, it may be worth the three episode test to see where the plot settles, but otherwise there really isn't much here to recommend it, the entertaining scene of Ard snapping his fingers and frying monster hordes behind him notwithstanding.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               It's always weird when a show manages to exceed your expectations, but still can't make it all the way up the stairs to being good. I went into The Greatest Demon Lord blah blah blah expecting basically the same show as last season's The Strongest Sage With the Weakest Crest, and that wound up being half true. There's still a plainfaced, OP potato boy at the center of things who has all his memories of being the biggest badass to ever wield a magic circle, and by the end of this episode he's on his way to both magic school and a harem of adoring anime girls to impress. But along the way there are at least a few sparks of charm that made it an overall more memorable watch than a lot of these kinds of shows.    Pretty much all of that comes down to Ard and his pre-pubescent demon lord shtick. The guy talks like a total weenie, and seeing a grown man in a child's body completely fumble through basic conversation is pretty funny. Small gags like monsters attacking him in the background only to be set ablaze by a snap of the fingers are silly enough to complement the goofy tone of his quest for friendship without being overbearing. And there's genuinely something funny about his first friend hating his guts for most of the premiere and fleeing from him in the streets. It's not laugh-out-loud funny, and if you start thinking about it you do feel a little icky about a grown man chasing a little girl around in spite of her constant protests, but on a basic comedy level it at least gives this show some personality.    That's something it's desperately lacking everywhere else. The visuals are cheap and rough, failing to sell any of the action or even the basic visual of Ard flying. Character designs are that particular kind of generic that would let you slot them into damn near any LN fantasy world without trouble, and they leave basically no impression. Once the jokes stop and the show tries to be serious and emotional, it becomes a slog. Ard and Ireena are flat and boring archetypes, and despite the show's best(?) efforts there's no weight to their eventual friendship, especially once we skip to their teenage years and she's clearly in love with him, as all anime girls must be in the presence of a potatoman.    So yeah, “better than expected” is sadly not the same as “good” and this premiere is here to prove it. This wasn't as hefty a chore as I figured going in, but that just means it felt like taking out the trash rather than mowing the lawn.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review                Odd Taxi: In the Woods   Apr 17, 00:00                 anime    By cleverly reframing its narrative around a series of interviews with the supporting cast, Odd Taxi: In the Woods succeeds where most recap films fail: it's an artistically cohesive film in its own right. ― Odd Taxi was 2021's sleeper anime hit, telling an intricate, original mystery that kept viewers guessing every week.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody   Apr  7th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody ?                     Community score: 3.5              What is this?   The greatest demon lord in all of history, Varvatos, has reigned for several millennia as an absolute ruler. Now, there's only one thing left for him to do: enjoy the life of an average commoner. When he's reincarnated as a villager in a non-descript town, everything seems to be going as he hoped, but there's just one slight problem—even when he holds back, Varvatos is still too strong. Soon, rumors about him spread, and he's approached by all sorts of men, women, and assailants.    The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody is based on Myōjin Katō's novels and streams on Crunchyroll.      How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Hands down, this was one of the cringiest 22 minutes of anime I have ever watched—and I am certain that is by design. Ard is a reincarnated Demon Lord who had no equals in his past life and, thus, no friends. He sees his position as the reason he was friendless, but as we see in this episode, that's not really the case.    Rather, Ard's problem is that he lacks social skills. And like many who share that problem, he is searching for a set of hard and fast rules to follow when meeting people. Unfortunately, no such thing exists. This is only exacerbated by his tendency to deal in extremes. When talking down to potential friends as their superior doesn't get the results he wants, he talks like a knight addressing a princess. Worse still is that he keeps trying over and over on the same people. It's trying to cross a bridge that is already burnt. He's already a wierdo in their eyes, yet Ard truly believes if he can find the right words, all will work out just as he intends.    And let's face it, to anyone who is or was socially awkward, Ard's struggles are relatable—that's the main reason it's so cringey. In fact, even the whole thing where he badgers Litz incessantly, might have been cute if it weren't for the fact that he is a 40+ year-old man stalking a literal child. Moreover, Ard doesn't really learn his lesson. Instead, he lucks into becoming Litz's friend by rescuing her from danger and getting her to open up about being friendless herself.    Lacking any kind of teachable moral or character growth, I'm not sure what this anime is trying to say or where it plans on going in the future. This might have been one of those shows that should have started in media res, because as it stands now, I have no idea.       Caitlin Moore  Rating:                You know, I have to hand it to light novel anime: every time a cliché dies out, a new one pops up to take its place. How many series in the last few years have there been where a powerful mage (often, but not always a demon lord) decides he's weary of his life at the top and decides to be reincarnated? And then, in his new era, he discovers that magic has degraded significantly since his reign but he's just as powerful as ever? Also he struggles socially but has one or two devoted female friends/followers? I'm ready to declare this overdone, and The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody is just yet another entry into the trend.    If you're into series of this ilk, it's not too bad a premiere. Ard's social struggles come from a mix of overenthusiasm and lack of skill, which is much more entertaining than his stone-faced equivalents. It's a little puzzling, though, how he ended up ten years old, raised by a nice, normal family in what appears to be a good neighborhood full of children, seemingly without ever having talked to a child his age. The effect is more that Ard sprung fully formed into his ten-year-old body, rather than having been born and raised in it. Maybe it's intentional? But the flashbacks to him studying magic and practicing sword indicate that no, he really is ten years old. It even turns out that the girl he spent most of the episode pursuing is the daughter of his parents' best friend, who he has somehow never met before despite being familiar with her father.    Speaking of Ireena, his dogged pursuit of her is what gave me the most misgivings about the episode. It's played for comedy, but I'm not comfortable with a little boy chasing after a little girl while she screams for him to leave her alone. When this became the main joke about ten minutes in, I had to fight not to check out. Even without the cultural baggage, it was repetitive and unfunny, and went on for almost half the episode. When she was surrounded by goblins and obliquely threatened with rape (they only showed little girls running from them), it took all my power not to turn off the episode.    The other parts of the episode aren't too bad. Ard's parents seem like good, caring people, as does Ireena's father. The jokes about Ard trying and failing to connect to the other children aren't especially funny, but some of the visual gags got a chuckle out of me. But boy, does he spend a lot of time chasing Ireena. No thanks.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I remember roughly two things from reading the first light novel this series is based on: that it was very dull and that the title was awfully misleading. While I don't feel that this was quite as boring as I thought the book was, the title thing is still an issue, albeit a nit-picky one, because while Ard is absolutely something of a nobody, he's in no way at all typical. I suppose that could be the point – that in his previous life as Varvatos, a human who won the appellation of “demon lord” for his prowess and fear factor, Ard was so out of touch with what “normal” and “typical” were that when he was reborn with his memories intact, he remained blissfully ignorant. But I can't help but feel that Ard's absurd levels of power and overwrought manner of speaking isn't helping the series that much, instead giving him leave to be the typical overpowered protagonist, albeit one with the social skills of a radish.    There is something a little sad about that, of course. Varvatos seems to have been in the same position as Leo from I'm Quitting Heroing in that his skill only served to make people fear him. Varvatos got to rule while Leo was kicked out of the kingdom, but both seem to be looking for friendship and acceptance that isn't forthcoming. As Ard, the former demon lord at least has some very loving parents (even if they seem more into each other than invested in their kid), but that doesn't translate into him having any luck at making friends. Largely that's because he's the most unchildlike child in the entire village – even Ireena (who is probably the reincarnation of Lydia, Varvatos' queen) does a better job being a kid while being ludicrously powerful; Ard is basically the anime incarnation of the old “hello, fellow kids” meme. Presumably this is meant to be funny, but I'm with the rest of the village children that it comes off as a bit creepy – especially once Ard focuses his friendly ardor on Ireena. Of course, once they “grow up” Ireena's doing the old “sneak into his bed when she comes to see him in the morning” routine, so my sense of creepy may be skewed.    But hey, if you're not content to watch a reborn adult continue acting like an adult in a child's body while exercising a ridiculous amount of magical power, don't worry! Because it looks like we're headed into magical school territory very soon. Even if this looked better or had a better executed story it's hard not to compare it to roughly half a dozen other similar shows that had slightly better hooks, and while it isn't precisely a bad episode, it's also not really a good one either. Since the story does look to be headed in a relatively different direction with episode two, it may be worth the three episode test to see where the plot settles, but otherwise there really isn't much here to recommend it, the entertaining scene of Ard snapping his fingers and frying monster hordes behind him notwithstanding.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               It's always weird when a show manages to exceed your expectations, but still can't make it all the way up the stairs to being good. I went into The Greatest Demon Lord blah blah blah expecting basically the same show as last season's The Strongest Sage With the Weakest Crest, and that wound up being half true. There's still a plainfaced, OP potato boy at the center of things who has all his memories of being the biggest badass to ever wield a magic circle, and by the end of this episode he's on his way to both magic school and a harem of adoring anime girls to impress. But along the way there are at least a few sparks of charm that made it an overall more memorable watch than a lot of these kinds of shows.    Pretty much all of that comes down to Ard and his pre-pubescent demon lord shtick. The guy talks like a total weenie, and seeing a grown man in a child's body completely fumble through basic conversation is pretty funny. Small gags like monsters attacking him in the background only to be set ablaze by a snap of the fingers are silly enough to complement the goofy tone of his quest for friendship without being overbearing. And there's genuinely something funny about his first friend hating his guts for most of the premiere and fleeing from him in the streets. It's not laugh-out-loud funny, and if you start thinking about it you do feel a little icky about a grown man chasing a little girl around in spite of her constant protests, but on a basic comedy level it at least gives this show some personality.    That's something it's desperately lacking everywhere else. The visuals are cheap and rough, failing to sell any of the action or even the basic visual of Ard flying. Character designs are that particular kind of generic that would let you slot them into damn near any LN fantasy world without trouble, and they leave basically no impression. Once the jokes stop and the show tries to be serious and emotional, it becomes a slog. Ard and Ireena are flat and boring archetypes, and despite the show's best(?) efforts there's no weight to their eventual friendship, especially once we skip to their teenage years and she's clearly in love with him, as all anime girls must be in the presence of a potatoman.    So yeah, “better than expected” is sadly not the same as “good” and this premiere is here to prove it. This wasn't as hefty a chore as I figured going in, but that just means it felt like taking out the trash rather than mowing the lawn.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review                Odd Taxi: In the Woods   Apr 17, 00:00                 anime    By cleverly reframing its narrative around a series of interviews with the supporting cast, Odd Taxi: In the Woods succeeds where most recap films fail: it's an artistically cohesive film in its own right. ― Odd Taxi was 2021's sleeper anime hit, telling an intricate, original mystery that kept viewers guessing every week.

And let's face it, to anyone who is or was socially awkward, Ard's struggles are relatable—that's the main reason it's so cringey. In fact, even the whole thing where he badgers Litz incessantly, might have been cute if it weren't for the fact that he is a 40+ year-old man stalking a literal child. Moreover, Ard doesn't really learn his lesson. Instead, he lucks into becoming Litz's friend by rescuing her from danger and getting her to open up about being friendless herself.    Lacking any kind of teachable moral or character growth, I'm not sure what this anime is trying to say or where it plans on going in the future. This might have been one of those shows that should have started in media res, because as it stands now, I have no idea.       Caitlin Moore  Rating:                You know, I have to hand it to light novel anime: every time a cliché dies out, a new one pops up to take its place. How many series in the last few years have there been where a powerful mage (often, but not always a demon lord) decides he's weary of his life at the top and decides to be reincarnated? And then, in his new era, he discovers that magic has degraded significantly since his reign but he's just as powerful as ever? Also he struggles socially but has one or two devoted female friends/followers? I'm ready to declare this overdone, and The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody is just yet another entry into the trend.    If you're into series of this ilk, it's not too bad a premiere. Ard's social struggles come from a mix of overenthusiasm and lack of skill, which is much more entertaining than his stone-faced equivalents. It's a little puzzling, though, how he ended up ten years old, raised by a nice, normal family in what appears to be a good neighborhood full of children, seemingly without ever having talked to a child his age. The effect is more that Ard sprung fully formed into his ten-year-old body, rather than having been born and raised in it. Maybe it's intentional? But the flashbacks to him studying magic and practicing sword indicate that no, he really is ten years old. It even turns out that the girl he spent most of the episode pursuing is the daughter of his parents' best friend, who he has somehow never met before despite being familiar with her father.    Speaking of Ireena, his dogged pursuit of her is what gave me the most misgivings about the episode. It's played for comedy, but I'm not comfortable with a little boy chasing after a little girl while she screams for him to leave her alone. When this became the main joke about ten minutes in, I had to fight not to check out. Even without the cultural baggage, it was repetitive and unfunny, and went on for almost half the episode. When she was surrounded by goblins and obliquely threatened with rape (they only showed little girls running from them), it took all my power not to turn off the episode.    The other parts of the episode aren't too bad. Ard's parents seem like good, caring people, as does Ireena's father. The jokes about Ard trying and failing to connect to the other children aren't especially funny, but some of the visual gags got a chuckle out of me. But boy, does he spend a lot of time chasing Ireena. No thanks.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I remember roughly two things from reading the first light novel this series is based on: that it was very dull and that the title was awfully misleading. While I don't feel that this was quite as boring as I thought the book was, the title thing is still an issue, albeit a nit-picky one, because while Ard is absolutely something of a nobody, he's in no way at all typical. I suppose that could be the point – that in his previous life as Varvatos, a human who won the appellation of “demon lord” for his prowess and fear factor, Ard was so out of touch with what “normal” and “typical” were that when he was reborn with his memories intact, he remained blissfully ignorant. But I can't help but feel that Ard's absurd levels of power and overwrought manner of speaking isn't helping the series that much, instead giving him leave to be the typical overpowered protagonist, albeit one with the social skills of a radish.    There is something a little sad about that, of course. Varvatos seems to have been in the same position as Leo from I'm Quitting Heroing in that his skill only served to make people fear him. Varvatos got to rule while Leo was kicked out of the kingdom, but both seem to be looking for friendship and acceptance that isn't forthcoming. As Ard, the former demon lord at least has some very loving parents (even if they seem more into each other than invested in their kid), but that doesn't translate into him having any luck at making friends. Largely that's because he's the most unchildlike child in the entire village – even Ireena (who is probably the reincarnation of Lydia, Varvatos' queen) does a better job being a kid while being ludicrously powerful; Ard is basically the anime incarnation of the old “hello, fellow kids” meme. Presumably this is meant to be funny, but I'm with the rest of the village children that it comes off as a bit creepy – especially once Ard focuses his friendly ardor on Ireena. Of course, once they “grow up” Ireena's doing the old “sneak into his bed when she comes to see him in the morning” routine, so my sense of creepy may be skewed.    But hey, if you're not content to watch a reborn adult continue acting like an adult in a child's body while exercising a ridiculous amount of magical power, don't worry! Because it looks like we're headed into magical school territory very soon. Even if this looked better or had a better executed story it's hard not to compare it to roughly half a dozen other similar shows that had slightly better hooks, and while it isn't precisely a bad episode, it's also not really a good one either. Since the story does look to be headed in a relatively different direction with episode two, it may be worth the three episode test to see where the plot settles, but otherwise there really isn't much here to recommend it, the entertaining scene of Ard snapping his fingers and frying monster hordes behind him notwithstanding.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               It's always weird when a show manages to exceed your expectations, but still can't make it all the way up the stairs to being good. I went into The Greatest Demon Lord blah blah blah expecting basically the same show as last season's The Strongest Sage With the Weakest Crest, and that wound up being half true. There's still a plainfaced, OP potato boy at the center of things who has all his memories of being the biggest badass to ever wield a magic circle, and by the end of this episode he's on his way to both magic school and a harem of adoring anime girls to impress. But along the way there are at least a few sparks of charm that made it an overall more memorable watch than a lot of these kinds of shows.    Pretty much all of that comes down to Ard and his pre-pubescent demon lord shtick. The guy talks like a total weenie, and seeing a grown man in a child's body completely fumble through basic conversation is pretty funny. Small gags like monsters attacking him in the background only to be set ablaze by a snap of the fingers are silly enough to complement the goofy tone of his quest for friendship without being overbearing. And there's genuinely something funny about his first friend hating his guts for most of the premiere and fleeing from him in the streets. It's not laugh-out-loud funny, and if you start thinking about it you do feel a little icky about a grown man chasing a little girl around in spite of her constant protests, but on a basic comedy level it at least gives this show some personality.    That's something it's desperately lacking everywhere else. The visuals are cheap and rough, failing to sell any of the action or even the basic visual of Ard flying. Character designs are that particular kind of generic that would let you slot them into damn near any LN fantasy world without trouble, and they leave basically no impression. Once the jokes stop and the show tries to be serious and emotional, it becomes a slog. Ard and Ireena are flat and boring archetypes, and despite the show's best(?) efforts there's no weight to their eventual friendship, especially once we skip to their teenage years and she's clearly in love with him, as all anime girls must be in the presence of a potatoman.    So yeah, “better than expected” is sadly not the same as “good” and this premiere is here to prove it. This wasn't as hefty a chore as I figured going in, but that just means it felt like taking out the trash rather than mowing the lawn.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody   Apr  7th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody ?                     Community score: 3.5              What is this?   The greatest demon lord in all of history, Varvatos, has reigned for several millennia as an absolute ruler. Now, there's only one thing left for him to do: enjoy the life of an average commoner. When he's reincarnated as a villager in a non-descript town, everything seems to be going as he hoped, but there's just one slight problem—even when he holds back, Varvatos is still too strong. Soon, rumors about him spread, and he's approached by all sorts of men, women, and assailants.    The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody is based on Myōjin Katō's novels and streams on Crunchyroll.      How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Hands down, this was one of the cringiest 22 minutes of anime I have ever watched—and I am certain that is by design. Ard is a reincarnated Demon Lord who had no equals in his past life and, thus, no friends. He sees his position as the reason he was friendless, but as we see in this episode, that's not really the case.    Rather, Ard's problem is that he lacks social skills. And like many who share that problem, he is searching for a set of hard and fast rules to follow when meeting people. Unfortunately, no such thing exists. This is only exacerbated by his tendency to deal in extremes. When talking down to potential friends as their superior doesn't get the results he wants, he talks like a knight addressing a princess. Worse still is that he keeps trying over and over on the same people. It's trying to cross a bridge that is already burnt. He's already a wierdo in their eyes, yet Ard truly believes if he can find the right words, all will work out just as he intends.    And let's face it, to anyone who is or was socially awkward, Ard's struggles are relatable—that's the main reason it's so cringey.

Community score: 3.5              What is this?   The greatest demon lord in all of history, Varvatos, has reigned for several millennia as an absolute ruler. Now, there's only one thing left for him to do: enjoy the life of an average commoner. When he's reincarnated as a villager in a non-descript town, everything seems to be going as he hoped, but there's just one slight problem—even when he holds back, Varvatos is still too strong. Soon, rumors about him spread, and he's approached by all sorts of men, women, and assailants.    The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody is based on Myōjin Katō's novels and streams on Crunchyroll.      How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Hands down, this was one of the cringiest 22 minutes of anime I have ever watched—and I am certain that is by design. Ard is a reincarnated Demon Lord who had no equals in his past life and, thus, no friends. He sees his position as the reason he was friendless, but as we see in this episode, that's not really the case.    Rather, Ard's problem is that he lacks social skills. And like many who share that problem, he is searching for a set of hard and fast rules to follow when meeting people. Unfortunately, no such thing exists. This is only exacerbated by his tendency to deal in extremes. When talking down to potential friends as their superior doesn't get the results he wants, he talks like a knight addressing a princess. Worse still is that he keeps trying over and over on the same people. It's trying to cross a bridge that is already burnt. He's already a wierdo in their eyes, yet Ard truly believes if he can find the right words, all will work out just as he intends.    And let's face it, to anyone who is or was socially awkward, Ard's struggles are relatable—that's the main reason it's so cringey. In fact, even the whole thing where he badgers Litz incessantly, might have been cute if it weren't for the fact that he is a 40+ year-old man stalking a literal child. Moreover, Ard doesn't really learn his lesson. Instead, he lucks into becoming Litz's friend by rescuing her from danger and getting her to open up about being friendless herself.    Lacking any kind of teachable moral or character growth, I'm not sure what this anime is trying to say or where it plans on going in the future. This might have been one of those shows that should have started in media res, because as it stands now, I have no idea.       Caitlin Moore  Rating:                You know, I have to hand it to light novel anime: every time a cliché dies out, a new one pops up to take its place. How many series in the last few years have there been where a powerful mage (often, but not always a demon lord) decides he's weary of his life at the top and decides to be reincarnated? And then, in his new era, he discovers that magic has degraded significantly since his reign but he's just as powerful as ever? Also he struggles socially but has one or two devoted female friends/followers? I'm ready to declare this overdone, and The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody is just yet another entry into the trend.    If you're into series of this ilk, it's not too bad a premiere. Ard's social struggles come from a mix of overenthusiasm and lack of skill, which is much more entertaining than his stone-faced equivalents. It's a little puzzling, though, how he ended up ten years old, raised by a nice, normal family in what appears to be a good neighborhood full of children, seemingly without ever having talked to a child his age. The effect is more that Ard sprung fully formed into his ten-year-old body, rather than having been born and raised in it. Maybe it's intentional? But the flashbacks to him studying magic and practicing sword indicate that no, he really is ten years old. It even turns out that the girl he spent most of the episode pursuing is the daughter of his parents' best friend, who he has somehow never met before despite being familiar with her father.    Speaking of Ireena, his dogged pursuit of her is what gave me the most misgivings about the episode. It's played for comedy, but I'm not comfortable with a little boy chasing after a little girl while she screams for him to leave her alone. When this became the main joke about ten minutes in, I had to fight not to check out. Even without the cultural baggage, it was repetitive and unfunny, and went on for almost half the episode. When she was surrounded by goblins and obliquely threatened with rape (they only showed little girls running from them), it took all my power not to turn off the episode.    The other parts of the episode aren't too bad. Ard's parents seem like good, caring people, as does Ireena's father. The jokes about Ard trying and failing to connect to the other children aren't especially funny, but some of the visual gags got a chuckle out of me. But boy, does he spend a lot of time chasing Ireena. No thanks.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I remember roughly two things from reading the first light novel this series is based on: that it was very dull and that the title was awfully misleading. While I don't feel that this was quite as boring as I thought the book was, the title thing is still an issue, albeit a nit-picky one, because while Ard is absolutely something of a nobody, he's in no way at all typical. I suppose that could be the point – that in his previous life as Varvatos, a human who won the appellation of “demon lord” for his prowess and fear factor, Ard was so out of touch with what “normal” and “typical” were that when he was reborn with his memories intact, he remained blissfully ignorant. But I can't help but feel that Ard's absurd levels of power and overwrought manner of speaking isn't helping the series that much, instead giving him leave to be the typical overpowered protagonist, albeit one with the social skills of a radish.    There is something a little sad about that, of course. Varvatos seems to have been in the same position as Leo from I'm Quitting Heroing in that his skill only served to make people fear him. Varvatos got to rule while Leo was kicked out of the kingdom, but both seem to be looking for friendship and acceptance that isn't forthcoming. As Ard, the former demon lord at least has some very loving parents (even if they seem more into each other than invested in their kid), but that doesn't translate into him having any luck at making friends. Largely that's because he's the most unchildlike child in the entire village – even Ireena (who is probably the reincarnation of Lydia, Varvatos' queen) does a better job being a kid while being ludicrously powerful; Ard is basically the anime incarnation of the old “hello, fellow kids” meme. Presumably this is meant to be funny, but I'm with the rest of the village children that it comes off as a bit creepy – especially once Ard focuses his friendly ardor on Ireena. Of course, once they “grow up” Ireena's doing the old “sneak into his bed when she comes to see him in the morning” routine, so my sense of creepy may be skewed.    But hey, if you're not content to watch a reborn adult continue acting like an adult in a child's body while exercising a ridiculous amount of magical power, don't worry! Because it looks like we're headed into magical school territory very soon. Even if this looked better or had a better executed story it's hard not to compare it to roughly half a dozen other similar shows that had slightly better hooks, and while it isn't precisely a bad episode, it's also not really a good one either. Since the story does look to be headed in a relatively different direction with episode two, it may be worth the three episode test to see where the plot settles, but otherwise there really isn't much here to recommend it, the entertaining scene of Ard snapping his fingers and frying monster hordes behind him notwithstanding.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               It's always weird when a show manages to exceed your expectations, but still can't make it all the way up the stairs to being good. I went into The Greatest Demon Lord blah blah blah expecting basically the same show as last season's The Strongest Sage With the Weakest Crest, and that wound up being half true. There's still a plainfaced, OP potato boy at the center of things who has all his memories of being the biggest badass to ever wield a magic circle, and by the end of this episode he's on his way to both magic school and a harem of adoring anime girls to impress. But along the way there are at least a few sparks of charm that made it an overall more memorable watch than a lot of these kinds of shows.    Pretty much all of that comes down to Ard and his pre-pubescent demon lord shtick. The guy talks like a total weenie, and seeing a grown man in a child's body completely fumble through basic conversation is pretty funny. Small gags like monsters attacking him in the background only to be set ablaze by a snap of the fingers are silly enough to complement the goofy tone of his quest for friendship without being overbearing. And there's genuinely something funny about his first friend hating his guts for most of the premiere and fleeing from him in the streets. It's not laugh-out-loud funny, and if you start thinking about it you do feel a little icky about a grown man chasing a little girl around in spite of her constant protests, but on a basic comedy level it at least gives this show some personality.    That's something it's desperately lacking everywhere else. The visuals are cheap and rough, failing to sell any of the action or even the basic visual of Ard flying. Character designs are that particular kind of generic that would let you slot them into damn near any LN fantasy world without trouble, and they leave basically no impression. Once the jokes stop and the show tries to be serious and emotional, it becomes a slog.

But hey, if you're not content to watch a reborn adult continue acting like an adult in a child's body while exercising a ridiculous amount of magical power, don't worry! Because it looks like we're headed into magical school territory very soon. Even if this looked better or had a better executed story it's hard not to compare it to roughly half a dozen other similar shows that had slightly better hooks, and while it isn't precisely a bad episode, it's also not really a good one either. Since the story does look to be headed in a relatively different direction with episode two, it may be worth the three episode test to see where the plot settles, but otherwise there really isn't much here to recommend it, the entertaining scene of Ard snapping his fingers and frying monster hordes behind him notwithstanding.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               It's always weird when a show manages to exceed your expectations, but still can't make it all the way up the stairs to being good. I went into The Greatest Demon Lord blah blah blah expecting basically the same show as last season's The Strongest Sage With the Weakest Crest, and that wound up being half true. There's still a plainfaced, OP potato boy at the center of things who has all his memories of being the biggest badass to ever wield a magic circle, and by the end of this episode he's on his way to both magic school and a harem of adoring anime girls to impress. But along the way there are at least a few sparks of charm that made it an overall more memorable watch than a lot of these kinds of shows.    Pretty much all of that comes down to Ard and his pre-pubescent demon lord shtick. The guy talks like a total weenie, and seeing a grown man in a child's body completely fumble through basic conversation is pretty funny. Small gags like monsters attacking him in the background only to be set ablaze by a snap of the fingers are silly enough to complement the goofy tone of his quest for friendship without being overbearing. And there's genuinely something funny about his first friend hating his guts for most of the premiere and fleeing from him in the streets. It's not laugh-out-loud funny, and if you start thinking about it you do feel a little icky about a grown man chasing a little girl around in spite of her constant protests, but on a basic comedy level it at least gives this show some personality.    That's something it's desperately lacking everywhere else. The visuals are cheap and rough, failing to sell any of the action or even the basic visual of Ard flying. Character designs are that particular kind of generic that would let you slot them into damn near any LN fantasy world without trouble, and they leave basically no impression. Once the jokes stop and the show tries to be serious and emotional, it becomes a slog. Ard and Ireena are flat and boring archetypes, and despite the show's best(?) efforts there's no weight to their eventual friendship, especially once we skip to their teenage years and she's clearly in love with him, as all anime girls must be in the presence of a potatoman.    So yeah, “better than expected” is sadly not the same as “good” and this premiere is here to prove it. This wasn't as hefty a chore as I figured going in, but that just means it felt like taking out the trash rather than mowing the lawn.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives   ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 3.5              What is this?   The greatest demon lord in all of history, Varvatos, has reigned for several millennia as an absolute ruler. Now, there's only one thing left for him to do: enjoy the life of an average commoner. When he's reincarnated as a villager in a non-descript town, everything seems to be going as he hoped, but there's just one slight problem—even when he holds back, Varvatos is still too strong. Soon, rumors about him spread, and he's approached by all sorts of men, women, and assailants.    The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody is based on Myōjin Katō's novels and streams on Crunchyroll.      How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Hands down, this was one of the cringiest 22 minutes of anime I have ever watched—and I am certain that is by design. Ard is a reincarnated Demon Lord who had no equals in his past life and, thus, no friends. He sees his position as the reason he was friendless, but as we see in this episode, that's not really the case.    Rather, Ard's problem is that he lacks social skills. And like many who share that problem, he is searching for a set of hard and fast rules to follow when meeting people. Unfortunately, no such thing exists. This is only exacerbated by his tendency to deal in extremes. When talking down to potential friends as their superior doesn't get the results he wants, he talks like a knight addressing a princess. Worse still is that he keeps trying over and over on the same people. It's trying to cross a bridge that is already burnt. He's already a wierdo in their eyes, yet Ard truly believes if he can find the right words, all will work out just as he intends.    And let's face it, to anyone who is or was socially awkward, Ard's struggles are relatable—that's the main reason it's so cringey. In fact, even the whole thing where he badgers Litz incessantly, might have been cute if it weren't for the fact that he is a 40+ year-old man stalking a literal child. Moreover, Ard doesn't really learn his lesson. Instead, he lucks into becoming Litz's friend by rescuing her from danger and getting her to open up about being friendless herself.    Lacking any kind of teachable moral or character growth, I'm not sure what this anime is trying to say or where it plans on going in the future. This might have been one of those shows that should have started in media res, because as it stands now, I have no idea.       Caitlin Moore  Rating:                You know, I have to hand it to light novel anime: every time a cliché dies out, a new one pops up to take its place. How many series in the last few years have there been where a powerful mage (often, but not always a demon lord) decides he's weary of his life at the top and decides to be reincarnated? And then, in his new era, he discovers that magic has degraded significantly since his reign but he's just as powerful as ever? Also he struggles socially but has one or two devoted female friends/followers? I'm ready to declare this overdone, and The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody is just yet another entry into the trend.    If you're into series of this ilk, it's not too bad a premiere. Ard's social struggles come from a mix of overenthusiasm and lack of skill, which is much more entertaining than his stone-faced equivalents. It's a little puzzling, though, how he ended up ten years old, raised by a nice, normal family in what appears to be a good neighborhood full of children, seemingly without ever having talked to a child his age. The effect is more that Ard sprung fully formed into his ten-year-old body, rather than having been born and raised in it. Maybe it's intentional? But the flashbacks to him studying magic and practicing sword indicate that no, he really is ten years old. It even turns out that the girl he spent most of the episode pursuing is the daughter of his parents' best friend, who he has somehow never met before despite being familiar with her father.    Speaking of Ireena, his dogged pursuit of her is what gave me the most misgivings about the episode. It's played for comedy, but I'm not comfortable with a little boy chasing after a little girl while she screams for him to leave her alone. When this became the main joke about ten minutes in, I had to fight not to check out. Even without the cultural baggage, it was repetitive and unfunny, and went on for almost half the episode. When she was surrounded by goblins and obliquely threatened with rape (they only showed little girls running from them), it took all my power not to turn off the episode.    The other parts of the episode aren't too bad. Ard's parents seem like good, caring people, as does Ireena's father. The jokes about Ard trying and failing to connect to the other children aren't especially funny, but some of the visual gags got a chuckle out of me. But boy, does he spend a lot of time chasing Ireena. No thanks.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I remember roughly two things from reading the first light novel this series is based on: that it was very dull and that the title was awfully misleading. While I don't feel that this was quite as boring as I thought the book was, the title thing is still an issue, albeit a nit-picky one, because while Ard is absolutely something of a nobody, he's in no way at all typical. I suppose that could be the point – that in his previous life as Varvatos, a human who won the appellation of “demon lord” for his prowess and fear factor, Ard was so out of touch with what “normal” and “typical” were that when he was reborn with his memories intact, he remained blissfully ignorant. But I can't help but feel that Ard's absurd levels of power and overwrought manner of speaking isn't helping the series that much, instead giving him leave to be the typical overpowered protagonist, albeit one with the social skills of a radish.    There is something a little sad about that, of course. Varvatos seems to have been in the same position as Leo from I'm Quitting Heroing in that his skill only served to make people fear him. Varvatos got to rule while Leo was kicked out of the kingdom, but both seem to be looking for friendship and acceptance that isn't forthcoming. As Ard, the former demon lord at least has some very loving parents (even if they seem more into each other than invested in their kid), but that doesn't translate into him having any luck at making friends. Largely that's because he's the most unchildlike child in the entire village – even Ireena (who is probably the reincarnation of Lydia, Varvatos' queen) does a better job being a kid while being ludicrously powerful; Ard is basically the anime incarnation of the old “hello, fellow kids” meme. Presumably this is meant to be funny, but I'm with the rest of the village children that it comes off as a bit creepy – especially once Ard focuses his friendly ardor on Ireena. Of course, once they “grow up” Ireena's doing the old “sneak into his bed when she comes to see him in the morning” routine, so my sense of creepy may be skewed.

News Akari Akase's Ending Theme Song for My Dress-Up Darling Anime Streamed 7 Million Times   posted on 2022-04-14 23:35 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         Music video debuted on January 9    The music video for Akari Akase's ""Koi no Yukue"" (Where Love Is), the ending theme song for the television anime of Shinichi Fukuda's My Dress-Up Darling (Sono Bisque Doll wa Koi wo Suru), has been streamed over seven million times since its release about three months ago. The song's music video debuted on January 9:      TikTok personality Akase debuted her singing career with the song.    The anime premiered on January 9. Funimation streamed the anime as it aired in Japan, and is also streaming an English dub. Crunchyroll is also streaming the anime and English dub.    Square Enix Manga & Books publishes the manga in English, and it describes the story:    Traumatized by a childhood incident with a friend who took exception to his love of traditional dolls, doll-artisan hopeful Wakana Gojō passes his days as a loner, finding solace in the home ec room at his high school. To Wakana, people like beautiful Marin Kitagawa, a trendy girl who's always surrounded by a throng of friends, is practically an alien from another world. But when cheerful Marin--never one to be shy--spots Wakana sewing away one day after school, she barges in with the aim of roping her quiet classmate into her secret hobby: cosplay.   The manga launched in Squre Enix's Young Gangan magazine in January 2018. Square Enix published the manga's ninth volume on March 25. Square Enix Manga & Books will publish the fifth volume in English on April 26.

News Akari Akase's Ending Theme Song for My Dress-Up Darling Anime Streamed 7 Million Times   posted on 2022-04-14 23:35 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         Music video debuted on January 9    The music video for Akari Akase's ""Koi no Yukue"" (Where Love Is), the ending theme song for the television anime of Shinichi Fukuda's My Dress-Up Darling (Sono Bisque Doll wa Koi wo Suru), has been streamed over seven million times since its release about three months ago. The song's music video debuted on January 9:      TikTok personality Akase debuted her singing career with the song.    The anime premiered on January 9. Funimation streamed the anime as it aired in Japan, and is also streaming an English dub. Crunchyroll is also streaming the anime and English dub.    Square Enix Manga & Books publishes the manga in English, and it describes the story:    Traumatized by a childhood incident with a friend who took exception to his love of traditional dolls, doll-artisan hopeful Wakana Gojō passes his days as a loner, finding solace in the home ec room at his high school. To Wakana, people like beautiful Marin Kitagawa, a trendy girl who's always surrounded by a throng of friends, is practically an alien from another world. But when cheerful Marin--never one to be shy--spots Wakana sewing away one day after school, she barges in with the aim of roping her quiet classmate into her secret hobby: cosplay.   The manga launched in Squre Enix's Young Gangan magazine in January 2018. Square Enix published the manga's ninth volume on March 25. Square Enix Manga & Books will publish the fifth volume in English on April 26.

News Akari Akase's Ending Theme Song for My Dress-Up Darling Anime Streamed 7 Million Times   posted on 2022-04-14 23:35 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         Music video debuted on January 9    The music video for Akari Akase's ""Koi no Yukue"" (Where Love Is), the ending theme song for the television anime of Shinichi Fukuda's My Dress-Up Darling (Sono Bisque Doll wa Koi wo Suru), has been streamed over seven million times since its release about three months ago. The song's music video debuted on January 9:      TikTok personality Akase debuted her singing career with the song.    The anime premiered on January 9. Funimation streamed the anime as it aired in Japan, and is also streaming an English dub. Crunchyroll is also streaming the anime and English dub.    Square Enix Manga & Books publishes the manga in English, and it describes the story:    Traumatized by a childhood incident with a friend who took exception to his love of traditional dolls, doll-artisan hopeful Wakana Gojō passes his days as a loner, finding solace in the home ec room at his high school. To Wakana, people like beautiful Marin Kitagawa, a trendy girl who's always surrounded by a throng of friends, is practically an alien from another world. But when cheerful Marin--never one to be shy--spots Wakana sewing away one day after school, she barges in with the aim of roping her quiet classmate into her secret hobby: cosplay.   The manga launched in Squre Enix's Young Gangan magazine in January 2018. Square Enix published the manga's ninth volume on March 25. Square Enix Manga & Books will publish the fifth volume in English on April 26.

Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision Episodes 25-27  by Christopher Farris, Apr 16th 2022                   How would you rate episode 25 of Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision (movies) ?                     Community score: 4.5                  How would you rate episode 26 of Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision (movies) ?                     Community score: 4.4                  How would you rate episode 27 of Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision (movies) ?                     Community score: 4.3            My thoughts on the opening episode of Collision were covered back at  the beginning of the preview guide, but to summarize, I regarded it as effectively a thematic opener for this season, less connected to the dense plotting we all really keep coming back to Legend of the Galactic Heroes for. But that might turn out to be a harbinger of the more roundabout approach to storytelling this season might overall be taking, as the following pair of episodes aren't overly concerned with advancing any major battle plans on either side of the conflict either. Instead, they are about two specific dudes: Wolfgang Mittermeyer and Oskar von Reuenthal. If you're a fan of LOGH from its previous incarnations, then these two need no introduction, but if you're a newcomer, this duology serves as a pretty effective one.    Of course, Mittermeyer and Reuenthal have been around Die Neue These for a while at this point; it's just now that the show is deciding to detail exactly who these two are, and how they got so close with each other and so trusted with Reinhard.  As with the first episode's Julian-focused aside prologue, this pair of backstory-based episodes uses the flashbacks for Mittermeyer and Reuenthal as vectors for overall thematic worldbuilding in laying out what their deal is. As well, getting two episodes in a row about these guys shows early on that Collision might be less beholden to the previous seasons' rigid alternating Alliance/Empire story focus structure; that also makes sense, given that, as this season's title implies, the two sides will be more directly clashing again as it goes on, as opposed to the more isolated plots they were dealing with in the last batch.    All that's structural setup for the season as it goes on, however, with Episodes 26 and 27 rooted firmly in the past, and entirely on the Empire's side of things to boot. The initial recounting of the more personal circumstances of Mittermeyer and Reuenthal's contrasting upbringings are more about establishing the men personally before the past's plot-heavy stuff rears its head. Stuff like Mittermeyer's courtship with his eventual wife Evangelin is pretty basic (though his dad's little fist-pump as his son's proposal is accepted is a cute detail), while Reuenthal's drunken confession of his distrust of all women stemming from his problems with his mother is as comparatively melodramatic as you would expect from this series. Beyond the actual context of the content, these beats are mainly here to impart to us the trust in the bond these two men forged. Mittermeyer acknowledges the irrationality of Reuenthal's issues, sure, but you can't not be heartened at his no-hesitance response the morning after when his bro asks him to act like he didn't hear anything.    It's basically all flavor, but it at least makes for a properly engaging opener for a season that's seemingly going to be heavy on featuring these guys. It gets them out in front of the audience, and makes clear what their dynamic is and why it's supposed to be appealing. The next step is showing that dynamic in more of a story-based context, in this case via a plotline that got shuffled around compared to the previous LOGH anime: The Klopstock Incident. Doing this story as a flashback has a few advantages, like getting to see more of Sieg even after his death at the end of last season. But there is still a sense of the post-hoc about the placement here, since a large part of this story is showing earlier interactions between our main Imperial heroes with aristocratic characters like Braunschweig and Ansbach, who you'll remember from the Empire's civil war plot from last season. It's dotted with a lot of signs of how things will lead into that story, particularly the establishment of how Mittermeyer and Reuenthal wound up courting the animosity of this particular group. But given how all those rich jerks have since been killed and their whole story wrapped up, it can feel like a retroactive thematic inclusion to something that finished nearly three years ago, which isn't great as far as pertinent storytelling goes.    That said, as a piece of storytelling on its own, this is still a tight little flashback arc that expounds on the themes of LOGH while at least keeping the energy of the series up. Mittermeyer and Reuenthal prove that they are still an appealing pair of characters that can carry a story that's largely a forgone conclusion by this point. And the thematics remain well-aligned, both in terms of where this season's story will ultimately go (let's just say the discussion of a potential military tribunal is something of a dry run), as well as the overarching ideas that have always been part of LOGH. Sure, we already knew that Mittermeyer and Reuenthal were aligned with Reinhard's beliefs about the corruption at the heart of the royalty running the Empire at the time, but seeing them demonstrate those principles, against the kind of barbarous bastard who would cut open a woman's throat just to steal a ring, unflinchingly shows how these guys are the 'Heroes' of this story even on this side of the conflict (Also if that scene of him shooting the guy doesn't convince you that Mittermeyer rules, I don't think anything will). The procession of events fits with the always-present historical stylings of LOGH, demonstrating that things rarely happen in neat, contained arcs in reality; instead, it's often a sequence of interactions that lead to connections and changes that continuously occur through time. By the end of Episode 27, the implication is that each of the commanders Reinhard has assembled under him have as rich personal histories connecting them to the new Prime Minister as Mittermeyer and Reuenthal do, as if all of these galactic heroes have their own legends. Or something like that.    I'd also be remiss if I didn't comment on the stylizations this sequence of episodes takes us through. Production I.G's Legend of the Galactic Heroes has always had a fair bit of gloss on it, but these episodes go hard on some of the more colorful elements of the presentation: The contrasting palette on the flashback to Reuenthal's mommy issues, the striking orange of the sun over Mittermeyer's gunning down of the noble, or the brief flash of lightning illuminating the conversation with Reinhard and Sieg. It all does a good job of reminding you that, oh right, these episodes are part of a Capital-M Movie in their original release. Things still get a little rote at the end when we're being introduced to the rest of Reinhard's commanders and DNT does that thing where it just keeps naming dudes. That means that even in an extended flashback of questionable relevance to the primary story, LOGH is still LOGH, for better and for worse. It can almost make these episodes feel entirely like fanservice for the established viewers at this point, spending time presenting a polished piece about a pair of popular players. It's an interesting choice three seasons in, to be sure, but it's also hard to argue with the pure entertainment that results.

Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision Episodes 25-27  by Christopher Farris, Apr 16th 2022                   How would you rate episode 25 of Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision (movies) ?                     Community score: 4.5                  How would you rate episode 26 of Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision (movies) ?                     Community score: 4.4                  How would you rate episode 27 of Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision (movies) ?                     Community score: 4.3            My thoughts on the opening episode of Collision were covered back at  the beginning of the preview guide, but to summarize, I regarded it as effectively a thematic opener for this season, less connected to the dense plotting we all really keep coming back to Legend of the Galactic Heroes for. But that might turn out to be a harbinger of the more roundabout approach to storytelling this season might overall be taking, as the following pair of episodes aren't overly concerned with advancing any major battle plans on either side of the conflict either. Instead, they are about two specific dudes: Wolfgang Mittermeyer and Oskar von Reuenthal. If you're a fan of LOGH from its previous incarnations, then these two need no introduction, but if you're a newcomer, this duology serves as a pretty effective one.    Of course, Mittermeyer and Reuenthal have been around Die Neue These for a while at this point; it's just now that the show is deciding to detail exactly who these two are, and how they got so close with each other and so trusted with Reinhard.  As with the first episode's Julian-focused aside prologue, this pair of backstory-based episodes uses the flashbacks for Mittermeyer and Reuenthal as vectors for overall thematic worldbuilding in laying out what their deal is. As well, getting two episodes in a row about these guys shows early on that Collision might be less beholden to the previous seasons' rigid alternating Alliance/Empire story focus structure; that also makes sense, given that, as this season's title implies, the two sides will be more directly clashing again as it goes on, as opposed to the more isolated plots they were dealing with in the last batch.    All that's structural setup for the season as it goes on, however, with Episodes 26 and 27 rooted firmly in the past, and entirely on the Empire's side of things to boot. The initial recounting of the more personal circumstances of Mittermeyer and Reuenthal's contrasting upbringings are more about establishing the men personally before the past's plot-heavy stuff rears its head. Stuff like Mittermeyer's courtship with his eventual wife Evangelin is pretty basic (though his dad's little fist-pump as his son's proposal is accepted is a cute detail), while Reuenthal's drunken confession of his distrust of all women stemming from his problems with his mother is as comparatively melodramatic as you would expect from this series. Beyond the actual context of the content, these beats are mainly here to impart to us the trust in the bond these two men forged. Mittermeyer acknowledges the irrationality of Reuenthal's issues, sure, but you can't not be heartened at his no-hesitance response the morning after when his bro asks him to act like he didn't hear anything.    It's basically all flavor, but it at least makes for a properly engaging opener for a season that's seemingly going to be heavy on featuring these guys. It gets them out in front of the audience, and makes clear what their dynamic is and why it's supposed to be appealing. The next step is showing that dynamic in more of a story-based context, in this case via a plotline that got shuffled around compared to the previous LOGH anime: The Klopstock Incident. Doing this story as a flashback has a few advantages, like getting to see more of Sieg even after his death at the end of last season. But there is still a sense of the post-hoc about the placement here, since a large part of this story is showing earlier interactions between our main Imperial heroes with aristocratic characters like Braunschweig and Ansbach, who you'll remember from the Empire's civil war plot from last season. It's dotted with a lot of signs of how things will lead into that story, particularly the establishment of how Mittermeyer and Reuenthal wound up courting the animosity of this particular group. But given how all those rich jerks have since been killed and their whole story wrapped up, it can feel like a retroactive thematic inclusion to something that finished nearly three years ago, which isn't great as far as pertinent storytelling goes.    That said, as a piece of storytelling on its own, this is still a tight little flashback arc that expounds on the themes of LOGH while at least keeping the energy of the series up. Mittermeyer and Reuenthal prove that they are still an appealing pair of characters that can carry a story that's largely a forgone conclusion by this point. And the thematics remain well-aligned, both in terms of where this season's story will ultimately go (let's just say the discussion of a potential military tribunal is something of a dry run), as well as the overarching ideas that have always been part of LOGH. Sure, we already knew that Mittermeyer and Reuenthal were aligned with Reinhard's beliefs about the corruption at the heart of the royalty running the Empire at the time, but seeing them demonstrate those principles, against the kind of barbarous bastard who would cut open a woman's throat just to steal a ring, unflinchingly shows how these guys are the 'Heroes' of this story even on this side of the conflict (Also if that scene of him shooting the guy doesn't convince you that Mittermeyer rules, I don't think anything will). The procession of events fits with the always-present historical stylings of LOGH, demonstrating that things rarely happen in neat, contained arcs in reality; instead, it's often a sequence of interactions that lead to connections and changes that continuously occur through time. By the end of Episode 27, the implication is that each of the commanders Reinhard has assembled under him have as rich personal histories connecting them to the new Prime Minister as Mittermeyer and Reuenthal do, as if all of these galactic heroes have their own legends. Or something like that.    I'd also be remiss if I didn't comment on the stylizations this sequence of episodes takes us through. Production I.G's Legend of the Galactic Heroes has always had a fair bit of gloss on it, but these episodes go hard on some of the more colorful elements of the presentation: The contrasting palette on the flashback to Reuenthal's mommy issues, the striking orange of the sun over Mittermeyer's gunning down of the noble, or the brief flash of lightning illuminating the conversation with Reinhard and Sieg. It all does a good job of reminding you that, oh right, these episodes are part of a Capital-M Movie in their original release. Things still get a little rote at the end when we're being introduced to the rest of Reinhard's commanders and DNT does that thing where it just keeps naming dudes. That means that even in an extended flashback of questionable relevance to the primary story, LOGH is still LOGH, for better and for worse. It can almost make these episodes feel entirely like fanservice for the established viewers at this point, spending time presenting a polished piece about a pair of popular players. It's an interesting choice three seasons in, to be sure, but it's also hard to argue with the pure entertainment that results.

Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision Episodes 25-27  by Christopher Farris, Apr 16th 2022                   How would you rate episode 25 of Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision (movies) ?                     Community score: 4.5                  How would you rate episode 26 of Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision (movies) ?                     Community score: 4.4                  How would you rate episode 27 of Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision (movies) ?                     Community score: 4.3            My thoughts on the opening episode of Collision were covered back at  the beginning of the preview guide, but to summarize, I regarded it as effectively a thematic opener for this season, less connected to the dense plotting we all really keep coming back to Legend of the Galactic Heroes for. But that might turn out to be a harbinger of the more roundabout approach to storytelling this season might overall be taking, as the following pair of episodes aren't overly concerned with advancing any major battle plans on either side of the conflict either. Instead, they are about two specific dudes: Wolfgang Mittermeyer and Oskar von Reuenthal. If you're a fan of LOGH from its previous incarnations, then these two need no introduction, but if you're a newcomer, this duology serves as a pretty effective one.    Of course, Mittermeyer and Reuenthal have been around Die Neue These for a while at this point; it's just now that the show is deciding to detail exactly who these two are, and how they got so close with each other and so trusted with Reinhard.  As with the first episode's Julian-focused aside prologue, this pair of backstory-based episodes uses the flashbacks for Mittermeyer and Reuenthal as vectors for overall thematic worldbuilding in laying out what their deal is. As well, getting two episodes in a row about these guys shows early on that Collision might be less beholden to the previous seasons' rigid alternating Alliance/Empire story focus structure; that also makes sense, given that, as this season's title implies, the two sides will be more directly clashing again as it goes on, as opposed to the more isolated plots they were dealing with in the last batch.    All that's structural setup for the season as it goes on, however, with Episodes 26 and 27 rooted firmly in the past, and entirely on the Empire's side of things to boot. The initial recounting of the more personal circumstances of Mittermeyer and Reuenthal's contrasting upbringings are more about establishing the men personally before the past's plot-heavy stuff rears its head. Stuff like Mittermeyer's courtship with his eventual wife Evangelin is pretty basic (though his dad's little fist-pump as his son's proposal is accepted is a cute detail), while Reuenthal's drunken confession of his distrust of all women stemming from his problems with his mother is as comparatively melodramatic as you would expect from this series. Beyond the actual context of the content, these beats are mainly here to impart to us the trust in the bond these two men forged. Mittermeyer acknowledges the irrationality of Reuenthal's issues, sure, but you can't not be heartened at his no-hesitance response the morning after when his bro asks him to act like he didn't hear anything.    It's basically all flavor, but it at least makes for a properly engaging opener for a season that's seemingly going to be heavy on featuring these guys. It gets them out in front of the audience, and makes clear what their dynamic is and why it's supposed to be appealing. The next step is showing that dynamic in more of a story-based context, in this case via a plotline that got shuffled around compared to the previous LOGH anime: The Klopstock Incident. Doing this story as a flashback has a few advantages, like getting to see more of Sieg even after his death at the end of last season. But there is still a sense of the post-hoc about the placement here, since a large part of this story is showing earlier interactions between our main Imperial heroes with aristocratic characters like Braunschweig and Ansbach, who you'll remember from the Empire's civil war plot from last season. It's dotted with a lot of signs of how things will lead into that story, particularly the establishment of how Mittermeyer and Reuenthal wound up courting the animosity of this particular group. But given how all those rich jerks have since been killed and their whole story wrapped up, it can feel like a retroactive thematic inclusion to something that finished nearly three years ago, which isn't great as far as pertinent storytelling goes.    That said, as a piece of storytelling on its own, this is still a tight little flashback arc that expounds on the themes of LOGH while at least keeping the energy of the series up. Mittermeyer and Reuenthal prove that they are still an appealing pair of characters that can carry a story that's largely a forgone conclusion by this point. And the thematics remain well-aligned, both in terms of where this season's story will ultimately go (let's just say the discussion of a potential military tribunal is something of a dry run), as well as the overarching ideas that have always been part of LOGH. Sure, we already knew that Mittermeyer and Reuenthal were aligned with Reinhard's beliefs about the corruption at the heart of the royalty running the Empire at the time, but seeing them demonstrate those principles, against the kind of barbarous bastard who would cut open a woman's throat just to steal a ring, unflinchingly shows how these guys are the 'Heroes' of this story even on this side of the conflict (Also if that scene of him shooting the guy doesn't convince you that Mittermeyer rules, I don't think anything will). The procession of events fits with the always-present historical stylings of LOGH, demonstrating that things rarely happen in neat, contained arcs in reality; instead, it's often a sequence of interactions that lead to connections and changes that continuously occur through time. By the end of Episode 27, the implication is that each of the commanders Reinhard has assembled under him have as rich personal histories connecting them to the new Prime Minister as Mittermeyer and Reuenthal do, as if all of these galactic heroes have their own legends. Or something like that.    I'd also be remiss if I didn't comment on the stylizations this sequence of episodes takes us through. Production I.G's Legend of the Galactic Heroes has always had a fair bit of gloss on it, but these episodes go hard on some of the more colorful elements of the presentation: The contrasting palette on the flashback to Reuenthal's mommy issues, the striking orange of the sun over Mittermeyer's gunning down of the noble, or the brief flash of lightning illuminating the conversation with Reinhard and Sieg. It all does a good job of reminding you that, oh right, these episodes are part of a Capital-M Movie in their original release. Things still get a little rote at the end when we're being introduced to the rest of Reinhard's commanders and DNT does that thing where it just keeps naming dudes. That means that even in an extended flashback of questionable relevance to the primary story, LOGH is still LOGH, for better and for worse. It can almost make these episodes feel entirely like fanservice for the established viewers at this point, spending time presenting a polished piece about a pair of popular players. It's an interesting choice three seasons in, to be sure, but it's also hard to argue with the pure entertainment that results.

Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision Episodes 25-27  by Christopher Farris, Apr 16th 2022                   How would you rate episode 25 of Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision (movies) ?                     Community score: 4.5                  How would you rate episode 26 of Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision (movies) ?                     Community score: 4.4                  How would you rate episode 27 of Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision (movies) ?                     Community score: 4.3            My thoughts on the opening episode of Collision were covered back at  the beginning of the preview guide, but to summarize, I regarded it as effectively a thematic opener for this season, less connected to the dense plotting we all really keep coming back to Legend of the Galactic Heroes for. But that might turn out to be a harbinger of the more roundabout approach to storytelling this season might overall be taking, as the following pair of episodes aren't overly concerned with advancing any major battle plans on either side of the conflict either. Instead, they are about two specific dudes: Wolfgang Mittermeyer and Oskar von Reuenthal. If you're a fan of LOGH from its previous incarnations, then these two need no introduction, but if you're a newcomer, this duology serves as a pretty effective one.    Of course, Mittermeyer and Reuenthal have been around Die Neue These for a while at this point; it's just now that the show is deciding to detail exactly who these two are, and how they got so close with each other and so trusted with Reinhard.  As with the first episode's Julian-focused aside prologue, this pair of backstory-based episodes uses the flashbacks for Mittermeyer and Reuenthal as vectors for overall thematic worldbuilding in laying out what their deal is. As well, getting two episodes in a row about these guys shows early on that Collision might be less beholden to the previous seasons' rigid alternating Alliance/Empire story focus structure; that also makes sense, given that, as this season's title implies, the two sides will be more directly clashing again as it goes on, as opposed to the more isolated plots they were dealing with in the last batch.    All that's structural setup for the season as it goes on, however, with Episodes 26 and 27 rooted firmly in the past, and entirely on the Empire's side of things to boot. The initial recounting of the more personal circumstances of Mittermeyer and Reuenthal's contrasting upbringings are more about establishing the men personally before the past's plot-heavy stuff rears its head. Stuff like Mittermeyer's courtship with his eventual wife Evangelin is pretty basic (though his dad's little fist-pump as his son's proposal is accepted is a cute detail), while Reuenthal's drunken confession of his distrust of all women stemming from his problems with his mother is as comparatively melodramatic as you would expect from this series. Beyond the actual context of the content, these beats are mainly here to impart to us the trust in the bond these two men forged. Mittermeyer acknowledges the irrationality of Reuenthal's issues, sure, but you can't not be heartened at his no-hesitance response the morning after when his bro asks him to act like he didn't hear anything.    It's basically all flavor, but it at least makes for a properly engaging opener for a season that's seemingly going to be heavy on featuring these guys. It gets them out in front of the audience, and makes clear what their dynamic is and why it's supposed to be appealing. The next step is showing that dynamic in more of a story-based context, in this case via a plotline that got shuffled around compared to the previous LOGH anime: The Klopstock Incident. Doing this story as a flashback has a few advantages, like getting to see more of Sieg even after his death at the end of last season. But there is still a sense of the post-hoc about the placement here, since a large part of this story is showing earlier interactions between our main Imperial heroes with aristocratic characters like Braunschweig and Ansbach, who you'll remember from the Empire's civil war plot from last season. It's dotted with a lot of signs of how things will lead into that story, particularly the establishment of how Mittermeyer and Reuenthal wound up courting the animosity of this particular group. But given how all those rich jerks have since been killed and their whole story wrapped up, it can feel like a retroactive thematic inclusion to something that finished nearly three years ago, which isn't great as far as pertinent storytelling goes.    That said, as a piece of storytelling on its own, this is still a tight little flashback arc that expounds on the themes of LOGH while at least keeping the energy of the series up. Mittermeyer and Reuenthal prove that they are still an appealing pair of characters that can carry a story that's largely a forgone conclusion by this point. And the thematics remain well-aligned, both in terms of where this season's story will ultimately go (let's just say the discussion of a potential military tribunal is something of a dry run), as well as the overarching ideas that have always been part of LOGH. Sure, we already knew that Mittermeyer and Reuenthal were aligned with Reinhard's beliefs about the corruption at the heart of the royalty running the Empire at the time, but seeing them demonstrate those principles, against the kind of barbarous bastard who would cut open a woman's throat just to steal a ring, unflinchingly shows how these guys are the 'Heroes' of this story even on this side of the conflict (Also if that scene of him shooting the guy doesn't convince you that Mittermeyer rules, I don't think anything will). The procession of events fits with the always-present historical stylings of LOGH, demonstrating that things rarely happen in neat, contained arcs in reality; instead, it's often a sequence of interactions that lead to connections and changes that continuously occur through time. By the end of Episode 27, the implication is that each of the commanders Reinhard has assembled under him have as rich personal histories connecting them to the new Prime Minister as Mittermeyer and Reuenthal do, as if all of these galactic heroes have their own legends. Or something like that.    I'd also be remiss if I didn't comment on the stylizations this sequence of episodes takes us through. Production I.G's Legend of the Galactic Heroes has always had a fair bit of gloss on it, but these episodes go hard on some of the more colorful elements of the presentation: The contrasting palette on the flashback to Reuenthal's mommy issues, the striking orange of the sun over Mittermeyer's gunning down of the noble, or the brief flash of lightning illuminating the conversation with Reinhard and Sieg. It all does a good job of reminding you that, oh right, these episodes are part of a Capital-M Movie in their original release. Things still get a little rote at the end when we're being introduced to the rest of Reinhard's commanders and DNT does that thing where it just keeps naming dudes. That means that even in an extended flashback of questionable relevance to the primary story, LOGH is still LOGH, for better and for worse. It can almost make these episodes feel entirely like fanservice for the established viewers at this point, spending time presenting a polished piece about a pair of popular players. It's an interesting choice three seasons in, to be sure, but it's also hard to argue with the pure entertainment that results.

If you skipped over Revue Starlight or Karakai Jozu no Takagi-san whe...                    column          8 comments       Shelf Life - Kokkoku   2019 May  7, 01:00 8 comments                 anime    Paul reviews this time-stopping supernatural thriller and breaks down all this week's new blu-ray releases! ―  We're coming up on the season for final exams, and for those of us who work in college libraries, that means interacting with a lot of panicked undergrads who haven't set foot in a library since their first tour of the campus. Luckily for me, I'm well practiced in the art of not making snark...                    column          4 comments       Shelf Life - Garo: Vanishing Line part 2   2019 Apr 30, 01:00 4 comments                 anime    Gabriella reviews the final chapter of this wild gothic horror road trip on blu-ray, while Paul breaks down all this week's new anime releases! ―  I picked up the new Ace Combat game on sale last week, and despite not having played anything in that genre since the previous console generation, I'm actually still decent at flying an imaginary plane.

There is not enough caffeine in the world to overcome the crushing realization of ""I was just here a few ...                    column          11 comments       Shelf Life - Galaxy Express 999: The Movie   2019 Apr  9, 01:00 11 comments                 anime    Paul reviews this Leiji Matsumoto classic on blu-ray and breaks down all this week's new anime releases! ―  Hey, it's Preview Guide time again! I'm taking a break this season, but the rest of the crew has all this season's new shows covered. I'm expecting the new Fruits Basket adaptation to be the big show this time around, but you never know when some obscure series is going to come out of nowhere a...                    column          6 comments       Shelf Life - Touken Ranbu: Hanamaru Season 2   2019 Apr  2, 02:00 6 comments                 anime    Paul takes on a whole warehouse full of historical sword boys in the second season of Touken Ranbu: Hanamaru, plus all of this week's new anime bluray releases! ―  To follow up on my intro from a couple weeks ago, I did buy the new Fate video game, and it had the desired effect of finally pulling me away from the mobile game. My login streak remains unbroken, though, because you can't not keep up you...                    column          11 comments       Shelf Life - Mitsuboshi Colors   2019 Mar 26, 00:00 11 comments                 anime    Paul snuggles up with an adorable slice-of-life series about mischievous ragamuffins and breaks down this week's huge slate of new blu-ray releases! ―  The good news: Cells at Work is getting a second season!

Not because I don't already have a huge gaming backlog to deal with, but because I need an excuse to finally take a break from the Fate smartphone game. A pers...                    column          12 comments       Shelf Life - Garo: Vanishing Line   2019 Mar 12, 00:00 12 comments                 anime    The Golden Armor returns once more for the wildly entertaining Garo: Vanishing Line part 1. Plus: all of this week's new anime DVD & Bluray releases! ―  I lent my copy of the Tomorrow's Joe movie to a friend months ago, and he still hasn't watched it, let alone returned it. This is fine, however, because watching him confess his crushing guilt on a weekly basis is providing me with more entertainment...                    column          9 comments       Shelf Life - Just Because!   2019 Mar  5, 02:00 9 comments                 anime    James dives into the turbulent waters of mushy teen romance with this curiously named series, while Paul breaks down all this week's new blu-ray releases! ―  This season is shaping up to be a good one for comedies. The Quintessential Quintuplets is proving that an old-fashioned harem comedy can still be entertaining, Kaguya-sama: Love is War is excellent across the board, and I guess Domestic Girlfri...                    column          4 comments       Shelf Life - Urahara   2019 Feb 26, 01:00 4 comments                 anime    Gabriella takes a look at an underrated magical girl show that takes place in the streets of Harajuku, while Paul runs down all this week's new blu-ray releases! ―  Ever wake up on a Saturday and realize the last seven days have all been a blur? That happened to me this week.

I can already tell I'm going to go back through this show a second or thi...                    column          8 comments       Shelf Life - King's Game   2019 Feb 12, 06:31 8 comments                 anime    Paul subjects himself to one of the most hilariously bad entries in survival game horror, along with all this week's new blu-ray releases. ―  I've had all kinds of problems getting my anime streaming apps to work lately, but at least this has given me an excuse to binge some nature documentaries. And yes, I absolutely make up obnoxious dialogue for the animals on screen, because that's the only corre...                    column          26 comments       Shelf Life - My Girlfriend is Shobitch   2019 Feb  5, 04:00 26 comments                 anime    Gabriella takes on a particularly stiff and seemingly already forgotten comedy about sexually clueless teens - plus all of this week's new anime DVD & Bluray releases! ―  Collecting things can be a strange process, especially when you look at it from an outsider's perspective. I recently tried to explain to someone why, when faced with a choice between two video games, I bought the one that cost more...                    column          20 comments       Shelf Life - Girls' Last Tour   2019 Jan 29, 02:00 20 comments                 anime    Paul discovers the world's most heartwarming apocalypse anime and breaks down all this week's new anime Blu-ray releases! ―  I can already sense my hopes of staying current with this season's simulcasts slipping away, but one series I've managed to keep up with is Run With the Wind. It's a nice little sports story with less of the typical teenage drama, and there's something wonderfully indulgent abo...                    column          9 comments       Shelf Life - Hells   2019 Jan 22, 03:15 9 comments                 anime    Paul takes a look at Madhouse's avant-garde movie about the underworld with a dub produced by Youtubers, plus a brand-new Shelf Obsessed submission and all this week's new anime releases! ―  By the time you read this, I'll probably be digging out from a foot or more of snow.

I'll be taking next week off, so you won't see a new column on the 24th (don't worry, nothing's coming out that week anyway). We'll be back with a ""year in review""...                    column          20 comments       Shelf Life - UQ Holder!   2018 Dec 11, 01:00 20 comments                 anime    Gabriella plunges deep into the lore of Ken Akamatsu for this Negima! spinoff action series, while Paul breaks down all this week's new anime releases! ―  I picked up the new Super Smash Bros. game this week, only to re-discover that I'm not very good at Smash games (and I never have been). Thankfully, the holidays should give me plenty of time to get better, or at least less comically awful. In the ...                    column          12 comments       Shelf Life - Scum's Wish   2018 Dec  4, 01:00 12 comments                 anime    James checks out this sexually charged teen melodrama with a surprisingly heartfelt edge, while Paul runs down all this week's new anime releases! ―  I saw Mirai last week, and it's an interesting film, particularly if you've seen any of Mamoru Hosoda's other movies. It's one of those stories that manages to be about children without being exclusively for children. If it's playing in your area, you m...                    column          11 comments       Shelf Life - Love, Chunibyo & Other Delusions!

It also means that some of this week's price links might be out of date (since I usually put these columns together on Saturday), so ...                    column          5 comments       Shelf Life - Terraformars Revenge   2018 Nov 20, 02:00 5 comments                 anime    Paul checks out the crude but effective sequel to a troubled anime series about fighting giant bugs on Mars, plus a breakdown of all this week's new anime releases! ―  Something about living in the Northeastern US has a tendency to warp one's mind in very particular ways.

Paul Jensen finds out. Plus, all this week's new anime releases! ―  A friend of mine is headed to Anime NYC next weekend.

It's a delightfully twisted little comedy, a fun send-up of both zombie and idol shows. I know that sounds insane, but it works better than it sounds. Welcome to Shelf Life.

I'm just hoping this doesn't make life more...                    column          40 comments       Shelf Life - Angel Cop   2018 Oct 15, 23:00 40 comments                 anime    This cyberpunk '80s OVA may be nostalgic for some fans, but it's hardly angelic.

PLUS: all of this week's new anime DVD & Bluray releases! ―  I rarely end up revisiting any of my old streaming review shows, if only because writing about a series every week forces you to get just about everything out of it on the first viewing.

If you skipped over Revue Starlight or Karakai Jozu no Takagi-san whe...                    column          8 comments       Shelf Life - Kokkoku   2019 May  7, 01:00 8 comments                 anime    Paul reviews this time-stopping supernatural thriller and breaks down all this week's new blu-ray releases! ―  We're coming up on the season for final exams, and for those of us who work in college libraries, that means interacting with a lot of panicked undergrads who haven't set foot in a library since their first tour of the campus. Luckily for me, I'm well practiced in the art of not making snark...                    column          4 comments       Shelf Life - Garo: Vanishing Line part 2   2019 Apr 30, 01:00 4 comments                 anime    Gabriella reviews the final chapter of this wild gothic horror road trip on blu-ray, while Paul breaks down all this week's new anime releases! ―  I picked up the new Ace Combat game on sale last week, and despite not having played anything in that genre since the previous console generation, I'm actually still decent at flying an imaginary plane.

There is not enough caffeine in the world to overcome the crushing realization of ""I was just here a few ...                    column          11 comments       Shelf Life - Galaxy Express 999: The Movie   2019 Apr  9, 01:00 11 comments                 anime    Paul reviews this Leiji Matsumoto classic on blu-ray and breaks down all this week's new anime releases! ―  Hey, it's Preview Guide time again! I'm taking a break this season, but the rest of the crew has all this season's new shows covered. I'm expecting the new Fruits Basket adaptation to be the big show this time around, but you never know when some obscure series is going to come out of nowhere a...                    column          6 comments       Shelf Life - Touken Ranbu: Hanamaru Season 2   2019 Apr  2, 02:00 6 comments                 anime    Paul takes on a whole warehouse full of historical sword boys in the second season of Touken Ranbu: Hanamaru, plus all of this week's new anime bluray releases! ―  To follow up on my intro from a couple weeks ago, I did buy the new Fate video game, and it had the desired effect of finally pulling me away from the mobile game. My login streak remains unbroken, though, because you can't not keep up you...                    column          11 comments       Shelf Life - Mitsuboshi Colors   2019 Mar 26, 00:00 11 comments                 anime    Paul snuggles up with an adorable slice-of-life series about mischievous ragamuffins and breaks down this week's huge slate of new blu-ray releases! ―  The good news: Cells at Work is getting a second season!

Not because I don't already have a huge gaming backlog to deal with, but because I need an excuse to finally take a break from the Fate smartphone game. A pers...                    column          12 comments       Shelf Life - Garo: Vanishing Line   2019 Mar 12, 00:00 12 comments                 anime    The Golden Armor returns once more for the wildly entertaining Garo: Vanishing Line part 1. Plus: all of this week's new anime DVD & Bluray releases! ―  I lent my copy of the Tomorrow's Joe movie to a friend months ago, and he still hasn't watched it, let alone returned it. This is fine, however, because watching him confess his crushing guilt on a weekly basis is providing me with more entertainment...                    column          9 comments       Shelf Life - Just Because!   2019 Mar  5, 02:00 9 comments                 anime    James dives into the turbulent waters of mushy teen romance with this curiously named series, while Paul breaks down all this week's new blu-ray releases! ―  This season is shaping up to be a good one for comedies. The Quintessential Quintuplets is proving that an old-fashioned harem comedy can still be entertaining, Kaguya-sama: Love is War is excellent across the board, and I guess Domestic Girlfri...                    column          4 comments       Shelf Life - Urahara   2019 Feb 26, 01:00 4 comments                 anime    Gabriella takes a look at an underrated magical girl show that takes place in the streets of Harajuku, while Paul runs down all this week's new blu-ray releases! ―  Ever wake up on a Saturday and realize the last seven days have all been a blur? That happened to me this week.

I can already tell I'm going to go back through this show a second or thi...                    column          8 comments       Shelf Life - King's Game   2019 Feb 12, 06:31 8 comments                 anime    Paul subjects himself to one of the most hilariously bad entries in survival game horror, along with all this week's new blu-ray releases. ―  I've had all kinds of problems getting my anime streaming apps to work lately, but at least this has given me an excuse to binge some nature documentaries. And yes, I absolutely make up obnoxious dialogue for the animals on screen, because that's the only corre...                    column          26 comments       Shelf Life - My Girlfriend is Shobitch   2019 Feb  5, 04:00 26 comments                 anime    Gabriella takes on a particularly stiff and seemingly already forgotten comedy about sexually clueless teens - plus all of this week's new anime DVD & Bluray releases! ―  Collecting things can be a strange process, especially when you look at it from an outsider's perspective. I recently tried to explain to someone why, when faced with a choice between two video games, I bought the one that cost more...                    column          20 comments       Shelf Life - Girls' Last Tour   2019 Jan 29, 02:00 20 comments                 anime    Paul discovers the world's most heartwarming apocalypse anime and breaks down all this week's new anime Blu-ray releases! ―  I can already sense my hopes of staying current with this season's simulcasts slipping away, but one series I've managed to keep up with is Run With the Wind. It's a nice little sports story with less of the typical teenage drama, and there's something wonderfully indulgent abo...                    column          9 comments       Shelf Life - Hells   2019 Jan 22, 03:15 9 comments                 anime    Paul takes a look at Madhouse's avant-garde movie about the underworld with a dub produced by Youtubers, plus a brand-new Shelf Obsessed submission and all this week's new anime releases! ―  By the time you read this, I'll probably be digging out from a foot or more of snow.

I'll be taking next week off, so you won't see a new column on the 24th (don't worry, nothing's coming out that week anyway). We'll be back with a ""year in review""...                    column          20 comments       Shelf Life - UQ Holder!   2018 Dec 11, 01:00 20 comments                 anime    Gabriella plunges deep into the lore of Ken Akamatsu for this Negima! spinoff action series, while Paul breaks down all this week's new anime releases! ―  I picked up the new Super Smash Bros. game this week, only to re-discover that I'm not very good at Smash games (and I never have been). Thankfully, the holidays should give me plenty of time to get better, or at least less comically awful. In the ...                    column          12 comments       Shelf Life - Scum's Wish   2018 Dec  4, 01:00 12 comments                 anime    James checks out this sexually charged teen melodrama with a surprisingly heartfelt edge, while Paul runs down all this week's new anime releases! ―  I saw Mirai last week, and it's an interesting film, particularly if you've seen any of Mamoru Hosoda's other movies. It's one of those stories that manages to be about children without being exclusively for children. If it's playing in your area, you m...                    column          11 comments       Shelf Life - Love, Chunibyo & Other Delusions!

It also means that some of this week's price links might be out of date (since I usually put these columns together on Saturday), so ...                    column          5 comments       Shelf Life - Terraformars Revenge   2018 Nov 20, 02:00 5 comments                 anime    Paul checks out the crude but effective sequel to a troubled anime series about fighting giant bugs on Mars, plus a breakdown of all this week's new anime releases! ―  Something about living in the Northeastern US has a tendency to warp one's mind in very particular ways.

Paul Jensen finds out. Plus, all this week's new anime releases! ―  A friend of mine is headed to Anime NYC next weekend.

It's a delightfully twisted little comedy, a fun send-up of both zombie and idol shows. I know that sounds insane, but it works better than it sounds. Welcome to Shelf Life.

I'm just hoping this doesn't make life more...                    column          40 comments       Shelf Life - Angel Cop   2018 Oct 15, 23:00 40 comments                 anime    This cyberpunk '80s OVA may be nostalgic for some fans, but it's hardly angelic.

PLUS: all of this week's new anime DVD & Bluray releases! ―  I rarely end up revisiting any of my old streaming review shows, if only because writing about a series every week forces you to get just about everything out of it on the first viewing.
