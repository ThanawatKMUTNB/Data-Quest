News Former Shonen Sunday Editor-in-Chief Takenori Ichihara Resigns from Shogakukan to Write Manga   posted on 2022-04-15 22:15 UTC-8 by Crystalyn Hodgkins         Ichihara stepped down from EiC role in October after serving in position for 6 years    Former editor-in-chief of Shogakukan's Weekly Shonen Sunday magazine Takenori Ichihara announced on Twitter on Friday that he has resigned from Shogakukan. Ichihara stated he will instead write manga (as an original author, instead of as an illustrator).    Ichihara stepped down as the editor-in-chief of Weekly Shonen Sunday in October, after being in the position for six years and three months. He became editor-in-chief in 2015. Kazunori Ohshima is the current editor-in-chief.    Ichihara had the second longest tenure out of all of the magazine's editors-in-chief. Kazuki Tanaka holds the magazine's record for longest tenure as editor-in-chief. Tanaka served in the role from 1976-1984.    As editor-in-chief, Ichihara personally made decisions on manga content, from debut one-shots from new talents to new series from veteran writers, based on his preferences and aesthetic. As such, he said he would take full responsibility for the fate of the magazine. Ichihara considered fostering the talent of new manga artists the magazine's biggest priority. His vision for the magazine included experienced writers for a mix of new and old.    Ichihara stated he was primarily a Shonen Sunday fan as a kid.    Weekly Shonen Sunday first launched in March 1959. Like Shueisha's Weekly Shonen Jump and Kodansha's Weekly Shōnen Magazine, the magazine's circulation had dropped in recent years, falling below 600,000 in July-September 2011 and below 400,000 in the first quarter of 2015.    The magazine has serialized such manga as Detective Conan, Inuyasha, Major, and Komi Can't Communicate.

News Former Shonen Sunday Editor-in-Chief Takenori Ichihara Resigns from Shogakukan to Write Manga   posted on 2022-04-15 22:15 UTC-8 by Crystalyn Hodgkins         Ichihara stepped down from EiC role in October after serving in position for 6 years    Former editor-in-chief of Shogakukan's Weekly Shonen Sunday magazine Takenori Ichihara announced on Twitter on Friday that he has resigned from Shogakukan. Ichihara stated he will instead write manga (as an original author, instead of as an illustrator).    Ichihara stepped down as the editor-in-chief of Weekly Shonen Sunday in October, after being in the position for six years and three months. He became editor-in-chief in 2015. Kazunori Ohshima is the current editor-in-chief.    Ichihara had the second longest tenure out of all of the magazine's editors-in-chief. Kazuki Tanaka holds the magazine's record for longest tenure as editor-in-chief. Tanaka served in the role from 1976-1984.    As editor-in-chief, Ichihara personally made decisions on manga content, from debut one-shots from new talents to new series from veteran writers, based on his preferences and aesthetic. As such, he said he would take full responsibility for the fate of the magazine. Ichihara considered fostering the talent of new manga artists the magazine's biggest priority. His vision for the magazine included experienced writers for a mix of new and old.    Ichihara stated he was primarily a Shonen Sunday fan as a kid.    Weekly Shonen Sunday first launched in March 1959. Like Shueisha's Weekly Shonen Jump and Kodansha's Weekly Shōnen Magazine, the magazine's circulation had dropped in recent years, falling below 600,000 in July-September 2011 and below 400,000 in the first quarter of 2015.    The magazine has serialized such manga as Detective Conan, Inuyasha, Major, and Komi Can't Communicate.

News Former Shonen Sunday Editor-in-Chief Takenori Ichihara Resigns from Shogakukan to Write Manga   posted on 2022-04-15 22:15 UTC-8 by Crystalyn Hodgkins         Ichihara stepped down from EiC role in October after serving in position for 6 years    Former editor-in-chief of Shogakukan's Weekly Shonen Sunday magazine Takenori Ichihara announced on Twitter on Friday that he has resigned from Shogakukan. Ichihara stated he will instead write manga (as an original author, instead of as an illustrator).    Ichihara stepped down as the editor-in-chief of Weekly Shonen Sunday in October, after being in the position for six years and three months. He became editor-in-chief in 2015. Kazunori Ohshima is the current editor-in-chief.    Ichihara had the second longest tenure out of all of the magazine's editors-in-chief. Kazuki Tanaka holds the magazine's record for longest tenure as editor-in-chief. Tanaka served in the role from 1976-1984.    As editor-in-chief, Ichihara personally made decisions on manga content, from debut one-shots from new talents to new series from veteran writers, based on his preferences and aesthetic. As such, he said he would take full responsibility for the fate of the magazine. Ichihara considered fostering the talent of new manga artists the magazine's biggest priority. His vision for the magazine included experienced writers for a mix of new and old.    Ichihara stated he was primarily a Shonen Sunday fan as a kid.    Weekly Shonen Sunday first launched in March 1959. Like Shueisha's Weekly Shonen Jump and Kodansha's Weekly Shōnen Magazine, the magazine's circulation had dropped in recent years, falling below 600,000 in July-September 2011 and below 400,000 in the first quarter of 2015.    The magazine has serialized such manga as Detective Conan, Inuyasha, Major, and Komi Can't Communicate.

News In Another World With My Smartphone Anime Gets 2nd Season   posted on 2022-04-15 17:46 UTC-8 by Crystalyn Hodgkins         1st season of anime based on light novel series premiered in 2017    The official website for the television anime of Patora Fuyuhara's In Another World With My Smartphone (Isekai wa Smartphone to Tomo ni.) light novel series announced on Friday that the anime is getting a second season. The website also posted an illustration from light novel illustrator Eiji Usatsuka to commemorate the announcement.     The first season premiered in July 2017 and aired for 12 episodes. Crunchyroll streamed the series in Japanese with English subtitles as it aired in Japan, and Funimation streamed an English dub.    Takeyuki Yanase (Himegoto, Onsen Yōsei Hakone-chan) directed the anime at Production Reed. Natsuko Takahashi (My Love Story!!) supervised and wrote the series scripts. Toshihide Masudate (Papillon Rose), Masahiro Sekiguchi (Rainbow Days chief animation director), and Miyako Nishida (Rainbow Days) were all credited as character designers and chief animation directors.    J-Novel Club is releasing the novel series in English, and it describes the story:   After a freak accident involving some lightning winds up zapping him dead, 15-year-old Mochizuki Touya wakes up to find himself face-to-face with God. “I am afraid to say that I have made a bit of a blunder...” laments the old coot. But all is not lost! God says that he can reincarnate Touya into a world of fantasy, and as a bonus, he gets to bring his smartphone along with! So begins Touya's adventure in a new, anachronistic pseudo-medieval world. Friends! Laughs! Tears! Inexplicable Deus ex Machina! He sets off on a journey full of wonder as he absentmindedly travels from place to place, following whatever goal catches his fancy. The curtains lift on an epic tale of swords, sorcery, and smartphone apps!  Fuyuhara launched the In Another World With My Smartphone series in 2013 on the ""Shōsetsuka ni Narō"" website, and Hobby Japan's Novels label is publishing the novels in print with illustrations by Eiji Usatsuka. Soto launched a manga adaptation in 2016, and Yen Press is releasing the manga in English.

News In Another World With My Smartphone Anime Gets 2nd Season   posted on 2022-04-15 17:46 UTC-8 by Crystalyn Hodgkins         1st season of anime based on light novel series premiered in 2017    The official website for the television anime of Patora Fuyuhara's In Another World With My Smartphone (Isekai wa Smartphone to Tomo ni.) light novel series announced on Friday that the anime is getting a second season. The website also posted an illustration from light novel illustrator Eiji Usatsuka to commemorate the announcement.     The first season premiered in July 2017 and aired for 12 episodes. Crunchyroll streamed the series in Japanese with English subtitles as it aired in Japan, and Funimation streamed an English dub.    Takeyuki Yanase (Himegoto, Onsen Yōsei Hakone-chan) directed the anime at Production Reed. Natsuko Takahashi (My Love Story!!) supervised and wrote the series scripts. Toshihide Masudate (Papillon Rose), Masahiro Sekiguchi (Rainbow Days chief animation director), and Miyako Nishida (Rainbow Days) were all credited as character designers and chief animation directors.    J-Novel Club is releasing the novel series in English, and it describes the story:   After a freak accident involving some lightning winds up zapping him dead, 15-year-old Mochizuki Touya wakes up to find himself face-to-face with God. “I am afraid to say that I have made a bit of a blunder...” laments the old coot. But all is not lost! God says that he can reincarnate Touya into a world of fantasy, and as a bonus, he gets to bring his smartphone along with! So begins Touya's adventure in a new, anachronistic pseudo-medieval world. Friends! Laughs! Tears! Inexplicable Deus ex Machina! He sets off on a journey full of wonder as he absentmindedly travels from place to place, following whatever goal catches his fancy. The curtains lift on an epic tale of swords, sorcery, and smartphone apps!  Fuyuhara launched the In Another World With My Smartphone series in 2013 on the ""Shōsetsuka ni Narō"" website, and Hobby Japan's Novels label is publishing the novels in print with illustrations by Eiji Usatsuka. Soto launched a manga adaptation in 2016, and Yen Press is releasing the manga in English.

Interest Newspaper Ad for Raunchy Tawawa on Monday Manga Draws Ire   posted on 2022-04-16 02:45 UTC-8 by Lynzee Loveridge         The global gender equality group UN Women deems ad ""unacceptable,"" calls for explanation from The Nikkei newspaper    A full-page ad for the Tawawa on Monday (Getsuyōbi no Tawawa) fanservice manga series was published in The Nikkei newspaper on April 4 and has since drawn criticism from the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women). The global gender equality organization issued a letter to the newspaper on April 11 stating that the advertisement is ""unacceptable"" and asked for further clarification about the choice to print it.     電車で紙の日経読んでいたら月曜日のたわわの広告を発見(　ﾟ∀ﾟ)o彡° pic.twitter.com/ggc3eKoJ6D— kissshot2015 (@Kissshot2015) April 4, 2022     The ad shows main character Ai standing in profile in her school uniform. The text reads, ""I hope this will be a wonderful week."" Kodansha placed the ad to promote the release of the manga's fourth volume.    ""April 4th is the first Monday of the year for new employees,"" a representative from Young Magazine told Comic Natalie. ""We put up a full-page ad to blow away their anxiety and cheer them up"".""    The manga series began in 2015 as weekly pin-ups posted on artist  Kiseki Himura's Twitter account. The main character, Ai, is a high school girl with large breasts who encounters a businessman on the train ride to school. The girl's regular appearance on the train brightens up the man's gloomy Monday commute.    The Nikkei paper is part of UN Women's Unstereotype Alliance effort, a global campaign to promote ""gender equality through media and advertising and eliminate harmful stereotypes."" The Nikkei paper has taken an active role in promoting the initiative's ideas in the past, including the ""Nikkei Woman Empowerment Advertising Award,"" which recognizes advertisements that contribute to gender equality. The award has a three-step process for screening ads known as ""The 3 Ps"" - Presence (does the ad include diverse people?), Perspective (does it take the perspectives of both men and women into account?), and Personality (does the subject show personality and independence?).    Kae Ishikawa, the director of UN Women's Japan-based office, was interviewed by The Huffington Post about the advertisement, which sparked additional controversy online. According to Ishikawa, the manga ad fails to meet the requirements outlined in The 3 Ps. She told The Huffington Post that the ad reflects a male-centric view of high school girls and that their personality is limited to being sexually enticing to men.    ""Obviously, advertising a manga about a underage girl as a male sexual target risks promoting stereotypes that impose these roles on women,"" Ishikawa said.    Part of the issue is the newspaper's target audience, according to Tokyo Institute of Technology professor Renge Jibu. The Nikkei is the largest business newspaper in Japan, akin to the U.S.'s The Wall Street Journal or the U.K.'s Financial Times. The choice to run the ad there was more likely to draw attention from people who didn't want to see it.    ""It's not a problem for people who want to read Young Magazine to pick it up and read it there,"" Professor Jibu said. ""Rather, the problem is that the media failed to protect the 'right of women and men who do not like sexually explicit manga not to be exposed to expressions they do not want to see.'""    The Nikkei's PR office told The Huffington Post that the company is aware of the current controversy revolving around the ad but do not comment on individual ad placement decisions.    Kodansha issued a statement to The Huffington Post in light of the online controversy. The company said, ""The advertisement was placed in conjunction with the release of the new book in order to attract new readers. We take your comments seriously and will give full consideration to the future development of our advertising.""    Ishikawa told The Huffington Post that she was told by a representative in a meeting with the newspaper that the advertisement was evaluated by various people in the company, but they did not recognize the ad as a problem. She also stated the organization is not questioning the publishers and creators of works like Tawawa on Monday, only the role The Nikkei played in placing the ad due to the publication's status as part of the Unstereotype Alliance effort.    ""Without an explanation from the company, I am not convinced that we will continue to work with them to promote gender equality through the power of advertising,"" Ishikawa said.    Publishing organizations in other countries have stricter guidelines relating to gender equality in advertisements. For example, the U.K.-based Advertising Standards Association has banned advertising using ""harmful stereotypes based on gender"" since 2019.    ""This full-page advertisement has made it clear that Japanese companies and the media are left behind in these international trends,"" said Professor Jibu.    UN Women have asked for a timely response from The Nikkei but have not received a response.    Even the series' anime adaptation has faced some controversy in the past. The first 12-episode season of anime shorts debuted on YouTube in October 2016, but YouTube removed the first episode before restoring it within the same week. NBCUniversal Entertainment Japan relaunched the series on Nico Nico Video beginning with the second episode.    Similar controversies have sparked discussion in the past, including a free Red Cross poster of the titular character from Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out! and a panel of Love Live! Sunshine!! character Chika Takami to promote Nishiura oranges.  In 2015, a sightseeing association in Minokamo, Gifu Prefecture changed a promotional poster depicting a No-Rin character in a sensual pose after receiving complaints that it was inappropriate.    Getsuyōbi no Tawawa  began serializing in Kodansha's Weekly Young Magazine in November 2020. Crunchyroll is streaming both anime seasons on its platform.

Interest Newspaper Ad for Raunchy Tawawa on Monday Manga Draws Ire   posted on 2022-04-16 02:45 UTC-8 by Lynzee Loveridge         The global gender equality group UN Women deems ad ""unacceptable,"" calls for explanation from The Nikkei newspaper    A full-page ad for the Tawawa on Monday (Getsuyōbi no Tawawa) fanservice manga series was published in The Nikkei newspaper on April 4 and has since drawn criticism from the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women). The global gender equality organization issued a letter to the newspaper on April 11 stating that the advertisement is ""unacceptable"" and asked for further clarification about the choice to print it.     電車で紙の日経読んでいたら月曜日のたわわの広告を発見(　ﾟ∀ﾟ)o彡° pic.twitter.com/ggc3eKoJ6D— kissshot2015 (@Kissshot2015) April 4, 2022     The ad shows main character Ai standing in profile in her school uniform. The text reads, ""I hope this will be a wonderful week."" Kodansha placed the ad to promote the release of the manga's fourth volume.    ""April 4th is the first Monday of the year for new employees,"" a representative from Young Magazine told Comic Natalie. ""We put up a full-page ad to blow away their anxiety and cheer them up"".""    The manga series began in 2015 as weekly pin-ups posted on artist  Kiseki Himura's Twitter account.

""It's not a problem for people who want to read Young Magazine to pick it up and read it there,"" Professor Jibu said. ""Rather, the problem is that the media failed to protect the 'right of women and men who do not like sexually explicit manga not to be exposed to expressions they do not want to see.'""    The Nikkei's PR office told The Huffington Post that the company is aware of the current controversy revolving around the ad but do not comment on individual ad placement decisions.    Kodansha issued a statement to The Huffington Post in light of the online controversy. The company said, ""The advertisement was placed in conjunction with the release of the new book in order to attract new readers. We take your comments seriously and will give full consideration to the future development of our advertising.""    Ishikawa told The Huffington Post that she was told by a representative in a meeting with the newspaper that the advertisement was evaluated by various people in the company, but they did not recognize the ad as a problem. She also stated the organization is not questioning the publishers and creators of works like Tawawa on Monday, only the role The Nikkei played in placing the ad due to the publication's status as part of the Unstereotype Alliance effort.    ""Without an explanation from the company, I am not convinced that we will continue to work with them to promote gender equality through the power of advertising,"" Ishikawa said.    Publishing organizations in other countries have stricter guidelines relating to gender equality in advertisements. For example, the U.K.-based Advertising Standards Association has banned advertising using ""harmful stereotypes based on gender"" since 2019.    ""This full-page advertisement has made it clear that Japanese companies and the media are left behind in these international trends,"" said Professor Jibu.    UN Women have asked for a timely response from The Nikkei but have not received a response.    Even the series' anime adaptation has faced some controversy in the past. The first 12-episode season of anime shorts debuted on YouTube in October 2016, but YouTube removed the first episode before restoring it within the same week. NBCUniversal Entertainment Japan relaunched the series on Nico Nico Video beginning with the second episode.    Similar controversies have sparked discussion in the past, including a free Red Cross poster of the titular character from Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out! and a panel of Love Live! Sunshine!! character Chika Takami to promote Nishiura oranges.  In 2015, a sightseeing association in Minokamo, Gifu Prefecture changed a promotional poster depicting a No-Rin character in a sensual pose after receiving complaints that it was inappropriate.    Getsuyōbi no Tawawa  began serializing in Kodansha's Weekly Young Magazine in November 2020. Crunchyroll is streaming both anime seasons on its platform.

Interest Newspaper Ad for Raunchy Tawawa on Monday Manga Draws Ire   posted on 2022-04-16 02:45 UTC-8 by Lynzee Loveridge         The global gender equality group UN Women deems ad ""unacceptable,"" calls for explanation from The Nikkei newspaper    A full-page ad for the Tawawa on Monday (Getsuyōbi no Tawawa) fanservice manga series was published in The Nikkei newspaper on April 4 and has since drawn criticism from the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women). The global gender equality organization issued a letter to the newspaper on April 11 stating that the advertisement is ""unacceptable"" and asked for further clarification about the choice to print it.     電車で紙の日経読んでいたら月曜日のたわわの広告を発見(　ﾟ∀ﾟ)o彡° pic.twitter.com/ggc3eKoJ6D— kissshot2015 (@Kissshot2015) April 4, 2022     The ad shows main character Ai standing in profile in her school uniform. The text reads, ""I hope this will be a wonderful week."" Kodansha placed the ad to promote the release of the manga's fourth volume.    ""April 4th is the first Monday of the year for new employees,"" a representative from Young Magazine told Comic Natalie. ""We put up a full-page ad to blow away their anxiety and cheer them up"".""    The manga series began in 2015 as weekly pin-ups posted on artist  Kiseki Himura's Twitter account. The main character, Ai, is a high school girl with large breasts who encounters a businessman on the train ride to school. The girl's regular appearance on the train brightens up the man's gloomy Monday commute.    The Nikkei paper is part of UN Women's Unstereotype Alliance effort, a global campaign to promote ""gender equality through media and advertising and eliminate harmful stereotypes."" The Nikkei paper has taken an active role in promoting the initiative's ideas in the past, including the ""Nikkei Woman Empowerment Advertising Award,"" which recognizes advertisements that contribute to gender equality. The award has a three-step process for screening ads known as ""The 3 Ps"" - Presence (does the ad include diverse people?), Perspective (does it take the perspectives of both men and women into account?), and Personality (does the subject show personality and independence?).    Kae Ishikawa, the director of UN Women's Japan-based office, was interviewed by The Huffington Post about the advertisement, which sparked additional controversy online. According to Ishikawa, the manga ad fails to meet the requirements outlined in The 3 Ps. She told The Huffington Post that the ad reflects a male-centric view of high school girls and that their personality is limited to being sexually enticing to men.    ""Obviously, advertising a manga about a underage girl as a male sexual target risks promoting stereotypes that impose these roles on women,"" Ishikawa said.    Part of the issue is the newspaper's target audience, according to Tokyo Institute of Technology professor Renge Jibu. The Nikkei is the largest business newspaper in Japan, akin to the U.S.'s The Wall Street Journal or the U.K.'s Financial Times. The choice to run the ad there was more likely to draw attention from people who didn't want to see it.    ""It's not a problem for people who want to read Young Magazine to pick it up and read it there,"" Professor Jibu said. ""Rather, the problem is that the media failed to protect the 'right of women and men who do not like sexually explicit manga not to be exposed to expressions they do not want to see.'""    The Nikkei's PR office told The Huffington Post that the company is aware of the current controversy revolving around the ad but do not comment on individual ad placement decisions.    Kodansha issued a statement to The Huffington Post in light of the online controversy. The company said, ""The advertisement was placed in conjunction with the release of the new book in order to attract new readers. We take your comments seriously and will give full consideration to the future development of our advertising.""    Ishikawa told The Huffington Post that she was told by a representative in a meeting with the newspaper that the advertisement was evaluated by various people in the company, but they did not recognize the ad as a problem. She also stated the organization is not questioning the publishers and creators of works like Tawawa on Monday, only the role The Nikkei played in placing the ad due to the publication's status as part of the Unstereotype Alliance effort.    ""Without an explanation from the company, I am not convinced that we will continue to work with them to promote gender equality through the power of advertising,"" Ishikawa said.    Publishing organizations in other countries have stricter guidelines relating to gender equality in advertisements. For example, the U.K.-based Advertising Standards Association has banned advertising using ""harmful stereotypes based on gender"" since 2019.    ""This full-page advertisement has made it clear that Japanese companies and the media are left behind in these international trends,"" said Professor Jibu.    UN Women have asked for a timely response from The Nikkei but have not received a response.    Even the series' anime adaptation has faced some controversy in the past. The first 12-episode season of anime shorts debuted on YouTube in October 2016, but YouTube removed the first episode before restoring it within the same week. NBCUniversal Entertainment Japan relaunched the series on Nico Nico Video beginning with the second episode.    Similar controversies have sparked discussion in the past, including a free Red Cross poster of the titular character from Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out! and a panel of Love Live! Sunshine!! character Chika Takami to promote Nishiura oranges.

Interest Newspaper Ad for Raunchy Tawawa on Monday Manga Draws Ire   posted on 2022-04-16 02:45 UTC-8 by Lynzee Loveridge         The global gender equality group UN Women deems ad ""unacceptable,"" calls for explanation from The Nikkei newspaper    A full-page ad for the Tawawa on Monday (Getsuyōbi no Tawawa) fanservice manga series was published in The Nikkei newspaper on April 4 and has since drawn criticism from the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women). The global gender equality organization issued a letter to the newspaper on April 11 stating that the advertisement is ""unacceptable"" and asked for further clarification about the choice to print it.     電車で紙の日経読んでいたら月曜日のたわわの広告を発見(　ﾟ∀ﾟ)o彡° pic.twitter.com/ggc3eKoJ6D— kissshot2015 (@Kissshot2015) April 4, 2022     The ad shows main character Ai standing in profile in her school uniform. The text reads, ""I hope this will be a wonderful week."" Kodansha placed the ad to promote the release of the manga's fourth volume.    ""April 4th is the first Monday of the year for new employees,"" a representative from Young Magazine told Comic Natalie. ""We put up a full-page ad to blow away their anxiety and cheer them up"".""    The manga series began in 2015 as weekly pin-ups posted on artist  Kiseki Himura's Twitter account. The main character, Ai, is a high school girl with large breasts who encounters a businessman on the train ride to school. The girl's regular appearance on the train brightens up the man's gloomy Monday commute.    The Nikkei paper is part of UN Women's Unstereotype Alliance effort, a global campaign to promote ""gender equality through media and advertising and eliminate harmful stereotypes."" The Nikkei paper has taken an active role in promoting the initiative's ideas in the past, including the ""Nikkei Woman Empowerment Advertising Award,"" which recognizes advertisements that contribute to gender equality. The award has a three-step process for screening ads known as ""The 3 Ps"" - Presence (does the ad include diverse people?), Perspective (does it take the perspectives of both men and women into account?), and Personality (does the subject show personality and independence?).    Kae Ishikawa, the director of UN Women's Japan-based office, was interviewed by The Huffington Post about the advertisement, which sparked additional controversy online. According to Ishikawa, the manga ad fails to meet the requirements outlined in The 3 Ps. She told The Huffington Post that the ad reflects a male-centric view of high school girls and that their personality is limited to being sexually enticing to men.    ""Obviously, advertising a manga about a underage girl as a male sexual target risks promoting stereotypes that impose these roles on women,"" Ishikawa said.    Part of the issue is the newspaper's target audience, according to Tokyo Institute of Technology professor Renge Jibu. The Nikkei is the largest business newspaper in Japan, akin to the U.S.'s The Wall Street Journal or the U.K.'s Financial Times. The choice to run the ad there was more likely to draw attention from people who didn't want to see it.    ""It's not a problem for people who want to read Young Magazine to pick it up and read it there,"" Professor Jibu said. ""Rather, the problem is that the media failed to protect the 'right of women and men who do not like sexually explicit manga not to be exposed to expressions they do not want to see.'""    The Nikkei's PR office told The Huffington Post that the company is aware of the current controversy revolving around the ad but do not comment on individual ad placement decisions.    Kodansha issued a statement to The Huffington Post in light of the online controversy. The company said, ""The advertisement was placed in conjunction with the release of the new book in order to attract new readers. We take your comments seriously and will give full consideration to the future development of our advertising.""    Ishikawa told The Huffington Post that she was told by a representative in a meeting with the newspaper that the advertisement was evaluated by various people in the company, but they did not recognize the ad as a problem. She also stated the organization is not questioning the publishers and creators of works like Tawawa on Monday, only the role The Nikkei played in placing the ad due to the publication's status as part of the Unstereotype Alliance effort.    ""Without an explanation from the company, I am not convinced that we will continue to work with them to promote gender equality through the power of advertising,"" Ishikawa said.    Publishing organizations in other countries have stricter guidelines relating to gender equality in advertisements. For example, the U.K.-based Advertising Standards Association has banned advertising using ""harmful stereotypes based on gender"" since 2019.    ""This full-page advertisement has made it clear that Japanese companies and the media are left behind in these international trends,"" said Professor Jibu.    UN Women have asked for a timely response from The Nikkei but have not received a response.    Even the series' anime adaptation has faced some controversy in the past. The first 12-episode season of anime shorts debuted on YouTube in October 2016, but YouTube removed the first episode before restoring it within the same week. NBCUniversal Entertainment Japan relaunched the series on Nico Nico Video beginning with the second episode.    Similar controversies have sparked discussion in the past, including a free Red Cross poster of the titular character from Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out! and a panel of Love Live! Sunshine!! character Chika Takami to promote Nishiura oranges.  In 2015, a sightseeing association in Minokamo, Gifu Prefecture changed a promotional poster depicting a No-Rin character in a sensual pose after receiving complaints that it was inappropriate.    Getsuyōbi no Tawawa  began serializing in Kodansha's Weekly Young Magazine in November 2020. Crunchyroll is streaming both anime seasons on its platform.

Interest Newspaper Ad for Raunchy Tawawa on Monday Manga Draws Ire   posted on 2022-04-16 02:45 UTC-8 by Lynzee Loveridge         The global gender equality group UN Women deems ad ""unacceptable,"" calls for explanation from The Nikkei newspaper    A full-page ad for the Tawawa on Monday (Getsuyōbi no Tawawa) fanservice manga series was published in The Nikkei newspaper on April 4 and has since drawn criticism from the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women). The global gender equality organization issued a letter to the newspaper on April 11 stating that the advertisement is ""unacceptable"" and asked for further clarification about the choice to print it.     電車で紙の日経読んでいたら月曜日のたわわの広告を発見(　ﾟ∀ﾟ)o彡° pic.twitter.com/ggc3eKoJ6D— kissshot2015 (@Kissshot2015) April 4, 2022     The ad shows main character Ai standing in profile in her school uniform. The text reads, ""I hope this will be a wonderful week."" Kodansha placed the ad to promote the release of the manga's fourth volume.    ""April 4th is the first Monday of the year for new employees,"" a representative from Young Magazine told Comic Natalie. ""We put up a full-page ad to blow away their anxiety and cheer them up"".""    The manga series began in 2015 as weekly pin-ups posted on artist  Kiseki Himura's Twitter account. The main character, Ai, is a high school girl with large breasts who encounters a businessman on the train ride to school. The girl's regular appearance on the train brightens up the man's gloomy Monday commute.    The Nikkei paper is part of UN Women's Unstereotype Alliance effort, a global campaign to promote ""gender equality through media and advertising and eliminate harmful stereotypes."" The Nikkei paper has taken an active role in promoting the initiative's ideas in the past, including the ""Nikkei Woman Empowerment Advertising Award,"" which recognizes advertisements that contribute to gender equality. The award has a three-step process for screening ads known as ""The 3 Ps"" - Presence (does the ad include diverse people?), Perspective (does it take the perspectives of both men and women into account?), and Personality (does the subject show personality and independence?).    Kae Ishikawa, the director of UN Women's Japan-based office, was interviewed by The Huffington Post about the advertisement, which sparked additional controversy online. According to Ishikawa, the manga ad fails to meet the requirements outlined in The 3 Ps. She told The Huffington Post that the ad reflects a male-centric view of high school girls and that their personality is limited to being sexually enticing to men.    ""Obviously, advertising a manga about a underage girl as a male sexual target risks promoting stereotypes that impose these roles on women,"" Ishikawa said.    Part of the issue is the newspaper's target audience, according to Tokyo Institute of Technology professor Renge Jibu. The Nikkei is the largest business newspaper in Japan, akin to the U.S.'s The Wall Street Journal or the U.K.'s Financial Times. The choice to run the ad there was more likely to draw attention from people who didn't want to see it.    ""It's not a problem for people who want to read Young Magazine to pick it up and read it there,"" Professor Jibu said. ""Rather, the problem is that the media failed to protect the 'right of women and men who do not like sexually explicit manga not to be exposed to expressions they do not want to see.'""    The Nikkei's PR office told The Huffington Post that the company is aware of the current controversy revolving around the ad but do not comment on individual ad placement decisions.    Kodansha issued a statement to The Huffington Post in light of the online controversy. The company said, ""The advertisement was placed in conjunction with the release of the new book in order to attract new readers. We take your comments seriously and will give full consideration to the future development of our advertising.""    Ishikawa told The Huffington Post that she was told by a representative in a meeting with the newspaper that the advertisement was evaluated by various people in the company, but they did not recognize the ad as a problem. She also stated the organization is not questioning the publishers and creators of works like Tawawa on Monday, only the role The Nikkei played in placing the ad due to the publication's status as part of the Unstereotype Alliance effort.    ""Without an explanation from the company, I am not convinced that we will continue to work with them to promote gender equality through the power of advertising,"" Ishikawa said.    Publishing organizations in other countries have stricter guidelines relating to gender equality in advertisements. For example, the U.K.-based Advertising Standards Association has banned advertising using ""harmful stereotypes based on gender"" since 2019.    ""This full-page advertisement has made it clear that Japanese companies and the media are left behind in these international trends,"" said Professor Jibu.    UN Women have asked for a timely response from The Nikkei but have not received a response.    Even the series' anime adaptation has faced some controversy in the past. The first 12-episode season of anime shorts debuted on YouTube in October 2016, but YouTube removed the first episode before restoring it within the same week. NBCUniversal Entertainment Japan relaunched the series on Nico Nico Video beginning with the second episode.    Similar controversies have sparked discussion in the past, including a free Red Cross poster of the titular character from Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out! and a panel of Love Live! Sunshine!! character Chika Takami to promote Nishiura oranges.  In 2015, a sightseeing association in Minokamo, Gifu Prefecture changed a promotional poster depicting a No-Rin character in a sensual pose after receiving complaints that it was inappropriate.    Getsuyōbi no Tawawa  began serializing in Kodansha's Weekly Young Magazine in November 2020. Crunchyroll is streaming both anime seasons on its platform.

""Rather, the problem is that the media failed to protect the 'right of women and men who do not like sexually explicit manga not to be exposed to expressions they do not want to see.'""    The Nikkei's PR office told The Huffington Post that the company is aware of the current controversy revolving around the ad but do not comment on individual ad placement decisions.    Kodansha issued a statement to The Huffington Post in light of the online controversy. The company said, ""The advertisement was placed in conjunction with the release of the new book in order to attract new readers. We take your comments seriously and will give full consideration to the future development of our advertising.""    Ishikawa told The Huffington Post that she was told by a representative in a meeting with the newspaper that the advertisement was evaluated by various people in the company, but they did not recognize the ad as a problem. She also stated the organization is not questioning the publishers and creators of works like Tawawa on Monday, only the role The Nikkei played in placing the ad due to the publication's status as part of the Unstereotype Alliance effort.    ""Without an explanation from the company, I am not convinced that we will continue to work with them to promote gender equality through the power of advertising,"" Ishikawa said.    Publishing organizations in other countries have stricter guidelines relating to gender equality in advertisements. For example, the U.K.-based Advertising Standards Association has banned advertising using ""harmful stereotypes based on gender"" since 2019.    ""This full-page advertisement has made it clear that Japanese companies and the media are left behind in these international trends,"" said Professor Jibu.    UN Women have asked for a timely response from The Nikkei but have not received a response.    Even the series' anime adaptation has faced some controversy in the past. The first 12-episode season of anime shorts debuted on YouTube in October 2016, but YouTube removed the first episode before restoring it within the same week. NBCUniversal Entertainment Japan relaunched the series on Nico Nico Video beginning with the second episode.    Similar controversies have sparked discussion in the past, including a free Red Cross poster of the titular character from Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out! and a panel of Love Live! Sunshine!! character Chika Takami to promote Nishiura oranges.  In 2015, a sightseeing association in Minokamo, Gifu Prefecture changed a promotional poster depicting a No-Rin character in a sensual pose after receiving complaints that it was inappropriate.

""April 4th is the first Monday of the year for new employees,"" a representative from Young Magazine told Comic Natalie. ""We put up a full-page ad to blow away their anxiety and cheer them up"".""    The manga series began in 2015 as weekly pin-ups posted on artist  Kiseki Himura's Twitter account.

The Nikkei paper has taken an active role in promoting the initiative's ideas in the past, including the ""Nikkei Woman Empowerment Advertising Award,"" which recognizes advertisements that contribute to gender equality. The award has a three-step process for screening ads known as ""The 3 Ps"" - Presence (does the ad include diverse people?), Perspective (does it take the perspectives of both men and women into account?), and Personality (does the subject show personality and independence?).    Kae Ishikawa, the director of UN Women's Japan-based office, was interviewed by The Huffington Post about the advertisement, which sparked additional controversy online. According to Ishikawa, the manga ad fails to meet the requirements outlined in The 3 Ps. She told The Huffington Post that the ad reflects a male-centric view of high school girls and that their personality is limited to being sexually enticing to men.    ""Obviously, advertising a manga about a underage girl as a male sexual target risks promoting stereotypes that impose these roles on women,"" Ishikawa said.

""This full-page advertisement has made it clear that Japanese companies and the media are left behind in these international trends,"" said Professor Jibu.    UN Women have asked for a timely response from The Nikkei but have not received a response.    Even the series' anime adaptation has faced some controversy in the past. The first 12-episode season of anime shorts debuted on YouTube in October 2016, but YouTube removed the first episode before restoring it within the same week. NBCUniversal Entertainment Japan relaunched the series on Nico Nico Video beginning with the second episode.    Similar controversies have sparked discussion in the past, including a free Red Cross poster of the titular character from Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out! and a panel of Love Live! Sunshine!! character Chika Takami to promote Nishiura oranges.  In 2015, a sightseeing association in Minokamo, Gifu Prefecture changed a promotional poster depicting a No-Rin character in a sensual pose after receiving complaints that it was inappropriate.

The global gender equality organization issued a letter to the newspaper on April 11 stating that the advertisement is ""unacceptable"" and asked for further clarification about the choice to print it.     電車で紙の日経読んでいたら月曜日のたわわの広告を発見(　ﾟ∀ﾟ)o彡° pic.twitter.com/ggc3eKoJ6D— kissshot2015 (@Kissshot2015) April 4, 2022     The ad shows main character Ai standing in profile in her school uniform. The text reads, ""I hope this will be a wonderful week."" Kodansha placed the ad to promote the release of the manga's fourth volume.    ""April 4th is the first Monday of the year for new employees,"" a representative from Young Magazine told Comic Natalie. ""We put up a full-page ad to blow away their anxiety and cheer them up"".""    The manga series began in 2015 as weekly pin-ups posted on artist  Kiseki Himura's Twitter account. The main character, Ai, is a high school girl with large breasts who encounters a businessman on the train ride to school. The girl's regular appearance on the train brightens up the man's gloomy Monday commute.    The Nikkei paper is part of UN Women's Unstereotype Alliance effort, a global campaign to promote ""gender equality through media and advertising and eliminate harmful stereotypes."" The Nikkei paper has taken an active role in promoting the initiative's ideas in the past, including the ""Nikkei Woman Empowerment Advertising Award,"" which recognizes advertisements that contribute to gender equality. The award has a three-step process for screening ads known as ""The 3 Ps"" - Presence (does the ad include diverse people?), Perspective (does it take the perspectives of both men and women into account?), and Personality (does the subject show personality and independence?).    Kae Ishikawa, the director of UN Women's Japan-based office, was interviewed by The Huffington Post about the advertisement, which sparked additional controversy online. According to Ishikawa, the manga ad fails to meet the requirements outlined in The 3 Ps. She told The Huffington Post that the ad reflects a male-centric view of high school girls and that their personality is limited to being sexually enticing to men.    ""Obviously, advertising a manga about a underage girl as a male sexual target risks promoting stereotypes that impose these roles on women,"" Ishikawa said.    Part of the issue is the newspaper's target audience, according to Tokyo Institute of Technology professor Renge Jibu. The Nikkei is the largest business newspaper in Japan, akin to the U.S.'s The Wall Street Journal or the U.K.'s Financial Times. The choice to run the ad there was more likely to draw attention from people who didn't want to see it.    ""It's not a problem for people who want to read Young Magazine to pick it up and read it there,"" Professor Jibu said. ""Rather, the problem is that the media failed to protect the 'right of women and men who do not like sexually explicit manga not to be exposed to expressions they do not want to see.'""    The Nikkei's PR office told The Huffington Post that the company is aware of the current controversy revolving around the ad but do not comment on individual ad placement decisions.    Kodansha issued a statement to The Huffington Post in light of the online controversy. The company said, ""The advertisement was placed in conjunction with the release of the new book in order to attract new readers. We take your comments seriously and will give full consideration to the future development of our advertising.""    Ishikawa told The Huffington Post that she was told by a representative in a meeting with the newspaper that the advertisement was evaluated by various people in the company, but they did not recognize the ad as a problem. She also stated the organization is not questioning the publishers and creators of works like Tawawa on Monday, only the role The Nikkei played in placing the ad due to the publication's status as part of the Unstereotype Alliance effort.    ""Without an explanation from the company, I am not convinced that we will continue to work with them to promote gender equality through the power of advertising,"" Ishikawa said.    Publishing organizations in other countries have stricter guidelines relating to gender equality in advertisements. For example, the U.K.-based Advertising Standards Association has banned advertising using ""harmful stereotypes based on gender"" since 2019.    ""This full-page advertisement has made it clear that Japanese companies and the media are left behind in these international trends,"" said Professor Jibu.

Which older games have you never found the time to experience? ― It's another one of those slow news weeks, where there's no one story or stories that stand out as particularly huge that I'd need to opine over.

We're finally exiting the doldrums of winter to enjoy the abundant foliage of spring.

How's Elden Ring going? Dying a lot in hilariously painful ways? Yeah, I figured. I'm sure you're aware by now, but there's some awful stuff going on in the world at the moment, and millions of civilians in Ukraine are struggling.

I want to discuss a multi-year gaming console trainwreck that's been impossible to turn away from.

Heidi breaks down what to expect. ― Greetings, everyone! I am quite relieved today, as it was very likely TWIG might not have happened this week. I got the letter in the mail that most every adult dreads: a jury duty summons, set for the exact day I write and submit TWIG. Thankfully, I wasn't needed, which frees me up to both ...                    column          14 comments       This Week in Games - What A Twist   Jan 22, 03:00 14 comments                 games    Good lord.

It feels like forever since we first saw the game revealed. Surprise, surprise – it's suffering from COVID-related development setbacks. ― Here we are, on the final day of 2021. While it wasn't the dumpster fire that 2020 was, I don't think anyone would say it was a particularly amazing year. We did get some darn good games out of it, at least!

It's also...                    column          4 comments       This Week in Games - Punching It Up   Nov 27, 02:08 4 comments                 games    with Christmas just around the corner, most of season's the major new releases have already hit shelves, and now it's simply a matter of finding time to play them all.

Folks, this is the textbook definition of a slow news week.

Unfortunately, most of us couldn't be there even if we wanted to, since it's still a royal pain in the butt to actually get through the country's COVID travel restrictions. Most of the publishers showcasing are announ...                    column          12 comments       This Week in Games - Maidragon Spirit   Sep 25, 00:30 12 comments                 games    Things have just gone from really bad to extremely worse over at the ongoing dumpster fire that is Activision-Blizzard corporate. ― Good day, my lovely ANN audience!

At least I have a bunch of Switch and PS4 ...                    column          5 comments       This Week in Games - The Abyss Beckons   May  8, 03:30 5 comments                 games    Companies that have dealt with Apple and/or Epic – which is roughly 98% of the game industry – are scrambling to make sure these two firms don't accidentally leak stuff while they engage in their courtroom slapfight.

Well, it's the end of April, and so far, 2021's been a great year for gaming. The release schedule is calming down a bit in May, but I can understand why – most publishers really don't want to compete with Resident Evil Village.

Looks like it's that time of week again. It's a little bit slow on the news front, but that's okay – more time to catch all the hot new anime being covered in the preview guide!

Just a heads-up: This Week in Games is probably going to be a Friday thing from now on. This benefits me because game companies, for whatever reason, just love dumping news on Thursdays, leaving me to either delay the column or look horribly out of date. Hopefully Friday publication solves this issue somewhat.

Heidi discusses what made the game so important in THIS WEEK IN GAMES. ― Hello again!

My man Keanu deserved better. ― Ho ho ho, Merry TWIGmas everyone! A little late, I know, but we're still in the holiday spirit.

News Live-Action xxxHOLiC Film's Clip Shows Surprisingly Ordinary Spring Day   posted on 2022-04-14 17:36 UTC-8 by Egan Loo         Watanuki, Doumeki, Himawari share bentō lunches in scene from April 29 film    The official website for Shochiku and ASMIK Ace's live-action film of CLAMP's xxxHOLiC manga posted a new clip from the film titled ""Haru no Nakayoshi 3-nin-gumi"" (Three Pals in Spring) on Thursday. The video shows Watanuki — a high school boy who once spent a solitary life because he can see spirits — letting his guard down and spending a surprisingly ordinary spring day with Shizuka Doumeki and Himawari Kunogi (complete with bentō box lunches he made for everyone).       The original xxxHOLiC manga's story follows Yuuko — a witch who grants people's wishes, but in return the person has to give up something precious — and Kimihiro Watanuki, a man who has visions. One day, Watanuki encounters Yuuko and she promises to get rid of the spirits that torment him. In return Watanuki must work in Yuuko's shop and help her grant other people's wishes.    Ryunosuke Kamiki (left in visual right) plays Kimihiro Watanuki, while Kou Shibasaki (right) plays Yuuko Ichihara.    Other cast members include:     Hokuto Matsumura as Shizuka Doumeki   Tina Tamashiro as Himawari Kunogi   Daoko as Marudashi ""Maru""   Serena Motola as Morodashi ""Moro""   Shuri as Misaki   Nanase Nishino as Nekomusume   Sakurako Ōhara as a guest who is possessed by an ayakashi   Tenchim as a customer at Yuuko's shop who wants her wish granted  Ai Hashimoto as a Zashiki-Warashi spirit in love   Riho Yoshioka as Jorо̄gumo  Hayato Isomura as Akagumo, a movie-original character    Mika Ninagawa (live-action Sakuran, Helter Skelter) is directing the film, with a script by Erika Yoshida. Keiichirō Shibuya is composing the musical soundtrack. The band SEKAI NO OWARI performs the theme song ""Habit.""    The film will open in Japan on April 29.    CLAMP serialized the original xxxHOLiC manga in Kodansha's Weekly Young Magazine and Bessatsu Shōnen Magazine from 2003 to 2011, although it was renamed xxxHOLiC: Rō in 2009. xxxHOLiC: Rei is the latest manga, which launched in 2013 (but is currently on hiatus, although CLAMP stated earlier this month that the group is still planning to continue the manga). The franchise spawned an anime film, two television anime seasons, and several original video anime projects.    The manga inspired a stage play adaptation that ran in Tokyo and Kyoto in September and October.

News Live-Action xxxHOLiC Film's Clip Shows Surprisingly Ordinary Spring Day   posted on 2022-04-14 17:36 UTC-8 by Egan Loo         Watanuki, Doumeki, Himawari share bentō lunches in scene from April 29 film    The official website for Shochiku and ASMIK Ace's live-action film of CLAMP's xxxHOLiC manga posted a new clip from the film titled ""Haru no Nakayoshi 3-nin-gumi"" (Three Pals in Spring) on Thursday. The video shows Watanuki — a high school boy who once spent a solitary life because he can see spirits — letting his guard down and spending a surprisingly ordinary spring day with Shizuka Doumeki and Himawari Kunogi (complete with bentō box lunches he made for everyone).       The original xxxHOLiC manga's story follows Yuuko — a witch who grants people's wishes, but in return the person has to give up something precious — and Kimihiro Watanuki, a man who has visions. One day, Watanuki encounters Yuuko and she promises to get rid of the spirits that torment him. In return Watanuki must work in Yuuko's shop and help her grant other people's wishes.    Ryunosuke Kamiki (left in visual right) plays Kimihiro Watanuki, while Kou Shibasaki (right) plays Yuuko Ichihara.    Other cast members include:     Hokuto Matsumura as Shizuka Doumeki   Tina Tamashiro as Himawari Kunogi   Daoko as Marudashi ""Maru""   Serena Motola as Morodashi ""Moro""   Shuri as Misaki   Nanase Nishino as Nekomusume   Sakurako Ōhara as a guest who is possessed by an ayakashi   Tenchim as a customer at Yuuko's shop who wants her wish granted  Ai Hashimoto as a Zashiki-Warashi spirit in love   Riho Yoshioka as Jorо̄gumo  Hayato Isomura as Akagumo, a movie-original character    Mika Ninagawa (live-action Sakuran, Helter Skelter) is directing the film, with a script by Erika Yoshida. Keiichirō Shibuya is composing the musical soundtrack. The band SEKAI NO OWARI performs the theme song ""Habit.""    The film will open in Japan on April 29.    CLAMP serialized the original xxxHOLiC manga in Kodansha's Weekly Young Magazine and Bessatsu Shōnen Magazine from 2003 to 2011, although it was renamed xxxHOLiC: Rō in 2009. xxxHOLiC: Rei is the latest manga, which launched in 2013 (but is currently on hiatus, although CLAMP stated earlier this month that the group is still planning to continue the manga). The franchise spawned an anime film, two television anime seasons, and several original video anime projects.    The manga inspired a stage play adaptation that ran in Tokyo and Kyoto in September and October.

News Live-Action xxxHOLiC Film's Clip Shows Surprisingly Ordinary Spring Day   posted on 2022-04-14 17:36 UTC-8 by Egan Loo         Watanuki, Doumeki, Himawari share bentō lunches in scene from April 29 film    The official website for Shochiku and ASMIK Ace's live-action film of CLAMP's xxxHOLiC manga posted a new clip from the film titled ""Haru no Nakayoshi 3-nin-gumi"" (Three Pals in Spring) on Thursday. The video shows Watanuki — a high school boy who once spent a solitary life because he can see spirits — letting his guard down and spending a surprisingly ordinary spring day with Shizuka Doumeki and Himawari Kunogi (complete with bentō box lunches he made for everyone).       The original xxxHOLiC manga's story follows Yuuko — a witch who grants people's wishes, but in return the person has to give up something precious — and Kimihiro Watanuki, a man who has visions. One day, Watanuki encounters Yuuko and she promises to get rid of the spirits that torment him. In return Watanuki must work in Yuuko's shop and help her grant other people's wishes.    Ryunosuke Kamiki (left in visual right) plays Kimihiro Watanuki, while Kou Shibasaki (right) plays Yuuko Ichihara.    Other cast members include:     Hokuto Matsumura as Shizuka Doumeki   Tina Tamashiro as Himawari Kunogi   Daoko as Marudashi ""Maru""   Serena Motola as Morodashi ""Moro""   Shuri as Misaki   Nanase Nishino as Nekomusume   Sakurako Ōhara as a guest who is possessed by an ayakashi   Tenchim as a customer at Yuuko's shop who wants her wish granted  Ai Hashimoto as a Zashiki-Warashi spirit in love   Riho Yoshioka as Jorо̄gumo  Hayato Isomura as Akagumo, a movie-original character    Mika Ninagawa (live-action Sakuran, Helter Skelter) is directing the film, with a script by Erika Yoshida. Keiichirō Shibuya is composing the musical soundtrack. The band SEKAI NO OWARI performs the theme song ""Habit.""    The film will open in Japan on April 29.    CLAMP serialized the original xxxHOLiC manga in Kodansha's Weekly Young Magazine and Bessatsu Shōnen Magazine from 2003 to 2011, although it was renamed xxxHOLiC: Rō in 2009. xxxHOLiC: Rei is the latest manga, which launched in 2013 (but is currently on hiatus, although CLAMP stated earlier this month that the group is still planning to continue the manga). The franchise spawned an anime film, two television anime seasons, and several original video anime projects.    The manga inspired a stage play adaptation that ran in Tokyo and Kyoto in September and October.

The video shows Watanuki — a high school boy who once spent a solitary life because he can see spirits — letting his guard down and spending a surprisingly ordinary spring day with Shizuka Doumeki and Himawari Kunogi (complete with bentō box lunches he made for everyone).       The original xxxHOLiC manga's story follows Yuuko — a witch who grants people's wishes, but in return the person has to give up something precious — and Kimihiro Watanuki, a man who has visions. One day, Watanuki encounters Yuuko and she promises to get rid of the spirits that torment him. In return Watanuki must work in Yuuko's shop and help her grant other people's wishes.    Ryunosuke Kamiki (left in visual right) plays Kimihiro Watanuki, while Kou Shibasaki (right) plays Yuuko Ichihara.

CLAMP serialized the original xxxHOLiC manga in Kodansha's Weekly Young Magazine and Bessatsu Shōnen Magazine from 2003 to 2011, although it was renamed xxxHOLiC: Rō in 2009. xxxHOLiC: Rei is the latest manga, which launched in 2013 (but is currently on hiatus, although CLAMP stated earlier this month that the group is still planning to continue the manga). The franchise spawned an anime film, two television anime seasons, and several original video anime projects.

How Composer MAYUKO Created Ranking of Kings' Fantasy-Infused Score   by Lynzee Loveridge, Apr 11th 2022          Writer, composer, arranger and singer, MAYUKO has been performing as a singer-songwriter since she was a student. As a composer, she created music for the drama The Full-Time Wife Escapist, the anime Cells at Work! and her latest soundtrack, available now from Milan Records, is all about capturing the magic of a fantasy world. We sat down with MAYUKO to discuss how she translated the characters and environment of Wit Studio's Ranking of Kings anime series to music.    What sorts of preparation did you do to get a sense of the 'sound' of Ranking of Kings?   I was playing Beethoven, Chopin, Mendelssohn, etc. to bring classical music into my life. It reminded me of my days as a music student.    Are there any key instruments you utilized for consistency throughout the series' score, or is it eclectic?   Since my goal was to build out a full orchestra rather than a specific instrument, I always kept an instrumental instruction book close by and would think about the best instrument that could produce the most appropriate sound in each arrangement. For example, I could really feel the potential of the horn in battle pieces – strong, fat and explosive sound, like in the song “Senritsu.”     What emotions were you hoping to inspire in the series' main theme?   I was told the main theme would be used mostly in teasers and trailers rather than the show itself, so I created it with a more comprehensive, birds-eye vision. The story is about to begin! The chorus of the song expresses the grandeur of the kingdom and the sopranino recorder expresses the Bojji's adventure.     Were there any specifications asked by the series' director or sound director or were you given free rein to experiment?   At my first meeting, I had a spreadsheet of music with over 70 songs and each song was explained in details. Some instruments were specified, but many were left to me. For instance, I decided to use the trombone for “Theme of Kage.”    What was the thought behind the use of a sopranino recorder for Bojji's theme?   I was asked to use a specific instrument for Bojji's theme, and there was a memo asking if that instrument should be a flute. I tried various things, but ultimately decided on a sopranino recorder, which can be both relaxing and cute as well as moderately powerful and strong. It's a great instrument with a wide range of tones.    Are there pieces of music that you feel closely embody specific characters? For example, Bosse, Despa, or Kage?   Bosse is a giant, so boom! I was conscious of using heavy percussion and a low pitch. It was actually easy to create because I only had to keep that in mind. From the beginning, I was given the instruction that Despa's sound should be “cheerful jazz,” and I was very excited to create it. I think it is one of the most unique songs on the soundtrack. Kage, meanwhile, is a survivor of an attack by a group of assassins, but he's not a bad guy, so the instrumentation had to express that middle ground. I thought, “well, maybe the trombone?” Ouken is clad in armor, so I thought the sound of metal = cathedral bells. And then Miranjo expresses some weirdness with the female chorus, triple-time and shimmering bells. Each character was expressed using various rules.     What's your process when you get 'stuck'?   Once you leave the work, you leave the work. When I take a short break and return a few hours later, I start again, and my calm self comes back to me, saying, “What was I so worried about?” When that calm self does not come back… I cry.    Is there a character you came to fond of by the show's end?   Hiling. I don't have such a cute tsundere mother. She can also use her healing ability and I think she is the strongest. I want her to be happy. I want her to listen to my problems when I'm in trouble. I also want to be friends with Despa.    Is there a particular memory of working on the series that will stick with you?   When I wrote the song, “Bojji to Kage no Yujyo,” I was very fond of it and actually wrote and sang lyrics to add to it. It's a song that says, “I will always be by your side.” The reason it was used in the final episode was because of my passion for the song. I couldn't be happier and am so glad I am singer-songwriter.    The full soundtrack for Ranking of Kings is available from Milan Records on Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube Music and more.     discuss this in the forum (1 post) |        bookmark/share with:               Interview homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review          1 comment       Odd Taxi: In the Woods   Apr 17, 00:00 1 comment                 anime    By cleverly reframing its narrative around a series of interviews with the supporting cast, Odd Taxi: In the Woods succeeds where most recap films fail: it's an artistically cohesive film in its own right. ― Odd Taxi was 2021's sleeper anime hit, telling an intricate, original mystery that kept viewers guessing every week.

How Composer MAYUKO Created Ranking of Kings' Fantasy-Infused Score   by Lynzee Loveridge, Apr 11th 2022          Writer, composer, arranger and singer, MAYUKO has been performing as a singer-songwriter since she was a student. As a composer, she created music for the drama The Full-Time Wife Escapist, the anime Cells at Work! and her latest soundtrack, available now from Milan Records, is all about capturing the magic of a fantasy world. We sat down with MAYUKO to discuss how she translated the characters and environment of Wit Studio's Ranking of Kings anime series to music.    What sorts of preparation did you do to get a sense of the 'sound' of Ranking of Kings?   I was playing Beethoven, Chopin, Mendelssohn, etc. to bring classical music into my life. It reminded me of my days as a music student.    Are there any key instruments you utilized for consistency throughout the series' score, or is it eclectic?   Since my goal was to build out a full orchestra rather than a specific instrument, I always kept an instrumental instruction book close by and would think about the best instrument that could produce the most appropriate sound in each arrangement. For example, I could really feel the potential of the horn in battle pieces – strong, fat and explosive sound, like in the song “Senritsu.”     What emotions were you hoping to inspire in the series' main theme?   I was told the main theme would be used mostly in teasers and trailers rather than the show itself, so I created it with a more comprehensive, birds-eye vision. The story is about to begin! The chorus of the song expresses the grandeur of the kingdom and the sopranino recorder expresses the Bojji's adventure.     Were there any specifications asked by the series' director or sound director or were you given free rein to experiment?   At my first meeting, I had a spreadsheet of music with over 70 songs and each song was explained in details. Some instruments were specified, but many were left to me. For instance, I decided to use the trombone for “Theme of Kage.”    What was the thought behind the use of a sopranino recorder for Bojji's theme?   I was asked to use a specific instrument for Bojji's theme, and there was a memo asking if that instrument should be a flute. I tried various things, but ultimately decided on a sopranino recorder, which can be both relaxing and cute as well as moderately powerful and strong. It's a great instrument with a wide range of tones.    Are there pieces of music that you feel closely embody specific characters? For example, Bosse, Despa, or Kage?   Bosse is a giant, so boom! I was conscious of using heavy percussion and a low pitch. It was actually easy to create because I only had to keep that in mind. From the beginning, I was given the instruction that Despa's sound should be “cheerful jazz,” and I was very excited to create it. I think it is one of the most unique songs on the soundtrack. Kage, meanwhile, is a survivor of an attack by a group of assassins, but he's not a bad guy, so the instrumentation had to express that middle ground. I thought, “well, maybe the trombone?” Ouken is clad in armor, so I thought the sound of metal = cathedral bells. And then Miranjo expresses some weirdness with the female chorus, triple-time and shimmering bells. Each character was expressed using various rules.     What's your process when you get 'stuck'?   Once you leave the work, you leave the work. When I take a short break and return a few hours later, I start again, and my calm self comes back to me, saying, “What was I so worried about?” When that calm self does not come back… I cry.    Is there a character you came to fond of by the show's end?   Hiling. I don't have such a cute tsundere mother. She can also use her healing ability and I think she is the strongest. I want her to be happy. I want her to listen to my problems when I'm in trouble. I also want to be friends with Despa.    Is there a particular memory of working on the series that will stick with you?   When I wrote the song, “Bojji to Kage no Yujyo,” I was very fond of it and actually wrote and sang lyrics to add to it. It's a song that says, “I will always be by your side.” The reason it was used in the final episode was because of my passion for the song. I couldn't be happier and am so glad I am singer-songwriter.    The full soundtrack for Ranking of Kings is available from Milan Records on Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube Music and more.     discuss this in the forum (1 post) |        bookmark/share with:               Interview homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review          1 comment       Odd Taxi: In the Woods   Apr 17, 00:00 1 comment                 anime    By cleverly reframing its narrative around a series of interviews with the supporting cast, Odd Taxi: In the Woods succeeds where most recap films fail: it's an artistically cohesive film in its own right. ― Odd Taxi was 2021's sleeper anime hit, telling an intricate, original mystery that kept viewers guessing every week.

How Composer MAYUKO Created Ranking of Kings' Fantasy-Infused Score   by Lynzee Loveridge, Apr 11th 2022          Writer, composer, arranger and singer, MAYUKO has been performing as a singer-songwriter since she was a student. As a composer, she created music for the drama The Full-Time Wife Escapist, the anime Cells at Work! and her latest soundtrack, available now from Milan Records, is all about capturing the magic of a fantasy world. We sat down with MAYUKO to discuss how she translated the characters and environment of Wit Studio's Ranking of Kings anime series to music.    What sorts of preparation did you do to get a sense of the 'sound' of Ranking of Kings?   I was playing Beethoven, Chopin, Mendelssohn, etc. to bring classical music into my life. It reminded me of my days as a music student.    Are there any key instruments you utilized for consistency throughout the series' score, or is it eclectic?   Since my goal was to build out a full orchestra rather than a specific instrument, I always kept an instrumental instruction book close by and would think about the best instrument that could produce the most appropriate sound in each arrangement. For example, I could really feel the potential of the horn in battle pieces – strong, fat and explosive sound, like in the song “Senritsu.”     What emotions were you hoping to inspire in the series' main theme?   I was told the main theme would be used mostly in teasers and trailers rather than the show itself, so I created it with a more comprehensive, birds-eye vision. The story is about to begin! The chorus of the song expresses the grandeur of the kingdom and the sopranino recorder expresses the Bojji's adventure.     Were there any specifications asked by the series' director or sound director or were you given free rein to experiment?   At my first meeting, I had a spreadsheet of music with over 70 songs and each song was explained in details. Some instruments were specified, but many were left to me. For instance, I decided to use the trombone for “Theme of Kage.”    What was the thought behind the use of a sopranino recorder for Bojji's theme?   I was asked to use a specific instrument for Bojji's theme, and there was a memo asking if that instrument should be a flute. I tried various things, but ultimately decided on a sopranino recorder, which can be both relaxing and cute as well as moderately powerful and strong. It's a great instrument with a wide range of tones.    Are there pieces of music that you feel closely embody specific characters? For example, Bosse, Despa, or Kage?   Bosse is a giant, so boom! I was conscious of using heavy percussion and a low pitch. It was actually easy to create because I only had to keep that in mind. From the beginning, I was given the instruction that Despa's sound should be “cheerful jazz,” and I was very excited to create it. I think it is one of the most unique songs on the soundtrack. Kage, meanwhile, is a survivor of an attack by a group of assassins, but he's not a bad guy, so the instrumentation had to express that middle ground. I thought, “well, maybe the trombone?” Ouken is clad in armor, so I thought the sound of metal = cathedral bells. And then Miranjo expresses some weirdness with the female chorus, triple-time and shimmering bells. Each character was expressed using various rules.     What's your process when you get 'stuck'?   Once you leave the work, you leave the work. When I take a short break and return a few hours later, I start again, and my calm self comes back to me, saying, “What was I so worried about?” When that calm self does not come back… I cry.    Is there a character you came to fond of by the show's end?   Hiling. I don't have such a cute tsundere mother. She can also use her healing ability and I think she is the strongest. I want her to be happy. I want her to listen to my problems when I'm in trouble. I also want to be friends with Despa.    Is there a particular memory of working on the series that will stick with you?   When I wrote the song, “Bojji to Kage no Yujyo,” I was very fond of it and actually wrote and sang lyrics to add to it. It's a song that says, “I will always be by your side.” The reason it was used in the final episode was because of my passion for the song. I couldn't be happier and am so glad I am singer-songwriter.    The full soundtrack for Ranking of Kings is available from Milan Records on Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube Music and more.     discuss this in the forum (1 post) |        bookmark/share with:               Interview homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review          1 comment       Odd Taxi: In the Woods   Apr 17, 00:00 1 comment                 anime    By cleverly reframing its narrative around a series of interviews with the supporting cast, Odd Taxi: In the Woods succeeds where most recap films fail: it's an artistically cohesive film in its own right. ― Odd Taxi was 2021's sleeper anime hit, telling an intricate, original mystery that kept viewers guessing every week.

Visit news.dexclub.com for all the latest news in Thai.                How Composer MAYUKO Created Ranking of Kings' Fantasy-Infused Score   by Lynzee Loveridge, Apr 11th 2022          Writer, composer, arranger and singer, MAYUKO has been performing as a singer-songwriter since she was a student. As a composer, she created music for the drama The Full-Time Wife Escapist, the anime Cells at Work! and her latest soundtrack, available now from Milan Records, is all about capturing the magic of a fantasy world. We sat down with MAYUKO to discuss how she translated the characters and environment of Wit Studio's Ranking of Kings anime series to music.    What sorts of preparation did you do to get a sense of the 'sound' of Ranking of Kings?   I was playing Beethoven, Chopin, Mendelssohn, etc. to bring classical music into my life. It reminded me of my days as a music student.    Are there any key instruments you utilized for consistency throughout the series' score, or is it eclectic?   Since my goal was to build out a full orchestra rather than a specific instrument, I always kept an instrumental instruction book close by and would think about the best instrument that could produce the most appropriate sound in each arrangement. For example, I could really feel the potential of the horn in battle pieces – strong, fat and explosive sound, like in the song “Senritsu.”     What emotions were you hoping to inspire in the series' main theme?   I was told the main theme would be used mostly in teasers and trailers rather than the show itself, so I created it with a more comprehensive, birds-eye vision. The story is about to begin! The chorus of the song expresses the grandeur of the kingdom and the sopranino recorder expresses the Bojji's adventure.     Were there any specifications asked by the series' director or sound director or were you given free rein to experiment?   At my first meeting, I had a spreadsheet of music with over 70 songs and each song was explained in details. Some instruments were specified, but many were left to me. For instance, I decided to use the trombone for “Theme of Kage.”    What was the thought behind the use of a sopranino recorder for Bojji's theme?   I was asked to use a specific instrument for Bojji's theme, and there was a memo asking if that instrument should be a flute. I tried various things, but ultimately decided on a sopranino recorder, which can be both relaxing and cute as well as moderately powerful and strong. It's a great instrument with a wide range of tones.    Are there pieces of music that you feel closely embody specific characters? For example, Bosse, Despa, or Kage?   Bosse is a giant, so boom! I was conscious of using heavy percussion and a low pitch. It was actually easy to create because I only had to keep that in mind. From the beginning, I was given the instruction that Despa's sound should be “cheerful jazz,” and I was very excited to create it. I think it is one of the most unique songs on the soundtrack. Kage, meanwhile, is a survivor of an attack by a group of assassins, but he's not a bad guy, so the instrumentation had to express that middle ground. I thought, “well, maybe the trombone?” Ouken is clad in armor, so I thought the sound of metal = cathedral bells. And then Miranjo expresses some weirdness with the female chorus, triple-time and shimmering bells. Each character was expressed using various rules.     What's your process when you get 'stuck'?   Once you leave the work, you leave the work. When I take a short break and return a few hours later, I start again, and my calm self comes back to me, saying, “What was I so worried about?” When that calm self does not come back… I cry.    Is there a character you came to fond of by the show's end?   Hiling. I don't have such a cute tsundere mother. She can also use her healing ability and I think she is the strongest. I want her to be happy. I want her to listen to my problems when I'm in trouble. I also want to be friends with Despa.    Is there a particular memory of working on the series that will stick with you?   When I wrote the song, “Bojji to Kage no Yujyo,” I was very fond of it and actually wrote and sang lyrics to add to it. It's a song that says, “I will always be by your side.” The reason it was used in the final episode was because of my passion for the song. I couldn't be happier and am so glad I am singer-songwriter.

When I take a short break and return a few hours later, I start again, and my calm self comes back to me, saying, “What was I so worried about?” When that calm self does not come back… I cry.    Is there a character you came to fond of by the show's end?   Hiling. I don't have such a cute tsundere mother. She can also use her healing ability and I think she is the strongest. I want her to be happy. I want her to listen to my problems when I'm in trouble. I also want to be friends with Despa.    Is there a particular memory of working on the series that will stick with you?   When I wrote the song, “Bojji to Kage no Yujyo,” I was very fond of it and actually wrote and sang lyrics to add to it. It's a song that says, “I will always be by your side.” The reason it was used in the final episode was because of my passion for the song.

As a composer, she created music for the drama The Full-Time Wife Escapist, the anime Cells at Work! and her latest soundtrack, available now from Milan Records, is all about capturing the magic of a fantasy world. We sat down with MAYUKO to discuss how she translated the characters and environment of Wit Studio's Ranking of Kings anime series to music.    What sorts of preparation did you do to get a sense of the 'sound' of Ranking of Kings?   I was playing Beethoven, Chopin, Mendelssohn, etc. to bring classical music into my life. It reminded me of my days as a music student.    Are there any key instruments you utilized for consistency throughout the series' score, or is it eclectic?   Since my goal was to build out a full orchestra rather than a specific instrument, I always kept an instrumental instruction book close by and would think about the best instrument that could produce the most appropriate sound in each arrangement. For example, I could really feel the potential of the horn in battle pieces – strong, fat and explosive sound, like in the song “Senritsu.”     What emotions were you hoping to inspire in the series' main theme?   I was told the main theme would be used mostly in teasers and trailers rather than the show itself, so I created it with a more comprehensive, birds-eye vision. The story is about to begin! The chorus of the song expresses the grandeur of the kingdom and the sopranino recorder expresses the Bojji's adventure.     Were there any specifications asked by the series' director or sound director or were you given free rein to experiment?   At my first meeting, I had a spreadsheet of music with over 70 songs and each song was explained in details. Some instruments were specified, but many were left to me. For instance, I decided to use the trombone for “Theme of Kage.”    What was the thought behind the use of a sopranino recorder for Bojji's theme?   I was asked to use a specific instrument for Bojji's theme, and there was a memo asking if that instrument should be a flute. I tried various things, but ultimately decided on a sopranino recorder, which can be both relaxing and cute as well as moderately powerful and strong. It's a great instrument with a wide range of tones.    Are there pieces of music that you feel closely embody specific characters? For example, Bosse, Despa, or Kage?   Bosse is a giant, so boom! I was conscious of using heavy percussion and a low pitch. It was actually easy to create because I only had to keep that in mind. From the beginning, I was given the instruction that Despa's sound should be “cheerful jazz,” and I was very excited to create it. I think it is one of the most unique songs on the soundtrack. Kage, meanwhile, is a survivor of an attack by a group of assassins, but he's not a bad guy, so the instrumentation had to express that middle ground. I thought, “well, maybe the trombone?” Ouken is clad in armor, so I thought the sound of metal = cathedral bells. And then Miranjo expresses some weirdness with the female chorus, triple-time and shimmering bells. Each character was expressed using various rules.     What's your process when you get 'stuck'?
