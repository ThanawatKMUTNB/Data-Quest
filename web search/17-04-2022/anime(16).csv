Interest Tokyo Ghoul's Sui Ishida Draws Marvel's Moon Knight   posted on 2022-04-16 00:45 UTC-8 by Kim Morrissy          Sui Ishida says Moon Knight might be his favorite Marvel superhero    Manga creator Sui Ishida (Tokyo Ghoul, Choujin X) drew a Tokyo Ghoul crossover image for the Marvel Studios live-action series Moon Knight. The tagline of the illustration translates to ""Clad in white madness,"" pointing to the shared themes between the two franchises.     Ishida commented that Moon Knight might be his favorite Marvel superhero, praising the show's fast-paced action, the gray morality in its violence, and the comical sadness of its protagonist. He highlighted the similarities between Moon Knight's Steven and Tokyo Ghoul's Ken Kaneki, saying that they both have a lot of knowledge in what they're interested in and have their own dreams, but feel hopeless.    The Moon Knight miniseries premiered on Disney+ on March 30, and will run until May 4. It tells the story of a mild-mannered gift shop employee who carries the split personality of a superhero.

Interest Tokyo Ghoul's Sui Ishida Draws Marvel's Moon Knight   posted on 2022-04-16 00:45 UTC-8 by Kim Morrissy          Sui Ishida says Moon Knight might be his favorite Marvel superhero    Manga creator Sui Ishida (Tokyo Ghoul, Choujin X) drew a Tokyo Ghoul crossover image for the Marvel Studios live-action series Moon Knight. The tagline of the illustration translates to ""Clad in white madness,"" pointing to the shared themes between the two franchises.     Ishida commented that Moon Knight might be his favorite Marvel superhero, praising the show's fast-paced action, the gray morality in its violence, and the comical sadness of its protagonist. He highlighted the similarities between Moon Knight's Steven and Tokyo Ghoul's Ken Kaneki, saying that they both have a lot of knowledge in what they're interested in and have their own dreams, but feel hopeless.    The Moon Knight miniseries premiered on Disney+ on March 30, and will run until May 4. It tells the story of a mild-mannered gift shop employee who carries the split personality of a superhero.

Interest Tokyo Ghoul's Sui Ishida Draws Marvel's Moon Knight   posted on 2022-04-16 00:45 UTC-8 by Kim Morrissy          Sui Ishida says Moon Knight might be his favorite Marvel superhero    Manga creator Sui Ishida (Tokyo Ghoul, Choujin X) drew a Tokyo Ghoul crossover image for the Marvel Studios live-action series Moon Knight. The tagline of the illustration translates to ""Clad in white madness,"" pointing to the shared themes between the two franchises.     Ishida commented that Moon Knight might be his favorite Marvel superhero, praising the show's fast-paced action, the gray morality in its violence, and the comical sadness of its protagonist. He highlighted the similarities between Moon Knight's Steven and Tokyo Ghoul's Ken Kaneki, saying that they both have a lot of knowledge in what they're interested in and have their own dreams, but feel hopeless.    The Moon Knight miniseries premiered on Disney+ on March 30, and will run until May 4. It tells the story of a mild-mannered gift shop employee who carries the split personality of a superhero.

News Chihayafuru Manga's End Delayed to Volume 50   posted on 2022-04-14 22:26 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         Final volume to include spinoff    Yuki Suetsugu's Chihayafuru manga will now end in its 50th compiled book volume, instead of in its 49th volume as originally planned. The manga needs the extra volume due to editorial circumstances such as the story's development. Kodansha will publish the manga's 50th and final volume this winter, and it will include a spinoff manga. Suetsugu illustrated a comic that explains this delay:     The manga's 49th volume will ship on July 13.    Suetsugu launched the manga in Kodansha's Be Love magazine in December 2007. Kodansha published the 48th volume on February 10. Kodansha Comics is releasing the manga digitally in English.    Amazon had listed the 47th volume of the manga as heading toward the story's climax in June 2021.    The manga inspired an anime, and the first 25-episode television anime season ran from October 2011 to March 2012. The second season, Chihayafuru 2, premiered in January 2013 and also ran for 25 episodes. The third season premiered in October 2019. The third season was slated to premiere in April 2019 on NTV's ""AnichU"" programming block, but was delayed to October 2019.  Crunchyroll Expo hosted a premiere screening for the anime in August 2019.    Crunchyroll has streamed the series as it aired in Japan. Sentai Filmworks released all three seasons with an English dub on home video. HIDIVE is also streaming the seasons with Japanese subtitles and an English dub.    Sentai Filmworks describes the story:  Chihaya Ayase is a beautiful and headstrong young woman with a passion for karuta, a card game inspired by classical Japanese poetry. As a child, Chihaya was introduced to the game by a quiet, gifted transfer student named Arata, and she was instantly drawn to it. Now in high school and reunited with her childhood friend Taichi, Chihaya dreams of finding Arata and the three resuming their love of karuta, only to discover that Arata has quit the game due to personal reasons. Determined not to let Arata's passion go to waste, Chihaya and Taichi form the Mizusawa High School Karuta Club, where they learn that in karuta - as in life - working toward your dreams is the key to winning, even when what you want seems just out of reach.  Suetsugu's manga has also inspired three live-action films. The first film, Chihayafuru: Kami no Ku (Chihayafuru: Upper Phrase), opened in Japan in March 2016. The second film, Chihayafuru: Shimo no Ku (Chihayafuru: Lower Phrase), opened in Japan in April 2016. The third film, Chihayafuru: Musubi, opened in Japan in March 2018. A five-episode live-action tie-in series, titled Chihayafuru -Tsunagu-, premiered on Hulu Japan in February 2018.

News Chihayafuru Manga's End Delayed to Volume 50   posted on 2022-04-14 22:26 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         Final volume to include spinoff    Yuki Suetsugu's Chihayafuru manga will now end in its 50th compiled book volume, instead of in its 49th volume as originally planned. The manga needs the extra volume due to editorial circumstances such as the story's development. Kodansha will publish the manga's 50th and final volume this winter, and it will include a spinoff manga. Suetsugu illustrated a comic that explains this delay:     The manga's 49th volume will ship on July 13.    Suetsugu launched the manga in Kodansha's Be Love magazine in December 2007. Kodansha published the 48th volume on February 10. Kodansha Comics is releasing the manga digitally in English.    Amazon had listed the 47th volume of the manga as heading toward the story's climax in June 2021.    The manga inspired an anime, and the first 25-episode television anime season ran from October 2011 to March 2012. The second season, Chihayafuru 2, premiered in January 2013 and also ran for 25 episodes. The third season premiered in October 2019. The third season was slated to premiere in April 2019 on NTV's ""AnichU"" programming block, but was delayed to October 2019.  Crunchyroll Expo hosted a premiere screening for the anime in August 2019.    Crunchyroll has streamed the series as it aired in Japan. Sentai Filmworks released all three seasons with an English dub on home video. HIDIVE is also streaming the seasons with Japanese subtitles and an English dub.    Sentai Filmworks describes the story:  Chihaya Ayase is a beautiful and headstrong young woman with a passion for karuta, a card game inspired by classical Japanese poetry. As a child, Chihaya was introduced to the game by a quiet, gifted transfer student named Arata, and she was instantly drawn to it. Now in high school and reunited with her childhood friend Taichi, Chihaya dreams of finding Arata and the three resuming their love of karuta, only to discover that Arata has quit the game due to personal reasons. Determined not to let Arata's passion go to waste, Chihaya and Taichi form the Mizusawa High School Karuta Club, where they learn that in karuta - as in life - working toward your dreams is the key to winning, even when what you want seems just out of reach.  Suetsugu's manga has also inspired three live-action films. The first film, Chihayafuru: Kami no Ku (Chihayafuru: Upper Phrase), opened in Japan in March 2016. The second film, Chihayafuru: Shimo no Ku (Chihayafuru: Lower Phrase), opened in Japan in April 2016. The third film, Chihayafuru: Musubi, opened in Japan in March 2018. A five-episode live-action tie-in series, titled Chihayafuru -Tsunagu-, premiered on Hulu Japan in February 2018.

Suetsugu illustrated a comic that explains this delay:     The manga's 49th volume will ship on July 13.    Suetsugu launched the manga in Kodansha's Be Love magazine in December 2007. Kodansha published the 48th volume on February 10. Kodansha Comics is releasing the manga digitally in English.    Amazon had listed the 47th volume of the manga as heading toward the story's climax in June 2021.    The manga inspired an anime, and the first 25-episode television anime season ran from October 2011 to March 2012. The second season, Chihayafuru 2, premiered in January 2013 and also ran for 25 episodes. The third season premiered in October 2019. The third season was slated to premiere in April 2019 on NTV's ""AnichU"" programming block, but was delayed to October 2019.  Crunchyroll Expo hosted a premiere screening for the anime in August 2019.    Crunchyroll has streamed the series as it aired in Japan. Sentai Filmworks released all three seasons with an English dub on home video. HIDIVE is also streaming the seasons with Japanese subtitles and an English dub.    Sentai Filmworks describes the story:  Chihaya Ayase is a beautiful and headstrong young woman with a passion for karuta, a card game inspired by classical Japanese poetry. As a child, Chihaya was introduced to the game by a quiet, gifted transfer student named Arata, and she was instantly drawn to it. Now in high school and reunited with her childhood friend Taichi, Chihaya dreams of finding Arata and the three resuming their love of karuta, only to discover that Arata has quit the game due to personal reasons. Determined not to let Arata's passion go to waste, Chihaya and Taichi form the Mizusawa High School Karuta Club, where they learn that in karuta - as in life - working toward your dreams is the key to winning, even when what you want seems just out of reach.  Suetsugu's manga has also inspired three live-action films. The first film, Chihayafuru: Kami no Ku (Chihayafuru: Upper Phrase), opened in Japan in March 2016. The second film, Chihayafuru: Shimo no Ku (Chihayafuru: Lower Phrase), opened in Japan in April 2016. The third film, Chihayafuru: Musubi, opened in Japan in March 2018. A five-episode live-action tie-in series, titled Chihayafuru -Tsunagu-, premiered on Hulu Japan in February 2018.

News Chihayafuru Manga's End Delayed to Volume 50   posted on 2022-04-14 22:26 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         Final volume to include spinoff    Yuki Suetsugu's Chihayafuru manga will now end in its 50th compiled book volume, instead of in its 49th volume as originally planned. The manga needs the extra volume due to editorial circumstances such as the story's development. Kodansha will publish the manga's 50th and final volume this winter, and it will include a spinoff manga. Suetsugu illustrated a comic that explains this delay:     The manga's 49th volume will ship on July 13.    Suetsugu launched the manga in Kodansha's Be Love magazine in December 2007. Kodansha published the 48th volume on February 10. Kodansha Comics is releasing the manga digitally in English.    Amazon had listed the 47th volume of the manga as heading toward the story's climax in June 2021.    The manga inspired an anime, and the first 25-episode television anime season ran from October 2011 to March 2012. The second season, Chihayafuru 2, premiered in January 2013 and also ran for 25 episodes. The third season premiered in October 2019. The third season was slated to premiere in April 2019 on NTV's ""AnichU"" programming block, but was delayed to October 2019.  Crunchyroll Expo hosted a premiere screening for the anime in August 2019.    Crunchyroll has streamed the series as it aired in Japan. Sentai Filmworks released all three seasons with an English dub on home video. HIDIVE is also streaming the seasons with Japanese subtitles and an English dub.    Sentai Filmworks describes the story:  Chihaya Ayase is a beautiful and headstrong young woman with a passion for karuta, a card game inspired by classical Japanese poetry. As a child, Chihaya was introduced to the game by a quiet, gifted transfer student named Arata, and she was instantly drawn to it. Now in high school and reunited with her childhood friend Taichi, Chihaya dreams of finding Arata and the three resuming their love of karuta, only to discover that Arata has quit the game due to personal reasons. Determined not to let Arata's passion go to waste, Chihaya and Taichi form the Mizusawa High School Karuta Club, where they learn that in karuta - as in life - working toward your dreams is the key to winning, even when what you want seems just out of reach.  Suetsugu's manga has also inspired three live-action films. The first film, Chihayafuru: Kami no Ku (Chihayafuru: Upper Phrase), opened in Japan in March 2016. The second film, Chihayafuru: Shimo no Ku (Chihayafuru: Lower Phrase), opened in Japan in April 2016. The third film, Chihayafuru: Musubi, opened in Japan in March 2018. A five-episode live-action tie-in series, titled Chihayafuru -Tsunagu-, premiered on Hulu Japan in February 2018.

The manga inspired an anime, and the first 25-episode television anime season ran from October 2011 to March 2012. The second season, Chihayafuru 2, premiered in January 2013 and also ran for 25 episodes. The third season premiered in October 2019. The third season was slated to premiere in April 2019 on NTV's ""AnichU"" programming block, but was delayed to October 2019.  Crunchyroll Expo hosted a premiere screening for the anime in August 2019.    Crunchyroll has streamed the series as it aired in Japan. Sentai Filmworks released all three seasons with an English dub on home video. HIDIVE is also streaming the seasons with Japanese subtitles and an English dub.    Sentai Filmworks describes the story:  Chihaya Ayase is a beautiful and headstrong young woman with a passion for karuta, a card game inspired by classical Japanese poetry. As a child, Chihaya was introduced to the game by a quiet, gifted transfer student named Arata, and she was instantly drawn to it. Now in high school and reunited with her childhood friend Taichi, Chihaya dreams of finding Arata and the three resuming their love of karuta, only to discover that Arata has quit the game due to personal reasons. Determined not to let Arata's passion go to waste, Chihaya and Taichi form the Mizusawa High School Karuta Club, where they learn that in karuta - as in life - working toward your dreams is the key to winning, even when what you want seems just out of reach.  Suetsugu's manga has also inspired three live-action films. The first film, Chihayafuru: Kami no Ku (Chihayafuru: Upper Phrase), opened in Japan in March 2016. The second film, Chihayafuru: Shimo no Ku (Chihayafuru: Lower Phrase), opened in Japan in April 2016. The third film, Chihayafuru: Musubi, opened in Japan in March 2018. A five-episode live-action tie-in series, titled Chihayafuru -Tsunagu-, premiered on Hulu Japan in February 2018.

The manga needs the extra volume due to editorial circumstances such as the story's development. Kodansha will publish the manga's 50th and final volume this winter, and it will include a spinoff manga. Suetsugu illustrated a comic that explains this delay:     The manga's 49th volume will ship on July 13.    Suetsugu launched the manga in Kodansha's Be Love magazine in December 2007.

Interview: How the Staff of She Professed Herself Pupil of the Wise Man Made An Old Man Cute   by Kim Morrissy, Apr 13th 2022          Among the genre of VRMMORPG novels, She Professed Herself Pupil of the Wise Man presents an interesting world shaped by the players in its past. The main character, Danblf, transforms into a young girl and journeys through a changed world set 30 years later. ANN spoke to the novel author Hirotsugu Ryusen, as well as director Keitaro Motonaga and screenwriter Takamitsu Kouno about how they brought the virtual world to life.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   (For author Hirotsugu Ryusen) The protagonist enters the game world only to realize that many years have passed within the game. What inspired this part of the story's premise?   RYUSEN: I like pure fantasy, but I also like it when modern technology has been arranged in a fantasy-like way. As I was thinking about how to create a setting where it wouldn't be strange for those elements to exist, I took inspiration from other novels I was reading at the time. I thought it would be neat to create a time skip and make the former players, who already possess modern knowledge, accomplish various feats ahead of time.    Also, because of the influence of those players, special modern words have spread throughout society in those 30 years. It gave me some looseness to play with words to an extent.     The novel explains the VRMMORPG setting in a lot of detail. What was your approach to creating the world?   RYUSEN: The foundation was built on the MMORPG I was engrossed in at the time. By referring to the knowledge and experiences I accumulated from that MMO, I was able to work out my ideal world for a game. I've also enjoyed creating worlds for a long time. I note down the details of a fictional game when I think of them, and when I combined them on this opportunity, this is what I got.     Are you the kind of writer who begins thinking about the world or the characters first?   RYUSEN: If I had to say, I suppose I start with the world… My ideal world. The people who live there. And the characters who stand out among them. I suppose that's how it goes.     What is the appeal of young girls who refer to themselves as ""washi""?   RYUSEN: I wonder, indeed… When I think about it, I never actually considered what was the appeal. I was just drawn to it hazily. I don't quite get it, but I like it. That can happen, right?    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   (For director Keitaro Motonaga)  Regarding the depiction of the VRMMORPG world, did you use any existing MMORPGs or other games as references?   MOTONAGA: I tried out a few titles my friend recommended to me and used them as references. For the things I referenced inside the game, I made sure not to make the resemblance too strong.     What sort of things did you keep in mind in order to depict Mira's cuteness?   MOTONAGA: I didn't want her to just be cute. Since she used to be Danblf, I kept Danblf's movements in mind, like how she carries herself when she stands. For example, she puts her hands on her hips or crosses her arms. Through those Danblf-like mannerisms, I tried to show Mira's cuteness.     How did you decide on the worldview of the anime? What kind of directions did you give to the art director?   MOTONAGA: That's a secret! (laughs) Anyway, I wanted the world to look beautiful, with a crisp and clean air. I asked him to be conscious of beautiful European streets and the World Heritage sites, and to capture the vibes around those places. That's all I asked for.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project    What inspired the montage at the end of episode 1?   MOTONAGA: I wanted to make Mira's signature line “I am cute” (said with an old man's first-person pronoun “washi”) stand out. I wondered if there was a way I could express it, and the montage was what I came up with.    That wasn't the only thing, of course. Like I mentioned before, I asked the art director to convey the vibes of beautiful European streets. By not having any spoken lines, we could show off the world and its atmosphere.    (For series composition writer Takamitsu Kouno) What was your first impression of the original work?   KOUNO: I thought it was wonderful. What makes it outstandingly original is that it's a game world where the existing skills, magic, towns, and kingdoms have all been shaped by the hands of players. I also think it's great how the story is based around the actions of the protagonist Danblf/Mira.     What did you keep in mind this time when writing the script?   KOUNO: The protagonist Mira is a beautiful and lovely girl. However, she was originally the dignified wise sage Danblf. And behind that is a player acting out a role. What was the best way to depict this amusing, peculiar, complicated, and mysterious figure? That was the first thing I turned my attention to. Specifically, I took care not to make Mira exhibit “girlish” mannerisms, words, or actions.    When the player is presenting himself as the wise sage Danblf, he is taking care to roleplay in a dignified manner. That doesn't change even when he turns into Mira. That's why the biggest thing I kept in mind when writing the script was how to act out Mira.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   How did you balance the amount of information in the novel with the action? The series also has a lot of characters, so what did you keep in mind to make each of them stand out in the anime?   KOUNO: The amount of material you can cover in 12 anime episodes that are 20 minutes long is limited, no matter how you slice it. Because of this, we consulted with the original creator's side at the script meetings in order to decide on the most absolutely essential information and scenes to prioritize. In order to ensure that the numerous guest characters have impact in the anime, we took care to depict not just their dialogue but also to give them action that leaves an impression.     Which characters did you particularly enjoy writing the lines for?   KOUNO: I especially enjoyed writing Mira and Solomon's interactions. Before Mira became known as one of the nine sages or Solomon established the kingdom of Arkite, they were both friendly in the real world. That makes their conversations very amusing. Even though they're in the dreadful situation of being stuck in a game world, I think the fact that Mira, Solomon, and the others can smile through it all is rooted in how they've stuck together through thick and thin. Through their conversations, I depicted them as not just game friends, but as real-life friends.

Interview: How the Staff of She Professed Herself Pupil of the Wise Man Made An Old Man Cute   by Kim Morrissy, Apr 13th 2022          Among the genre of VRMMORPG novels, She Professed Herself Pupil of the Wise Man presents an interesting world shaped by the players in its past. The main character, Danblf, transforms into a young girl and journeys through a changed world set 30 years later. ANN spoke to the novel author Hirotsugu Ryusen, as well as director Keitaro Motonaga and screenwriter Takamitsu Kouno about how they brought the virtual world to life.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   (For author Hirotsugu Ryusen) The protagonist enters the game world only to realize that many years have passed within the game. What inspired this part of the story's premise?   RYUSEN: I like pure fantasy, but I also like it when modern technology has been arranged in a fantasy-like way. As I was thinking about how to create a setting where it wouldn't be strange for those elements to exist, I took inspiration from other novels I was reading at the time. I thought it would be neat to create a time skip and make the former players, who already possess modern knowledge, accomplish various feats ahead of time.    Also, because of the influence of those players, special modern words have spread throughout society in those 30 years. It gave me some looseness to play with words to an extent.     The novel explains the VRMMORPG setting in a lot of detail. What was your approach to creating the world?   RYUSEN: The foundation was built on the MMORPG I was engrossed in at the time. By referring to the knowledge and experiences I accumulated from that MMO, I was able to work out my ideal world for a game. I've also enjoyed creating worlds for a long time. I note down the details of a fictional game when I think of them, and when I combined them on this opportunity, this is what I got.     Are you the kind of writer who begins thinking about the world or the characters first?   RYUSEN: If I had to say, I suppose I start with the world… My ideal world. The people who live there. And the characters who stand out among them. I suppose that's how it goes.     What is the appeal of young girls who refer to themselves as ""washi""?   RYUSEN: I wonder, indeed… When I think about it, I never actually considered what was the appeal. I was just drawn to it hazily. I don't quite get it, but I like it. That can happen, right?    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   (For director Keitaro Motonaga)  Regarding the depiction of the VRMMORPG world, did you use any existing MMORPGs or other games as references?   MOTONAGA: I tried out a few titles my friend recommended to me and used them as references. For the things I referenced inside the game, I made sure not to make the resemblance too strong.     What sort of things did you keep in mind in order to depict Mira's cuteness?   MOTONAGA: I didn't want her to just be cute. Since she used to be Danblf, I kept Danblf's movements in mind, like how she carries herself when she stands. For example, she puts her hands on her hips or crosses her arms. Through those Danblf-like mannerisms, I tried to show Mira's cuteness.     How did you decide on the worldview of the anime? What kind of directions did you give to the art director?   MOTONAGA: That's a secret! (laughs) Anyway, I wanted the world to look beautiful, with a crisp and clean air. I asked him to be conscious of beautiful European streets and the World Heritage sites, and to capture the vibes around those places. That's all I asked for.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project    What inspired the montage at the end of episode 1?   MOTONAGA: I wanted to make Mira's signature line “I am cute” (said with an old man's first-person pronoun “washi”) stand out. I wondered if there was a way I could express it, and the montage was what I came up with.    That wasn't the only thing, of course. Like I mentioned before, I asked the art director to convey the vibes of beautiful European streets. By not having any spoken lines, we could show off the world and its atmosphere.    (For series composition writer Takamitsu Kouno) What was your first impression of the original work?   KOUNO: I thought it was wonderful. What makes it outstandingly original is that it's a game world where the existing skills, magic, towns, and kingdoms have all been shaped by the hands of players. I also think it's great how the story is based around the actions of the protagonist Danblf/Mira.     What did you keep in mind this time when writing the script?   KOUNO: The protagonist Mira is a beautiful and lovely girl. However, she was originally the dignified wise sage Danblf. And behind that is a player acting out a role. What was the best way to depict this amusing, peculiar, complicated, and mysterious figure? That was the first thing I turned my attention to. Specifically, I took care not to make Mira exhibit “girlish” mannerisms, words, or actions.    When the player is presenting himself as the wise sage Danblf, he is taking care to roleplay in a dignified manner. That doesn't change even when he turns into Mira. That's why the biggest thing I kept in mind when writing the script was how to act out Mira.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   How did you balance the amount of information in the novel with the action? The series also has a lot of characters, so what did you keep in mind to make each of them stand out in the anime?   KOUNO: The amount of material you can cover in 12 anime episodes that are 20 minutes long is limited, no matter how you slice it. Because of this, we consulted with the original creator's side at the script meetings in order to decide on the most absolutely essential information and scenes to prioritize. In order to ensure that the numerous guest characters have impact in the anime, we took care to depict not just their dialogue but also to give them action that leaves an impression.     Which characters did you particularly enjoy writing the lines for?   KOUNO: I especially enjoyed writing Mira and Solomon's interactions. Before Mira became known as one of the nine sages or Solomon established the kingdom of Arkite, they were both friendly in the real world. That makes their conversations very amusing. Even though they're in the dreadful situation of being stuck in a game world, I think the fact that Mira, Solomon, and the others can smile through it all is rooted in how they've stuck together through thick and thin. Through their conversations, I depicted them as not just game friends, but as real-life friends.

Interview: How the Staff of She Professed Herself Pupil of the Wise Man Made An Old Man Cute   by Kim Morrissy, Apr 13th 2022          Among the genre of VRMMORPG novels, She Professed Herself Pupil of the Wise Man presents an interesting world shaped by the players in its past. The main character, Danblf, transforms into a young girl and journeys through a changed world set 30 years later. ANN spoke to the novel author Hirotsugu Ryusen, as well as director Keitaro Motonaga and screenwriter Takamitsu Kouno about how they brought the virtual world to life.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   (For author Hirotsugu Ryusen) The protagonist enters the game world only to realize that many years have passed within the game. What inspired this part of the story's premise?   RYUSEN: I like pure fantasy, but I also like it when modern technology has been arranged in a fantasy-like way. As I was thinking about how to create a setting where it wouldn't be strange for those elements to exist, I took inspiration from other novels I was reading at the time. I thought it would be neat to create a time skip and make the former players, who already possess modern knowledge, accomplish various feats ahead of time.    Also, because of the influence of those players, special modern words have spread throughout society in those 30 years. It gave me some looseness to play with words to an extent.     The novel explains the VRMMORPG setting in a lot of detail. What was your approach to creating the world?   RYUSEN: The foundation was built on the MMORPG I was engrossed in at the time. By referring to the knowledge and experiences I accumulated from that MMO, I was able to work out my ideal world for a game. I've also enjoyed creating worlds for a long time. I note down the details of a fictional game when I think of them, and when I combined them on this opportunity, this is what I got.     Are you the kind of writer who begins thinking about the world or the characters first?   RYUSEN: If I had to say, I suppose I start with the world… My ideal world. The people who live there. And the characters who stand out among them. I suppose that's how it goes.     What is the appeal of young girls who refer to themselves as ""washi""?   RYUSEN: I wonder, indeed… When I think about it, I never actually considered what was the appeal. I was just drawn to it hazily. I don't quite get it, but I like it. That can happen, right?    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   (For director Keitaro Motonaga)  Regarding the depiction of the VRMMORPG world, did you use any existing MMORPGs or other games as references?   MOTONAGA: I tried out a few titles my friend recommended to me and used them as references. For the things I referenced inside the game, I made sure not to make the resemblance too strong.     What sort of things did you keep in mind in order to depict Mira's cuteness?   MOTONAGA: I didn't want her to just be cute. Since she used to be Danblf, I kept Danblf's movements in mind, like how she carries herself when she stands. For example, she puts her hands on her hips or crosses her arms. Through those Danblf-like mannerisms, I tried to show Mira's cuteness.     How did you decide on the worldview of the anime? What kind of directions did you give to the art director?   MOTONAGA: That's a secret! (laughs) Anyway, I wanted the world to look beautiful, with a crisp and clean air. I asked him to be conscious of beautiful European streets and the World Heritage sites, and to capture the vibes around those places. That's all I asked for.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project    What inspired the montage at the end of episode 1?   MOTONAGA: I wanted to make Mira's signature line “I am cute” (said with an old man's first-person pronoun “washi”) stand out. I wondered if there was a way I could express it, and the montage was what I came up with.    That wasn't the only thing, of course. Like I mentioned before, I asked the art director to convey the vibes of beautiful European streets. By not having any spoken lines, we could show off the world and its atmosphere.    (For series composition writer Takamitsu Kouno) What was your first impression of the original work?   KOUNO: I thought it was wonderful. What makes it outstandingly original is that it's a game world where the existing skills, magic, towns, and kingdoms have all been shaped by the hands of players. I also think it's great how the story is based around the actions of the protagonist Danblf/Mira.     What did you keep in mind this time when writing the script?   KOUNO: The protagonist Mira is a beautiful and lovely girl. However, she was originally the dignified wise sage Danblf. And behind that is a player acting out a role. What was the best way to depict this amusing, peculiar, complicated, and mysterious figure? That was the first thing I turned my attention to. Specifically, I took care not to make Mira exhibit “girlish” mannerisms, words, or actions.    When the player is presenting himself as the wise sage Danblf, he is taking care to roleplay in a dignified manner. That doesn't change even when he turns into Mira. That's why the biggest thing I kept in mind when writing the script was how to act out Mira.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   How did you balance the amount of information in the novel with the action? The series also has a lot of characters, so what did you keep in mind to make each of them stand out in the anime?   KOUNO: The amount of material you can cover in 12 anime episodes that are 20 minutes long is limited, no matter how you slice it. Because of this, we consulted with the original creator's side at the script meetings in order to decide on the most absolutely essential information and scenes to prioritize. In order to ensure that the numerous guest characters have impact in the anime, we took care to depict not just their dialogue but also to give them action that leaves an impression.     Which characters did you particularly enjoy writing the lines for?   KOUNO: I especially enjoyed writing Mira and Solomon's interactions. Before Mira became known as one of the nine sages or Solomon established the kingdom of Arkite, they were both friendly in the real world. That makes their conversations very amusing. Even though they're in the dreadful situation of being stuck in a game world, I think the fact that Mira, Solomon, and the others can smile through it all is rooted in how they've stuck together through thick and thin. Through their conversations, I depicted them as not just game friends, but as real-life friends.

What inspired this part of the story's premise?   RYUSEN: I like pure fantasy, but I also like it when modern technology has been arranged in a fantasy-like way. As I was thinking about how to create a setting where it wouldn't be strange for those elements to exist, I took inspiration from other novels I was reading at the time. I thought it would be neat to create a time skip and make the former players, who already possess modern knowledge, accomplish various feats ahead of time.    Also, because of the influence of those players, special modern words have spread throughout society in those 30 years. It gave me some looseness to play with words to an extent.     The novel explains the VRMMORPG setting in a lot of detail. What was your approach to creating the world?   RYUSEN: The foundation was built on the MMORPG I was engrossed in at the time. By referring to the knowledge and experiences I accumulated from that MMO, I was able to work out my ideal world for a game. I've also enjoyed creating worlds for a long time. I note down the details of a fictional game when I think of them, and when I combined them on this opportunity, this is what I got.     Are you the kind of writer who begins thinking about the world or the characters first?   RYUSEN: If I had to say, I suppose I start with the world… My ideal world. The people who live there. And the characters who stand out among them. I suppose that's how it goes.     What is the appeal of young girls who refer to themselves as ""washi""?   RYUSEN: I wonder, indeed… When I think about it, I never actually considered what was the appeal. I was just drawn to it hazily. I don't quite get it, but I like it. That can happen, right?    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   (For director Keitaro Motonaga)  Regarding the depiction of the VRMMORPG world, did you use any existing MMORPGs or other games as references?   MOTONAGA: I tried out a few titles my friend recommended to me and used them as references. For the things I referenced inside the game, I made sure not to make the resemblance too strong.     What sort of things did you keep in mind in order to depict Mira's cuteness?   MOTONAGA: I didn't want her to just be cute. Since she used to be Danblf, I kept Danblf's movements in mind, like how she carries herself when she stands. For example, she puts her hands on her hips or crosses her arms. Through those Danblf-like mannerisms, I tried to show Mira's cuteness.     How did you decide on the worldview of the anime? What kind of directions did you give to the art director?   MOTONAGA: That's a secret! (laughs) Anyway, I wanted the world to look beautiful, with a crisp and clean air. I asked him to be conscious of beautiful European streets and the World Heritage sites, and to capture the vibes around those places. That's all I asked for.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project    What inspired the montage at the end of episode 1?   MOTONAGA: I wanted to make Mira's signature line “I am cute” (said with an old man's first-person pronoun “washi”) stand out. I wondered if there was a way I could express it, and the montage was what I came up with.    That wasn't the only thing, of course. Like I mentioned before, I asked the art director to convey the vibes of beautiful European streets. By not having any spoken lines, we could show off the world and its atmosphere.    (For series composition writer Takamitsu Kouno) What was your first impression of the original work?   KOUNO: I thought it was wonderful. What makes it outstandingly original is that it's a game world where the existing skills, magic, towns, and kingdoms have all been shaped by the hands of players. I also think it's great how the story is based around the actions of the protagonist Danblf/Mira.     What did you keep in mind this time when writing the script?   KOUNO: The protagonist Mira is a beautiful and lovely girl. However, she was originally the dignified wise sage Danblf. And behind that is a player acting out a role. What was the best way to depict this amusing, peculiar, complicated, and mysterious figure? That was the first thing I turned my attention to. Specifically, I took care not to make Mira exhibit “girlish” mannerisms, words, or actions.    When the player is presenting himself as the wise sage Danblf, he is taking care to roleplay in a dignified manner. That doesn't change even when he turns into Mira. That's why the biggest thing I kept in mind when writing the script was how to act out Mira.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   How did you balance the amount of information in the novel with the action? The series also has a lot of characters, so what did you keep in mind to make each of them stand out in the anime?   KOUNO: The amount of material you can cover in 12 anime episodes that are 20 minutes long is limited, no matter how you slice it. Because of this, we consulted with the original creator's side at the script meetings in order to decide on the most absolutely essential information and scenes to prioritize. In order to ensure that the numerous guest characters have impact in the anime, we took care to depict not just their dialogue but also to give them action that leaves an impression.     Which characters did you particularly enjoy writing the lines for?   KOUNO: I especially enjoyed writing Mira and Solomon's interactions. Before Mira became known as one of the nine sages or Solomon established the kingdom of Arkite, they were both friendly in the real world. That makes their conversations very amusing. Even though they're in the dreadful situation of being stuck in a game world, I think the fact that Mira, Solomon, and the others can smile through it all is rooted in how they've stuck together through thick and thin. Through their conversations, I depicted them as not just game friends, but as real-life friends.

MOTONAGA: That's a secret! (laughs) Anyway, I wanted the world to look beautiful, with a crisp and clean air. I asked him to be conscious of beautiful European streets and the World Heritage sites, and to capture the vibes around those places. That's all I asked for.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project    What inspired the montage at the end of episode 1?   MOTONAGA: I wanted to make Mira's signature line “I am cute” (said with an old man's first-person pronoun “washi”) stand out. I wondered if there was a way I could express it, and the montage was what I came up with.    That wasn't the only thing, of course. Like I mentioned before, I asked the art director to convey the vibes of beautiful European streets. By not having any spoken lines, we could show off the world and its atmosphere.    (For series composition writer Takamitsu Kouno) What was your first impression of the original work?   KOUNO: I thought it was wonderful. What makes it outstandingly original is that it's a game world where the existing skills, magic, towns, and kingdoms have all been shaped by the hands of players. I also think it's great how the story is based around the actions of the protagonist Danblf/Mira.     What did you keep in mind this time when writing the script?   KOUNO: The protagonist Mira is a beautiful and lovely girl. However, she was originally the dignified wise sage Danblf. And behind that is a player acting out a role. What was the best way to depict this amusing, peculiar, complicated, and mysterious figure? That was the first thing I turned my attention to. Specifically, I took care not to make Mira exhibit “girlish” mannerisms, words, or actions.    When the player is presenting himself as the wise sage Danblf, he is taking care to roleplay in a dignified manner. That doesn't change even when he turns into Mira. That's why the biggest thing I kept in mind when writing the script was how to act out Mira.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   How did you balance the amount of information in the novel with the action? The series also has a lot of characters, so what did you keep in mind to make each of them stand out in the anime?   KOUNO: The amount of material you can cover in 12 anime episodes that are 20 minutes long is limited, no matter how you slice it. Because of this, we consulted with the original creator's side at the script meetings in order to decide on the most absolutely essential information and scenes to prioritize. In order to ensure that the numerous guest characters have impact in the anime, we took care to depict not just their dialogue but also to give them action that leaves an impression.     Which characters did you particularly enjoy writing the lines for?   KOUNO: I especially enjoyed writing Mira and Solomon's interactions. Before Mira became known as one of the nine sages or Solomon established the kingdom of Arkite, they were both friendly in the real world. That makes their conversations very amusing. Even though they're in the dreadful situation of being stuck in a game world, I think the fact that Mira, Solomon, and the others can smile through it all is rooted in how they've stuck together through thick and thin. Through their conversations, I depicted them as not just game friends, but as real-life friends.

The main character, Danblf, transforms into a young girl and journeys through a changed world set 30 years later. ANN spoke to the novel author Hirotsugu Ryusen, as well as director Keitaro Motonaga and screenwriter Takamitsu Kouno about how they brought the virtual world to life.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   (For author Hirotsugu Ryusen) The protagonist enters the game world only to realize that many years have passed within the game. What inspired this part of the story's premise?   RYUSEN: I like pure fantasy, but I also like it when modern technology has been arranged in a fantasy-like way. As I was thinking about how to create a setting where it wouldn't be strange for those elements to exist, I took inspiration from other novels I was reading at the time. I thought it would be neat to create a time skip and make the former players, who already possess modern knowledge, accomplish various feats ahead of time.    Also, because of the influence of those players, special modern words have spread throughout society in those 30 years. It gave me some looseness to play with words to an extent.     The novel explains the VRMMORPG setting in a lot of detail. What was your approach to creating the world?   RYUSEN: The foundation was built on the MMORPG I was engrossed in at the time. By referring to the knowledge and experiences I accumulated from that MMO, I was able to work out my ideal world for a game. I've also enjoyed creating worlds for a long time. I note down the details of a fictional game when I think of them, and when I combined them on this opportunity, this is what I got.     Are you the kind of writer who begins thinking about the world or the characters first?   RYUSEN: If I had to say, I suppose I start with the world… My ideal world. The people who live there. And the characters who stand out among them. I suppose that's how it goes.     What is the appeal of young girls who refer to themselves as ""washi""?   RYUSEN: I wonder, indeed… When I think about it, I never actually considered what was the appeal. I was just drawn to it hazily. I don't quite get it, but I like it. That can happen, right?    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   (For director Keitaro Motonaga)  Regarding the depiction of the VRMMORPG world, did you use any existing MMORPGs or other games as references?   MOTONAGA: I tried out a few titles my friend recommended to me and used them as references. For the things I referenced inside the game, I made sure not to make the resemblance too strong.     What sort of things did you keep in mind in order to depict Mira's cuteness?   MOTONAGA: I didn't want her to just be cute.

That's all I asked for.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project    What inspired the montage at the end of episode 1?   MOTONAGA: I wanted to make Mira's signature line “I am cute” (said with an old man's first-person pronoun “washi”) stand out. I wondered if there was a way I could express it, and the montage was what I came up with.    That wasn't the only thing, of course. Like I mentioned before, I asked the art director to convey the vibes of beautiful European streets. By not having any spoken lines, we could show off the world and its atmosphere.    (For series composition writer Takamitsu Kouno) What was your first impression of the original work?   KOUNO: I thought it was wonderful. What makes it outstandingly original is that it's a game world where the existing skills, magic, towns, and kingdoms have all been shaped by the hands of players. I also think it's great how the story is based around the actions of the protagonist Danblf/Mira.     What did you keep in mind this time when writing the script?   KOUNO: The protagonist Mira is a beautiful and lovely girl. However, she was originally the dignified wise sage Danblf. And behind that is a player acting out a role. What was the best way to depict this amusing, peculiar, complicated, and mysterious figure? That was the first thing I turned my attention to. Specifically, I took care not to make Mira exhibit “girlish” mannerisms, words, or actions.    When the player is presenting himself as the wise sage Danblf, he is taking care to roleplay in a dignified manner. That doesn't change even when he turns into Mira. That's why the biggest thing I kept in mind when writing the script was how to act out Mira.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   How did you balance the amount of information in the novel with the action? The series also has a lot of characters, so what did you keep in mind to make each of them stand out in the anime?   KOUNO: The amount of material you can cover in 12 anime episodes that are 20 minutes long is limited, no matter how you slice it. Because of this, we consulted with the original creator's side at the script meetings in order to decide on the most absolutely essential information and scenes to prioritize. In order to ensure that the numerous guest characters have impact in the anime, we took care to depict not just their dialogue but also to give them action that leaves an impression.     Which characters did you particularly enjoy writing the lines for?   KOUNO: I especially enjoyed writing Mira and Solomon's interactions. Before Mira became known as one of the nine sages or Solomon established the kingdom of Arkite, they were both friendly in the real world. That makes their conversations very amusing. Even though they're in the dreadful situation of being stuck in a game world, I think the fact that Mira, Solomon, and the others can smile through it all is rooted in how they've stuck together through thick and thin. Through their conversations, I depicted them as not just game friends, but as real-life friends.

The main character, Danblf, transforms into a young girl and journeys through a changed world set 30 years later. ANN spoke to the novel author Hirotsugu Ryusen, as well as director Keitaro Motonaga and screenwriter Takamitsu Kouno about how they brought the virtual world to life.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   (For author Hirotsugu Ryusen) The protagonist enters the game world only to realize that many years have passed within the game. What inspired this part of the story's premise?   RYUSEN: I like pure fantasy, but I also like it when modern technology has been arranged in a fantasy-like way. As I was thinking about how to create a setting where it wouldn't be strange for those elements to exist, I took inspiration from other novels I was reading at the time. I thought it would be neat to create a time skip and make the former players, who already possess modern knowledge, accomplish various feats ahead of time.    Also, because of the influence of those players, special modern words have spread throughout society in those 30 years. It gave me some looseness to play with words to an extent.     The novel explains the VRMMORPG setting in a lot of detail. What was your approach to creating the world?   RYUSEN: The foundation was built on the MMORPG I was engrossed in at the time. By referring to the knowledge and experiences I accumulated from that MMO, I was able to work out my ideal world for a game. I've also enjoyed creating worlds for a long time. I note down the details of a fictional game when I think of them, and when I combined them on this opportunity, this is what I got.     Are you the kind of writer who begins thinking about the world or the characters first?   RYUSEN: If I had to say, I suppose I start with the world… My ideal world. The people who live there. And the characters who stand out among them. I suppose that's how it goes.     What is the appeal of young girls who refer to themselves as ""washi""?   RYUSEN: I wonder, indeed… When I think about it, I never actually considered what was the appeal. I was just drawn to it hazily. I don't quite get it, but I like it. That can happen, right?    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   (For director Keitaro Motonaga)  Regarding the depiction of the VRMMORPG world, did you use any existing MMORPGs or other games as references?   MOTONAGA: I tried out a few titles my friend recommended to me and used them as references. For the things I referenced inside the game, I made sure not to make the resemblance too strong.     What sort of things did you keep in mind in order to depict Mira's cuteness?   MOTONAGA: I didn't want her to just be cute. Since she used to be Danblf, I kept Danblf's movements in mind, like how she carries herself when she stands. For example, she puts her hands on her hips or crosses her arms. Through those Danblf-like mannerisms, I tried to show Mira's cuteness.     How did you decide on the worldview of the anime? What kind of directions did you give to the art director?   MOTONAGA: That's a secret! (laughs) Anyway, I wanted the world to look beautiful, with a crisp and clean air.
