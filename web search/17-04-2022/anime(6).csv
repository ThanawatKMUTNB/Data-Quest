The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Rising of The Shield Hero Season 2   Apr  7th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Rising of The Shield Hero Season 2 ?                     Community score: 3.9              What is this?   No sooner has Naofumi settled into his role as the new ruler of Raphtalia's village, that they're beset by an attack from a horde of bat monsters! The timer for the Waves is mysteriously stalled, and a meeting with the other Cardinal Heroes and the Queen reveals the rising of a new threat: The 'Spirit Tortoise' is bringing potential ruin with it, and with the other Heroes opting out of doing anything about it, things naturally fall to Naofumi to take care of things. With new ally (and new slave) Rishia in tow, the Shield Hero's party heads for the Spirit Tortoise Kingdom in order to save the world once again.    The Rising of The Shield Hero Season 2 is based on Aneko Yusagi's novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Wednesdays.      How was the first episode?  Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               When last we left off, Naofumi and the others were struggling with the revelation that they were involved in a battle between worlds rather than a simple monster invasion. However, all this is put to the side as a new threat arises, the Spirit Tortoise, whose arrival mysteriously puts a stop to the Waves for the time being.    When it comes down to it, this episode is really only concerned with one thing: exposition. Though we do get two quick action scenes, the thrust of the episode is about establishing the status quo for the arc—i.e., the threat of the turtle—while reminding us of important plot points from the previous season.    Luckily, this is done largely through character building. We see that Naofumi is far from the aggrieved man he was for much of the first season. Becoming the lord of Raphtalia's hometown has tied him irrevocably to the kingdom. While the other heroes still see the fantasy world as a game, to Naofumi it has become his true life filled with things he is driven to protect.    We also spend a lot of time developing Rishia, the newest member of Naofumi's party. She's a young woman in turmoil—in love with a man who has rejected her even though she is dying to be useful to him. But in her, there is potential, though Naofumi and his friends are unsure how to bring it out and what form it will ultimately take. She is an inherently tragic character but through Naofumi's party, it looks like she will be able to become the person she was meant to be. If nothing else, her earnestness makes her easy to root for.    All in all, while this is one of the weaker episodes, it does its job setting up the next arc well enough and gives us some solid character development to boot. Hopefully, things will pick up a bit next episode.      How was the first episode?  Christopher Farris  Rating:               There's the possibility that kicking off a second season of The Rising of the Shield Hero could be a boon for the series. There's a clean break to all the consternation and baggage that fueled the original outing: most of the foundation built on Naofumi's persecution  has cleared up. However, not content with just the one demihuman slave, he now gets to be the ruler of a whole village of demihumans. The world is still besieged by regular monster attacks, which is also now subject to hero-assassination attempts from other worlds. So of course, some new issue inevitably gets foisted into the plot for Naofumi and crew.    There's definitely the sense of a plot-necessity swerve in the development of this premiere episode. The driving force of the entire story of the first season, the Waves, quite literally gets put on pause so the Queen can impart the new issue of a 'Spirit Tortoise' that we haven't heard of before but we're assured is every bit as much a major disaster. It certainly means the episode gets going quickly; we hardly have any time for the sort of reestablishing elements with Naofumi in the demihuman village before suddenly they're beset by random bat monsters brought by the ascension of the evil Turtle Pope. But it also means that parts of the story get back to too-perfunctory Business As Usual for Shield Hero. The other Cardinal Heroes, apparently having learned nothing from the climax of the previous adventure, are still acting like callous jerks to Naofumi and friends, and shrugging off needing to actually do anything about the Spirit Tortoise under the auspices that it's not their job.    So even though Naofumi has more predisposition to help with the situation, the storytelling still oddly proceeds with that sense of begrudgement we're just supposed to expect around him in this story. It's almost unintentionally hilarious, the way both the Queen and later Fitoria act like they need to convince Naofumi to take care of the Spirit Tortoise under duress, despite him immediately agreeing to do so. I know that this sort of disagreeable tone is part-and-parcel to the darker, nihilistic angle of appeal Shield Hero is trying to present in its fantasy world, but it just comes off needlessly enforced when its main character character has no reason to act like the world's against him anymore .    That said, the slack of the struggle in Shield-land is instead picked up in this premiere by Rishia, who ends up with what could be considered the emotional core of this episode. Her persecution by her former party with the Bow Hero definitely reflects Naofumi's own story, to where you can almost hear the author going ""See, I can write a woman who gets put upon and mistreated for unfair reasons too! It's equality!"" Of course the major difference is that when Naofumi was at his lowest point, he was forced to buy a slave, while as Rishia finds herself struggling she is convinced to become a slave and aaaaaawwwwww Christ.    Look, I don't need to get into the weeds on this, we had half a year of slavery discourse with the first Shield Hero season. But it must be said that it comes off as downright undermining that the show ever portrayed the slave trade as this dark, seedy element its hero could turn to out of desperation, when at this point it's mostly just an odd mechanic characters can submit themselves to for in-story power-up convenience and lip service to a fetish that isn't even portrayed half as entertainingly as in other series like How NOT to Summon a Demon Lord. That is to say, Rishia agreeing to become Naofumi's slave for a time doesn't prompt aghast reactions of offense, it simply comes off as eyeroll-worthy.    Regardless, Shield Hero's second season has at least started with plenty of momentum to it, even if some of the new story elements come off like ham-fisted hard-turns. But this is a show that worked better the more it expanded its world-building anyway, so maybe figuring out what the deal with this Spirit Tortoise actually is or seeing how Rishia's development along the way plays out will be to its benefit. The fights we get in this episode featuring our heroes slaughtering their way through Countries both Bat and Donkey Kong are decent, concentrated bursts of action (there's a little bit of shaky CGI, but you know I always love seeing Filo fight in her big, puffy, bird form), and you know Kevin Penkin's score is still pulling its weight. It's the beginning of a second season that seems to be justifying its existence, with all the caveats from however you felt about the original's existence in the first place.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review                Odd Taxi: In the Woods   Apr 17, 00:00                 anime    By cleverly reframing its narrative around a series of interviews with the supporting cast, Odd Taxi: In the Woods succeeds where most recap films fail: it's an artistically cohesive film in its own right. ― Odd Taxi was 2021's sleeper anime hit, telling an intricate, original mystery that kept viewers guessing every week.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Rising of The Shield Hero Season 2   Apr  7th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Rising of The Shield Hero Season 2 ?                     Community score: 3.9              What is this?   No sooner has Naofumi settled into his role as the new ruler of Raphtalia's village, that they're beset by an attack from a horde of bat monsters! The timer for the Waves is mysteriously stalled, and a meeting with the other Cardinal Heroes and the Queen reveals the rising of a new threat: The 'Spirit Tortoise' is bringing potential ruin with it, and with the other Heroes opting out of doing anything about it, things naturally fall to Naofumi to take care of things. With new ally (and new slave) Rishia in tow, the Shield Hero's party heads for the Spirit Tortoise Kingdom in order to save the world once again.    The Rising of The Shield Hero Season 2 is based on Aneko Yusagi's novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Wednesdays.      How was the first episode?  Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               When last we left off, Naofumi and the others were struggling with the revelation that they were involved in a battle between worlds rather than a simple monster invasion. However, all this is put to the side as a new threat arises, the Spirit Tortoise, whose arrival mysteriously puts a stop to the Waves for the time being.    When it comes down to it, this episode is really only concerned with one thing: exposition. Though we do get two quick action scenes, the thrust of the episode is about establishing the status quo for the arc—i.e., the threat of the turtle—while reminding us of important plot points from the previous season.    Luckily, this is done largely through character building. We see that Naofumi is far from the aggrieved man he was for much of the first season. Becoming the lord of Raphtalia's hometown has tied him irrevocably to the kingdom. While the other heroes still see the fantasy world as a game, to Naofumi it has become his true life filled with things he is driven to protect.    We also spend a lot of time developing Rishia, the newest member of Naofumi's party. She's a young woman in turmoil—in love with a man who has rejected her even though she is dying to be useful to him. But in her, there is potential, though Naofumi and his friends are unsure how to bring it out and what form it will ultimately take. She is an inherently tragic character but through Naofumi's party, it looks like she will be able to become the person she was meant to be. If nothing else, her earnestness makes her easy to root for.    All in all, while this is one of the weaker episodes, it does its job setting up the next arc well enough and gives us some solid character development to boot. Hopefully, things will pick up a bit next episode.      How was the first episode?  Christopher Farris  Rating:               There's the possibility that kicking off a second season of The Rising of the Shield Hero could be a boon for the series. There's a clean break to all the consternation and baggage that fueled the original outing: most of the foundation built on Naofumi's persecution  has cleared up. However, not content with just the one demihuman slave, he now gets to be the ruler of a whole village of demihumans. The world is still besieged by regular monster attacks, which is also now subject to hero-assassination attempts from other worlds. So of course, some new issue inevitably gets foisted into the plot for Naofumi and crew.    There's definitely the sense of a plot-necessity swerve in the development of this premiere episode. The driving force of the entire story of the first season, the Waves, quite literally gets put on pause so the Queen can impart the new issue of a 'Spirit Tortoise' that we haven't heard of before but we're assured is every bit as much a major disaster. It certainly means the episode gets going quickly; we hardly have any time for the sort of reestablishing elements with Naofumi in the demihuman village before suddenly they're beset by random bat monsters brought by the ascension of the evil Turtle Pope. But it also means that parts of the story get back to too-perfunctory Business As Usual for Shield Hero. The other Cardinal Heroes, apparently having learned nothing from the climax of the previous adventure, are still acting like callous jerks to Naofumi and friends, and shrugging off needing to actually do anything about the Spirit Tortoise under the auspices that it's not their job.    So even though Naofumi has more predisposition to help with the situation, the storytelling still oddly proceeds with that sense of begrudgement we're just supposed to expect around him in this story. It's almost unintentionally hilarious, the way both the Queen and later Fitoria act like they need to convince Naofumi to take care of the Spirit Tortoise under duress, despite him immediately agreeing to do so. I know that this sort of disagreeable tone is part-and-parcel to the darker, nihilistic angle of appeal Shield Hero is trying to present in its fantasy world, but it just comes off needlessly enforced when its main character character has no reason to act like the world's against him anymore .    That said, the slack of the struggle in Shield-land is instead picked up in this premiere by Rishia, who ends up with what could be considered the emotional core of this episode. Her persecution by her former party with the Bow Hero definitely reflects Naofumi's own story, to where you can almost hear the author going ""See, I can write a woman who gets put upon and mistreated for unfair reasons too! It's equality!"" Of course the major difference is that when Naofumi was at his lowest point, he was forced to buy a slave, while as Rishia finds herself struggling she is convinced to become a slave and aaaaaawwwwww Christ.    Look, I don't need to get into the weeds on this, we had half a year of slavery discourse with the first Shield Hero season. But it must be said that it comes off as downright undermining that the show ever portrayed the slave trade as this dark, seedy element its hero could turn to out of desperation, when at this point it's mostly just an odd mechanic characters can submit themselves to for in-story power-up convenience and lip service to a fetish that isn't even portrayed half as entertainingly as in other series like How NOT to Summon a Demon Lord. That is to say, Rishia agreeing to become Naofumi's slave for a time doesn't prompt aghast reactions of offense, it simply comes off as eyeroll-worthy.    Regardless, Shield Hero's second season has at least started with plenty of momentum to it, even if some of the new story elements come off like ham-fisted hard-turns. But this is a show that worked better the more it expanded its world-building anyway, so maybe figuring out what the deal with this Spirit Tortoise actually is or seeing how Rishia's development along the way plays out will be to its benefit. The fights we get in this episode featuring our heroes slaughtering their way through Countries both Bat and Donkey Kong are decent, concentrated bursts of action (there's a little bit of shaky CGI, but you know I always love seeing Filo fight in her big, puffy, bird form), and you know Kevin Penkin's score is still pulling its weight. It's the beginning of a second season that seems to be justifying its existence, with all the caveats from however you felt about the original's existence in the first place.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review                Odd Taxi: In the Woods   Apr 17, 00:00                 anime    By cleverly reframing its narrative around a series of interviews with the supporting cast, Odd Taxi: In the Woods succeeds where most recap films fail: it's an artistically cohesive film in its own right. ― Odd Taxi was 2021's sleeper anime hit, telling an intricate, original mystery that kept viewers guessing every week.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Rising of The Shield Hero Season 2   Apr  7th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Rising of The Shield Hero Season 2 ?                     Community score: 3.9              What is this?   No sooner has Naofumi settled into his role as the new ruler of Raphtalia's village, that they're beset by an attack from a horde of bat monsters! The timer for the Waves is mysteriously stalled, and a meeting with the other Cardinal Heroes and the Queen reveals the rising of a new threat: The 'Spirit Tortoise' is bringing potential ruin with it, and with the other Heroes opting out of doing anything about it, things naturally fall to Naofumi to take care of things. With new ally (and new slave) Rishia in tow, the Shield Hero's party heads for the Spirit Tortoise Kingdom in order to save the world once again.    The Rising of The Shield Hero Season 2 is based on Aneko Yusagi's novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Wednesdays.      How was the first episode?  Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               When last we left off, Naofumi and the others were struggling with the revelation that they were involved in a battle between worlds rather than a simple monster invasion. However, all this is put to the side as a new threat arises, the Spirit Tortoise, whose arrival mysteriously puts a stop to the Waves for the time being.    When it comes down to it, this episode is really only concerned with one thing: exposition. Though we do get two quick action scenes, the thrust of the episode is about establishing the status quo for the arc—i.e., the threat of the turtle—while reminding us of important plot points from the previous season.    Luckily, this is done largely through character building. We see that Naofumi is far from the aggrieved man he was for much of the first season. Becoming the lord of Raphtalia's hometown has tied him irrevocably to the kingdom. While the other heroes still see the fantasy world as a game, to Naofumi it has become his true life filled with things he is driven to protect.    We also spend a lot of time developing Rishia, the newest member of Naofumi's party. She's a young woman in turmoil—in love with a man who has rejected her even though she is dying to be useful to him. But in her, there is potential, though Naofumi and his friends are unsure how to bring it out and what form it will ultimately take. She is an inherently tragic character but through Naofumi's party, it looks like she will be able to become the person she was meant to be. If nothing else, her earnestness makes her easy to root for.    All in all, while this is one of the weaker episodes, it does its job setting up the next arc well enough and gives us some solid character development to boot. Hopefully, things will pick up a bit next episode.      How was the first episode?  Christopher Farris  Rating:               There's the possibility that kicking off a second season of The Rising of the Shield Hero could be a boon for the series. There's a clean break to all the consternation and baggage that fueled the original outing: most of the foundation built on Naofumi's persecution  has cleared up. However, not content with just the one demihuman slave, he now gets to be the ruler of a whole village of demihumans. The world is still besieged by regular monster attacks, which is also now subject to hero-assassination attempts from other worlds. So of course, some new issue inevitably gets foisted into the plot for Naofumi and crew.    There's definitely the sense of a plot-necessity swerve in the development of this premiere episode. The driving force of the entire story of the first season, the Waves, quite literally gets put on pause so the Queen can impart the new issue of a 'Spirit Tortoise' that we haven't heard of before but we're assured is every bit as much a major disaster. It certainly means the episode gets going quickly; we hardly have any time for the sort of reestablishing elements with Naofumi in the demihuman village before suddenly they're beset by random bat monsters brought by the ascension of the evil Turtle Pope. But it also means that parts of the story get back to too-perfunctory Business As Usual for Shield Hero. The other Cardinal Heroes, apparently having learned nothing from the climax of the previous adventure, are still acting like callous jerks to Naofumi and friends, and shrugging off needing to actually do anything about the Spirit Tortoise under the auspices that it's not their job.    So even though Naofumi has more predisposition to help with the situation, the storytelling still oddly proceeds with that sense of begrudgement we're just supposed to expect around him in this story. It's almost unintentionally hilarious, the way both the Queen and later Fitoria act like they need to convince Naofumi to take care of the Spirit Tortoise under duress, despite him immediately agreeing to do so. I know that this sort of disagreeable tone is part-and-parcel to the darker, nihilistic angle of appeal Shield Hero is trying to present in its fantasy world, but it just comes off needlessly enforced when its main character character has no reason to act like the world's against him anymore .    That said, the slack of the struggle in Shield-land is instead picked up in this premiere by Rishia, who ends up with what could be considered the emotional core of this episode. Her persecution by her former party with the Bow Hero definitely reflects Naofumi's own story, to where you can almost hear the author going ""See, I can write a woman who gets put upon and mistreated for unfair reasons too! It's equality!"" Of course the major difference is that when Naofumi was at his lowest point, he was forced to buy a slave, while as Rishia finds herself struggling she is convinced to become a slave and aaaaaawwwwww Christ.    Look, I don't need to get into the weeds on this, we had half a year of slavery discourse with the first Shield Hero season. But it must be said that it comes off as downright undermining that the show ever portrayed the slave trade as this dark, seedy element its hero could turn to out of desperation, when at this point it's mostly just an odd mechanic characters can submit themselves to for in-story power-up convenience and lip service to a fetish that isn't even portrayed half as entertainingly as in other series like How NOT to Summon a Demon Lord. That is to say, Rishia agreeing to become Naofumi's slave for a time doesn't prompt aghast reactions of offense, it simply comes off as eyeroll-worthy.    Regardless, Shield Hero's second season has at least started with plenty of momentum to it, even if some of the new story elements come off like ham-fisted hard-turns. But this is a show that worked better the more it expanded its world-building anyway, so maybe figuring out what the deal with this Spirit Tortoise actually is or seeing how Rishia's development along the way plays out will be to its benefit. The fights we get in this episode featuring our heroes slaughtering their way through Countries both Bat and Donkey Kong are decent, concentrated bursts of action (there's a little bit of shaky CGI, but you know I always love seeing Filo fight in her big, puffy, bird form), and you know Kevin Penkin's score is still pulling its weight. It's the beginning of a second season that seems to be justifying its existence, with all the caveats from however you felt about the original's existence in the first place.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review                Odd Taxi: In the Woods   Apr 17, 00:00                 anime    By cleverly reframing its narrative around a series of interviews with the supporting cast, Odd Taxi: In the Woods succeeds where most recap films fail: it's an artistically cohesive film in its own right. ― Odd Taxi was 2021's sleeper anime hit, telling an intricate, original mystery that kept viewers guessing every week.

Film's Teaser Announces July 15 Opening, Joint Screening With 10th Anniversary Film   posted on 2022-04-14 10:43 UTC-8 by Egan Loo         New Mirai e no Starway anniversary film reunites 1st series staff    The official website for BN Pictures' Gekijō-ban Aikatsu Planet! film debuted a teaser promotional video on Thursday. The teaser announces the film's July 11 opening date and its joint screening with the franchise's new 10th anniversary film.         The Aikatsu! Planet television series' director Ryuichi Kimura, series script supervisor Misuzu Chiba, and character designer Risa Miyadani are returning for the Gekijō-ban Aikatsu Planet! film.       The accompanying Aikatsu! 10th Story ~Mirai e no Starway~ (Starway to the Future, an apparent reference to the Japanese translation of the Led Zeppelin song ""Stairway to Heaven"") film marks the franchise's 10th anniversary. The brand-new story for the original Aikatsu! series reunites that series' director  Kimura, scenario writer Yoichi Kato, and character designer Hiroko Yaguchi.    The Aikatsu! 10th Story ~Mirai e no Starway~ film's teaser visual shows the main leads Ichigo Hoshimiya and Akari Ōzora  in their debut outfits as the Cosmos duo (from the television series finale). The film's story introduction reveals that the first live Cosmos concert was a great success. Later, Ichigo faces her graduation from Starlight Academy in half a year — but even after graduation, the life of an idol continues.    Aikatsu! Planet was the Aikatsu! idol franchise's first television project that combined animation, 3D CG, and live-action.    The story revolves around ""Aikatsu Planet,"" a world where anyone can assume the role of an avatar and become an adorably cute idol. Mao Otoha, an ordinary first-year student at the private academy Seirei High School, becomes the #1 idol Hana when Hana's previous alter ego Meisa Hinata suddenly disappeared. However, Mao's new role as the avatar Hana is a secret to everyone else. The tagline of the project is, ""To become the 'me' I want to be, I enter the mirror.""    The project used anime and CG to depict the scenes in the ""Aikatsu Planet"" world, and it used live-action footage to depict Mao's daily life.    BN Pictures was credited with the project's development, original story, and production, and Bandai was credited with the original concept. Ryuichi Kimura served as both chief director and director, and Misuzu Chiba supervised the series scripts. Risa Miyadani designed the characters. Tohokushinsha Film Corporation produced the live-action footage. The characters Mao, Ruli, Kyōko, and Shiori sang the opening song ""Bloomy*Smile,"" and the new unit Starry Planet sang the theme song ""Happy ∞ Aikatsu.""    The Aikatsu! Planet seires premiered on January 10, 2021 and ended in June 2021.    The Aikatsu! franchise began with the original arcade card game in October 2012. The game inspired a television anime that ran from 2012 to 2016, and three anime films. The second entry in the franchise, Aikatsu Stars!, inspired a television anime that premiered on TV Tokyo and its affiliates in April 2016. Aikatsu Stars! received an anime film in August 2016.    The third entry in the Aikatsu! franchise, Aikatsu Friends!, premiered in April 2018 along with the accompanying Aikatsu Friends! Data Carddass arcade game. A sequel television anime titled Aikatsu Friends! ~Kagayaki no Jewel~ (Shining Jewel) then  premiered in April 2018 with its own aracde game tie-in. The sequel is set two years after the story of Aikatsu Friends!, with the main character Aine Yūki now in high school.    The Aikatsu on Parade! television anime premiered on Saturday, October 5, 2019 with the new lead character Raki Kiseki and characters from the previous Aikatsu! anime series.    Sources: Aikatsu!

Film's Teaser Announces July 15 Opening, Joint Screening With 10th Anniversary Film   posted on 2022-04-14 10:43 UTC-8 by Egan Loo         New Mirai e no Starway anniversary film reunites 1st series staff    The official website for BN Pictures' Gekijō-ban Aikatsu Planet! film debuted a teaser promotional video on Thursday. The teaser announces the film's July 11 opening date and its joint screening with the franchise's new 10th anniversary film.         The Aikatsu! Planet television series' director Ryuichi Kimura, series script supervisor Misuzu Chiba, and character designer Risa Miyadani are returning for the Gekijō-ban Aikatsu Planet! film.       The accompanying Aikatsu! 10th Story ~Mirai e no Starway~ (Starway to the Future, an apparent reference to the Japanese translation of the Led Zeppelin song ""Stairway to Heaven"") film marks the franchise's 10th anniversary. The brand-new story for the original Aikatsu! series reunites that series' director  Kimura, scenario writer Yoichi Kato, and character designer Hiroko Yaguchi.    The Aikatsu! 10th Story ~Mirai e no Starway~ film's teaser visual shows the main leads Ichigo Hoshimiya and Akari Ōzora  in their debut outfits as the Cosmos duo (from the television series finale). The film's story introduction reveals that the first live Cosmos concert was a great success. Later, Ichigo faces her graduation from Starlight Academy in half a year — but even after graduation, the life of an idol continues.    Aikatsu! Planet was the Aikatsu! idol franchise's first television project that combined animation, 3D CG, and live-action.    The story revolves around ""Aikatsu Planet,"" a world where anyone can assume the role of an avatar and become an adorably cute idol. Mao Otoha, an ordinary first-year student at the private academy Seirei High School, becomes the #1 idol Hana when Hana's previous alter ego Meisa Hinata suddenly disappeared. However, Mao's new role as the avatar Hana is a secret to everyone else. The tagline of the project is, ""To become the 'me' I want to be, I enter the mirror.""    The project used anime and CG to depict the scenes in the ""Aikatsu Planet"" world, and it used live-action footage to depict Mao's daily life.    BN Pictures was credited with the project's development, original story, and production, and Bandai was credited with the original concept. Ryuichi Kimura served as both chief director and director, and Misuzu Chiba supervised the series scripts. Risa Miyadani designed the characters. Tohokushinsha Film Corporation produced the live-action footage. The characters Mao, Ruli, Kyōko, and Shiori sang the opening song ""Bloomy*Smile,"" and the new unit Starry Planet sang the theme song ""Happy ∞ Aikatsu.""    The Aikatsu! Planet seires premiered on January 10, 2021 and ended in June 2021.    The Aikatsu! franchise began with the original arcade card game in October 2012. The game inspired a television anime that ran from 2012 to 2016, and three anime films. The second entry in the franchise, Aikatsu Stars!, inspired a television anime that premiered on TV Tokyo and its affiliates in April 2016. Aikatsu Stars! received an anime film in August 2016.    The third entry in the Aikatsu! franchise, Aikatsu Friends!, premiered in April 2018 along with the accompanying Aikatsu Friends! Data Carddass arcade game. A sequel television anime titled Aikatsu Friends! ~Kagayaki no Jewel~ (Shining Jewel) then  premiered in April 2018 with its own aracde game tie-in. The sequel is set two years after the story of Aikatsu Friends!, with the main character Aine Yūki now in high school.    The Aikatsu on Parade! television anime premiered on Saturday, October 5, 2019 with the new lead character Raki Kiseki and characters from the previous Aikatsu! anime series.    Sources: Aikatsu!

Film's Teaser Announces July 15 Opening, Joint Screening With 10th Anniversary Film   posted on 2022-04-14 10:43 UTC-8 by Egan Loo         New Mirai e no Starway anniversary film reunites 1st series staff    The official website for BN Pictures' Gekijō-ban Aikatsu Planet! film debuted a teaser promotional video on Thursday. The teaser announces the film's July 11 opening date and its joint screening with the franchise's new 10th anniversary film.         The Aikatsu! Planet television series' director Ryuichi Kimura, series script supervisor Misuzu Chiba, and character designer Risa Miyadani are returning for the Gekijō-ban Aikatsu Planet! film.       The accompanying Aikatsu! 10th Story ~Mirai e no Starway~ (Starway to the Future, an apparent reference to the Japanese translation of the Led Zeppelin song ""Stairway to Heaven"") film marks the franchise's 10th anniversary. The brand-new story for the original Aikatsu! series reunites that series' director  Kimura, scenario writer Yoichi Kato, and character designer Hiroko Yaguchi.    The Aikatsu! 10th Story ~Mirai e no Starway~ film's teaser visual shows the main leads Ichigo Hoshimiya and Akari Ōzora  in their debut outfits as the Cosmos duo (from the television series finale). The film's story introduction reveals that the first live Cosmos concert was a great success. Later, Ichigo faces her graduation from Starlight Academy in half a year — but even after graduation, the life of an idol continues.    Aikatsu! Planet was the Aikatsu! idol franchise's first television project that combined animation, 3D CG, and live-action.    The story revolves around ""Aikatsu Planet,"" a world where anyone can assume the role of an avatar and become an adorably cute idol. Mao Otoha, an ordinary first-year student at the private academy Seirei High School, becomes the #1 idol Hana when Hana's previous alter ego Meisa Hinata suddenly disappeared. However, Mao's new role as the avatar Hana is a secret to everyone else. The tagline of the project is, ""To become the 'me' I want to be, I enter the mirror.""    The project used anime and CG to depict the scenes in the ""Aikatsu Planet"" world, and it used live-action footage to depict Mao's daily life.    BN Pictures was credited with the project's development, original story, and production, and Bandai was credited with the original concept. Ryuichi Kimura served as both chief director and director, and Misuzu Chiba supervised the series scripts. Risa Miyadani designed the characters. Tohokushinsha Film Corporation produced the live-action footage. The characters Mao, Ruli, Kyōko, and Shiori sang the opening song ""Bloomy*Smile,"" and the new unit Starry Planet sang the theme song ""Happy ∞ Aikatsu.""    The Aikatsu!

The teaser announces the film's July 11 opening date and its joint screening with the franchise's new 10th anniversary film.         The Aikatsu! Planet television series' director Ryuichi Kimura, series script supervisor Misuzu Chiba, and character designer Risa Miyadani are returning for the Gekijō-ban Aikatsu Planet! film.       The accompanying Aikatsu! 10th Story ~Mirai e no Starway~ (Starway to the Future, an apparent reference to the Japanese translation of the Led Zeppelin song ""Stairway to Heaven"") film marks the franchise's 10th anniversary. The brand-new story for the original Aikatsu! series reunites that series' director  Kimura, scenario writer Yoichi Kato, and character designer Hiroko Yaguchi.    The Aikatsu! 10th Story ~Mirai e no Starway~ film's teaser visual shows the main leads Ichigo Hoshimiya and Akari Ōzora  in their debut outfits as the Cosmos duo (from the television series finale). The film's story introduction reveals that the first live Cosmos concert was a great success. Later, Ichigo faces her graduation from Starlight Academy in half a year — but even after graduation, the life of an idol continues.    Aikatsu! Planet was the Aikatsu! idol franchise's first television project that combined animation, 3D CG, and live-action.    The story revolves around ""Aikatsu Planet,"" a world where anyone can assume the role of an avatar and become an adorably cute idol. Mao Otoha, an ordinary first-year student at the private academy Seirei High School, becomes the #1 idol Hana when Hana's previous alter ego Meisa Hinata suddenly disappeared. However, Mao's new role as the avatar Hana is a secret to everyone else. The tagline of the project is, ""To become the 'me' I want to be, I enter the mirror.""    The project used anime and CG to depict the scenes in the ""Aikatsu Planet"" world, and it used live-action footage to depict Mao's daily life.    BN Pictures was credited with the project's development, original story, and production, and Bandai was credited with the original concept. Ryuichi Kimura served as both chief director and director, and Misuzu Chiba supervised the series scripts. Risa Miyadani designed the characters. Tohokushinsha Film Corporation produced the live-action footage. The characters Mao, Ruli, Kyōko, and Shiori sang the opening song ""Bloomy*Smile,"" and the new unit Starry Planet sang the theme song ""Happy ∞ Aikatsu.""    The Aikatsu! Planet seires premiered on January 10, 2021 and ended in June 2021.    The Aikatsu! franchise began with the original arcade card game in October 2012.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki   Apr 10th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki ?                     Community score: 3.6              What is this?   Tsubaki Kunoichi is the best student in her kunoichi school. She lives in a village of women with the rule that they cannot have contact with men. However, she has a curiosity about men that she cannot reveal.    In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki is based on Sōichirō Yamamoto's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Boy, Sōichirō Yamamoto's artstyle is not working here. The author of Teasing Master Takagi-san's signature style of cute characters with big noggins and fiveheads may work for realistic slice-of-life romantic comedies, but combined with The Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki's bare-midriff costume designs, it kind of gives things a “sexy baby” vibe. When you add that to the core concept of a teenage girl who's starting to develop an obsession with men despite never having seen one in her life, things get pretty awkward.    I'm willing to buy that despite appearances, Tsubaki and her florally named cohorts are of an age where developing an interest in boys is normal and natural and, with that in mind, the series does have some charm. It gives things kind of a dueling summer camps vibe, where teens are segregated by sex but also desperate to catch a glimpse of one another. Adolescence is a hell of a drug, after all, and while not every girl develops an all-consuming obsession with boys, quite a few of them do at some point or another. Plus, the banter between the girls was pretty cute, whether it be about guys or other topics. The way they kept repeating the same factoids they'd learned from one another for lack of any other kind of information made me chuckle. I half-expected one to bust out, “Boys go to Jupiter to get more stupider” at some point.    It does beg the question: if these girls have literally never seen a man, and all they know is that they're big and smelly and have weak crotches, why would their hormones still go toward them? (Instead of being sublimated to more immediately available and familiar targets, if you catch my drift) It's one thing when you're around boys, but mostly spend time with other girls, and suddenly you start wanting to know about this mysterious other sex; it's another thing when they're basically cryptids.    One last thing in Kunoichi Tsubaki's defense: the show uses the word “otoko,” which is closer in meaning to “male” than to “man” or “men.” The choice to use “men” for the translation instead of “boys” makes it seem like these young girls are lusting after adult men, rather than their peers. With that in mind, things get a lot less creepy. Still a little weird, but not nearly as actively uncomfortable.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Look. I understand what this show is trying to do. The joke is that we have a girl going through puberty who is basically “boy crazy.” Yet, she's surrounded by nothing but girls and has been taught from birth that men are basically monsters (but, importantly, ones that can be defeated with a well-aimed shot to the crotch). She has no one to talk to about her burgeoning sexuality and is trying to keep all these newfound feelings inside—though they keep bursting to the surface whenever she so much as thinks of something even tangentially related to men.    Unfortunately, I am unable to suspend disbelief when it comes to the core concept of the show. If you've never seen a man, think that they are disgusting, inhuman beings, and know nothing about sex and men's role in it, why would you be sexually aroused by them? I mean, she can't even form a mental picture of a man because all she knows about men comes from what her teacher has told them to scare them.    It would be one thing if she were captivated by the unknown—enticed by the taboo nature of meeting a man. After all, most teens rebel at some point and do things they are not supposed to do for the rush of it. But that's not what we are seeing with Tsubaki. She's basically sexually attracted to the concept of men—and an incredibly unflattering concept at that. I think she's going to be disappointed when she finds out that men are actually a lot like women—only with more hair and muscles.    Now, I may be overthinking things (but in my own defense, that's literally what I am paid to do). However, that doesn't change the fact that every time Tsubaki goes to mush thinking about men, I find it annoying instead of cute and silly, and her teammates (one “aggressively lesbian” and the other a lazy glutton) didn't add much to the story beyond being walking plot devices. In the end, this anime is basically a non-starter. Consider me thoroughly not entertained.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               This is a bit of a weird one. If you couldn't tell from the size of these characters' foreheads, this is from the same mangaka as Teasing Master Takagi-san, and while it features a similar style of soft and silly humor based around the awkward pangs of early puberty, instead of a typical high-school romcom we get this whole apparatus of a girls-only ninja-in-training village and multiple teams of anime girls throwing shuriken and using ninjutsu. It's a way more complex setting for a similar effect, but it does add a bit of flavor to the whole thing.    It helps that the show just looks really nice. I don't know what magic Sōichirō Yamamoto worked to get two different gorgeously directed adaptations of his work, but that panache helps what might otherwise be pretty standard anime ninja shenanigans feel genuinely fun. These characters move with a ton of energy and spark, the short action sequences are solid, but the real treat is the wonderful environmental work during Tsubaki's nighttime excursion into the woods. The daytime scenes are a bit more pedestrian, but still do well to give this big ol' gaggle of kunoichi the energy you'd expect from kids, even ones training to be ninja. The character designs – specifically the cast's clothing, or lack thereof – are a bit of a red flag, but as of this episode the direction hasn't dipped into anything sexualizing. The closest it gets is Tsubaki blushing over the thought of seeing a b-b-b-boy, but you'd have to stretch pretty far to call that cheesecake.    As for the setup itself, it does feel a bit too contrived at the start, but by the end of the episode we wind up in the same sort of place as like, kids' summer camp movies. You know, it's a sleep-away camp out in the woods, and there's all-girls and all-boys camps on either side of a big lake. They get into adventures trying to sneak over to see the other camp, and eventually there's a big competition at the End of Summer. I don't imagine these competing(?) ninja schools will have a river raft race or a competitive pie eating contest, but you never know. It all mostly winds up as fodder for jokes about kids who don't know anything about boys spreading rumors and theories, including one girl who very clearly heard about dudes getting kicked in the balls and spends the entire rest of the episode telling all her friends about it to seem cool. Tsubaki herself is flustered to hell and back thinking about boys, and that's about all the jokes you get across this premiere.    It's not bad, but it definitely starts wearing thin by the time credits roll, and the sooner the show can introduce more material to build its gags around, the better. This creator has shown before that he can make charming low-key ensemble comedies, and there's certainly enough characters to facilitate that. It just needs to either introduce a stronger comedic hook, or delve more into its setting to get there.       James Beckett  Rating:               Man, I wanted to like In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki, since I'm already such a big fan of author Soichiro Yamamoto's other series, Teasing Master Takagi-san. However, I was definitely not inspired to get my hopes up when I saw the key art and trailers for this new series, which made it look like it was the kind of pandering and fanservice-driven comedy that I'm usually not too keen on. And look, let's get it out of the way up front: If you get skeeved out when a show puts a whole heck of a lot of the camera's focus on the exposed bellies and feet of young girls, thenIn the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki isn't going to be for you. The show is never so crass as to straight-up crash zoom on any of the characters' crotches or anything, but you'd have to be blind to not notice how much effort this series has gone towards putting a literal village full of tween girls into the most revealing ninja outfits that it can manage without knocking itself into an Adults Only timeslot (or a government watch-list, for that matter).    Even if you were to ignore the questionable designs and costume choices of the entire cast, not to mention all of the shots that are specifically designed to highlight the girls' toes and bellybuttons, the biggest issue with In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki would remain: It just isn't very funny. The whole show revolves around precisely one joke, which is that Tsubaki and her fellow lady ninjas hail from a reclusive clan that has managed to live in complete isolation from any men for years, to the point that all of the children treat the very concept of a “man” as some sort of hilarious cryptozoological prank. This is a trope that has been played both straight and as comedic fodder for literally a hundred years or more, from the pages of the sleaziest pulp magazine stories to the hackiest TV sitcoms. It isn't an inherently awful trope, mind you, but it's been played out to the degree that you have to get really creative with it if you want to be successful.    In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki is not really creative about anything it does, and if it weren't for the admittedly slick and entertaining production values, you'd be forgiven for mistaking the series for some bargain bin sex-comedy OVA that's been buried in someone's old VHS stash for the past thirty years. Each of the three main characters has exactly one character trait apiece, and none of them make for great comedy: Tsubaki is the all-star ninja who has become so obsessed with the idea of meeting a guy that she can't do her job anymore, Sazanka is the obsessive scamp who can't keep her hands/feet/body off of Tsubaki, and Asagao is…I guess she's the dumb one? I don't know. The show is too busy making lazy double entendre puns and repeating the same joke about Tsubaki's overflowing horniness to bother communicating anything else to its audience.    That's the thing about this preview: It could very well be that there is a genuinely funny and endearing comedy hiding somewhere underneath all of the lazy writing and questionable artistic decisions, but if that version of In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki does exist, this first episode certainly didn't do a great job of advertising it. I'll stick to Takagi-san, thank you very much. Consider this one of the season's biggest disappointments.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               It's entirely possible that In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki is trying to be a sort of light riff on that period of adolescence when some people become obsessed with whatever gender(s) they're attracted to. In fact, I highly suspect that's the case – in a world where ninja schools are segregated by gender, the guiding principle of the girls' school seems to be that men are like ticks – something best avoided and, in this case, often found outside. But because people are people, the harping on how awful men are has had the effect that the girls are all fully obsessed with them, something that ranges from “deliciously grossed out” to “fluttery feelings in the chest.” While most of the girls fall into the first category, our eponymous heroine is firmly in the second, but because her teacher is so down on men, she thinks that liking them must mean that there's something wrong with her. Hijinks ensue.    I'm not sure what point exactly this episode is trying to make or what mood it's hoping to strike. We have a yuri-bait character in Sazanka, who is more attached to Tsubaki than she perhaps should be, we have plenty of cute girl designs and young women in various states of undress (or rather, clothing that doesn't cover much), and we have Tsubaki who is plainly attracted to men despite having never seen one. Presumably it's all meant to be funny, but it doesn't quite manage it, in part because even when the story hits on something amusing, it's promptly used as many times as possible in the moments following its introduction. Even if you've never seen a man you can surely use your imagination to come up with more than the oft-repeated “smelly, doesn't bathe, big bodies but weak in the crotch” that's practically the theme song of this episode. There are more ways to describe the Loch Ness Monster, for goodness' sake. It feels like someone thought the concept (and that repeated statement) is a lot funnier than it actually is.    On the other hand, this is a different approach to the CGCT genre, so if you're interested in a variation on that theme, this may be worth checking out. Bobble-head look of the character designs aside, it doesn't look awful, and if the attempt to show how far the girls can jump ends up looking more like they're flying on invisible brooms, well, I at least appreciate the effort. But it really needs to find more than one joke to hang its hat on, because this one gets old quickly.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review                Odd Taxi: In the Woods   Apr 17, 00:00                 anime    By cleverly reframing its narrative around a series of interviews with the supporting cast, Odd Taxi: In the Woods succeeds where most recap films fail: it's an artistically cohesive film in its own right. ― Odd Taxi was 2021's sleeper anime hit, telling an intricate, original mystery that kept viewers guessing every week.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki   Apr 10th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki ?                     Community score: 3.6              What is this?   Tsubaki Kunoichi is the best student in her kunoichi school. She lives in a village of women with the rule that they cannot have contact with men. However, she has a curiosity about men that she cannot reveal.    In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki is based on Sōichirō Yamamoto's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Boy, Sōichirō Yamamoto's artstyle is not working here. The author of Teasing Master Takagi-san's signature style of cute characters with big noggins and fiveheads may work for realistic slice-of-life romantic comedies, but combined with The Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki's bare-midriff costume designs, it kind of gives things a “sexy baby” vibe. When you add that to the core concept of a teenage girl who's starting to develop an obsession with men despite never having seen one in her life, things get pretty awkward.    I'm willing to buy that despite appearances, Tsubaki and her florally named cohorts are of an age where developing an interest in boys is normal and natural and, with that in mind, the series does have some charm. It gives things kind of a dueling summer camps vibe, where teens are segregated by sex but also desperate to catch a glimpse of one another. Adolescence is a hell of a drug, after all, and while not every girl develops an all-consuming obsession with boys, quite a few of them do at some point or another. Plus, the banter between the girls was pretty cute, whether it be about guys or other topics. The way they kept repeating the same factoids they'd learned from one another for lack of any other kind of information made me chuckle. I half-expected one to bust out, “Boys go to Jupiter to get more stupider” at some point.    It does beg the question: if these girls have literally never seen a man, and all they know is that they're big and smelly and have weak crotches, why would their hormones still go toward them? (Instead of being sublimated to more immediately available and familiar targets, if you catch my drift) It's one thing when you're around boys, but mostly spend time with other girls, and suddenly you start wanting to know about this mysterious other sex; it's another thing when they're basically cryptids.    One last thing in Kunoichi Tsubaki's defense: the show uses the word “otoko,” which is closer in meaning to “male” than to “man” or “men.” The choice to use “men” for the translation instead of “boys” makes it seem like these young girls are lusting after adult men, rather than their peers. With that in mind, things get a lot less creepy. Still a little weird, but not nearly as actively uncomfortable.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Look. I understand what this show is trying to do. The joke is that we have a girl going through puberty who is basically “boy crazy.” Yet, she's surrounded by nothing but girls and has been taught from birth that men are basically monsters (but, importantly, ones that can be defeated with a well-aimed shot to the crotch). She has no one to talk to about her burgeoning sexuality and is trying to keep all these newfound feelings inside—though they keep bursting to the surface whenever she so much as thinks of something even tangentially related to men.    Unfortunately, I am unable to suspend disbelief when it comes to the core concept of the show. If you've never seen a man, think that they are disgusting, inhuman beings, and know nothing about sex and men's role in it, why would you be sexually aroused by them? I mean, she can't even form a mental picture of a man because all she knows about men comes from what her teacher has told them to scare them.    It would be one thing if she were captivated by the unknown—enticed by the taboo nature of meeting a man. After all, most teens rebel at some point and do things they are not supposed to do for the rush of it. But that's not what we are seeing with Tsubaki. She's basically sexually attracted to the concept of men—and an incredibly unflattering concept at that. I think she's going to be disappointed when she finds out that men are actually a lot like women—only with more hair and muscles.    Now, I may be overthinking things (but in my own defense, that's literally what I am paid to do). However, that doesn't change the fact that every time Tsubaki goes to mush thinking about men, I find it annoying instead of cute and silly, and her teammates (one “aggressively lesbian” and the other a lazy glutton) didn't add much to the story beyond being walking plot devices. In the end, this anime is basically a non-starter. Consider me thoroughly not entertained.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               This is a bit of a weird one. If you couldn't tell from the size of these characters' foreheads, this is from the same mangaka as Teasing Master Takagi-san, and while it features a similar style of soft and silly humor based around the awkward pangs of early puberty, instead of a typical high-school romcom we get this whole apparatus of a girls-only ninja-in-training village and multiple teams of anime girls throwing shuriken and using ninjutsu. It's a way more complex setting for a similar effect, but it does add a bit of flavor to the whole thing.    It helps that the show just looks really nice. I don't know what magic Sōichirō Yamamoto worked to get two different gorgeously directed adaptations of his work, but that panache helps what might otherwise be pretty standard anime ninja shenanigans feel genuinely fun. These characters move with a ton of energy and spark, the short action sequences are solid, but the real treat is the wonderful environmental work during Tsubaki's nighttime excursion into the woods. The daytime scenes are a bit more pedestrian, but still do well to give this big ol' gaggle of kunoichi the energy you'd expect from kids, even ones training to be ninja. The character designs – specifically the cast's clothing, or lack thereof – are a bit of a red flag, but as of this episode the direction hasn't dipped into anything sexualizing. The closest it gets is Tsubaki blushing over the thought of seeing a b-b-b-boy, but you'd have to stretch pretty far to call that cheesecake.    As for the setup itself, it does feel a bit too contrived at the start, but by the end of the episode we wind up in the same sort of place as like, kids' summer camp movies. You know, it's a sleep-away camp out in the woods, and there's all-girls and all-boys camps on either side of a big lake. They get into adventures trying to sneak over to see the other camp, and eventually there's a big competition at the End of Summer. I don't imagine these competing(?) ninja schools will have a river raft race or a competitive pie eating contest, but you never know. It all mostly winds up as fodder for jokes about kids who don't know anything about boys spreading rumors and theories, including one girl who very clearly heard about dudes getting kicked in the balls and spends the entire rest of the episode telling all her friends about it to seem cool. Tsubaki herself is flustered to hell and back thinking about boys, and that's about all the jokes you get across this premiere.    It's not bad, but it definitely starts wearing thin by the time credits roll, and the sooner the show can introduce more material to build its gags around, the better. This creator has shown before that he can make charming low-key ensemble comedies, and there's certainly enough characters to facilitate that. It just needs to either introduce a stronger comedic hook, or delve more into its setting to get there.       James Beckett  Rating:               Man, I wanted to like In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki, since I'm already such a big fan of author Soichiro Yamamoto's other series, Teasing Master Takagi-san. However, I was definitely not inspired to get my hopes up when I saw the key art and trailers for this new series, which made it look like it was the kind of pandering and fanservice-driven comedy that I'm usually not too keen on. And look, let's get it out of the way up front: If you get skeeved out when a show puts a whole heck of a lot of the camera's focus on the exposed bellies and feet of young girls, thenIn the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki isn't going to be for you. The show is never so crass as to straight-up crash zoom on any of the characters' crotches or anything, but you'd have to be blind to not notice how much effort this series has gone towards putting a literal village full of tween girls into the most revealing ninja outfits that it can manage without knocking itself into an Adults Only timeslot (or a government watch-list, for that matter).    Even if you were to ignore the questionable designs and costume choices of the entire cast, not to mention all of the shots that are specifically designed to highlight the girls' toes and bellybuttons, the biggest issue with In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki would remain: It just isn't very funny. The whole show revolves around precisely one joke, which is that Tsubaki and her fellow lady ninjas hail from a reclusive clan that has managed to live in complete isolation from any men for years, to the point that all of the children treat the very concept of a “man” as some sort of hilarious cryptozoological prank. This is a trope that has been played both straight and as comedic fodder for literally a hundred years or more, from the pages of the sleaziest pulp magazine stories to the hackiest TV sitcoms. It isn't an inherently awful trope, mind you, but it's been played out to the degree that you have to get really creative with it if you want to be successful.    In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki is not really creative about anything it does, and if it weren't for the admittedly slick and entertaining production values, you'd be forgiven for mistaking the series for some bargain bin sex-comedy OVA that's been buried in someone's old VHS stash for the past thirty years. Each of the three main characters has exactly one character trait apiece, and none of them make for great comedy: Tsubaki is the all-star ninja who has become so obsessed with the idea of meeting a guy that she can't do her job anymore, Sazanka is the obsessive scamp who can't keep her hands/feet/body off of Tsubaki, and Asagao is…I guess she's the dumb one? I don't know. The show is too busy making lazy double entendre puns and repeating the same joke about Tsubaki's overflowing horniness to bother communicating anything else to its audience.    That's the thing about this preview: It could very well be that there is a genuinely funny and endearing comedy hiding somewhere underneath all of the lazy writing and questionable artistic decisions, but if that version of In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki does exist, this first episode certainly didn't do a great job of advertising it. I'll stick to Takagi-san, thank you very much. Consider this one of the season's biggest disappointments.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               It's entirely possible that In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki is trying to be a sort of light riff on that period of adolescence when some people become obsessed with whatever gender(s) they're attracted to. In fact, I highly suspect that's the case – in a world where ninja schools are segregated by gender, the guiding principle of the girls' school seems to be that men are like ticks – something best avoided and, in this case, often found outside. But because people are people, the harping on how awful men are has had the effect that the girls are all fully obsessed with them, something that ranges from “deliciously grossed out” to “fluttery feelings in the chest.” While most of the girls fall into the first category, our eponymous heroine is firmly in the second, but because her teacher is so down on men, she thinks that liking them must mean that there's something wrong with her. Hijinks ensue.    I'm not sure what point exactly this episode is trying to make or what mood it's hoping to strike. We have a yuri-bait character in Sazanka, who is more attached to Tsubaki than she perhaps should be, we have plenty of cute girl designs and young women in various states of undress (or rather, clothing that doesn't cover much), and we have Tsubaki who is plainly attracted to men despite having never seen one. Presumably it's all meant to be funny, but it doesn't quite manage it, in part because even when the story hits on something amusing, it's promptly used as many times as possible in the moments following its introduction. Even if you've never seen a man you can surely use your imagination to come up with more than the oft-repeated “smelly, doesn't bathe, big bodies but weak in the crotch” that's practically the theme song of this episode. There are more ways to describe the Loch Ness Monster, for goodness' sake. It feels like someone thought the concept (and that repeated statement) is a lot funnier than it actually is.    On the other hand, this is a different approach to the CGCT genre, so if you're interested in a variation on that theme, this may be worth checking out. Bobble-head look of the character designs aside, it doesn't look awful, and if the attempt to show how far the girls can jump ends up looking more like they're flying on invisible brooms, well, I at least appreciate the effort. But it really needs to find more than one joke to hang its hat on, because this one gets old quickly.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review                Odd Taxi: In the Woods   Apr 17, 00:00                 anime    By cleverly reframing its narrative around a series of interviews with the supporting cast, Odd Taxi: In the Woods succeeds where most recap films fail: it's an artistically cohesive film in its own right. ― Odd Taxi was 2021's sleeper anime hit, telling an intricate, original mystery that kept viewers guessing every week.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki   Apr 10th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki ?                     Community score: 3.6              What is this?   Tsubaki Kunoichi is the best student in her kunoichi school. She lives in a village of women with the rule that they cannot have contact with men. However, she has a curiosity about men that she cannot reveal.    In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki is based on Sōichirō Yamamoto's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Boy, Sōichirō Yamamoto's artstyle is not working here. The author of Teasing Master Takagi-san's signature style of cute characters with big noggins and fiveheads may work for realistic slice-of-life romantic comedies, but combined with The Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki's bare-midriff costume designs, it kind of gives things a “sexy baby” vibe. When you add that to the core concept of a teenage girl who's starting to develop an obsession with men despite never having seen one in her life, things get pretty awkward.    I'm willing to buy that despite appearances, Tsubaki and her florally named cohorts are of an age where developing an interest in boys is normal and natural and, with that in mind, the series does have some charm. It gives things kind of a dueling summer camps vibe, where teens are segregated by sex but also desperate to catch a glimpse of one another. Adolescence is a hell of a drug, after all, and while not every girl develops an all-consuming obsession with boys, quite a few of them do at some point or another. Plus, the banter between the girls was pretty cute, whether it be about guys or other topics. The way they kept repeating the same factoids they'd learned from one another for lack of any other kind of information made me chuckle. I half-expected one to bust out, “Boys go to Jupiter to get more stupider” at some point.    It does beg the question: if these girls have literally never seen a man, and all they know is that they're big and smelly and have weak crotches, why would their hormones still go toward them? (Instead of being sublimated to more immediately available and familiar targets, if you catch my drift) It's one thing when you're around boys, but mostly spend time with other girls, and suddenly you start wanting to know about this mysterious other sex; it's another thing when they're basically cryptids.    One last thing in Kunoichi Tsubaki's defense: the show uses the word “otoko,” which is closer in meaning to “male” than to “man” or “men.” The choice to use “men” for the translation instead of “boys” makes it seem like these young girls are lusting after adult men, rather than their peers. With that in mind, things get a lot less creepy. Still a little weird, but not nearly as actively uncomfortable.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Look. I understand what this show is trying to do. The joke is that we have a girl going through puberty who is basically “boy crazy.” Yet, she's surrounded by nothing but girls and has been taught from birth that men are basically monsters (but, importantly, ones that can be defeated with a well-aimed shot to the crotch). She has no one to talk to about her burgeoning sexuality and is trying to keep all these newfound feelings inside—though they keep bursting to the surface whenever she so much as thinks of something even tangentially related to men.    Unfortunately, I am unable to suspend disbelief when it comes to the core concept of the show. If you've never seen a man, think that they are disgusting, inhuman beings, and know nothing about sex and men's role in it, why would you be sexually aroused by them? I mean, she can't even form a mental picture of a man because all she knows about men comes from what her teacher has told them to scare them.    It would be one thing if she were captivated by the unknown—enticed by the taboo nature of meeting a man. After all, most teens rebel at some point and do things they are not supposed to do for the rush of it. But that's not what we are seeing with Tsubaki. She's basically sexually attracted to the concept of men—and an incredibly unflattering concept at that. I think she's going to be disappointed when she finds out that men are actually a lot like women—only with more hair and muscles.    Now, I may be overthinking things (but in my own defense, that's literally what I am paid to do). However, that doesn't change the fact that every time Tsubaki goes to mush thinking about men, I find it annoying instead of cute and silly, and her teammates (one “aggressively lesbian” and the other a lazy glutton) didn't add much to the story beyond being walking plot devices. In the end, this anime is basically a non-starter. Consider me thoroughly not entertained.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               This is a bit of a weird one. If you couldn't tell from the size of these characters' foreheads, this is from the same mangaka as Teasing Master Takagi-san, and while it features a similar style of soft and silly humor based around the awkward pangs of early puberty, instead of a typical high-school romcom we get this whole apparatus of a girls-only ninja-in-training village and multiple teams of anime girls throwing shuriken and using ninjutsu. It's a way more complex setting for a similar effect, but it does add a bit of flavor to the whole thing.    It helps that the show just looks really nice. I don't know what magic Sōichirō Yamamoto worked to get two different gorgeously directed adaptations of his work, but that panache helps what might otherwise be pretty standard anime ninja shenanigans feel genuinely fun. These characters move with a ton of energy and spark, the short action sequences are solid, but the real treat is the wonderful environmental work during Tsubaki's nighttime excursion into the woods. The daytime scenes are a bit more pedestrian, but still do well to give this big ol' gaggle of kunoichi the energy you'd expect from kids, even ones training to be ninja. The character designs – specifically the cast's clothing, or lack thereof – are a bit of a red flag, but as of this episode the direction hasn't dipped into anything sexualizing. The closest it gets is Tsubaki blushing over the thought of seeing a b-b-b-boy, but you'd have to stretch pretty far to call that cheesecake.    As for the setup itself, it does feel a bit too contrived at the start, but by the end of the episode we wind up in the same sort of place as like, kids' summer camp movies. You know, it's a sleep-away camp out in the woods, and there's all-girls and all-boys camps on either side of a big lake. They get into adventures trying to sneak over to see the other camp, and eventually there's a big competition at the End of Summer. I don't imagine these competing(?) ninja schools will have a river raft race or a competitive pie eating contest, but you never know. It all mostly winds up as fodder for jokes about kids who don't know anything about boys spreading rumors and theories, including one girl who very clearly heard about dudes getting kicked in the balls and spends the entire rest of the episode telling all her friends about it to seem cool. Tsubaki herself is flustered to hell and back thinking about boys, and that's about all the jokes you get across this premiere.    It's not bad, but it definitely starts wearing thin by the time credits roll, and the sooner the show can introduce more material to build its gags around, the better. This creator has shown before that he can make charming low-key ensemble comedies, and there's certainly enough characters to facilitate that. It just needs to either introduce a stronger comedic hook, or delve more into its setting to get there.       James Beckett  Rating:               Man, I wanted to like In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki, since I'm already such a big fan of author Soichiro Yamamoto's other series, Teasing Master Takagi-san. However, I was definitely not inspired to get my hopes up when I saw the key art and trailers for this new series, which made it look like it was the kind of pandering and fanservice-driven comedy that I'm usually not too keen on. And look, let's get it out of the way up front: If you get skeeved out when a show puts a whole heck of a lot of the camera's focus on the exposed bellies and feet of young girls, thenIn the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki isn't going to be for you. The show is never so crass as to straight-up crash zoom on any of the characters' crotches or anything, but you'd have to be blind to not notice how much effort this series has gone towards putting a literal village full of tween girls into the most revealing ninja outfits that it can manage without knocking itself into an Adults Only timeslot (or a government watch-list, for that matter).    Even if you were to ignore the questionable designs and costume choices of the entire cast, not to mention all of the shots that are specifically designed to highlight the girls' toes and bellybuttons, the biggest issue with In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki would remain: It just isn't very funny. The whole show revolves around precisely one joke, which is that Tsubaki and her fellow lady ninjas hail from a reclusive clan that has managed to live in complete isolation from any men for years, to the point that all of the children treat the very concept of a “man” as some sort of hilarious cryptozoological prank. This is a trope that has been played both straight and as comedic fodder for literally a hundred years or more, from the pages of the sleaziest pulp magazine stories to the hackiest TV sitcoms. It isn't an inherently awful trope, mind you, but it's been played out to the degree that you have to get really creative with it if you want to be successful.    In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki is not really creative about anything it does, and if it weren't for the admittedly slick and entertaining production values, you'd be forgiven for mistaking the series for some bargain bin sex-comedy OVA that's been buried in someone's old VHS stash for the past thirty years. Each of the three main characters has exactly one character trait apiece, and none of them make for great comedy: Tsubaki is the all-star ninja who has become so obsessed with the idea of meeting a guy that she can't do her job anymore, Sazanka is the obsessive scamp who can't keep her hands/feet/body off of Tsubaki, and Asagao is…I guess she's the dumb one? I don't know. The show is too busy making lazy double entendre puns and repeating the same joke about Tsubaki's overflowing horniness to bother communicating anything else to its audience.    That's the thing about this preview: It could very well be that there is a genuinely funny and endearing comedy hiding somewhere underneath all of the lazy writing and questionable artistic decisions, but if that version of In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki does exist, this first episode certainly didn't do a great job of advertising it. I'll stick to Takagi-san, thank you very much. Consider this one of the season's biggest disappointments.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               It's entirely possible that In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki is trying to be a sort of light riff on that period of adolescence when some people become obsessed with whatever gender(s) they're attracted to. In fact, I highly suspect that's the case – in a world where ninja schools are segregated by gender, the guiding principle of the girls' school seems to be that men are like ticks – something best avoided and, in this case, often found outside. But because people are people, the harping on how awful men are has had the effect that the girls are all fully obsessed with them, something that ranges from “deliciously grossed out” to “fluttery feelings in the chest.” While most of the girls fall into the first category, our eponymous heroine is firmly in the second, but because her teacher is so down on men, she thinks that liking them must mean that there's something wrong with her. Hijinks ensue.    I'm not sure what point exactly this episode is trying to make or what mood it's hoping to strike. We have a yuri-bait character in Sazanka, who is more attached to Tsubaki than she perhaps should be, we have plenty of cute girl designs and young women in various states of undress (or rather, clothing that doesn't cover much), and we have Tsubaki who is plainly attracted to men despite having never seen one. Presumably it's all meant to be funny, but it doesn't quite manage it, in part because even when the story hits on something amusing, it's promptly used as many times as possible in the moments following its introduction. Even if you've never seen a man you can surely use your imagination to come up with more than the oft-repeated “smelly, doesn't bathe, big bodies but weak in the crotch” that's practically the theme song of this episode. There are more ways to describe the Loch Ness Monster, for goodness' sake. It feels like someone thought the concept (and that repeated statement) is a lot funnier than it actually is.    On the other hand, this is a different approach to the CGCT genre, so if you're interested in a variation on that theme, this may be worth checking out. Bobble-head look of the character designs aside, it doesn't look awful, and if the attempt to show how far the girls can jump ends up looking more like they're flying on invisible brooms, well, I at least appreciate the effort. But it really needs to find more than one joke to hang its hat on, because this one gets old quickly.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review                Odd Taxi: In the Woods   Apr 17, 00:00                 anime    By cleverly reframing its narrative around a series of interviews with the supporting cast, Odd Taxi: In the Woods succeeds where most recap films fail: it's an artistically cohesive film in its own right. ― Odd Taxi was 2021's sleeper anime hit, telling an intricate, original mystery that kept viewers guessing every week.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki   Apr 10th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki ?                     Community score: 3.6              What is this?   Tsubaki Kunoichi is the best student in her kunoichi school. She lives in a village of women with the rule that they cannot have contact with men. However, she has a curiosity about men that she cannot reveal.    In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki is based on Sōichirō Yamamoto's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Boy, Sōichirō Yamamoto's artstyle is not working here. The author of Teasing Master Takagi-san's signature style of cute characters with big noggins and fiveheads may work for realistic slice-of-life romantic comedies, but combined with The Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki's bare-midriff costume designs, it kind of gives things a “sexy baby” vibe. When you add that to the core concept of a teenage girl who's starting to develop an obsession with men despite never having seen one in her life, things get pretty awkward.    I'm willing to buy that despite appearances, Tsubaki and her florally named cohorts are of an age where developing an interest in boys is normal and natural and, with that in mind, the series does have some charm. It gives things kind of a dueling summer camps vibe, where teens are segregated by sex but also desperate to catch a glimpse of one another. Adolescence is a hell of a drug, after all, and while not every girl develops an all-consuming obsession with boys, quite a few of them do at some point or another. Plus, the banter between the girls was pretty cute, whether it be about guys or other topics. The way they kept repeating the same factoids they'd learned from one another for lack of any other kind of information made me chuckle. I half-expected one to bust out, “Boys go to Jupiter to get more stupider” at some point.    It does beg the question: if these girls have literally never seen a man, and all they know is that they're big and smelly and have weak crotches, why would their hormones still go toward them? (Instead of being sublimated to more immediately available and familiar targets, if you catch my drift) It's one thing when you're around boys, but mostly spend time with other girls, and suddenly you start wanting to know about this mysterious other sex; it's another thing when they're basically cryptids.    One last thing in Kunoichi Tsubaki's defense: the show uses the word “otoko,” which is closer in meaning to “male” than to “man” or “men.” The choice to use “men” for the translation instead of “boys” makes it seem like these young girls are lusting after adult men, rather than their peers. With that in mind, things get a lot less creepy. Still a little weird, but not nearly as actively uncomfortable.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Look. I understand what this show is trying to do. The joke is that we have a girl going through puberty who is basically “boy crazy.” Yet, she's surrounded by nothing but girls and has been taught from birth that men are basically monsters (but, importantly, ones that can be defeated with a well-aimed shot to the crotch). She has no one to talk to about her burgeoning sexuality and is trying to keep all these newfound feelings inside—though they keep bursting to the surface whenever she so much as thinks of something even tangentially related to men.    Unfortunately, I am unable to suspend disbelief when it comes to the core concept of the show. If you've never seen a man, think that they are disgusting, inhuman beings, and know nothing about sex and men's role in it, why would you be sexually aroused by them? I mean, she can't even form a mental picture of a man because all she knows about men comes from what her teacher has told them to scare them.    It would be one thing if she were captivated by the unknown—enticed by the taboo nature of meeting a man. After all, most teens rebel at some point and do things they are not supposed to do for the rush of it. But that's not what we are seeing with Tsubaki. She's basically sexually attracted to the concept of men—and an incredibly unflattering concept at that. I think she's going to be disappointed when she finds out that men are actually a lot like women—only with more hair and muscles.    Now, I may be overthinking things (but in my own defense, that's literally what I am paid to do). However, that doesn't change the fact that every time Tsubaki goes to mush thinking about men, I find it annoying instead of cute and silly, and her teammates (one “aggressively lesbian” and the other a lazy glutton) didn't add much to the story beyond being walking plot devices. In the end, this anime is basically a non-starter. Consider me thoroughly not entertained.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               This is a bit of a weird one. If you couldn't tell from the size of these characters' foreheads, this is from the same mangaka as Teasing Master Takagi-san, and while it features a similar style of soft and silly humor based around the awkward pangs of early puberty, instead of a typical high-school romcom we get this whole apparatus of a girls-only ninja-in-training village and multiple teams of anime girls throwing shuriken and using ninjutsu. It's a way more complex setting for a similar effect, but it does add a bit of flavor to the whole thing.    It helps that the show just looks really nice. I don't know what magic Sōichirō Yamamoto worked to get two different gorgeously directed adaptations of his work, but that panache helps what might otherwise be pretty standard anime ninja shenanigans feel genuinely fun. These characters move with a ton of energy and spark, the short action sequences are solid, but the real treat is the wonderful environmental work during Tsubaki's nighttime excursion into the woods. The daytime scenes are a bit more pedestrian, but still do well to give this big ol' gaggle of kunoichi the energy you'd expect from kids, even ones training to be ninja. The character designs – specifically the cast's clothing, or lack thereof – are a bit of a red flag, but as of this episode the direction hasn't dipped into anything sexualizing. The closest it gets is Tsubaki blushing over the thought of seeing a b-b-b-boy, but you'd have to stretch pretty far to call that cheesecake.    As for the setup itself, it does feel a bit too contrived at the start, but by the end of the episode we wind up in the same sort of place as like, kids' summer camp movies. You know, it's a sleep-away camp out in the woods, and there's all-girls and all-boys camps on either side of a big lake. They get into adventures trying to sneak over to see the other camp, and eventually there's a big competition at the End of Summer. I don't imagine these competing(?) ninja schools will have a river raft race or a competitive pie eating contest, but you never know. It all mostly winds up as fodder for jokes about kids who don't know anything about boys spreading rumors and theories, including one girl who very clearly heard about dudes getting kicked in the balls and spends the entire rest of the episode telling all her friends about it to seem cool. Tsubaki herself is flustered to hell and back thinking about boys, and that's about all the jokes you get across this premiere.    It's not bad, but it definitely starts wearing thin by the time credits roll, and the sooner the show can introduce more material to build its gags around, the better. This creator has shown before that he can make charming low-key ensemble comedies, and there's certainly enough characters to facilitate that. It just needs to either introduce a stronger comedic hook, or delve more into its setting to get there.       James Beckett  Rating:               Man, I wanted to like In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki, since I'm already such a big fan of author Soichiro Yamamoto's other series, Teasing Master Takagi-san. However, I was definitely not inspired to get my hopes up when I saw the key art and trailers for this new series, which made it look like it was the kind of pandering and fanservice-driven comedy that I'm usually not too keen on. And look, let's get it out of the way up front: If you get skeeved out when a show puts a whole heck of a lot of the camera's focus on the exposed bellies and feet of young girls, thenIn the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki isn't going to be for you. The show is never so crass as to straight-up crash zoom on any of the characters' crotches or anything, but you'd have to be blind to not notice how much effort this series has gone towards putting a literal village full of tween girls into the most revealing ninja outfits that it can manage without knocking itself into an Adults Only timeslot (or a government watch-list, for that matter).    Even if you were to ignore the questionable designs and costume choices of the entire cast, not to mention all of the shots that are specifically designed to highlight the girls' toes and bellybuttons, the biggest issue with In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki would remain: It just isn't very funny. The whole show revolves around precisely one joke, which is that Tsubaki and her fellow lady ninjas hail from a reclusive clan that has managed to live in complete isolation from any men for years, to the point that all of the children treat the very concept of a “man” as some sort of hilarious cryptozoological prank. This is a trope that has been played both straight and as comedic fodder for literally a hundred years or more, from the pages of the sleaziest pulp magazine stories to the hackiest TV sitcoms. It isn't an inherently awful trope, mind you, but it's been played out to the degree that you have to get really creative with it if you want to be successful.    In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki is not really creative about anything it does, and if it weren't for the admittedly slick and entertaining production values, you'd be forgiven for mistaking the series for some bargain bin sex-comedy OVA that's been buried in someone's old VHS stash for the past thirty years. Each of the three main characters has exactly one character trait apiece, and none of them make for great comedy: Tsubaki is the all-star ninja who has become so obsessed with the idea of meeting a guy that she can't do her job anymore, Sazanka is the obsessive scamp who can't keep her hands/feet/body off of Tsubaki, and Asagao is…I guess she's the dumb one? I don't know. The show is too busy making lazy double entendre puns and repeating the same joke about Tsubaki's overflowing horniness to bother communicating anything else to its audience.    That's the thing about this preview: It could very well be that there is a genuinely funny and endearing comedy hiding somewhere underneath all of the lazy writing and questionable artistic decisions, but if that version of In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki does exist, this first episode certainly didn't do a great job of advertising it. I'll stick to Takagi-san, thank you very much. Consider this one of the season's biggest disappointments.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               It's entirely possible that In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki is trying to be a sort of light riff on that period of adolescence when some people become obsessed with whatever gender(s) they're attracted to. In fact, I highly suspect that's the case – in a world where ninja schools are segregated by gender, the guiding principle of the girls' school seems to be that men are like ticks – something best avoided and, in this case, often found outside. But because people are people, the harping on how awful men are has had the effect that the girls are all fully obsessed with them, something that ranges from “deliciously grossed out” to “fluttery feelings in the chest.” While most of the girls fall into the first category, our eponymous heroine is firmly in the second, but because her teacher is so down on men, she thinks that liking them must mean that there's something wrong with her. Hijinks ensue.    I'm not sure what point exactly this episode is trying to make or what mood it's hoping to strike. We have a yuri-bait character in Sazanka, who is more attached to Tsubaki than she perhaps should be, we have plenty of cute girl designs and young women in various states of undress (or rather, clothing that doesn't cover much), and we have Tsubaki who is plainly attracted to men despite having never seen one. Presumably it's all meant to be funny, but it doesn't quite manage it, in part because even when the story hits on something amusing, it's promptly used as many times as possible in the moments following its introduction. Even if you've never seen a man you can surely use your imagination to come up with more than the oft-repeated “smelly, doesn't bathe, big bodies but weak in the crotch” that's practically the theme song of this episode. There are more ways to describe the Loch Ness Monster, for goodness' sake. It feels like someone thought the concept (and that repeated statement) is a lot funnier than it actually is.    On the other hand, this is a different approach to the CGCT genre, so if you're interested in a variation on that theme, this may be worth checking out. Bobble-head look of the character designs aside, it doesn't look awful, and if the attempt to show how far the girls can jump ends up looking more like they're flying on invisible brooms, well, I at least appreciate the effort. But it really needs to find more than one joke to hang its hat on, because this one gets old quickly.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review                Odd Taxi: In the Woods   Apr 17, 00:00                 anime    By cleverly reframing its narrative around a series of interviews with the supporting cast, Odd Taxi: In the Woods succeeds where most recap films fail: it's an artistically cohesive film in its own right. ― Odd Taxi was 2021's sleeper anime hit, telling an intricate, original mystery that kept viewers guessing every week.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki   Apr 10th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki ?                     Community score: 3.6              What is this?   Tsubaki Kunoichi is the best student in her kunoichi school. She lives in a village of women with the rule that they cannot have contact with men. However, she has a curiosity about men that she cannot reveal.    In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki is based on Sōichirō Yamamoto's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Boy, Sōichirō Yamamoto's artstyle is not working here. The author of Teasing Master Takagi-san's signature style of cute characters with big noggins and fiveheads may work for realistic slice-of-life romantic comedies, but combined with The Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki's bare-midriff costume designs, it kind of gives things a “sexy baby” vibe. When you add that to the core concept of a teenage girl who's starting to develop an obsession with men despite never having seen one in her life, things get pretty awkward.    I'm willing to buy that despite appearances, Tsubaki and her florally named cohorts are of an age where developing an interest in boys is normal and natural and, with that in mind, the series does have some charm. It gives things kind of a dueling summer camps vibe, where teens are segregated by sex but also desperate to catch a glimpse of one another. Adolescence is a hell of a drug, after all, and while not every girl develops an all-consuming obsession with boys, quite a few of them do at some point or another. Plus, the banter between the girls was pretty cute, whether it be about guys or other topics. The way they kept repeating the same factoids they'd learned from one another for lack of any other kind of information made me chuckle. I half-expected one to bust out, “Boys go to Jupiter to get more stupider” at some point.    It does beg the question: if these girls have literally never seen a man, and all they know is that they're big and smelly and have weak crotches, why would their hormones still go toward them? (Instead of being sublimated to more immediately available and familiar targets, if you catch my drift) It's one thing when you're around boys, but mostly spend time with other girls, and suddenly you start wanting to know about this mysterious other sex; it's another thing when they're basically cryptids.    One last thing in Kunoichi Tsubaki's defense: the show uses the word “otoko,” which is closer in meaning to “male” than to “man” or “men.” The choice to use “men” for the translation instead of “boys” makes it seem like these young girls are lusting after adult men, rather than their peers. With that in mind, things get a lot less creepy. Still a little weird, but not nearly as actively uncomfortable.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Look. I understand what this show is trying to do. The joke is that we have a girl going through puberty who is basically “boy crazy.” Yet, she's surrounded by nothing but girls and has been taught from birth that men are basically monsters (but, importantly, ones that can be defeated with a well-aimed shot to the crotch). She has no one to talk to about her burgeoning sexuality and is trying to keep all these newfound feelings inside—though they keep bursting to the surface whenever she so much as thinks of something even tangentially related to men.    Unfortunately, I am unable to suspend disbelief when it comes to the core concept of the show. If you've never seen a man, think that they are disgusting, inhuman beings, and know nothing about sex and men's role in it, why would you be sexually aroused by them? I mean, she can't even form a mental picture of a man because all she knows about men comes from what her teacher has told them to scare them.    It would be one thing if she were captivated by the unknown—enticed by the taboo nature of meeting a man. After all, most teens rebel at some point and do things they are not supposed to do for the rush of it. But that's not what we are seeing with Tsubaki. She's basically sexually attracted to the concept of men—and an incredibly unflattering concept at that. I think she's going to be disappointed when she finds out that men are actually a lot like women—only with more hair and muscles.    Now, I may be overthinking things (but in my own defense, that's literally what I am paid to do). However, that doesn't change the fact that every time Tsubaki goes to mush thinking about men, I find it annoying instead of cute and silly, and her teammates (one “aggressively lesbian” and the other a lazy glutton) didn't add much to the story beyond being walking plot devices. In the end, this anime is basically a non-starter. Consider me thoroughly not entertained.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               This is a bit of a weird one. If you couldn't tell from the size of these characters' foreheads, this is from the same mangaka as Teasing Master Takagi-san, and while it features a similar style of soft and silly humor based around the awkward pangs of early puberty, instead of a typical high-school romcom we get this whole apparatus of a girls-only ninja-in-training village and multiple teams of anime girls throwing shuriken and using ninjutsu. It's a way more complex setting for a similar effect, but it does add a bit of flavor to the whole thing.    It helps that the show just looks really nice. I don't know what magic Sōichirō Yamamoto worked to get two different gorgeously directed adaptations of his work, but that panache helps what might otherwise be pretty standard anime ninja shenanigans feel genuinely fun. These characters move with a ton of energy and spark, the short action sequences are solid, but the real treat is the wonderful environmental work during Tsubaki's nighttime excursion into the woods. The daytime scenes are a bit more pedestrian, but still do well to give this big ol' gaggle of kunoichi the energy you'd expect from kids, even ones training to be ninja. The character designs – specifically the cast's clothing, or lack thereof – are a bit of a red flag, but as of this episode the direction hasn't dipped into anything sexualizing. The closest it gets is Tsubaki blushing over the thought of seeing a b-b-b-boy, but you'd have to stretch pretty far to call that cheesecake.    As for the setup itself, it does feel a bit too contrived at the start, but by the end of the episode we wind up in the same sort of place as like, kids' summer camp movies. You know, it's a sleep-away camp out in the woods, and there's all-girls and all-boys camps on either side of a big lake. They get into adventures trying to sneak over to see the other camp, and eventually there's a big competition at the End of Summer. I don't imagine these competing(?) ninja schools will have a river raft race or a competitive pie eating contest, but you never know. It all mostly winds up as fodder for jokes about kids who don't know anything about boys spreading rumors and theories, including one girl who very clearly heard about dudes getting kicked in the balls and spends the entire rest of the episode telling all her friends about it to seem cool. Tsubaki herself is flustered to hell and back thinking about boys, and that's about all the jokes you get across this premiere.    It's not bad, but it definitely starts wearing thin by the time credits roll, and the sooner the show can introduce more material to build its gags around, the better. This creator has shown before that he can make charming low-key ensemble comedies, and there's certainly enough characters to facilitate that. It just needs to either introduce a stronger comedic hook, or delve more into its setting to get there.       James Beckett  Rating:               Man, I wanted to like In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki, since I'm already such a big fan of author Soichiro Yamamoto's other series, Teasing Master Takagi-san. However, I was definitely not inspired to get my hopes up when I saw the key art and trailers for this new series, which made it look like it was the kind of pandering and fanservice-driven comedy that I'm usually not too keen on. And look, let's get it out of the way up front: If you get skeeved out when a show puts a whole heck of a lot of the camera's focus on the exposed bellies and feet of young girls, thenIn the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki isn't going to be for you. The show is never so crass as to straight-up crash zoom on any of the characters' crotches or anything, but you'd have to be blind to not notice how much effort this series has gone towards putting a literal village full of tween girls into the most revealing ninja outfits that it can manage without knocking itself into an Adults Only timeslot (or a government watch-list, for that matter).    Even if you were to ignore the questionable designs and costume choices of the entire cast, not to mention all of the shots that are specifically designed to highlight the girls' toes and bellybuttons, the biggest issue with In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki would remain: It just isn't very funny. The whole show revolves around precisely one joke, which is that Tsubaki and her fellow lady ninjas hail from a reclusive clan that has managed to live in complete isolation from any men for years, to the point that all of the children treat the very concept of a “man” as some sort of hilarious cryptozoological prank. This is a trope that has been played both straight and as comedic fodder for literally a hundred years or more, from the pages of the sleaziest pulp magazine stories to the hackiest TV sitcoms. It isn't an inherently awful trope, mind you, but it's been played out to the degree that you have to get really creative with it if you want to be successful.    In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki is not really creative about anything it does, and if it weren't for the admittedly slick and entertaining production values, you'd be forgiven for mistaking the series for some bargain bin sex-comedy OVA that's been buried in someone's old VHS stash for the past thirty years. Each of the three main characters has exactly one character trait apiece, and none of them make for great comedy: Tsubaki is the all-star ninja who has become so obsessed with the idea of meeting a guy that she can't do her job anymore, Sazanka is the obsessive scamp who can't keep her hands/feet/body off of Tsubaki, and Asagao is…I guess she's the dumb one? I don't know. The show is too busy making lazy double entendre puns and repeating the same joke about Tsubaki's overflowing horniness to bother communicating anything else to its audience.    That's the thing about this preview: It could very well be that there is a genuinely funny and endearing comedy hiding somewhere underneath all of the lazy writing and questionable artistic decisions, but if that version of In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki does exist, this first episode certainly didn't do a great job of advertising it. I'll stick to Takagi-san, thank you very much. Consider this one of the season's biggest disappointments.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               It's entirely possible that In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki is trying to be a sort of light riff on that period of adolescence when some people become obsessed with whatever gender(s) they're attracted to. In fact, I highly suspect that's the case – in a world where ninja schools are segregated by gender, the guiding principle of the girls' school seems to be that men are like ticks – something best avoided and, in this case, often found outside. But because people are people, the harping on how awful men are has had the effect that the girls are all fully obsessed with them, something that ranges from “deliciously grossed out” to “fluttery feelings in the chest.” While most of the girls fall into the first category, our eponymous heroine is firmly in the second, but because her teacher is so down on men, she thinks that liking them must mean that there's something wrong with her. Hijinks ensue.    I'm not sure what point exactly this episode is trying to make or what mood it's hoping to strike. We have a yuri-bait character in Sazanka, who is more attached to Tsubaki than she perhaps should be, we have plenty of cute girl designs and young women in various states of undress (or rather, clothing that doesn't cover much), and we have Tsubaki who is plainly attracted to men despite having never seen one. Presumably it's all meant to be funny, but it doesn't quite manage it, in part because even when the story hits on something amusing, it's promptly used as many times as possible in the moments following its introduction. Even if you've never seen a man you can surely use your imagination to come up with more than the oft-repeated “smelly, doesn't bathe, big bodies but weak in the crotch” that's practically the theme song of this episode. There are more ways to describe the Loch Ness Monster, for goodness' sake. It feels like someone thought the concept (and that repeated statement) is a lot funnier than it actually is.    On the other hand, this is a different approach to the CGCT genre, so if you're interested in a variation on that theme, this may be worth checking out. Bobble-head look of the character designs aside, it doesn't look awful, and if the attempt to show how far the girls can jump ends up looking more like they're flying on invisible brooms, well, I at least appreciate the effort. But it really needs to find more than one joke to hang its hat on, because this one gets old quickly.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

The whole show revolves around precisely one joke, which is that Tsubaki and her fellow lady ninjas hail from a reclusive clan that has managed to live in complete isolation from any men for years, to the point that all of the children treat the very concept of a “man” as some sort of hilarious cryptozoological prank. This is a trope that has been played both straight and as comedic fodder for literally a hundred years or more, from the pages of the sleaziest pulp magazine stories to the hackiest TV sitcoms. It isn't an inherently awful trope, mind you, but it's been played out to the degree that you have to get really creative with it if you want to be successful.    In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki is not really creative about anything it does, and if it weren't for the admittedly slick and entertaining production values, you'd be forgiven for mistaking the series for some bargain bin sex-comedy OVA that's been buried in someone's old VHS stash for the past thirty years. Each of the three main characters has exactly one character trait apiece, and none of them make for great comedy: Tsubaki is the all-star ninja who has become so obsessed with the idea of meeting a guy that she can't do her job anymore, Sazanka is the obsessive scamp who can't keep her hands/feet/body off of Tsubaki, and Asagao is…I guess she's the dumb one? I don't know. The show is too busy making lazy double entendre puns and repeating the same joke about Tsubaki's overflowing horniness to bother communicating anything else to its audience.    That's the thing about this preview: It could very well be that there is a genuinely funny and endearing comedy hiding somewhere underneath all of the lazy writing and questionable artistic decisions, but if that version of In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki does exist, this first episode certainly didn't do a great job of advertising it. I'll stick to Takagi-san, thank you very much. Consider this one of the season's biggest disappointments.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               It's entirely possible that In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki is trying to be a sort of light riff on that period of adolescence when some people become obsessed with whatever gender(s) they're attracted to. In fact, I highly suspect that's the case – in a world where ninja schools are segregated by gender, the guiding principle of the girls' school seems to be that men are like ticks – something best avoided and, in this case, often found outside. But because people are people, the harping on how awful men are has had the effect that the girls are all fully obsessed with them, something that ranges from “deliciously grossed out” to “fluttery feelings in the chest.” While most of the girls fall into the first category, our eponymous heroine is firmly in the second, but because her teacher is so down on men, she thinks that liking them must mean that there's something wrong with her. Hijinks ensue.    I'm not sure what point exactly this episode is trying to make or what mood it's hoping to strike. We have a yuri-bait character in Sazanka, who is more attached to Tsubaki than she perhaps should be, we have plenty of cute girl designs and young women in various states of undress (or rather, clothing that doesn't cover much), and we have Tsubaki who is plainly attracted to men despite having never seen one. Presumably it's all meant to be funny, but it doesn't quite manage it, in part because even when the story hits on something amusing, it's promptly used as many times as possible in the moments following its introduction. Even if you've never seen a man you can surely use your imagination to come up with more than the oft-repeated “smelly, doesn't bathe, big bodies but weak in the crotch” that's practically the theme song of this episode. There are more ways to describe the Loch Ness Monster, for goodness' sake. It feels like someone thought the concept (and that repeated statement) is a lot funnier than it actually is.    On the other hand, this is a different approach to the CGCT genre, so if you're interested in a variation on that theme, this may be worth checking out. Bobble-head look of the character designs aside, it doesn't look awful, and if the attempt to show how far the girls can jump ends up looking more like they're flying on invisible brooms, well, I at least appreciate the effort. But it really needs to find more than one joke to hang its hat on, because this one gets old quickly.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More     ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 3.6              What is this?   Tsubaki Kunoichi is the best student in her kunoichi school. She lives in a village of women with the rule that they cannot have contact with men. However, she has a curiosity about men that she cannot reveal.    In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki is based on Sōichirō Yamamoto's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Boy, Sōichirō Yamamoto's artstyle is not working here. The author of Teasing Master Takagi-san's signature style of cute characters with big noggins and fiveheads may work for realistic slice-of-life romantic comedies, but combined with The Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki's bare-midriff costume designs, it kind of gives things a “sexy baby” vibe. When you add that to the core concept of a teenage girl who's starting to develop an obsession with men despite never having seen one in her life, things get pretty awkward.    I'm willing to buy that despite appearances, Tsubaki and her florally named cohorts are of an age where developing an interest in boys is normal and natural and, with that in mind, the series does have some charm. It gives things kind of a dueling summer camps vibe, where teens are segregated by sex but also desperate to catch a glimpse of one another. Adolescence is a hell of a drug, after all, and while not every girl develops an all-consuming obsession with boys, quite a few of them do at some point or another. Plus, the banter between the girls was pretty cute, whether it be about guys or other topics. The way they kept repeating the same factoids they'd learned from one another for lack of any other kind of information made me chuckle. I half-expected one to bust out, “Boys go to Jupiter to get more stupider” at some point.    It does beg the question: if these girls have literally never seen a man, and all they know is that they're big and smelly and have weak crotches, why would their hormones still go toward them? (Instead of being sublimated to more immediately available and familiar targets, if you catch my drift) It's one thing when you're around boys, but mostly spend time with other girls, and suddenly you start wanting to know about this mysterious other sex; it's another thing when they're basically cryptids.    One last thing in Kunoichi Tsubaki's defense: the show uses the word “otoko,” which is closer in meaning to “male” than to “man” or “men.” The choice to use “men” for the translation instead of “boys” makes it seem like these young girls are lusting after adult men, rather than their peers. With that in mind, things get a lot less creepy. Still a little weird, but not nearly as actively uncomfortable.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Look. I understand what this show is trying to do. The joke is that we have a girl going through puberty who is basically “boy crazy.” Yet, she's surrounded by nothing but girls and has been taught from birth that men are basically monsters (but, importantly, ones that can be defeated with a well-aimed shot to the crotch). She has no one to talk to about her burgeoning sexuality and is trying to keep all these newfound feelings inside—though they keep bursting to the surface whenever she so much as thinks of something even tangentially related to men.    Unfortunately, I am unable to suspend disbelief when it comes to the core concept of the show. If you've never seen a man, think that they are disgusting, inhuman beings, and know nothing about sex and men's role in it, why would you be sexually aroused by them? I mean, she can't even form a mental picture of a man because all she knows about men comes from what her teacher has told them to scare them.    It would be one thing if she were captivated by the unknown—enticed by the taboo nature of meeting a man. After all, most teens rebel at some point and do things they are not supposed to do for the rush of it. But that's not what we are seeing with Tsubaki. She's basically sexually attracted to the concept of men—and an incredibly unflattering concept at that. I think she's going to be disappointed when she finds out that men are actually a lot like women—only with more hair and muscles.    Now, I may be overthinking things (but in my own defense, that's literally what I am paid to do). However, that doesn't change the fact that every time Tsubaki goes to mush thinking about men, I find it annoying instead of cute and silly, and her teammates (one “aggressively lesbian” and the other a lazy glutton) didn't add much to the story beyond being walking plot devices. In the end, this anime is basically a non-starter. Consider me thoroughly not entertained.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               This is a bit of a weird one. If you couldn't tell from the size of these characters' foreheads, this is from the same mangaka as Teasing Master Takagi-san, and while it features a similar style of soft and silly humor based around the awkward pangs of early puberty, instead of a typical high-school romcom we get this whole apparatus of a girls-only ninja-in-training village and multiple teams of anime girls throwing shuriken and using ninjutsu. It's a way more complex setting for a similar effect, but it does add a bit of flavor to the whole thing.    It helps that the show just looks really nice. I don't know what magic Sōichirō Yamamoto worked to get two different gorgeously directed adaptations of his work, but that panache helps what might otherwise be pretty standard anime ninja shenanigans feel genuinely fun. These characters move with a ton of energy and spark, the short action sequences are solid, but the real treat is the wonderful environmental work during Tsubaki's nighttime excursion into the woods. The daytime scenes are a bit more pedestrian, but still do well to give this big ol' gaggle of kunoichi the energy you'd expect from kids, even ones training to be ninja. The character designs – specifically the cast's clothing, or lack thereof – are a bit of a red flag, but as of this episode the direction hasn't dipped into anything sexualizing. The closest it gets is Tsubaki blushing over the thought of seeing a b-b-b-boy, but you'd have to stretch pretty far to call that cheesecake.    As for the setup itself, it does feel a bit too contrived at the start, but by the end of the episode we wind up in the same sort of place as like, kids' summer camp movies. You know, it's a sleep-away camp out in the woods, and there's all-girls and all-boys camps on either side of a big lake. They get into adventures trying to sneak over to see the other camp, and eventually there's a big competition at the End of Summer. I don't imagine these competing(?) ninja schools will have a river raft race or a competitive pie eating contest, but you never know. It all mostly winds up as fodder for jokes about kids who don't know anything about boys spreading rumors and theories, including one girl who very clearly heard about dudes getting kicked in the balls and spends the entire rest of the episode telling all her friends about it to seem cool. Tsubaki herself is flustered to hell and back thinking about boys, and that's about all the jokes you get across this premiere.    It's not bad, but it definitely starts wearing thin by the time credits roll, and the sooner the show can introduce more material to build its gags around, the better. This creator has shown before that he can make charming low-key ensemble comedies, and there's certainly enough characters to facilitate that. It just needs to either introduce a stronger comedic hook, or delve more into its setting to get there.       James Beckett  Rating:               Man, I wanted to like In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki, since I'm already such a big fan of author Soichiro Yamamoto's other series, Teasing Master Takagi-san. However, I was definitely not inspired to get my hopes up when I saw the key art and trailers for this new series, which made it look like it was the kind of pandering and fanservice-driven comedy that I'm usually not too keen on. And look, let's get it out of the way up front: If you get skeeved out when a show puts a whole heck of a lot of the camera's focus on the exposed bellies and feet of young girls, thenIn the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki isn't going to be for you. The show is never so crass as to straight-up crash zoom on any of the characters' crotches or anything, but you'd have to be blind to not notice how much effort this series has gone towards putting a literal village full of tween girls into the most revealing ninja outfits that it can manage without knocking itself into an Adults Only timeslot (or a government watch-list, for that matter).

We have a yuri-bait character in Sazanka, who is more attached to Tsubaki than she perhaps should be, we have plenty of cute girl designs and young women in various states of undress (or rather, clothing that doesn't cover much), and we have Tsubaki who is plainly attracted to men despite having never seen one. Presumably it's all meant to be funny, but it doesn't quite manage it, in part because even when the story hits on something amusing, it's promptly used as many times as possible in the moments following its introduction. Even if you've never seen a man you can surely use your imagination to come up with more than the oft-repeated “smelly, doesn't bathe, big bodies but weak in the crotch” that's practically the theme song of this episode. There are more ways to describe the Loch Ness Monster, for goodness' sake. It feels like someone thought the concept (and that repeated statement) is a lot funnier than it actually is.    On the other hand, this is a different approach to the CGCT genre, so if you're interested in a variation on that theme, this may be worth checking out. Bobble-head look of the character designs aside, it doesn't look awful, and if the attempt to show how far the girls can jump ends up looking more like they're flying on invisible brooms, well, I at least appreciate the effort. But it really needs to find more than one joke to hang its hat on, because this one gets old quickly.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives     ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"
17-04-2022,anime,3,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/preview-guide/2022/spring/in-the-heart-of-kunoichi-tsubaki/.183647,In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki - The Spring 2022 Preview Guide - Anime News Network:SEA,"                 How would you rate episode 1 of In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki ?                     Community score: 3.6              What is this?   Tsubaki Kunoichi is the best student in her kunoichi school. She lives in a village of women with the rule that they cannot have contact with men. However, she has a curiosity about men that she cannot reveal.    In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki is based on Sōichirō Yamamoto's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Boy, Sōichirō Yamamoto's artstyle is not working here. The author of Teasing Master Takagi-san's signature style of cute characters with big noggins and fiveheads may work for realistic slice-of-life romantic comedies, but combined with The Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki's bare-midriff costume designs, it kind of gives things a “sexy baby” vibe. When you add that to the core concept of a teenage girl who's starting to develop an obsession with men despite never having seen one in her life, things get pretty awkward.    I'm willing to buy that despite appearances, Tsubaki and her florally named cohorts are of an age where developing an interest in boys is normal and natural and, with that in mind, the series does have some charm. It gives things kind of a dueling summer camps vibe, where teens are segregated by sex but also desperate to catch a glimpse of one another. Adolescence is a hell of a drug, after all, and while not every girl develops an all-consuming obsession with boys, quite a few of them do at some point or another. Plus, the banter between the girls was pretty cute, whether it be about guys or other topics. The way they kept repeating the same factoids they'd learned from one another for lack of any other kind of information made me chuckle. I half-expected one to bust out, “Boys go to Jupiter to get more stupider” at some point.    It does beg the question: if these girls have literally never seen a man, and all they know is that they're big and smelly and have weak crotches, why would their hormones still go toward them? (Instead of being sublimated to more immediately available and familiar targets, if you catch my drift) It's one thing when you're around boys, but mostly spend time with other girls, and suddenly you start wanting to know about this mysterious other sex; it's another thing when they're basically cryptids.    One last thing in Kunoichi Tsubaki's defense: the show uses the word “otoko,” which is closer in meaning to “male” than to “man” or “men.” The choice to use “men” for the translation instead of “boys” makes it seem like these young girls are lusting after adult men, rather than their peers. With that in mind, things get a lot less creepy. Still a little weird, but not nearly as actively uncomfortable.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Look. I understand what this show is trying to do. The joke is that we have a girl going through puberty who is basically “boy crazy.” Yet, she's surrounded by nothing but girls and has been taught from birth that men are basically monsters (but, importantly, ones that can be defeated with a well-aimed shot to the crotch). She has no one to talk to about her burgeoning sexuality and is trying to keep all these newfound feelings inside—though they keep bursting to the surface whenever she so much as thinks of something even tangentially related to men.    Unfortunately, I am unable to suspend disbelief when it comes to the core concept of the show. If you've never seen a man, think that they are disgusting, inhuman beings, and know nothing about sex and men's role in it, why would you be sexually aroused by them? I mean, she can't even form a mental picture of a man because all she knows about men comes from what her teacher has told them to scare them.    It would be one thing if she were captivated by the unknown—enticed by the taboo nature of meeting a man. After all, most teens rebel at some point and do things they are not supposed to do for the rush of it. But that's not what we are seeing with Tsubaki. She's basically sexually attracted to the concept of men—and an incredibly unflattering concept at that. I think she's going to be disappointed when she finds out that men are actually a lot like women—only with more hair and muscles.    Now, I may be overthinking things (but in my own defense, that's literally what I am paid to do). However, that doesn't change the fact that every time Tsubaki goes to mush thinking about men, I find it annoying instead of cute and silly, and her teammates (one “aggressively lesbian” and the other a lazy glutton) didn't add much to the story beyond being walking plot devices. In the end, this anime is basically a non-starter. Consider me thoroughly not entertained.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               This is a bit of a weird one. If you couldn't tell from the size of these characters' foreheads, this is from the same mangaka as Teasing Master Takagi-san, and while it features a similar style of soft and silly humor based around the awkward pangs of early puberty, instead of a typical high-school romcom we get this whole apparatus of a girls-only ninja-in-training village and multiple teams of anime girls throwing shuriken and using ninjutsu. It's a way more complex setting for a similar effect, but it does add a bit of flavor to the whole thing.    It helps that the show just looks really nice. I don't know what magic Sōichirō Yamamoto worked to get two different gorgeously directed adaptations of his work, but that panache helps what might otherwise be pretty standard anime ninja shenanigans feel genuinely fun. These characters move with a ton of energy and spark, the short action sequences are solid, but the real treat is the wonderful environmental work during Tsubaki's nighttime excursion into the woods. The daytime scenes are a bit more pedestrian, but still do well to give this big ol' gaggle of kunoichi the energy you'd expect from kids, even ones training to be ninja. The character designs – specifically the cast's clothing, or lack thereof – are a bit of a red flag, but as of this episode the direction hasn't dipped into anything sexualizing. The closest it gets is Tsubaki blushing over the thought of seeing a b-b-b-boy, but you'd have to stretch pretty far to call that cheesecake.    As for the setup itself, it does feel a bit too contrived at the start, but by the end of the episode we wind up in the same sort of place as like, kids' summer camp movies. You know, it's a sleep-away camp out in the woods, and there's all-girls and all-boys camps on either side of a big lake. They get into adventures trying to sneak over to see the other camp, and eventually there's a big competition at the End of Summer. I don't imagine these competing(?) ninja schools will have a river raft race or a competitive pie eating contest, but you never know. It all mostly winds up as fodder for jokes about kids who don't know anything about boys spreading rumors and theories, including one girl who very clearly heard about dudes getting kicked in the balls and spends the entire rest of the episode telling all her friends about it to seem cool. Tsubaki herself is flustered to hell and back thinking about boys, and that's about all the jokes you get across this premiere.    It's not bad, but it definitely starts wearing thin by the time credits roll, and the sooner the show can introduce more material to build its gags around, the better. This creator has shown before that he can make charming low-key ensemble comedies, and there's certainly enough characters to facilitate that. It just needs to either introduce a stronger comedic hook, or delve more into its setting to get there.       James Beckett  Rating:               Man, I wanted to like In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki, since I'm already such a big fan of author Soichiro Yamamoto's other series, Teasing Master Takagi-san. However, I was definitely not inspired to get my hopes up when I saw the key art and trailers for this new series, which made it look like it was the kind of pandering and fanservice-driven comedy that I'm usually not too keen on. And look, let's get it out of the way up front: If you get skeeved out when a show puts a whole heck of a lot of the camera's focus on the exposed bellies and feet of young girls, thenIn the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki isn't going to be for you. The show is never so crass as to straight-up crash zoom on any of the characters' crotches or anything, but you'd have to be blind to not notice how much effort this series has gone towards putting a literal village full of tween girls into the most revealing ninja outfits that it can manage without knocking itself into an Adults Only timeslot (or a government watch-list, for that matter).    Even if you were to ignore the questionable designs and costume choices of the entire cast, not to mention all of the shots that are specifically designed to highlight the girls' toes and bellybuttons, the biggest issue with In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki would remain: It just isn't very funny. The whole show revolves around precisely one joke, which is that Tsubaki and her fellow lady ninjas hail from a reclusive clan that has managed to live in complete isolation from any men for years, to the point that all of the children treat the very concept of a “man” as some sort of hilarious cryptozoological prank. This is a trope that has been played both straight and as comedic fodder for literally a hundred years or more, from the pages of the sleaziest pulp magazine stories to the hackiest TV sitcoms. It isn't an inherently awful trope, mind you, but it's been played out to the degree that you have to get really creative with it if you want to be successful.    In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki is not really creative about anything it does, and if it weren't for the admittedly slick and entertaining production values, you'd be forgiven for mistaking the series for some bargain bin sex-comedy OVA that's been buried in someone's old VHS stash for the past thirty years. Each of the three main characters has exactly one character trait apiece, and none of them make for great comedy: Tsubaki is the all-star ninja who has become so obsessed with the idea of meeting a guy that she can't do her job anymore, Sazanka is the obsessive scamp who can't keep her hands/feet/body off of Tsubaki, and Asagao is…I guess she's the dumb one? I don't know. The show is too busy making lazy double entendre puns and repeating the same joke about Tsubaki's overflowing horniness to bother communicating anything else to its audience.    That's the thing about this preview: It could very well be that there is a genuinely funny and endearing comedy hiding somewhere underneath all of the lazy writing and questionable artistic decisions, but if that version of In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki does exist, this first episode certainly didn't do a great job of advertising it. I'll stick to Takagi-san, thank you very much. Consider this one of the season's biggest disappointments.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               It's entirely possible that In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki is trying to be a sort of light riff on that period of adolescence when some people become obsessed with whatever gender(s) they're attracted to. In fact, I highly suspect that's the case – in a world where ninja schools are segregated by gender, the guiding principle of the girls' school seems to be that men are like ticks – something best avoided and, in this case, often found outside. But because people are people, the harping on how awful men are has had the effect that the girls are all fully obsessed with them, something that ranges from “deliciously grossed out” to “fluttery feelings in the chest.” While most of the girls fall into the first category, our eponymous heroine is firmly in the second, but because her teacher is so down on men, she thinks that liking them must mean that there's something wrong with her.

The author of Teasing Master Takagi-san's signature style of cute characters with big noggins and fiveheads may work for realistic slice-of-life romantic comedies, but combined with The Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki's bare-midriff costume designs, it kind of gives things a “sexy baby” vibe. When you add that to the core concept of a teenage girl who's starting to develop an obsession with men despite never having seen one in her life, things get pretty awkward.    I'm willing to buy that despite appearances, Tsubaki and her florally named cohorts are of an age where developing an interest in boys is normal and natural and, with that in mind, the series does have some charm. It gives things kind of a dueling summer camps vibe, where teens are segregated by sex but also desperate to catch a glimpse of one another. Adolescence is a hell of a drug, after all, and while not every girl develops an all-consuming obsession with boys, quite a few of them do at some point or another. Plus, the banter between the girls was pretty cute, whether it be about guys or other topics. The way they kept repeating the same factoids they'd learned from one another for lack of any other kind of information made me chuckle. I half-expected one to bust out, “Boys go to Jupiter to get more stupider” at some point.    It does beg the question: if these girls have literally never seen a man, and all they know is that they're big and smelly and have weak crotches, why would their hormones still go toward them? (Instead of being sublimated to more immediately available and familiar targets, if you catch my drift) It's one thing when you're around boys, but mostly spend time with other girls, and suddenly you start wanting to know about this mysterious other sex; it's another thing when they're basically cryptids.    One last thing in Kunoichi Tsubaki's defense: the show uses the word “otoko,” which is closer in meaning to “male” than to “man” or “men.” The choice to use “men” for the translation instead of “boys” makes it seem like these young girls are lusting after adult men, rather than their peers. With that in mind, things get a lot less creepy. Still a little weird, but not nearly as actively uncomfortable.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Look. I understand what this show is trying to do. The joke is that we have a girl going through puberty who is basically “boy crazy.” Yet, she's surrounded by nothing but girls and has been taught from birth that men are basically monsters (but, importantly, ones that can be defeated with a well-aimed shot to the crotch). She has no one to talk to about her burgeoning sexuality and is trying to keep all these newfound feelings inside—though they keep bursting to the surface whenever she so much as thinks of something even tangentially related to men.    Unfortunately, I am unable to suspend disbelief when it comes to the core concept of the show. If you've never seen a man, think that they are disgusting, inhuman beings, and know nothing about sex and men's role in it, why would you be sexually aroused by them? I mean, she can't even form a mental picture of a man because all she knows about men comes from what her teacher has told them to scare them.    It would be one thing if she were captivated by the unknown—enticed by the taboo nature of meeting a man. After all, most teens rebel at some point and do things they are not supposed to do for the rush of it. But that's not what we are seeing with Tsubaki. She's basically sexually attracted to the concept of men—and an incredibly unflattering concept at that. I think she's going to be disappointed when she finds out that men are actually a lot like women—only with more hair and muscles.    Now, I may be overthinking things (but in my own defense, that's literally what I am paid to do). However, that doesn't change the fact that every time Tsubaki goes to mush thinking about men, I find it annoying instead of cute and silly, and her teammates (one “aggressively lesbian” and the other a lazy glutton) didn't add much to the story beyond being walking plot devices. In the end, this anime is basically a non-starter. Consider me thoroughly not entertained.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               This is a bit of a weird one. If you couldn't tell from the size of these characters' foreheads, this is from the same mangaka as Teasing Master Takagi-san, and while it features a similar style of soft and silly humor based around the awkward pangs of early puberty, instead of a typical high-school romcom we get this whole apparatus of a girls-only ninja-in-training village and multiple teams of anime girls throwing shuriken and using ninjutsu. It's a way more complex setting for a similar effect, but it does add a bit of flavor to the whole thing.    It helps that the show just looks really nice. I don't know what magic Sōichirō Yamamoto worked to get two different gorgeously directed adaptations of his work, but that panache helps what might otherwise be pretty standard anime ninja shenanigans feel genuinely fun. These characters move with a ton of energy and spark, the short action sequences are solid, but the real treat is the wonderful environmental work during Tsubaki's nighttime excursion into the woods. The daytime scenes are a bit more pedestrian, but still do well to give this big ol' gaggle of kunoichi the energy you'd expect from kids, even ones training to be ninja. The character designs – specifically the cast's clothing, or lack thereof – are a bit of a red flag, but as of this episode the direction hasn't dipped into anything sexualizing. The closest it gets is Tsubaki blushing over the thought of seeing a b-b-b-boy, but you'd have to stretch pretty far to call that cheesecake.    As for the setup itself, it does feel a bit too contrived at the start, but by the end of the episode we wind up in the same sort of place as like, kids' summer camp movies. You know, it's a sleep-away camp out in the woods, and there's all-girls and all-boys camps on either side of a big lake. They get into adventures trying to sneak over to see the other camp, and eventually there's a big competition at the End of Summer. I don't imagine these competing(?) ninja schools will have a river raft race or a competitive pie eating contest, but you never know. It all mostly winds up as fodder for jokes about kids who don't know anything about boys spreading rumors and theories, including one girl who very clearly heard about dudes getting kicked in the balls and spends the entire rest of the episode telling all her friends about it to seem cool. Tsubaki herself is flustered to hell and back thinking about boys, and that's about all the jokes you get across this premiere.    It's not bad, but it definitely starts wearing thin by the time credits roll, and the sooner the show can introduce more material to build its gags around, the better. This creator has shown before that he can make charming low-key ensemble comedies, and there's certainly enough characters to facilitate that. It just needs to either introduce a stronger comedic hook, or delve more into its setting to get there.       James Beckett  Rating:               Man, I wanted to like In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki, since I'm already such a big fan of author Soichiro Yamamoto's other series, Teasing Master Takagi-san. However, I was definitely not inspired to get my hopes up when I saw the key art and trailers for this new series, which made it look like it was the kind of pandering and fanservice-driven comedy that I'm usually not too keen on. And look, let's get it out of the way up front: If you get skeeved out when a show puts a whole heck of a lot of the camera's focus on the exposed bellies and feet of young girls, thenIn the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki isn't going to be for you. The show is never so crass as to straight-up crash zoom on any of the characters' crotches or anything, but you'd have to be blind to not notice how much effort this series has gone towards putting a literal village full of tween girls into the most revealing ninja outfits that it can manage without knocking itself into an Adults Only timeslot (or a government watch-list, for that matter).    Even if you were to ignore the questionable designs and costume choices of the entire cast, not to mention all of the shots that are specifically designed to highlight the girls' toes and bellybuttons, the biggest issue with In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki would remain: It just isn't very funny. The whole show revolves around precisely one joke, which is that Tsubaki and her fellow lady ninjas hail from a reclusive clan that has managed to live in complete isolation from any men for years, to the point that all of the children treat the very concept of a “man” as some sort of hilarious cryptozoological prank. This is a trope that has been played both straight and as comedic fodder for literally a hundred years or more, from the pages of the sleaziest pulp magazine stories to the hackiest TV sitcoms. It isn't an inherently awful trope, mind you, but it's been played out to the degree that you have to get really creative with it if you want to be successful.    In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki is not really creative about anything it does, and if it weren't for the admittedly slick and entertaining production values, you'd be forgiven for mistaking the series for some bargain bin sex-comedy OVA that's been buried in someone's old VHS stash for the past thirty years. Each of the three main characters has exactly one character trait apiece, and none of them make for great comedy: Tsubaki is the all-star ninja who has become so obsessed with the idea of meeting a guy that she can't do her job anymore, Sazanka is the obsessive scamp who can't keep her hands/feet/body off of Tsubaki, and Asagao is…I guess she's the dumb one? I don't know. The show is too busy making lazy double entendre puns and repeating the same joke about Tsubaki's overflowing horniness to bother communicating anything else to its audience.    That's the thing about this preview: It could very well be that there is a genuinely funny and endearing comedy hiding somewhere underneath all of the lazy writing and questionable artistic decisions, but if that version of In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki does exist, this first episode certainly didn't do a great job of advertising it. I'll stick to Takagi-san, thank you very much. Consider this one of the season's biggest disappointments.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               It's entirely possible that In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki is trying to be a sort of light riff on that period of adolescence when some people become obsessed with whatever gender(s) they're attracted to. In fact, I highly suspect that's the case – in a world where ninja schools are segregated by gender, the guiding principle of the girls' school seems to be that men are like ticks – something best avoided and, in this case, often found outside. But because people are people, the harping on how awful men are has had the effect that the girls are all fully obsessed with them, something that ranges from “deliciously grossed out” to “fluttery feelings in the chest.” While most of the girls fall into the first category, our eponymous heroine is firmly in the second, but because her teacher is so down on men, she thinks that liking them must mean that there's something wrong with her. Hijinks ensue.    I'm not sure what point exactly this episode is trying to make or what mood it's hoping to strike. We have a yuri-bait character in Sazanka, who is more attached to Tsubaki than she perhaps should be, we have plenty of cute girl designs and young women in various states of undress (or rather, clothing that doesn't cover much), and we have Tsubaki who is plainly attracted to men despite having never seen one. Presumably it's all meant to be funny, but it doesn't quite manage it, in part because even when the story hits on something amusing, it's promptly used as many times as possible in the moments following its introduction. Even if you've never seen a man you can surely use your imagination to come up with more than the oft-repeated “smelly, doesn't bathe, big bodies but weak in the crotch” that's practically the theme song of this episode. There are more ways to describe the Loch Ness Monster, for goodness' sake. It feels like someone thought the concept (and that repeated statement) is a lot funnier than it actually is.    On the other hand, this is a different approach to the CGCT genre, so if you're interested in a variation on that theme, this may be worth checking out. Bobble-head look of the character designs aside, it doesn't look awful, and if the attempt to show how far the girls can jump ends up looking more like they're flying on invisible brooms, well, I at least appreciate the effort. But it really needs to find more than one joke to hang its hat on, because this one gets old quickly.

Visit news.dexclub.com for all the latest news in Thai.                Advertising              Thank you for your interest in advertising on Anime News Network. Founded in 1998, Anime News Network is the world's leading source of up to date news and information on the anime and manga industries. Regular readers of Anime News Network not only include hundreds of thousands of anime fans, but also all of the industry heavy weights. The past several years have witnessed an attrition of English anime news sites on the Internet; as the number of sites shrink, the remaining sites only get better. Consistently growing and improving, Anime News Network is here to stay. The key benefit in advertising on Anime News Network is that our readership fits a particular demographic; mature anime fans. The majority of visitors to Anime News Network are between the ages of 18 and 24 and, needless to say, they're all anime fans, but also have a healthy appetite for other forms of animation, video games, and many other related interests. As long as you are interested in reaching anime fans that make their own purchasing decisions, Anime News Network is the ideal place for you to advertise. Please contact us at [email protected] (advertising at animenewsnetwork.com) for more information regarding advertising opportunities. Self-Serve ANN's minimum buy is $3000, but if your budget is lower than $3000 you can now buy ads directly from our self-serve advertising system. The minimum buy is only $10.   The self serve system is also great for people who know what they want and don't want to waste time.   What are you waiting for? Buy ads right here, right now.  Want to Trade? With the exception of anime conventions and charities, ANN does not trade advertising.  Convention Trades The convention trades are back! We have two trade programs available.    Non Profit Anime and Manga Conventions under 30K attendance: We can trade you for 100% of your advertising on ANN. Provide ANN with up to $5,000 of advertising in your program guide or on site, and we will provide you an equal value on ANN.  Other Anime, manga and geek culture conventions: We provide a 50% trade with no max value. You can pay for half the value of your advertisements on ANN with advertisements in your program guide or on-site. EG: If you give us $5,000 of ads at the convention, you only have to pay us $5,000 for $10,000 worth of advertising on ANN.  For Networks We are not looking for any advertising networks at this time. Agencies and rep firms are welcome to contact us, but no networks/exchanges/rtb platforms. No Bootlegs! No Pirates! Important: Don't waste our time if you sell bootleg/pirate DVDs or host unlicensed content on your website. Not only will we not allow you to advertise with us, but we'll probably report you to the appropriate authorities, licensors and/or licensees. We do not consider gray market imports of otherwise legal goods, or doujinshi, ""bootlegs,"" although we may require potential advertisers to prove that their gray market imports are legal goods.             bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Misc Page homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review                Odd Taxi: In the Woods   Apr 17, 00:00                 anime    By cleverly reframing its narrative around a series of interviews with the supporting cast, Odd Taxi: In the Woods succeeds where most recap films fail: it's an artistically cohesive film in its own right. ― Odd Taxi was 2021's sleeper anime hit, telling an intricate, original mystery that kept viewers guessing every week.

Founded in 1998, Anime News Network is the world's leading source of up to date news and information on the anime and manga industries. Regular readers of Anime News Network not only include hundreds of thousands of anime fans, but also all of the industry heavy weights. The past several years have witnessed an attrition of English anime news sites on the Internet; as the number of sites shrink, the remaining sites only get better. Consistently growing and improving, Anime News Network is here to stay. The key benefit in advertising on Anime News Network is that our readership fits a particular demographic; mature anime fans. The majority of visitors to Anime News Network are between the ages of 18 and 24 and, needless to say, they're all anime fans, but also have a healthy appetite for other forms of animation, video games, and many other related interests. As long as you are interested in reaching anime fans that make their own purchasing decisions, Anime News Network is the ideal place for you to advertise. Please contact us at [email protected] (advertising at animenewsnetwork.com) for more information regarding advertising opportunities. Self-Serve ANN's minimum buy is $3000, but if your budget is lower than $3000 you can now buy ads directly from our self-serve advertising system. The minimum buy is only $10.   The self serve system is also great for people who know what they want and don't want to waste time.   What are you waiting for? Buy ads right here, right now.  Want to Trade? With the exception of anime conventions and charities, ANN does not trade advertising.  Convention Trades The convention trades are back! We have two trade programs available.    Non Profit Anime and Manga Conventions under 30K attendance: We can trade you for 100% of your advertising on ANN. Provide ANN with up to $5,000 of advertising in your program guide or on site, and we will provide you an equal value on ANN.  Other Anime, manga and geek culture conventions: We provide a 50% trade with no max value. You can pay for half the value of your advertisements on ANN with advertisements in your program guide or on-site. EG: If you give us $5,000 of ads at the convention, you only have to pay us $5,000 for $10,000 worth of advertising on ANN.  For Networks We are not looking for any advertising networks at this time. Agencies and rep firms are welcome to contact us, but no networks/exchanges/rtb platforms. No Bootlegs! No Pirates! Important: Don't waste our time if you sell bootleg/pirate DVDs or host unlicensed content on your website. Not only will we not allow you to advertise with us, but we'll probably report you to the appropriate authorities, licensors and/or licensees. We do not consider gray market imports of otherwise legal goods, or doujinshi, ""bootlegs,"" although we may require potential advertisers to prove that their gray market imports are legal goods.             bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Misc Page homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review                Odd Taxi: In the Woods   Apr 17, 00:00                 anime    By cleverly reframing its narrative around a series of interviews with the supporting cast, Odd Taxi: In the Woods succeeds where most recap films fail: it's an artistically cohesive film in its own right. ― Odd Taxi was 2021's sleeper anime hit, telling an intricate, original mystery that kept viewers guessing every week.

Founded in 1998, Anime News Network is the world's leading source of up to date news and information on the anime and manga industries. Regular readers of Anime News Network not only include hundreds of thousands of anime fans, but also all of the industry heavy weights. The past several years have witnessed an attrition of English anime news sites on the Internet; as the number of sites shrink, the remaining sites only get better. Consistently growing and improving, Anime News Network is here to stay. The key benefit in advertising on Anime News Network is that our readership fits a particular demographic; mature anime fans. The majority of visitors to Anime News Network are between the ages of 18 and 24 and, needless to say, they're all anime fans, but also have a healthy appetite for other forms of animation, video games, and many other related interests. As long as you are interested in reaching anime fans that make their own purchasing decisions, Anime News Network is the ideal place for you to advertise. Please contact us at [email protected] (advertising at animenewsnetwork.com) for more information regarding advertising opportunities. Self-Serve ANN's minimum buy is $3000, but if your budget is lower than $3000 you can now buy ads directly from our self-serve advertising system. The minimum buy is only $10.   The self serve system is also great for people who know what they want and don't want to waste time.   What are you waiting for? Buy ads right here, right now.  Want to Trade? With the exception of anime conventions and charities, ANN does not trade advertising.  Convention Trades The convention trades are back! We have two trade programs available.    Non Profit Anime and Manga Conventions under 30K attendance: We can trade you for 100% of your advertising on ANN. Provide ANN with up to $5,000 of advertising in your program guide or on site, and we will provide you an equal value on ANN.  Other Anime, manga and geek culture conventions: We provide a 50% trade with no max value. You can pay for half the value of your advertisements on ANN with advertisements in your program guide or on-site. EG: If you give us $5,000 of ads at the convention, you only have to pay us $5,000 for $10,000 worth of advertising on ANN.  For Networks We are not looking for any advertising networks at this time. Agencies and rep firms are welcome to contact us, but no networks/exchanges/rtb platforms. No Bootlegs! No Pirates!

As long as you are interested in reaching anime fans that make their own purchasing decisions, Anime News Network is the ideal place for you to advertise. Please contact us at [email protected] (advertising at animenewsnetwork.com) for more information regarding advertising opportunities. Self-Serve ANN's minimum buy is $3000, but if your budget is lower than $3000 you can now buy ads directly from our self-serve advertising system. The minimum buy is only $10.   The self serve system is also great for people who know what they want and don't want to waste time.   What are you waiting for? Buy ads right here, right now.  Want to Trade? With the exception of anime conventions and charities, ANN does not trade advertising.  Convention Trades The convention trades are back! We have two trade programs available.    Non Profit Anime and Manga Conventions under 30K attendance: We can trade you for 100% of your advertising on ANN. Provide ANN with up to $5,000 of advertising in your program guide or on site, and we will provide you an equal value on ANN.  Other Anime, manga and geek culture conventions: We provide a 50% trade with no max value. You can pay for half the value of your advertisements on ANN with advertisements in your program guide or on-site. EG: If you give us $5,000 of ads at the convention, you only have to pay us $5,000 for $10,000 worth of advertising on ANN.  For Networks We are not looking for any advertising networks at this time. Agencies and rep firms are welcome to contact us, but no networks/exchanges/rtb platforms. No Bootlegs! No Pirates! Important: Don't waste our time if you sell bootleg/pirate DVDs or host unlicensed content on your website. Not only will we not allow you to advertise with us, but we'll probably report you to the appropriate authorities, licensors and/or licensees. We do not consider gray market imports of otherwise legal goods, or doujinshi, ""bootlegs,"" although we may require potential advertisers to prove that their gray market imports are legal goods.

Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.2              What is this?   General of the Three Kingdoms, Kongming, had struggled his whole life, facing countless battles that made him into the accomplished strategist he was. So on his deathbed, he wished only to be reborn into a peaceful world... and was sent straight to modern-day party-central, Tokyo. The brilliant strategist Kongming will have to adapt to the wild beats and even wilder party people of the modern age.    Ya Boy Kongming! is based on Yuto Yotsuba and Ryō Ogawa's manga and streams on HIDIVE on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                For a second, I was tempted to call the premise of this one old hat – yoinking a historic figure from the past and tossing them into the present day has been a go-to premise for comedy movies for ages. But there really haven't been too many of those in anime the last few years, since the current obsession is taking a boring-ass dude from our world and tossing him to a theoretically more interesting setting to get his stank all over that place. So in a way this time transplant comedy has some novelty on its side, but it definitely needed more than that to sell itself. Thankfully, as of this first episode it's more than managed to surprise me.    For one, I'm shocked how little the series relies on the rote jokes that come with this territory. You of course have the requisite scenes of Kongming learning about smartphones and modern culture, but those moments are sped through in under a minute, and seemingly every character just rolls with him either being a time traveler or a weird LARPer without much fuss. Not only does that keep this introduction feeling less predictable, it allows more time for the story to dig into sentiment alongside its goofy time-hopping setup. For all that this is a chance for nerdy history references, they take the time to give both Kongming and Eiko likable personalities and moments of emotional sincerity that seriously gripped me.    I was also surprised at how relatively in-depth the show gets with its central musical hook. I'm used to musical anime being idol shows that rarely dip their toes into the actual mechanics of music or the larger world of genres outside of marketable pop ballads. But Ya Boy Kongming! shows a lot of knowledge about music as a whole, from Eiko having a phone filled with EDM and Hip-Hop to discussing how the club she works at plays tracks with different BPM depending on the time of night and how many people are around. Eiko's music is pretty, if not particularly memorable, but the detail and attention being paid here makes me hopeful that the story can use music as more than just a marketing gimmick.    It's also just really well produced so far. The standout scenes are Eiko's first stage appearance and, later, her practice session in her apartment. Both are short but gorgeous sequences of character acting, and do a lot to sell you on why Kongming would suddenly devote himself to becoming her “tactician” to support her career. Really, the entire premiere just looks rock solid – great use of color, strong character designs that are distinct but all gel together effortlessly, and an altogether pleasant aesthetic to lean on. Put together it makes for a much stronger premiere than you might expect, and I'll definitely be staying for another performance.       Rebeccca Silverman  Rating:                Would I have been as thrilled with this episode if I hadn't already read the source manga? I'd like to think so, because even without the knowledge of where this is heading, Ya Boy Kongming!'s first episode is a delightful combination of pathos and humor. It's also a sort of reverse-isekai – our protagonist is in fact the Kongming from the Three Kingdoms period of Chinese history, and after his death from old age in 234 C. E., he wakes up 1,800 years later, young once again, in what he presumes to be Hell. It's basically Mayaya from Princess Jellyfish's dream anime. But a series needs more than just a good premise and a catchy title to work, and in that respect this episode delivers: rather than going with a plain old fish-out-of-water story, Ya Boy Kongming! instead focuses on Kongming finding a new purpose in his life and embracing his rebirth wholeheartedly, and that's a large part of what sells this premier.    It helps that Kongming's new liege is Eiko, an aspiring singer. Despite a lovely singing voice (provided by 96 Neko), success has been elusive to the point where she very nearly committed suicide at one point. It's Eiko's song that snaps Kongming out of his confusion upon first arriving in “Hell” (Shibuya on Halloween), and when they meet again the next day, he's wholeheartedly ready to back Eiko's career. Does it matter that he doesn't know anything about the 21st century's music scene? Not in the slightest; the episode does a very good job of showing us just how quickly he picks things up without actually stopping to say, “Hey, this guy picks up new skills really fast” in a beautiful display of showing versus telling. (His pride that he's got his own Wiki is pretty funny.) Since he's been brought to the world without war that he wished for, what better use of his prodigious intellect and tactical knowledge than to back the girl who saved him and is in need of a helping hand herself?    There's something really heartwarming about Kongming's and Eiko's relationship, even if she is totally thrown by him roughly every three minutes, and it helps that the episode doesn't skimp on the animation or the music – not counting the ending theme, we hear Eiko sing three separate songs, which is better than most idol shows. There's also nice detail in the art, from Kongming holding his sleeve back as he plays go to the clutter of Eiko's small apartment, and the occasional foray into chibi land doesn't detract from this. Honestly, this was just a really entertaining half-hour, and if it wasn't on your radar, I'd urge you to check it out.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Although the Romance of the Three Kingdoms talk went right over my head, the show clearly lays out the two most important things for us to know about Kongming: 1) he was a master strategist, and 2) his side lost. Therefore, it's possible he sees this gig not only as his second chance at life but also his second chance to win—albeit through philosophy rather than warfare.    One thing I love about this episode is how it addresses the absurdity of its premise. Why is he in Japan in the modern day? Why can he understand Japanese? Why is he young again? Why does he encounter the one person who will not only deal with his apparent eccentricities but even bring him into her home? Why does he meet the one boss who will hire him on the spot? The answer to all of these questions is the same: some divine force willed it to be so. His task is to support Eiko, full stop.    Of course, it helps that the show is willing to use this all for comedy.Whether it is Kongming going from having never seen a computer before to asking Eiko about the blockchain over the course of a few hours, or him becoming a master bartender after just listening to Eiko's instructions once, there are a ton of good laughs as we get all those pesky questions out of the way and set up both the premise and our characters.    The other great thing about the episode is that it understands that the most important thing to have in a show about an up-and-coming singer is the music to match. If the songs don't wow you, you can't believe that the supposedly talented singers will make it big, robbing the show of its drama. Honestly, I'm saddened we didn't spend more time listening to Eiko sing (though with runtime limitations I understand why we didn't). I'll be sure to keep an eye out for the soundtrack if nothing else.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review                Odd Taxi: In the Woods   Apr 17, 00:00                 anime    By cleverly reframing its narrative around a series of interviews with the supporting cast, Odd Taxi: In the Woods succeeds where most recap films fail: it's an artistically cohesive film in its own right. ― Odd Taxi was 2021's sleeper anime hit, telling an intricate, original mystery that kept viewers guessing every week.

Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.2              What is this?   General of the Three Kingdoms, Kongming, had struggled his whole life, facing countless battles that made him into the accomplished strategist he was. So on his deathbed, he wished only to be reborn into a peaceful world... and was sent straight to modern-day party-central, Tokyo. The brilliant strategist Kongming will have to adapt to the wild beats and even wilder party people of the modern age.    Ya Boy Kongming! is based on Yuto Yotsuba and Ryō Ogawa's manga and streams on HIDIVE on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                For a second, I was tempted to call the premise of this one old hat – yoinking a historic figure from the past and tossing them into the present day has been a go-to premise for comedy movies for ages. But there really haven't been too many of those in anime the last few years, since the current obsession is taking a boring-ass dude from our world and tossing him to a theoretically more interesting setting to get his stank all over that place. So in a way this time transplant comedy has some novelty on its side, but it definitely needed more than that to sell itself. Thankfully, as of this first episode it's more than managed to surprise me.    For one, I'm shocked how little the series relies on the rote jokes that come with this territory. You of course have the requisite scenes of Kongming learning about smartphones and modern culture, but those moments are sped through in under a minute, and seemingly every character just rolls with him either being a time traveler or a weird LARPer without much fuss. Not only does that keep this introduction feeling less predictable, it allows more time for the story to dig into sentiment alongside its goofy time-hopping setup. For all that this is a chance for nerdy history references, they take the time to give both Kongming and Eiko likable personalities and moments of emotional sincerity that seriously gripped me.    I was also surprised at how relatively in-depth the show gets with its central musical hook. I'm used to musical anime being idol shows that rarely dip their toes into the actual mechanics of music or the larger world of genres outside of marketable pop ballads. But Ya Boy Kongming! shows a lot of knowledge about music as a whole, from Eiko having a phone filled with EDM and Hip-Hop to discussing how the club she works at plays tracks with different BPM depending on the time of night and how many people are around. Eiko's music is pretty, if not particularly memorable, but the detail and attention being paid here makes me hopeful that the story can use music as more than just a marketing gimmick.    It's also just really well produced so far. The standout scenes are Eiko's first stage appearance and, later, her practice session in her apartment. Both are short but gorgeous sequences of character acting, and do a lot to sell you on why Kongming would suddenly devote himself to becoming her “tactician” to support her career. Really, the entire premiere just looks rock solid – great use of color, strong character designs that are distinct but all gel together effortlessly, and an altogether pleasant aesthetic to lean on. Put together it makes for a much stronger premiere than you might expect, and I'll definitely be staying for another performance.       Rebeccca Silverman  Rating:                Would I have been as thrilled with this episode if I hadn't already read the source manga? I'd like to think so, because even without the knowledge of where this is heading, Ya Boy Kongming!'s first episode is a delightful combination of pathos and humor. It's also a sort of reverse-isekai – our protagonist is in fact the Kongming from the Three Kingdoms period of Chinese history, and after his death from old age in 234 C. E., he wakes up 1,800 years later, young once again, in what he presumes to be Hell. It's basically Mayaya from Princess Jellyfish's dream anime. But a series needs more than just a good premise and a catchy title to work, and in that respect this episode delivers: rather than going with a plain old fish-out-of-water story, Ya Boy Kongming! instead focuses on Kongming finding a new purpose in his life and embracing his rebirth wholeheartedly, and that's a large part of what sells this premier.    It helps that Kongming's new liege is Eiko, an aspiring singer. Despite a lovely singing voice (provided by 96 Neko), success has been elusive to the point where she very nearly committed suicide at one point. It's Eiko's song that snaps Kongming out of his confusion upon first arriving in “Hell” (Shibuya on Halloween), and when they meet again the next day, he's wholeheartedly ready to back Eiko's career. Does it matter that he doesn't know anything about the 21st century's music scene? Not in the slightest; the episode does a very good job of showing us just how quickly he picks things up without actually stopping to say, “Hey, this guy picks up new skills really fast” in a beautiful display of showing versus telling. (His pride that he's got his own Wiki is pretty funny.) Since he's been brought to the world without war that he wished for, what better use of his prodigious intellect and tactical knowledge than to back the girl who saved him and is in need of a helping hand herself?    There's something really heartwarming about Kongming's and Eiko's relationship, even if she is totally thrown by him roughly every three minutes, and it helps that the episode doesn't skimp on the animation or the music – not counting the ending theme, we hear Eiko sing three separate songs, which is better than most idol shows. There's also nice detail in the art, from Kongming holding his sleeve back as he plays go to the clutter of Eiko's small apartment, and the occasional foray into chibi land doesn't detract from this. Honestly, this was just a really entertaining half-hour, and if it wasn't on your radar, I'd urge you to check it out.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Although the Romance of the Three Kingdoms talk went right over my head, the show clearly lays out the two most important things for us to know about Kongming: 1) he was a master strategist, and 2) his side lost. Therefore, it's possible he sees this gig not only as his second chance at life but also his second chance to win—albeit through philosophy rather than warfare.    One thing I love about this episode is how it addresses the absurdity of its premise. Why is he in Japan in the modern day? Why can he understand Japanese? Why is he young again? Why does he encounter the one person who will not only deal with his apparent eccentricities but even bring him into her home? Why does he meet the one boss who will hire him on the spot? The answer to all of these questions is the same: some divine force willed it to be so. His task is to support Eiko, full stop.    Of course, it helps that the show is willing to use this all for comedy.Whether it is Kongming going from having never seen a computer before to asking Eiko about the blockchain over the course of a few hours, or him becoming a master bartender after just listening to Eiko's instructions once, there are a ton of good laughs as we get all those pesky questions out of the way and set up both the premise and our characters.    The other great thing about the episode is that it understands that the most important thing to have in a show about an up-and-coming singer is the music to match. If the songs don't wow you, you can't believe that the supposedly talented singers will make it big, robbing the show of its drama. Honestly, I'm saddened we didn't spend more time listening to Eiko sing (though with runtime limitations I understand why we didn't). I'll be sure to keep an eye out for the soundtrack if nothing else.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review                Odd Taxi: In the Woods   Apr 17, 00:00                 anime    By cleverly reframing its narrative around a series of interviews with the supporting cast, Odd Taxi: In the Woods succeeds where most recap films fail: it's an artistically cohesive film in its own right. ― Odd Taxi was 2021's sleeper anime hit, telling an intricate, original mystery that kept viewers guessing every week.

Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.2              What is this?   General of the Three Kingdoms, Kongming, had struggled his whole life, facing countless battles that made him into the accomplished strategist he was. So on his deathbed, he wished only to be reborn into a peaceful world... and was sent straight to modern-day party-central, Tokyo. The brilliant strategist Kongming will have to adapt to the wild beats and even wilder party people of the modern age.    Ya Boy Kongming! is based on Yuto Yotsuba and Ryō Ogawa's manga and streams on HIDIVE on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                For a second, I was tempted to call the premise of this one old hat – yoinking a historic figure from the past and tossing them into the present day has been a go-to premise for comedy movies for ages. But there really haven't been too many of those in anime the last few years, since the current obsession is taking a boring-ass dude from our world and tossing him to a theoretically more interesting setting to get his stank all over that place. So in a way this time transplant comedy has some novelty on its side, but it definitely needed more than that to sell itself. Thankfully, as of this first episode it's more than managed to surprise me.    For one, I'm shocked how little the series relies on the rote jokes that come with this territory. You of course have the requisite scenes of Kongming learning about smartphones and modern culture, but those moments are sped through in under a minute, and seemingly every character just rolls with him either being a time traveler or a weird LARPer without much fuss. Not only does that keep this introduction feeling less predictable, it allows more time for the story to dig into sentiment alongside its goofy time-hopping setup. For all that this is a chance for nerdy history references, they take the time to give both Kongming and Eiko likable personalities and moments of emotional sincerity that seriously gripped me.    I was also surprised at how relatively in-depth the show gets with its central musical hook. I'm used to musical anime being idol shows that rarely dip their toes into the actual mechanics of music or the larger world of genres outside of marketable pop ballads. But Ya Boy Kongming! shows a lot of knowledge about music as a whole, from Eiko having a phone filled with EDM and Hip-Hop to discussing how the club she works at plays tracks with different BPM depending on the time of night and how many people are around. Eiko's music is pretty, if not particularly memorable, but the detail and attention being paid here makes me hopeful that the story can use music as more than just a marketing gimmick.    It's also just really well produced so far. The standout scenes are Eiko's first stage appearance and, later, her practice session in her apartment. Both are short but gorgeous sequences of character acting, and do a lot to sell you on why Kongming would suddenly devote himself to becoming her “tactician” to support her career. Really, the entire premiere just looks rock solid – great use of color, strong character designs that are distinct but all gel together effortlessly, and an altogether pleasant aesthetic to lean on. Put together it makes for a much stronger premiere than you might expect, and I'll definitely be staying for another performance.       Rebeccca Silverman  Rating:                Would I have been as thrilled with this episode if I hadn't already read the source manga? I'd like to think so, because even without the knowledge of where this is heading, Ya Boy Kongming!'s first episode is a delightful combination of pathos and humor. It's also a sort of reverse-isekai – our protagonist is in fact the Kongming from the Three Kingdoms period of Chinese history, and after his death from old age in 234 C. E., he wakes up 1,800 years later, young once again, in what he presumes to be Hell. It's basically Mayaya from Princess Jellyfish's dream anime. But a series needs more than just a good premise and a catchy title to work, and in that respect this episode delivers: rather than going with a plain old fish-out-of-water story, Ya Boy Kongming! instead focuses on Kongming finding a new purpose in his life and embracing his rebirth wholeheartedly, and that's a large part of what sells this premier.    It helps that Kongming's new liege is Eiko, an aspiring singer. Despite a lovely singing voice (provided by 96 Neko), success has been elusive to the point where she very nearly committed suicide at one point. It's Eiko's song that snaps Kongming out of his confusion upon first arriving in “Hell” (Shibuya on Halloween), and when they meet again the next day, he's wholeheartedly ready to back Eiko's career. Does it matter that he doesn't know anything about the 21st century's music scene? Not in the slightest; the episode does a very good job of showing us just how quickly he picks things up without actually stopping to say, “Hey, this guy picks up new skills really fast” in a beautiful display of showing versus telling. (His pride that he's got his own Wiki is pretty funny.) Since he's been brought to the world without war that he wished for, what better use of his prodigious intellect and tactical knowledge than to back the girl who saved him and is in need of a helping hand herself?    There's something really heartwarming about Kongming's and Eiko's relationship, even if she is totally thrown by him roughly every three minutes, and it helps that the episode doesn't skimp on the animation or the music – not counting the ending theme, we hear Eiko sing three separate songs, which is better than most idol shows. There's also nice detail in the art, from Kongming holding his sleeve back as he plays go to the clutter of Eiko's small apartment, and the occasional foray into chibi land doesn't detract from this. Honestly, this was just a really entertaining half-hour, and if it wasn't on your radar, I'd urge you to check it out.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Although the Romance of the Three Kingdoms talk went right over my head, the show clearly lays out the two most important things for us to know about Kongming: 1) he was a master strategist, and 2) his side lost. Therefore, it's possible he sees this gig not only as his second chance at life but also his second chance to win—albeit through philosophy rather than warfare.    One thing I love about this episode is how it addresses the absurdity of its premise. Why is he in Japan in the modern day? Why can he understand Japanese? Why is he young again? Why does he encounter the one person who will not only deal with his apparent eccentricities but even bring him into her home? Why does he meet the one boss who will hire him on the spot? The answer to all of these questions is the same: some divine force willed it to be so. His task is to support Eiko, full stop.    Of course, it helps that the show is willing to use this all for comedy.Whether it is Kongming going from having never seen a computer before to asking Eiko about the blockchain over the course of a few hours, or him becoming a master bartender after just listening to Eiko's instructions once, there are a ton of good laughs as we get all those pesky questions out of the way and set up both the premise and our characters.    The other great thing about the episode is that it understands that the most important thing to have in a show about an up-and-coming singer is the music to match. If the songs don't wow you, you can't believe that the supposedly talented singers will make it big, robbing the show of its drama. Honestly, I'm saddened we didn't spend more time listening to Eiko sing (though with runtime limitations I understand why we didn't). I'll be sure to keep an eye out for the soundtrack if nothing else.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review                Odd Taxi: In the Woods   Apr 17, 00:00                 anime    By cleverly reframing its narrative around a series of interviews with the supporting cast, Odd Taxi: In the Woods succeeds where most recap films fail: it's an artistically cohesive film in its own right. ― Odd Taxi was 2021's sleeper anime hit, telling an intricate, original mystery that kept viewers guessing every week.

Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Although the Romance of the Three Kingdoms talk went right over my head, the show clearly lays out the two most important things for us to know about Kongming: 1) he was a master strategist, and 2) his side lost. Therefore, it's possible he sees this gig not only as his second chance at life but also his second chance to win—albeit through philosophy rather than warfare.    One thing I love about this episode is how it addresses the absurdity of its premise. Why is he in Japan in the modern day? Why can he understand Japanese? Why is he young again? Why does he encounter the one person who will not only deal with his apparent eccentricities but even bring him into her home? Why does he meet the one boss who will hire him on the spot? The answer to all of these questions is the same: some divine force willed it to be so. His task is to support Eiko, full stop.    Of course, it helps that the show is willing to use this all for comedy.Whether it is Kongming going from having never seen a computer before to asking Eiko about the blockchain over the course of a few hours, or him becoming a master bartender after just listening to Eiko's instructions once, there are a ton of good laughs as we get all those pesky questions out of the way and set up both the premise and our characters.    The other great thing about the episode is that it understands that the most important thing to have in a show about an up-and-coming singer is the music to match. If the songs don't wow you, you can't believe that the supposedly talented singers will make it big, robbing the show of its drama. Honestly, I'm saddened we didn't spend more time listening to Eiko sing (though with runtime limitations I understand why we didn't). I'll be sure to keep an eye out for the soundtrack if nothing else.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review                Odd Taxi: In the Woods   Apr 17, 00:00                 anime    By cleverly reframing its narrative around a series of interviews with the supporting cast, Odd Taxi: In the Woods succeeds where most recap films fail: it's an artistically cohesive film in its own right. ― Odd Taxi was 2021's sleeper anime hit, telling an intricate, original mystery that kept viewers guessing every week.

Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.2              What is this?   General of the Three Kingdoms, Kongming, had struggled his whole life, facing countless battles that made him into the accomplished strategist he was. So on his deathbed, he wished only to be reborn into a peaceful world... and was sent straight to modern-day party-central, Tokyo. The brilliant strategist Kongming will have to adapt to the wild beats and even wilder party people of the modern age.    Ya Boy Kongming! is based on Yuto Yotsuba and Ryō Ogawa's manga and streams on HIDIVE on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                For a second, I was tempted to call the premise of this one old hat – yoinking a historic figure from the past and tossing them into the present day has been a go-to premise for comedy movies for ages. But there really haven't been too many of those in anime the last few years, since the current obsession is taking a boring-ass dude from our world and tossing him to a theoretically more interesting setting to get his stank all over that place. So in a way this time transplant comedy has some novelty on its side, but it definitely needed more than that to sell itself. Thankfully, as of this first episode it's more than managed to surprise me.    For one, I'm shocked how little the series relies on the rote jokes that come with this territory. You of course have the requisite scenes of Kongming learning about smartphones and modern culture, but those moments are sped through in under a minute, and seemingly every character just rolls with him either being a time traveler or a weird LARPer without much fuss. Not only does that keep this introduction feeling less predictable, it allows more time for the story to dig into sentiment alongside its goofy time-hopping setup. For all that this is a chance for nerdy history references, they take the time to give both Kongming and Eiko likable personalities and moments of emotional sincerity that seriously gripped me.    I was also surprised at how relatively in-depth the show gets with its central musical hook. I'm used to musical anime being idol shows that rarely dip their toes into the actual mechanics of music or the larger world of genres outside of marketable pop ballads. But Ya Boy Kongming! shows a lot of knowledge about music as a whole, from Eiko having a phone filled with EDM and Hip-Hop to discussing how the club she works at plays tracks with different BPM depending on the time of night and how many people are around. Eiko's music is pretty, if not particularly memorable, but the detail and attention being paid here makes me hopeful that the story can use music as more than just a marketing gimmick.    It's also just really well produced so far. The standout scenes are Eiko's first stage appearance and, later, her practice session in her apartment. Both are short but gorgeous sequences of character acting, and do a lot to sell you on why Kongming would suddenly devote himself to becoming her “tactician” to support her career. Really, the entire premiere just looks rock solid – great use of color, strong character designs that are distinct but all gel together effortlessly, and an altogether pleasant aesthetic to lean on. Put together it makes for a much stronger premiere than you might expect, and I'll definitely be staying for another performance.       Rebeccca Silverman  Rating:                Would I have been as thrilled with this episode if I hadn't already read the source manga? I'd like to think so, because even without the knowledge of where this is heading, Ya Boy Kongming!'s first episode is a delightful combination of pathos and humor. It's also a sort of reverse-isekai – our protagonist is in fact the Kongming from the Three Kingdoms period of Chinese history, and after his death from old age in 234 C. E., he wakes up 1,800 years later, young once again, in what he presumes to be Hell. It's basically Mayaya from Princess Jellyfish's dream anime. But a series needs more than just a good premise and a catchy title to work, and in that respect this episode delivers: rather than going with a plain old fish-out-of-water story, Ya Boy Kongming! instead focuses on Kongming finding a new purpose in his life and embracing his rebirth wholeheartedly, and that's a large part of what sells this premier.    It helps that Kongming's new liege is Eiko, an aspiring singer. Despite a lovely singing voice (provided by 96 Neko), success has been elusive to the point where she very nearly committed suicide at one point. It's Eiko's song that snaps Kongming out of his confusion upon first arriving in “Hell” (Shibuya on Halloween), and when they meet again the next day, he's wholeheartedly ready to back Eiko's career. Does it matter that he doesn't know anything about the 21st century's music scene? Not in the slightest; the episode does a very good job of showing us just how quickly he picks things up without actually stopping to say, “Hey, this guy picks up new skills really fast” in a beautiful display of showing versus telling. (His pride that he's got his own Wiki is pretty funny.) Since he's been brought to the world without war that he wished for, what better use of his prodigious intellect and tactical knowledge than to back the girl who saved him and is in need of a helping hand herself?    There's something really heartwarming about Kongming's and Eiko's relationship, even if she is totally thrown by him roughly every three minutes, and it helps that the episode doesn't skimp on the animation or the music – not counting the ending theme, we hear Eiko sing three separate songs, which is better than most idol shows. There's also nice detail in the art, from Kongming holding his sleeve back as he plays go to the clutter of Eiko's small apartment, and the occasional foray into chibi land doesn't detract from this. Honestly, this was just a really entertaining half-hour, and if it wasn't on your radar, I'd urge you to check it out.      How was the first episode?

Of course, it helps that the show is willing to use this all for comedy.Whether it is Kongming going from having never seen a computer before to asking Eiko about the blockchain over the course of a few hours, or him becoming a master bartender after just listening to Eiko's instructions once, there are a ton of good laughs as we get all those pesky questions out of the way and set up both the premise and our characters.

Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                For a second, I was tempted to call the premise of this one old hat – yoinking a historic figure from the past and tossing them into the present day has been a go-to premise for comedy movies for ages. But there really haven't been too many of those in anime the last few years, since the current obsession is taking a boring-ass dude from our world and tossing him to a theoretically more interesting setting to get his stank all over that place. So in a way this time transplant comedy has some novelty on its side, but it definitely needed more than that to sell itself. Thankfully, as of this first episode it's more than managed to surprise me.    For one, I'm shocked how little the series relies on the rote jokes that come with this territory. You of course have the requisite scenes of Kongming learning about smartphones and modern culture, but those moments are sped through in under a minute, and seemingly every character just rolls with him either being a time traveler or a weird LARPer without much fuss. Not only does that keep this introduction feeling less predictable, it allows more time for the story to dig into sentiment alongside its goofy time-hopping setup. For all that this is a chance for nerdy history references, they take the time to give both Kongming and Eiko likable personalities and moments of emotional sincerity that seriously gripped me.    I was also surprised at how relatively in-depth the show gets with its central musical hook. I'm used to musical anime being idol shows that rarely dip their toes into the actual mechanics of music or the larger world of genres outside of marketable pop ballads. But Ya Boy Kongming! shows a lot of knowledge about music as a whole, from Eiko having a phone filled with EDM and Hip-Hop to discussing how the club she works at plays tracks with different BPM depending on the time of night and how many people are around. Eiko's music is pretty, if not particularly memorable, but the detail and attention being paid here makes me hopeful that the story can use music as more than just a marketing gimmick.    It's also just really well produced so far. The standout scenes are Eiko's first stage appearance and, later, her practice session in her apartment. Both are short but gorgeous sequences of character acting, and do a lot to sell you on why Kongming would suddenly devote himself to becoming her “tactician” to support her career. Really, the entire premiere just looks rock solid – great use of color, strong character designs that are distinct but all gel together effortlessly, and an altogether pleasant aesthetic to lean on. Put together it makes for a much stronger premiere than you might expect, and I'll definitely be staying for another performance.       Rebeccca Silverman  Rating:                Would I have been as thrilled with this episode if I hadn't already read the source manga? I'd like to think so, because even without the knowledge of where this is heading, Ya Boy Kongming!'s first episode is a delightful combination of pathos and humor. It's also a sort of reverse-isekai – our protagonist is in fact the Kongming from the Three Kingdoms period of Chinese history, and after his death from old age in 234 C. E., he wakes up 1,800 years later, young once again, in what he presumes to be Hell. It's basically Mayaya from Princess Jellyfish's dream anime. But a series needs more than just a good premise and a catchy title to work, and in that respect this episode delivers: rather than going with a plain old fish-out-of-water story, Ya Boy Kongming! instead focuses on Kongming finding a new purpose in his life and embracing his rebirth wholeheartedly, and that's a large part of what sells this premier.    It helps that Kongming's new liege is Eiko, an aspiring singer. Despite a lovely singing voice (provided by 96 Neko), success has been elusive to the point where she very nearly committed suicide at one point. It's Eiko's song that snaps Kongming out of his confusion upon first arriving in “Hell” (Shibuya on Halloween), and when they meet again the next day, he's wholeheartedly ready to back Eiko's career. Does it matter that he doesn't know anything about the 21st century's music scene? Not in the slightest; the episode does a very good job of showing us just how quickly he picks things up without actually stopping to say, “Hey, this guy picks up new skills really fast” in a beautiful display of showing versus telling. (His pride that he's got his own Wiki is pretty funny.) Since he's been brought to the world without war that he wished for, what better use of his prodigious intellect and tactical knowledge than to back the girl who saved him and is in need of a helping hand herself?    There's something really heartwarming about Kongming's and Eiko's relationship, even if she is totally thrown by him roughly every three minutes, and it helps that the episode doesn't skimp on the animation or the music – not counting the ending theme, we hear Eiko sing three separate songs, which is better than most idol shows. There's also nice detail in the art, from Kongming holding his sleeve back as he plays go to the clutter of Eiko's small apartment, and the occasional foray into chibi land doesn't detract from this. Honestly, this was just a really entertaining half-hour, and if it wasn't on your radar, I'd urge you to check it out.      How was the first episode?

It's also a sort of reverse-isekai – our protagonist is in fact the Kongming from the Three Kingdoms period of Chinese history, and after his death from old age in 234 C. E., he wakes up 1,800 years later, young once again, in what he presumes to be Hell. It's basically Mayaya from Princess Jellyfish's dream anime. But a series needs more than just a good premise and a catchy title to work, and in that respect this episode delivers: rather than going with a plain old fish-out-of-water story, Ya Boy Kongming! instead focuses on Kongming finding a new purpose in his life and embracing his rebirth wholeheartedly, and that's a large part of what sells this premier.    It helps that Kongming's new liege is Eiko, an aspiring singer. Despite a lovely singing voice (provided by 96 Neko), success has been elusive to the point where she very nearly committed suicide at one point. It's Eiko's song that snaps Kongming out of his confusion upon first arriving in “Hell” (Shibuya on Halloween), and when they meet again the next day, he's wholeheartedly ready to back Eiko's career. Does it matter that he doesn't know anything about the 21st century's music scene? Not in the slightest; the episode does a very good job of showing us just how quickly he picks things up without actually stopping to say, “Hey, this guy picks up new skills really fast” in a beautiful display of showing versus telling. (His pride that he's got his own Wiki is pretty funny.) Since he's been brought to the world without war that he wished for, what better use of his prodigious intellect and tactical knowledge than to back the girl who saved him and is in need of a helping hand herself?    There's something really heartwarming about Kongming's and Eiko's relationship, even if she is totally thrown by him roughly every three minutes, and it helps that the episode doesn't skimp on the animation or the music – not counting the ending theme, we hear Eiko sing three separate songs, which is better than most idol shows. There's also nice detail in the art, from Kongming holding his sleeve back as he plays go to the clutter of Eiko's small apartment, and the occasional foray into chibi land doesn't detract from this. Honestly, this was just a really entertaining half-hour, and if it wasn't on your radar, I'd urge you to check it out.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Although the Romance of the Three Kingdoms talk went right over my head, the show clearly lays out the two most important things for us to know about Kongming: 1) he was a master strategist, and 2) his side lost. Therefore, it's possible he sees this gig not only as his second chance at life but also his second chance to win—albeit through philosophy rather than warfare.    One thing I love about this episode is how it addresses the absurdity of its premise. Why is he in Japan in the modern day? Why can he understand Japanese? Why is he young again? Why does he encounter the one person who will not only deal with his apparent eccentricities but even bring him into her home? Why does he meet the one boss who will hire him on the spot? The answer to all of these questions is the same: some divine force willed it to be so. His task is to support Eiko, full stop.    Of course, it helps that the show is willing to use this all for comedy.Whether it is Kongming going from having never seen a computer before to asking Eiko about the blockchain over the course of a few hours, or him becoming a master bartender after just listening to Eiko's instructions once, there are a ton of good laughs as we get all those pesky questions out of the way and set up both the premise and our characters.    The other great thing about the episode is that it understands that the most important thing to have in a show about an up-and-coming singer is the music to match. If the songs don't wow you, you can't believe that the supposedly talented singers will make it big, robbing the show of its drama. Honestly, I'm saddened we didn't spend more time listening to Eiko sing (though with runtime limitations I understand why we didn't).

Community score: 4.2              What is this?   General of the Three Kingdoms, Kongming, had struggled his whole life, facing countless battles that made him into the accomplished strategist he was. So on his deathbed, he wished only to be reborn into a peaceful world... and was sent straight to modern-day party-central, Tokyo. The brilliant strategist Kongming will have to adapt to the wild beats and even wilder party people of the modern age.    Ya Boy Kongming! is based on Yuto Yotsuba and Ryō Ogawa's manga and streams on HIDIVE on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                For a second, I was tempted to call the premise of this one old hat – yoinking a historic figure from the past and tossing them into the present day has been a go-to premise for comedy movies for ages. But there really haven't been too many of those in anime the last few years, since the current obsession is taking a boring-ass dude from our world and tossing him to a theoretically more interesting setting to get his stank all over that place. So in a way this time transplant comedy has some novelty on its side, but it definitely needed more than that to sell itself. Thankfully, as of this first episode it's more than managed to surprise me.    For one, I'm shocked how little the series relies on the rote jokes that come with this territory. You of course have the requisite scenes of Kongming learning about smartphones and modern culture, but those moments are sped through in under a minute, and seemingly every character just rolls with him either being a time traveler or a weird LARPer without much fuss. Not only does that keep this introduction feeling less predictable, it allows more time for the story to dig into sentiment alongside its goofy time-hopping setup. For all that this is a chance for nerdy history references, they take the time to give both Kongming and Eiko likable personalities and moments of emotional sincerity that seriously gripped me.    I was also surprised at how relatively in-depth the show gets with its central musical hook. I'm used to musical anime being idol shows that rarely dip their toes into the actual mechanics of music or the larger world of genres outside of marketable pop ballads. But Ya Boy Kongming! shows a lot of knowledge about music as a whole, from Eiko having a phone filled with EDM and Hip-Hop to discussing how the club she works at plays tracks with different BPM depending on the time of night and how many people are around. Eiko's music is pretty, if not particularly memorable, but the detail and attention being paid here makes me hopeful that the story can use music as more than just a marketing gimmick.    It's also just really well produced so far. The standout scenes are Eiko's first stage appearance and, later, her practice session in her apartment. Both are short but gorgeous sequences of character acting, and do a lot to sell you on why Kongming would suddenly devote himself to becoming her “tactician” to support her career. Really, the entire premiere just looks rock solid – great use of color, strong character designs that are distinct but all gel together effortlessly, and an altogether pleasant aesthetic to lean on. Put together it makes for a much stronger premiere than you might expect, and I'll definitely be staying for another performance.
