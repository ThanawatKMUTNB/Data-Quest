Streaming                     Synopsis:             After he sees a particularly skillful player during a televised futsal match, high schooler Haru Yamato becomes inspired to play the sport, despite some uncomfortable associations with it. He enrolls at Koyo Gakuen with the intent to play on their team, only to find that it's very small and perhaps doesn't have the greatest track record. Undeterred, he and his fellow players work their hardest to propel Koyo into the national spotlight, but that will require more than just improving their individual skills: they've got a lot to learn about playing as a team before they can even begin to rise to the heights they aspire to.      Review:         Synopsis:        After he sees a particularly skillful player during a televised futsal match, high schooler Haru Yamato becomes inspired to play the sport, despite some uncomfortable associations with it. He enrolls at Koyo Gakuen with the intent to play on their team, only to find that it's very small and perhaps doesn't have the greatest track record. Undeterred, he and his fellow players work their hardest to propel Koyo into the national spotlight, but that will require more than just improving their individual skills: they've got a lot to learn about playing as a team before they can even begin to rise to the heights they aspire to.     Review:            In the novel Reaper Man, the late, great Terry Pratchett remarked that “Five exclamation marks [are] the sure sign of an insane mind.” While Futsal Boys!!!!! isn't alone in its enthusiasm for its own title, it also isn't up to the task of living up to it, either in terms of sports-related lunacy or its love of its subject matter – the series is clearly modeling itself after other, more successful sports titles and making that fact just a little too obvious as it strives to capture its audience and makes more than a few missteps along the way.    The most obvious influence on the series would appear to be volleyball series Haikyu!!. That's not just because it's about an underdog team playing a ball sport, but rather because the character dynamics are set up to mimic those which were so successful in Haikyu!!. We have the incredibly excited newcomer, Haru, to fill the Hinata role, grumpy egotistical former star player Sakaki as Kageyama, a bouncy duo, a stoic(ish) captain, and even a third-year player who spends most of the games on the bench so that the perky, talented first years can play. While these character types certainly aren't unique to Haikyu!!, that series is among the most recent to make them a roaring success, and the fact that they're all so easily recognizable in Futsal Boys!!!!! isn't a great sign – especially since the series doesn't give itself the time to develop them into characters beyond their tropes and as a result lacks any real sense of tension or urgency.    Mostly this is an issue of allocation. With only twelve episodes, the series is mostly invested in coming to a conclusion where we've seen the Koyo team improve but unwilling to spend the time to make us care that they've become better players. It isn't enough to harp on Sakaki's unwillingness to pass the ball to anyone; we need to understand why this is an issue long before we do, and the same could be said of most of the team. Captain Toi's preferred group dynamic isn't even mentioned before the final episode, and Taiga's anxiety issues are barely covered before they're once again shoved into the background. Likewise the fact that Haru was studying break dancing (and was really pretty good at it) is barely incorporated into the story, despite the fact that in the first game we see him play he whips out a move that helps him to score a goal. While that one specific move does come back every so often, it's still underutilized, as is his apparently very transferrable skill in general. Why bother to give him that piece of background if it's not going to be used on the regular, especially if it's established early on that using it isn't cheating? Similarly, the issue of Haru's father being a futsal star is barely touched on, which is perhaps the oddest of all of the series' omissions. Shouldn't the other players find this more interesting or significant? Granted, “Yamato” isn't exactly a unique last name, but it's still strikingly odd that his past gets barely any screentime.    What does get most of the series' attention is the vast number of pretty high school boys with oddball uniforms. Koyo plays against several teams in official matches, one of which has a truly unfortunate uniform that combines pastel pink with white tiger stripes (even worse when we consider that most of the Adelbert Gakuen boys have pastel hair), and we meet at least two others, one while at a training camp and the other in passing. The former is made up entirely of professional entertainers and seems to serve very little purpose besides making sure that “hot idols” is ticked off the checklist of “stuff that appeals to girls,” while the latter is the premier high school team in our heroes' region. In fact, their star player is the guy whose moves inspired Haru, but a couple of low-key meetings and a failed grudge match between the two of them doesn't quite merit their presence in the story, which could have moved along with Yamato's idol remaining an off-screen aspiration. That, at least, would have kept their “escaped from a marching band” school uniforms from assaulting our eyes.    This brings us to the series' main fault: it feels very much as if it's just going down a list of things that have done well in shows with male casts that appeal to female viewers in the past without actually realizing what made those shows work. In my own experience, what is primarily appealing about shows like Haikyu!! or IDOLiSH7 is not the fact that they're populated with pretty boys, but the character development and interactions. They could just as easily star garden slugs and be as good, because the ways that the various players evolve as characters is the draw. The team format simply allows for those interactions and developments to happen, and simply being a collection of attractive characters isn't enough to move things along. While Futsal Boys!!!!! does make a token effort in that direction, specifically with the Taiga/Ryu friendship and the Haru/Sakaki rivalry, it doesn't spend the time to make them stand out in the otherwise crowded series. Yes, it's fun to see them play a game and win, but that's not enough to carry an entire story, and just throwing in bits and pieces that have worked in other titles isn't going to make this one particularly memorable.    It's a shame, because futsal (a soccer/football variant developed in Uruguay) isn't a sport that gets a lot of anime airtime and there are elements of this series that are appealing. It also isn't helped by the fact that the art often has perspective issues and that post-action shots are often just a frame or two too long. The voice acting is also fine, although I feel as if there are more effort noises than are typical; possibly this is because the music is a bit underwhelming, making them stand out more. This just isn't as good a story as it could have been, bogged down by trying to throw in too many elements of other, more successful shows and not spending the time to develop any one of them. If you're desperate for a sports show that incorporates futsal, well, maybe check out DAYS instead. Otherwise, this will do in a pinch.

Streaming                     Synopsis:             After he sees a particularly skillful player during a televised futsal match, high schooler Haru Yamato becomes inspired to play the sport, despite some uncomfortable associations with it. He enrolls at Koyo Gakuen with the intent to play on their team, only to find that it's very small and perhaps doesn't have the greatest track record. Undeterred, he and his fellow players work their hardest to propel Koyo into the national spotlight, but that will require more than just improving their individual skills: they've got a lot to learn about playing as a team before they can even begin to rise to the heights they aspire to.      Review:         Synopsis:        After he sees a particularly skillful player during a televised futsal match, high schooler Haru Yamato becomes inspired to play the sport, despite some uncomfortable associations with it. He enrolls at Koyo Gakuen with the intent to play on their team, only to find that it's very small and perhaps doesn't have the greatest track record. Undeterred, he and his fellow players work their hardest to propel Koyo into the national spotlight, but that will require more than just improving their individual skills: they've got a lot to learn about playing as a team before they can even begin to rise to the heights they aspire to.     Review:            In the novel Reaper Man, the late, great Terry Pratchett remarked that “Five exclamation marks [are] the sure sign of an insane mind.” While Futsal Boys!!!!! isn't alone in its enthusiasm for its own title, it also isn't up to the task of living up to it, either in terms of sports-related lunacy or its love of its subject matter – the series is clearly modeling itself after other, more successful sports titles and making that fact just a little too obvious as it strives to capture its audience and makes more than a few missteps along the way.    The most obvious influence on the series would appear to be volleyball series Haikyu!!. That's not just because it's about an underdog team playing a ball sport, but rather because the character dynamics are set up to mimic those which were so successful in Haikyu!!. We have the incredibly excited newcomer, Haru, to fill the Hinata role, grumpy egotistical former star player Sakaki as Kageyama, a bouncy duo, a stoic(ish) captain, and even a third-year player who spends most of the games on the bench so that the perky, talented first years can play. While these character types certainly aren't unique to Haikyu!!, that series is among the most recent to make them a roaring success, and the fact that they're all so easily recognizable in Futsal Boys!!!!! isn't a great sign – especially since the series doesn't give itself the time to develop them into characters beyond their tropes and as a result lacks any real sense of tension or urgency.    Mostly this is an issue of allocation. With only twelve episodes, the series is mostly invested in coming to a conclusion where we've seen the Koyo team improve but unwilling to spend the time to make us care that they've become better players. It isn't enough to harp on Sakaki's unwillingness to pass the ball to anyone; we need to understand why this is an issue long before we do, and the same could be said of most of the team. Captain Toi's preferred group dynamic isn't even mentioned before the final episode, and Taiga's anxiety issues are barely covered before they're once again shoved into the background. Likewise the fact that Haru was studying break dancing (and was really pretty good at it) is barely incorporated into the story, despite the fact that in the first game we see him play he whips out a move that helps him to score a goal. While that one specific move does come back every so often, it's still underutilized, as is his apparently very transferrable skill in general. Why bother to give him that piece of background if it's not going to be used on the regular, especially if it's established early on that using it isn't cheating? Similarly, the issue of Haru's father being a futsal star is barely touched on, which is perhaps the oddest of all of the series' omissions. Shouldn't the other players find this more interesting or significant? Granted, “Yamato” isn't exactly a unique last name, but it's still strikingly odd that his past gets barely any screentime.    What does get most of the series' attention is the vast number of pretty high school boys with oddball uniforms. Koyo plays against several teams in official matches, one of which has a truly unfortunate uniform that combines pastel pink with white tiger stripes (even worse when we consider that most of the Adelbert Gakuen boys have pastel hair), and we meet at least two others, one while at a training camp and the other in passing. The former is made up entirely of professional entertainers and seems to serve very little purpose besides making sure that “hot idols” is ticked off the checklist of “stuff that appeals to girls,” while the latter is the premier high school team in our heroes' region. In fact, their star player is the guy whose moves inspired Haru, but a couple of low-key meetings and a failed grudge match between the two of them doesn't quite merit their presence in the story, which could have moved along with Yamato's idol remaining an off-screen aspiration. That, at least, would have kept their “escaped from a marching band” school uniforms from assaulting our eyes.    This brings us to the series' main fault: it feels very much as if it's just going down a list of things that have done well in shows with male casts that appeal to female viewers in the past without actually realizing what made those shows work. In my own experience, what is primarily appealing about shows like Haikyu!! or IDOLiSH7 is not the fact that they're populated with pretty boys, but the character development and interactions. They could just as easily star garden slugs and be as good, because the ways that the various players evolve as characters is the draw. The team format simply allows for those interactions and developments to happen, and simply being a collection of attractive characters isn't enough to move things along. While Futsal Boys!!!!! does make a token effort in that direction, specifically with the Taiga/Ryu friendship and the Haru/Sakaki rivalry, it doesn't spend the time to make them stand out in the otherwise crowded series. Yes, it's fun to see them play a game and win, but that's not enough to carry an entire story, and just throwing in bits and pieces that have worked in other titles isn't going to make this one particularly memorable.    It's a shame, because futsal (a soccer/football variant developed in Uruguay) isn't a sport that gets a lot of anime airtime and there are elements of this series that are appealing. It also isn't helped by the fact that the art often has perspective issues and that post-action shots are often just a frame or two too long. The voice acting is also fine, although I feel as if there are more effort noises than are typical; possibly this is because the music is a bit underwhelming, making them stand out more. This just isn't as good a story as it could have been, bogged down by trying to throw in too many elements of other, more successful shows and not spending the time to develop any one of them. If you're desperate for a sports show that incorporates futsal, well, maybe check out DAYS instead. Otherwise, this will do in a pinch.

Streaming                     Synopsis:             After he sees a particularly skillful player during a televised futsal match, high schooler Haru Yamato becomes inspired to play the sport, despite some uncomfortable associations with it. He enrolls at Koyo Gakuen with the intent to play on their team, only to find that it's very small and perhaps doesn't have the greatest track record. Undeterred, he and his fellow players work their hardest to propel Koyo into the national spotlight, but that will require more than just improving their individual skills: they've got a lot to learn about playing as a team before they can even begin to rise to the heights they aspire to.      Review:         Synopsis:        After he sees a particularly skillful player during a televised futsal match, high schooler Haru Yamato becomes inspired to play the sport, despite some uncomfortable associations with it. He enrolls at Koyo Gakuen with the intent to play on their team, only to find that it's very small and perhaps doesn't have the greatest track record. Undeterred, he and his fellow players work their hardest to propel Koyo into the national spotlight, but that will require more than just improving their individual skills: they've got a lot to learn about playing as a team before they can even begin to rise to the heights they aspire to.     Review:            In the novel Reaper Man, the late, great Terry Pratchett remarked that “Five exclamation marks [are] the sure sign of an insane mind.” While Futsal Boys!!!!! isn't alone in its enthusiasm for its own title, it also isn't up to the task of living up to it, either in terms of sports-related lunacy or its love of its subject matter – the series is clearly modeling itself after other, more successful sports titles and making that fact just a little too obvious as it strives to capture its audience and makes more than a few missteps along the way.    The most obvious influence on the series would appear to be volleyball series Haikyu!!. That's not just because it's about an underdog team playing a ball sport, but rather because the character dynamics are set up to mimic those which were so successful in Haikyu!!. We have the incredibly excited newcomer, Haru, to fill the Hinata role, grumpy egotistical former star player Sakaki as Kageyama, a bouncy duo, a stoic(ish) captain, and even a third-year player who spends most of the games on the bench so that the perky, talented first years can play. While these character types certainly aren't unique to Haikyu!!, that series is among the most recent to make them a roaring success, and the fact that they're all so easily recognizable in Futsal Boys!!!!! isn't a great sign – especially since the series doesn't give itself the time to develop them into characters beyond their tropes and as a result lacks any real sense of tension or urgency.    Mostly this is an issue of allocation. With only twelve episodes, the series is mostly invested in coming to a conclusion where we've seen the Koyo team improve but unwilling to spend the time to make us care that they've become better players. It isn't enough to harp on Sakaki's unwillingness to pass the ball to anyone; we need to understand why this is an issue long before we do, and the same could be said of most of the team. Captain Toi's preferred group dynamic isn't even mentioned before the final episode, and Taiga's anxiety issues are barely covered before they're once again shoved into the background. Likewise the fact that Haru was studying break dancing (and was really pretty good at it) is barely incorporated into the story, despite the fact that in the first game we see him play he whips out a move that helps him to score a goal. While that one specific move does come back every so often, it's still underutilized, as is his apparently very transferrable skill in general. Why bother to give him that piece of background if it's not going to be used on the regular, especially if it's established early on that using it isn't cheating? Similarly, the issue of Haru's father being a futsal star is barely touched on, which is perhaps the oddest of all of the series' omissions. Shouldn't the other players find this more interesting or significant? Granted, “Yamato” isn't exactly a unique last name, but it's still strikingly odd that his past gets barely any screentime.    What does get most of the series' attention is the vast number of pretty high school boys with oddball uniforms. Koyo plays against several teams in official matches, one of which has a truly unfortunate uniform that combines pastel pink with white tiger stripes (even worse when we consider that most of the Adelbert Gakuen boys have pastel hair), and we meet at least two others, one while at a training camp and the other in passing. The former is made up entirely of professional entertainers and seems to serve very little purpose besides making sure that “hot idols” is ticked off the checklist of “stuff that appeals to girls,” while the latter is the premier high school team in our heroes' region. In fact, their star player is the guy whose moves inspired Haru, but a couple of low-key meetings and a failed grudge match between the two of them doesn't quite merit their presence in the story, which could have moved along with Yamato's idol remaining an off-screen aspiration. That, at least, would have kept their “escaped from a marching band” school uniforms from assaulting our eyes.    This brings us to the series' main fault: it feels very much as if it's just going down a list of things that have done well in shows with male casts that appeal to female viewers in the past without actually realizing what made those shows work. In my own experience, what is primarily appealing about shows like Haikyu!! or IDOLiSH7 is not the fact that they're populated with pretty boys, but the character development and interactions. They could just as easily star garden slugs and be as good, because the ways that the various players evolve as characters is the draw. The team format simply allows for those interactions and developments to happen, and simply being a collection of attractive characters isn't enough to move things along. While Futsal Boys!!!!! does make a token effort in that direction, specifically with the Taiga/Ryu friendship and the Haru/Sakaki rivalry, it doesn't spend the time to make them stand out in the otherwise crowded series. Yes, it's fun to see them play a game and win, but that's not enough to carry an entire story, and just throwing in bits and pieces that have worked in other titles isn't going to make this one particularly memorable.    It's a shame, because futsal (a soccer/football variant developed in Uruguay) isn't a sport that gets a lot of anime airtime and there are elements of this series that are appealing. It also isn't helped by the fact that the art often has perspective issues and that post-action shots are often just a frame or two too long. The voice acting is also fine, although I feel as if there are more effort noises than are typical; possibly this is because the music is a bit underwhelming, making them stand out more. This just isn't as good a story as it could have been, bogged down by trying to throw in too many elements of other, more successful shows and not spending the time to develop any one of them. If you're desperate for a sports show that incorporates futsal, well, maybe check out DAYS instead. Otherwise, this will do in a pinch.             Grade:      Overall (sub) : C Story : C- Animation : B- Art : B- Music : C  + Decent premise and character designs, a few interesting story elements. − Premise and plot aren't used well in favor of cramming in too many popular bits and pieces, story doesn't develop fully.

Streaming                     Synopsis:             After he sees a particularly skillful player during a televised futsal match, high schooler Haru Yamato becomes inspired to play the sport, despite some uncomfortable associations with it. He enrolls at Koyo Gakuen with the intent to play on their team, only to find that it's very small and perhaps doesn't have the greatest track record. Undeterred, he and his fellow players work their hardest to propel Koyo into the national spotlight, but that will require more than just improving their individual skills: they've got a lot to learn about playing as a team before they can even begin to rise to the heights they aspire to.      Review:         Synopsis:        After he sees a particularly skillful player during a televised futsal match, high schooler Haru Yamato becomes inspired to play the sport, despite some uncomfortable associations with it. He enrolls at Koyo Gakuen with the intent to play on their team, only to find that it's very small and perhaps doesn't have the greatest track record. Undeterred, he and his fellow players work their hardest to propel Koyo into the national spotlight, but that will require more than just improving their individual skills: they've got a lot to learn about playing as a team before they can even begin to rise to the heights they aspire to.     Review:            In the novel Reaper Man, the late, great Terry Pratchett remarked that “Five exclamation marks [are] the sure sign of an insane mind.” While Futsal Boys!!!!! isn't alone in its enthusiasm for its own title, it also isn't up to the task of living up to it, either in terms of sports-related lunacy or its love of its subject matter – the series is clearly modeling itself after other, more successful sports titles and making that fact just a little too obvious as it strives to capture its audience and makes more than a few missteps along the way.    The most obvious influence on the series would appear to be volleyball series Haikyu!!. That's not just because it's about an underdog team playing a ball sport, but rather because the character dynamics are set up to mimic those which were so successful in Haikyu!!. We have the incredibly excited newcomer, Haru, to fill the Hinata role, grumpy egotistical former star player Sakaki as Kageyama, a bouncy duo, a stoic(ish) captain, and even a third-year player who spends most of the games on the bench so that the perky, talented first years can play. While these character types certainly aren't unique to Haikyu!!, that series is among the most recent to make them a roaring success, and the fact that they're all so easily recognizable in Futsal Boys!!!!! isn't a great sign – especially since the series doesn't give itself the time to develop them into characters beyond their tropes and as a result lacks any real sense of tension or urgency.    Mostly this is an issue of allocation. With only twelve episodes, the series is mostly invested in coming to a conclusion where we've seen the Koyo team improve but unwilling to spend the time to make us care that they've become better players. It isn't enough to harp on Sakaki's unwillingness to pass the ball to anyone; we need to understand why this is an issue long before we do, and the same could be said of most of the team. Captain Toi's preferred group dynamic isn't even mentioned before the final episode, and Taiga's anxiety issues are barely covered before they're once again shoved into the background. Likewise the fact that Haru was studying break dancing (and was really pretty good at it) is barely incorporated into the story, despite the fact that in the first game we see him play he whips out a move that helps him to score a goal. While that one specific move does come back every so often, it's still underutilized, as is his apparently very transferrable skill in general. Why bother to give him that piece of background if it's not going to be used on the regular, especially if it's established early on that using it isn't cheating? Similarly, the issue of Haru's father being a futsal star is barely touched on, which is perhaps the oddest of all of the series' omissions. Shouldn't the other players find this more interesting or significant? Granted, “Yamato” isn't exactly a unique last name, but it's still strikingly odd that his past gets barely any screentime.    What does get most of the series' attention is the vast number of pretty high school boys with oddball uniforms. Koyo plays against several teams in official matches, one of which has a truly unfortunate uniform that combines pastel pink with white tiger stripes (even worse when we consider that most of the Adelbert Gakuen boys have pastel hair), and we meet at least two others, one while at a training camp and the other in passing. The former is made up entirely of professional entertainers and seems to serve very little purpose besides making sure that “hot idols” is ticked off the checklist of “stuff that appeals to girls,” while the latter is the premier high school team in our heroes' region. In fact, their star player is the guy whose moves inspired Haru, but a couple of low-key meetings and a failed grudge match between the two of them doesn't quite merit their presence in the story, which could have moved along with Yamato's idol remaining an off-screen aspiration. That, at least, would have kept their “escaped from a marching band” school uniforms from assaulting our eyes.    This brings us to the series' main fault: it feels very much as if it's just going down a list of things that have done well in shows with male casts that appeal to female viewers in the past without actually realizing what made those shows work. In my own experience, what is primarily appealing about shows like Haikyu!! or IDOLiSH7 is not the fact that they're populated with pretty boys, but the character development and interactions. They could just as easily star garden slugs and be as good, because the ways that the various players evolve as characters is the draw. The team format simply allows for those interactions and developments to happen, and simply being a collection of attractive characters isn't enough to move things along. While Futsal Boys!!!!! does make a token effort in that direction, specifically with the Taiga/Ryu friendship and the Haru/Sakaki rivalry, it doesn't spend the time to make them stand out in the otherwise crowded series. Yes, it's fun to see them play a game and win, but that's not enough to carry an entire story, and just throwing in bits and pieces that have worked in other titles isn't going to make this one particularly memorable.    It's a shame, because futsal (a soccer/football variant developed in Uruguay) isn't a sport that gets a lot of anime airtime and there are elements of this series that are appealing. It also isn't helped by the fact that the art often has perspective issues and that post-action shots are often just a frame or two too long. The voice acting is also fine, although I feel as if there are more effort noises than are typical; possibly this is because the music is a bit underwhelming, making them stand out more. This just isn't as good a story as it could have been, bogged down by trying to throw in too many elements of other, more successful shows and not spending the time to develop any one of them. If you're desperate for a sports show that incorporates futsal, well, maybe check out DAYS instead. Otherwise, this will do in a pinch.             Grade:      Overall (sub) : C Story : C- Animation : B- Art : B- Music : C  + Decent premise and character designs, a few interesting story elements. − Premise and plot aren't used well in favor of cramming in too many popular bits and pieces, story doesn't develop fully.

The team format simply allows for those interactions and developments to happen, and simply being a collection of attractive characters isn't enough to move things along. While Futsal Boys!!!!! does make a token effort in that direction, specifically with the Taiga/Ryu friendship and the Haru/Sakaki rivalry, it doesn't spend the time to make them stand out in the otherwise crowded series. Yes, it's fun to see them play a game and win, but that's not enough to carry an entire story, and just throwing in bits and pieces that have worked in other titles isn't going to make this one particularly memorable.    It's a shame, because futsal (a soccer/football variant developed in Uruguay) isn't a sport that gets a lot of anime airtime and there are elements of this series that are appealing. It also isn't helped by the fact that the art often has perspective issues and that post-action shots are often just a frame or two too long. The voice acting is also fine, although I feel as if there are more effort noises than are typical; possibly this is because the music is a bit underwhelming, making them stand out more. This just isn't as good a story as it could have been, bogged down by trying to throw in too many elements of other, more successful shows and not spending the time to develop any one of them. If you're desperate for a sports show that incorporates futsal, well, maybe check out DAYS instead. Otherwise, this will do in a pinch.

Streaming                     Synopsis:             After he sees a particularly skillful player during a televised futsal match, high schooler Haru Yamato becomes inspired to play the sport, despite some uncomfortable associations with it. He enrolls at Koyo Gakuen with the intent to play on their team, only to find that it's very small and perhaps doesn't have the greatest track record. Undeterred, he and his fellow players work their hardest to propel Koyo into the national spotlight, but that will require more than just improving their individual skills: they've got a lot to learn about playing as a team before they can even begin to rise to the heights they aspire to.      Review:         Synopsis:        After he sees a particularly skillful player during a televised futsal match, high schooler Haru Yamato becomes inspired to play the sport, despite some uncomfortable associations with it. He enrolls at Koyo Gakuen with the intent to play on their team, only to find that it's very small and perhaps doesn't have the greatest track record. Undeterred, he and his fellow players work their hardest to propel Koyo into the national spotlight, but that will require more than just improving their individual skills: they've got a lot to learn about playing as a team before they can even begin to rise to the heights they aspire to.     Review:            In the novel Reaper Man, the late, great Terry Pratchett remarked that “Five exclamation marks [are] the sure sign of an insane mind.” While Futsal Boys!!!!! isn't alone in its enthusiasm for its own title, it also isn't up to the task of living up to it, either in terms of sports-related lunacy or its love of its subject matter – the series is clearly modeling itself after other, more successful sports titles and making that fact just a little too obvious as it strives to capture its audience and makes more than a few missteps along the way.    The most obvious influence on the series would appear to be volleyball series Haikyu!!. That's not just because it's about an underdog team playing a ball sport, but rather because the character dynamics are set up to mimic those which were so successful in Haikyu!!. We have the incredibly excited newcomer, Haru, to fill the Hinata role, grumpy egotistical former star player Sakaki as Kageyama, a bouncy duo, a stoic(ish) captain, and even a third-year player who spends most of the games on the bench so that the perky, talented first years can play. While these character types certainly aren't unique to Haikyu!!, that series is among the most recent to make them a roaring success, and the fact that they're all so easily recognizable in Futsal Boys!!!!! isn't a great sign – especially since the series doesn't give itself the time to develop them into characters beyond their tropes and as a result lacks any real sense of tension or urgency.    Mostly this is an issue of allocation. With only twelve episodes, the series is mostly invested in coming to a conclusion where we've seen the Koyo team improve but unwilling to spend the time to make us care that they've become better players. It isn't enough to harp on Sakaki's unwillingness to pass the ball to anyone; we need to understand why this is an issue long before we do, and the same could be said of most of the team. Captain Toi's preferred group dynamic isn't even mentioned before the final episode, and Taiga's anxiety issues are barely covered before they're once again shoved into the background. Likewise the fact that Haru was studying break dancing (and was really pretty good at it) is barely incorporated into the story, despite the fact that in the first game we see him play he whips out a move that helps him to score a goal. While that one specific move does come back every so often, it's still underutilized, as is his apparently very transferrable skill in general. Why bother to give him that piece of background if it's not going to be used on the regular, especially if it's established early on that using it isn't cheating? Similarly, the issue of Haru's father being a futsal star is barely touched on, which is perhaps the oddest of all of the series' omissions. Shouldn't the other players find this more interesting or significant? Granted, “Yamato” isn't exactly a unique last name, but it's still strikingly odd that his past gets barely any screentime.    What does get most of the series' attention is the vast number of pretty high school boys with oddball uniforms. Koyo plays against several teams in official matches, one of which has a truly unfortunate uniform that combines pastel pink with white tiger stripes (even worse when we consider that most of the Adelbert Gakuen boys have pastel hair), and we meet at least two others, one while at a training camp and the other in passing. The former is made up entirely of professional entertainers and seems to serve very little purpose besides making sure that “hot idols” is ticked off the checklist of “stuff that appeals to girls,” while the latter is the premier high school team in our heroes' region. In fact, their star player is the guy whose moves inspired Haru, but a couple of low-key meetings and a failed grudge match between the two of them doesn't quite merit their presence in the story, which could have moved along with Yamato's idol remaining an off-screen aspiration. That, at least, would have kept their “escaped from a marching band” school uniforms from assaulting our eyes.    This brings us to the series' main fault: it feels very much as if it's just going down a list of things that have done well in shows with male casts that appeal to female viewers in the past without actually realizing what made those shows work. In my own experience, what is primarily appealing about shows like Haikyu!! or IDOLiSH7 is not the fact that they're populated with pretty boys, but the character development and interactions.

The most obvious influence on the series would appear to be volleyball series Haikyu!!. That's not just because it's about an underdog team playing a ball sport, but rather because the character dynamics are set up to mimic those which were so successful in Haikyu!!. We have the incredibly excited newcomer, Haru, to fill the Hinata role, grumpy egotistical former star player Sakaki as Kageyama, a bouncy duo, a stoic(ish) captain, and even a third-year player who spends most of the games on the bench so that the perky, talented first years can play. While these character types certainly aren't unique to Haikyu!!, that series is among the most recent to make them a roaring success, and the fact that they're all so easily recognizable in Futsal Boys!!!!! isn't a great sign – especially since the series doesn't give itself the time to develop them into characters beyond their tropes and as a result lacks any real sense of tension or urgency.    Mostly this is an issue of allocation. With only twelve episodes, the series is mostly invested in coming to a conclusion where we've seen the Koyo team improve but unwilling to spend the time to make us care that they've become better players. It isn't enough to harp on Sakaki's unwillingness to pass the ball to anyone; we need to understand why this is an issue long before we do, and the same could be said of most of the team. Captain Toi's preferred group dynamic isn't even mentioned before the final episode, and Taiga's anxiety issues are barely covered before they're once again shoved into the background. Likewise the fact that Haru was studying break dancing (and was really pretty good at it) is barely incorporated into the story, despite the fact that in the first game we see him play he whips out a move that helps him to score a goal. While that one specific move does come back every so often, it's still underutilized, as is his apparently very transferrable skill in general. Why bother to give him that piece of background if it's not going to be used on the regular, especially if it's established early on that using it isn't cheating? Similarly, the issue of Haru's father being a futsal star is barely touched on, which is perhaps the oddest of all of the series' omissions. Shouldn't the other players find this more interesting or significant? Granted, “Yamato” isn't exactly a unique last name, but it's still strikingly odd that his past gets barely any screentime.    What does get most of the series' attention is the vast number of pretty high school boys with oddball uniforms. Koyo plays against several teams in official matches, one of which has a truly unfortunate uniform that combines pastel pink with white tiger stripes (even worse when we consider that most of the Adelbert Gakuen boys have pastel hair), and we meet at least two others, one while at a training camp and the other in passing. The former is made up entirely of professional entertainers and seems to serve very little purpose besides making sure that “hot idols” is ticked off the checklist of “stuff that appeals to girls,” while the latter is the premier high school team in our heroes' region. In fact, their star player is the guy whose moves inspired Haru, but a couple of low-key meetings and a failed grudge match between the two of them doesn't quite merit their presence in the story, which could have moved along with Yamato's idol remaining an off-screen aspiration. That, at least, would have kept their “escaped from a marching band” school uniforms from assaulting our eyes.    This brings us to the series' main fault: it feels very much as if it's just going down a list of things that have done well in shows with male casts that appeal to female viewers in the past without actually realizing what made those shows work. In my own experience, what is primarily appealing about shows like Haikyu!! or IDOLiSH7 is not the fact that they're populated with pretty boys, but the character development and interactions. They could just as easily star garden slugs and be as good, because the ways that the various players evolve as characters is the draw. The team format simply allows for those interactions and developments to happen, and simply being a collection of attractive characters isn't enough to move things along. While Futsal Boys!!!!! does make a token effort in that direction, specifically with the Taiga/Ryu friendship and the Haru/Sakaki rivalry, it doesn't spend the time to make them stand out in the otherwise crowded series. Yes, it's fun to see them play a game and win, but that's not enough to carry an entire story, and just throwing in bits and pieces that have worked in other titles isn't going to make this one particularly memorable.    It's a shame, because futsal (a soccer/football variant developed in Uruguay) isn't a sport that gets a lot of anime airtime and there are elements of this series that are appealing. It also isn't helped by the fact that the art often has perspective issues and that post-action shots are often just a frame or two too long. The voice acting is also fine, although I feel as if there are more effort noises than are typical; possibly this is because the music is a bit underwhelming, making them stand out more.

19-04-2022,anime,1,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/futsal-boys/streaming/.184121,Futsal Boys!!!!! Streaming - Review - Anime News Network:SEA,"  In the novel Reaper Man, the late, great Terry Pratchett remarked that “Five exclamation marks [are] the sure sign of an insane mind.” While Futsal Boys!!!!! isn't alone in its enthusiasm for its own title, it also isn't up to the task of living up to it, either in terms of sports-related lunacy or its love of its subject matter – the series is clearly modeling itself after other, more successful sports titles and making that fact just a little too obvious as it strives to capture its audience and makes more than a few missteps along the way.    The most obvious influence on the series would appear to be volleyball series Haikyu!!. That's not just because it's about an underdog team playing a ball sport, but rather because the character dynamics are set up to mimic those which were so successful in Haikyu!!. We have the incredibly excited newcomer, Haru, to fill the Hinata role, grumpy egotistical former star player Sakaki as Kageyama, a bouncy duo, a stoic(ish) captain, and even a third-year player who spends most of the games on the bench so that the perky, talented first years can play. While these character types certainly aren't unique to Haikyu!!, that series is among the most recent to make them a roaring success, and the fact that they're all so easily recognizable in Futsal Boys!!!!! isn't a great sign – especially since the series doesn't give itself the time to develop them into characters beyond their tropes and as a result lacks any real sense of tension or urgency.    Mostly this is an issue of allocation. With only twelve episodes, the series is mostly invested in coming to a conclusion where we've seen the Koyo team improve but unwilling to spend the time to make us care that they've become better players. It isn't enough to harp on Sakaki's unwillingness to pass the ball to anyone; we need to understand why this is an issue long before we do, and the same could be said of most of the team. Captain Toi's preferred group dynamic isn't even mentioned before the final episode, and Taiga's anxiety issues are barely covered before they're once again shoved into the background. Likewise the fact that Haru was studying break dancing (and was really pretty good at it) is barely incorporated into the story, despite the fact that in the first game we see him play he whips out a move that helps him to score a goal. While that one specific move does come back every so often, it's still underutilized, as is his apparently very transferrable skill in general. Why bother to give him that piece of background if it's not going to be used on the regular, especially if it's established early on that using it isn't cheating? Similarly, the issue of Haru's father being a futsal star is barely touched on, which is perhaps the oddest of all of the series' omissions. Shouldn't the other players find this more interesting or significant? Granted, “Yamato” isn't exactly a unique last name, but it's still strikingly odd that his past gets barely any screentime.    What does get most of the series' attention is the vast number of pretty high school boys with oddball uniforms. Koyo plays against several teams in official matches, one of which has a truly unfortunate uniform that combines pastel pink with white tiger stripes (even worse when we consider that most of the Adelbert Gakuen boys have pastel hair), and we meet at least two others, one while at a training camp and the other in passing. The former is made up entirely of professional entertainers and seems to serve very little purpose besides making sure that “hot idols” is ticked off the checklist of “stuff that appeals to girls,” while the latter is the premier high school team in our heroes' region. In fact, their star player is the guy whose moves inspired Haru, but a couple of low-key meetings and a failed grudge match between the two of them doesn't quite merit their presence in the story, which could have moved along with Yamato's idol remaining an off-screen aspiration. That, at least, would have kept their “escaped from a marching band” school uniforms from assaulting our eyes.    This brings us to the series' main fault: it feels very much as if it's just going down a list of things that have done well in shows with male casts that appeal to female viewers in the past without actually realizing what made those shows work. In my own experience, what is primarily appealing about shows like Haikyu!! or IDOLiSH7 is not the fact that they're populated with pretty boys, but the character development and interactions. They could just as easily star garden slugs and be as good, because the ways that the various players evolve as characters is the draw. The team format simply allows for those interactions and developments to happen, and simply being a collection of attractive characters isn't enough to move things along. While Futsal Boys!!!!! does make a token effort in that direction, specifically with the Taiga/Ryu friendship and the Haru/Sakaki rivalry, it doesn't spend the time to make them stand out in the otherwise crowded series. Yes, it's fun to see them play a game and win, but that's not enough to carry an entire story, and just throwing in bits and pieces that have worked in other titles isn't going to make this one particularly memorable.    It's a shame, because futsal (a soccer/football variant developed in Uruguay) isn't a sport that gets a lot of anime airtime and there are elements of this series that are appealing. It also isn't helped by the fact that the art often has perspective issues and that post-action shots are often just a frame or two too long. The voice acting is also fine, although I feel as if there are more effort noises than are typical; possibly this is because the music is a bit underwhelming, making them stand out more. This just isn't as good a story as it could have been, bogged down by trying to throw in too many elements of other, more successful shows and not spending the time to develop any one of them. If you're desperate for a sports show that incorporates futsal, well, maybe check out DAYS instead. Otherwise, this will do in a pinch.

Episodes 1-3  by Christopher Farris, Apr 16th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.2                  How would you rate episode 2 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.5                  How would you rate episode 3 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.5            The first episode of Ya Boy Kongming! does an effective (and delightful) job of laying out its establishing premise: Three Kingdoms-era strategist Kongming finds himself reincarnated into modern-day Japan, where he winds up tending both a bar and the career of aspiring songstress Eiko. It's fun, it's funny, and perhaps surprisingly cute in its wholesome handling of the whole affair and making clear just how moe ol' Zhuge Liang can be. Past the central time-travel gimmick, that first episode also clearly demonstrates just how instrumental the musical element of the story will be moving forward, featuring several performances from Eiko (including a lovingly-rendered and particularly moving one in her apartment halfway through the episode) and even sprinkling in some base knowledge of musical technicalities that it can work off going forward. It's just getting started, but it's still a good time.    But it's the second (and by extension, third) episode of this anime that better showcases the actual structure of the show and its further charms. Kongming formally takes on the role of Eiko's manager and we'll be following her path to stardom step by step, with each part punctuated by the strategist demonstrating his latest Zany Scheme™ in getting her there, potentially rooted in some famous or mythologized bit from Kongming's history. And that, I must tell you, is where I really fell in love with this show. Just seeing Kongming help Eiko out would be pleasant enough, since they're both so appealing and easy to root for, but couching those efforts in demonstrations of strategy and mind games gives things a narrative thrust as well. It's the sort of thing that makes any story based on competition (combat-based or otherwise) interesting, especially when structured on an episodic basis like this. It keeps us engaged as our own mental gears turn, theorizing about what it is that Kongming has actually done this time as we roll up to the revelation.    It definitely helps that a lot of the elements driving that are seeded by the writing even for those not particularly well-versed in Three Kingdoms history, which as the bar's owner laments, is a distressing amount of people these days. In fact, Kongming's discussions with the owner as they nerd out over those historical elements are there to serve that narrative purpose: It's in these conversations that Kongming's famous strategy of illusion and confusion is referenced before he deploys a variant of it in the second episode, and how he brings up his adherence to ""The Thirty-Six Stratagems"" in the third episode, as well as leading into more personal elements of his past. Like so much of this show, it's not just an entertaining characteristic element; it's also just dang effective storytelling overall.    This reliance on such a structured setup does bring up the potential issue that Ya Boy Kongming might wind up too bound by its own formula as it goes on. The third episode even has the characters call attention to the fact that the obstacle Eiko has to deal with – competing for an audience at the same time as a more well-known musical act – is effectively the same as that from the second episode. One wouldn't want a show like this, which thrives on keeping the audience engaged with increasing stakes and galaxy-brain managerial ploys from Kongming, to fall into such structural staleness. While that's a concern more for the future of the show, the way the setup works also rubs up against a potential thematic concern: The show's framing of competition and adversity. This angle does also make sense; Kongming is a military strategist, so his style specifically thrives off of outmaneuvering somebody else to the advantage of himself and his liege. But some aside comments by the rival band Jet Jacket in the third episode make the point of how other musicians in this structure are working for their big break as much as Eiko is, thus her 'victory' might need to come at the cost of someone else's. As cutthroat as the music industry is known to be, there's the possibility that said structure might feel too harshly adversarial for what is, at its heart, an earnest comedy.    Thankfully, the third episode does end up mitigating that tone in a heartening way by its end, with Kongming extending an olive branch to Jet Jacket in assisting with some of their troubles he previously leveraged to Eiko's success. It brings back the all-around good vibes of the series premiere, and also offers another follow-up on some of that conversational information we got on Kongming: The desire to appreciate the humanity of others and enjoy time spent with them as compensation for missing out on partying with the soldiers in his previous life. That ends up being the strongest new component from that episode; despite being a public-domain historical transplant who serves as this show's fundamental gimmick, we will be seeing some characterization and development for Kongming himself.    It forms a neat parallel with the show's overall structure that strengthens the cohesiveness of the whole thing. Just as Kongming's past strategizing exploits inform his efforts in the modern day, his personal experiences and regrets from his past life inform how he chooses to interact with people now. Kongming was already adorably effective just basically acting as this show's mascot, so confirming that he'll be receiving some of that all-important humanity only makes him more appealing.    Any other concerns for how this show might trend forward are firmly questions for the future. I'm not even entirely opposed to the idea of some adversarial elements. Mia, the rival musician introduced in the second episode, has her propensity for Dick Datastardly-style antics which I pretty well enjoy. Plus, come on, this is a show where the opening features everyone dancing around to ""Chikichiki Banban"" (in what's got to be a contender for opener of the year) – things are probably going to work out generally nicely overall. For now, these are opening episodes that immediately make the conceptual hooks clear for Ya Boy Kongming, a series that can seem like an oddly askew gimmick at first pass, but which I've kind of utterly fallen for by this point in its efforts of establishing itself.

Episodes 1-3  by Christopher Farris, Apr 16th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.2                  How would you rate episode 2 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.5                  How would you rate episode 3 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.5            The first episode of Ya Boy Kongming! does an effective (and delightful) job of laying out its establishing premise: Three Kingdoms-era strategist Kongming finds himself reincarnated into modern-day Japan, where he winds up tending both a bar and the career of aspiring songstress Eiko. It's fun, it's funny, and perhaps surprisingly cute in its wholesome handling of the whole affair and making clear just how moe ol' Zhuge Liang can be. Past the central time-travel gimmick, that first episode also clearly demonstrates just how instrumental the musical element of the story will be moving forward, featuring several performances from Eiko (including a lovingly-rendered and particularly moving one in her apartment halfway through the episode) and even sprinkling in some base knowledge of musical technicalities that it can work off going forward. It's just getting started, but it's still a good time.    But it's the second (and by extension, third) episode of this anime that better showcases the actual structure of the show and its further charms. Kongming formally takes on the role of Eiko's manager and we'll be following her path to stardom step by step, with each part punctuated by the strategist demonstrating his latest Zany Scheme™ in getting her there, potentially rooted in some famous or mythologized bit from Kongming's history. And that, I must tell you, is where I really fell in love with this show. Just seeing Kongming help Eiko out would be pleasant enough, since they're both so appealing and easy to root for, but couching those efforts in demonstrations of strategy and mind games gives things a narrative thrust as well. It's the sort of thing that makes any story based on competition (combat-based or otherwise) interesting, especially when structured on an episodic basis like this. It keeps us engaged as our own mental gears turn, theorizing about what it is that Kongming has actually done this time as we roll up to the revelation.    It definitely helps that a lot of the elements driving that are seeded by the writing even for those not particularly well-versed in Three Kingdoms history, which as the bar's owner laments, is a distressing amount of people these days. In fact, Kongming's discussions with the owner as they nerd out over those historical elements are there to serve that narrative purpose: It's in these conversations that Kongming's famous strategy of illusion and confusion is referenced before he deploys a variant of it in the second episode, and how he brings up his adherence to ""The Thirty-Six Stratagems"" in the third episode, as well as leading into more personal elements of his past. Like so much of this show, it's not just an entertaining characteristic element; it's also just dang effective storytelling overall.    This reliance on such a structured setup does bring up the potential issue that Ya Boy Kongming might wind up too bound by its own formula as it goes on. The third episode even has the characters call attention to the fact that the obstacle Eiko has to deal with – competing for an audience at the same time as a more well-known musical act – is effectively the same as that from the second episode. One wouldn't want a show like this, which thrives on keeping the audience engaged with increasing stakes and galaxy-brain managerial ploys from Kongming, to fall into such structural staleness. While that's a concern more for the future of the show, the way the setup works also rubs up against a potential thematic concern: The show's framing of competition and adversity. This angle does also make sense; Kongming is a military strategist, so his style specifically thrives off of outmaneuvering somebody else to the advantage of himself and his liege. But some aside comments by the rival band Jet Jacket in the third episode make the point of how other musicians in this structure are working for their big break as much as Eiko is, thus her 'victory' might need to come at the cost of someone else's. As cutthroat as the music industry is known to be, there's the possibility that said structure might feel too harshly adversarial for what is, at its heart, an earnest comedy.    Thankfully, the third episode does end up mitigating that tone in a heartening way by its end, with Kongming extending an olive branch to Jet Jacket in assisting with some of their troubles he previously leveraged to Eiko's success. It brings back the all-around good vibes of the series premiere, and also offers another follow-up on some of that conversational information we got on Kongming: The desire to appreciate the humanity of others and enjoy time spent with them as compensation for missing out on partying with the soldiers in his previous life. That ends up being the strongest new component from that episode; despite being a public-domain historical transplant who serves as this show's fundamental gimmick, we will be seeing some characterization and development for Kongming himself.    It forms a neat parallel with the show's overall structure that strengthens the cohesiveness of the whole thing. Just as Kongming's past strategizing exploits inform his efforts in the modern day, his personal experiences and regrets from his past life inform how he chooses to interact with people now. Kongming was already adorably effective just basically acting as this show's mascot, so confirming that he'll be receiving some of that all-important humanity only makes him more appealing.    Any other concerns for how this show might trend forward are firmly questions for the future. I'm not even entirely opposed to the idea of some adversarial elements. Mia, the rival musician introduced in the second episode, has her propensity for Dick Datastardly-style antics which I pretty well enjoy. Plus, come on, this is a show where the opening features everyone dancing around to ""Chikichiki Banban"" (in what's got to be a contender for opener of the year) – things are probably going to work out generally nicely overall. For now, these are opening episodes that immediately make the conceptual hooks clear for Ya Boy Kongming, a series that can seem like an oddly askew gimmick at first pass, but which I've kind of utterly fallen for by this point in its efforts of establishing itself.

Episodes 1-3  by Christopher Farris, Apr 16th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.2                  How would you rate episode 2 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.5                  How would you rate episode 3 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.5            The first episode of Ya Boy Kongming! does an effective (and delightful) job of laying out its establishing premise: Three Kingdoms-era strategist Kongming finds himself reincarnated into modern-day Japan, where he winds up tending both a bar and the career of aspiring songstress Eiko. It's fun, it's funny, and perhaps surprisingly cute in its wholesome handling of the whole affair and making clear just how moe ol' Zhuge Liang can be. Past the central time-travel gimmick, that first episode also clearly demonstrates just how instrumental the musical element of the story will be moving forward, featuring several performances from Eiko (including a lovingly-rendered and particularly moving one in her apartment halfway through the episode) and even sprinkling in some base knowledge of musical technicalities that it can work off going forward. It's just getting started, but it's still a good time.    But it's the second (and by extension, third) episode of this anime that better showcases the actual structure of the show and its further charms. Kongming formally takes on the role of Eiko's manager and we'll be following her path to stardom step by step, with each part punctuated by the strategist demonstrating his latest Zany Scheme™ in getting her there, potentially rooted in some famous or mythologized bit from Kongming's history. And that, I must tell you, is where I really fell in love with this show. Just seeing Kongming help Eiko out would be pleasant enough, since they're both so appealing and easy to root for, but couching those efforts in demonstrations of strategy and mind games gives things a narrative thrust as well. It's the sort of thing that makes any story based on competition (combat-based or otherwise) interesting, especially when structured on an episodic basis like this. It keeps us engaged as our own mental gears turn, theorizing about what it is that Kongming has actually done this time as we roll up to the revelation.    It definitely helps that a lot of the elements driving that are seeded by the writing even for those not particularly well-versed in Three Kingdoms history, which as the bar's owner laments, is a distressing amount of people these days. In fact, Kongming's discussions with the owner as they nerd out over those historical elements are there to serve that narrative purpose: It's in these conversations that Kongming's famous strategy of illusion and confusion is referenced before he deploys a variant of it in the second episode, and how he brings up his adherence to ""The Thirty-Six Stratagems"" in the third episode, as well as leading into more personal elements of his past. Like so much of this show, it's not just an entertaining characteristic element; it's also just dang effective storytelling overall.    This reliance on such a structured setup does bring up the potential issue that Ya Boy Kongming might wind up too bound by its own formula as it goes on. The third episode even has the characters call attention to the fact that the obstacle Eiko has to deal with – competing for an audience at the same time as a more well-known musical act – is effectively the same as that from the second episode. One wouldn't want a show like this, which thrives on keeping the audience engaged with increasing stakes and galaxy-brain managerial ploys from Kongming, to fall into such structural staleness. While that's a concern more for the future of the show, the way the setup works also rubs up against a potential thematic concern: The show's framing of competition and adversity. This angle does also make sense; Kongming is a military strategist, so his style specifically thrives off of outmaneuvering somebody else to the advantage of himself and his liege. But some aside comments by the rival band Jet Jacket in the third episode make the point of how other musicians in this structure are working for their big break as much as Eiko is, thus her 'victory' might need to come at the cost of someone else's. As cutthroat as the music industry is known to be, there's the possibility that said structure might feel too harshly adversarial for what is, at its heart, an earnest comedy.    Thankfully, the third episode does end up mitigating that tone in a heartening way by its end, with Kongming extending an olive branch to Jet Jacket in assisting with some of their troubles he previously leveraged to Eiko's success. It brings back the all-around good vibes of the series premiere, and also offers another follow-up on some of that conversational information we got on Kongming: The desire to appreciate the humanity of others and enjoy time spent with them as compensation for missing out on partying with the soldiers in his previous life. That ends up being the strongest new component from that episode; despite being a public-domain historical transplant who serves as this show's fundamental gimmick, we will be seeing some characterization and development for Kongming himself.    It forms a neat parallel with the show's overall structure that strengthens the cohesiveness of the whole thing. Just as Kongming's past strategizing exploits inform his efforts in the modern day, his personal experiences and regrets from his past life inform how he chooses to interact with people now. Kongming was already adorably effective just basically acting as this show's mascot, so confirming that he'll be receiving some of that all-important humanity only makes him more appealing.    Any other concerns for how this show might trend forward are firmly questions for the future. I'm not even entirely opposed to the idea of some adversarial elements. Mia, the rival musician introduced in the second episode, has her propensity for Dick Datastardly-style antics which I pretty well enjoy. Plus, come on, this is a show where the opening features everyone dancing around to ""Chikichiki Banban"" (in what's got to be a contender for opener of the year) – things are probably going to work out generally nicely overall. For now, these are opening episodes that immediately make the conceptual hooks clear for Ya Boy Kongming, a series that can seem like an oddly askew gimmick at first pass, but which I've kind of utterly fallen for by this point in its efforts of establishing itself.

Episodes 1-3  by Christopher Farris, Apr 16th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.2                  How would you rate episode 2 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.5                  How would you rate episode 3 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.5            The first episode of Ya Boy Kongming! does an effective (and delightful) job of laying out its establishing premise: Three Kingdoms-era strategist Kongming finds himself reincarnated into modern-day Japan, where he winds up tending both a bar and the career of aspiring songstress Eiko. It's fun, it's funny, and perhaps surprisingly cute in its wholesome handling of the whole affair and making clear just how moe ol' Zhuge Liang can be. Past the central time-travel gimmick, that first episode also clearly demonstrates just how instrumental the musical element of the story will be moving forward, featuring several performances from Eiko (including a lovingly-rendered and particularly moving one in her apartment halfway through the episode) and even sprinkling in some base knowledge of musical technicalities that it can work off going forward. It's just getting started, but it's still a good time.    But it's the second (and by extension, third) episode of this anime that better showcases the actual structure of the show and its further charms. Kongming formally takes on the role of Eiko's manager and we'll be following her path to stardom step by step, with each part punctuated by the strategist demonstrating his latest Zany Scheme™ in getting her there, potentially rooted in some famous or mythologized bit from Kongming's history. And that, I must tell you, is where I really fell in love with this show. Just seeing Kongming help Eiko out would be pleasant enough, since they're both so appealing and easy to root for, but couching those efforts in demonstrations of strategy and mind games gives things a narrative thrust as well. It's the sort of thing that makes any story based on competition (combat-based or otherwise) interesting, especially when structured on an episodic basis like this. It keeps us engaged as our own mental gears turn, theorizing about what it is that Kongming has actually done this time as we roll up to the revelation.    It definitely helps that a lot of the elements driving that are seeded by the writing even for those not particularly well-versed in Three Kingdoms history, which as the bar's owner laments, is a distressing amount of people these days. In fact, Kongming's discussions with the owner as they nerd out over those historical elements are there to serve that narrative purpose: It's in these conversations that Kongming's famous strategy of illusion and confusion is referenced before he deploys a variant of it in the second episode, and how he brings up his adherence to ""The Thirty-Six Stratagems"" in the third episode, as well as leading into more personal elements of his past. Like so much of this show, it's not just an entertaining characteristic element; it's also just dang effective storytelling overall.    This reliance on such a structured setup does bring up the potential issue that Ya Boy Kongming might wind up too bound by its own formula as it goes on. The third episode even has the characters call attention to the fact that the obstacle Eiko has to deal with – competing for an audience at the same time as a more well-known musical act – is effectively the same as that from the second episode. One wouldn't want a show like this, which thrives on keeping the audience engaged with increasing stakes and galaxy-brain managerial ploys from Kongming, to fall into such structural staleness. While that's a concern more for the future of the show, the way the setup works also rubs up against a potential thematic concern: The show's framing of competition and adversity. This angle does also make sense; Kongming is a military strategist, so his style specifically thrives off of outmaneuvering somebody else to the advantage of himself and his liege. But some aside comments by the rival band Jet Jacket in the third episode make the point of how other musicians in this structure are working for their big break as much as Eiko is, thus her 'victory' might need to come at the cost of someone else's. As cutthroat as the music industry is known to be, there's the possibility that said structure might feel too harshly adversarial for what is, at its heart, an earnest comedy.    Thankfully, the third episode does end up mitigating that tone in a heartening way by its end, with Kongming extending an olive branch to Jet Jacket in assisting with some of their troubles he previously leveraged to Eiko's success. It brings back the all-around good vibes of the series premiere, and also offers another follow-up on some of that conversational information we got on Kongming: The desire to appreciate the humanity of others and enjoy time spent with them as compensation for missing out on partying with the soldiers in his previous life. That ends up being the strongest new component from that episode; despite being a public-domain historical transplant who serves as this show's fundamental gimmick, we will be seeing some characterization and development for Kongming himself.    It forms a neat parallel with the show's overall structure that strengthens the cohesiveness of the whole thing. Just as Kongming's past strategizing exploits inform his efforts in the modern day, his personal experiences and regrets from his past life inform how he chooses to interact with people now. Kongming was already adorably effective just basically acting as this show's mascot, so confirming that he'll be receiving some of that all-important humanity only makes him more appealing.    Any other concerns for how this show might trend forward are firmly questions for the future. I'm not even entirely opposed to the idea of some adversarial elements. Mia, the rival musician introduced in the second episode, has her propensity for Dick Datastardly-style antics which I pretty well enjoy. Plus, come on, this is a show where the opening features everyone dancing around to ""Chikichiki Banban"" (in what's got to be a contender for opener of the year) – things are probably going to work out generally nicely overall. For now, these are opening episodes that immediately make the conceptual hooks clear for Ya Boy Kongming, a series that can seem like an oddly askew gimmick at first pass, but which I've kind of utterly fallen for by this point in its efforts of establishing itself.

Episodes 1-3  by Christopher Farris, Apr 16th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.2                  How would you rate episode 2 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.5                  How would you rate episode 3 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.5            The first episode of Ya Boy Kongming! does an effective (and delightful) job of laying out its establishing premise: Three Kingdoms-era strategist Kongming finds himself reincarnated into modern-day Japan, where he winds up tending both a bar and the career of aspiring songstress Eiko. It's fun, it's funny, and perhaps surprisingly cute in its wholesome handling of the whole affair and making clear just how moe ol' Zhuge Liang can be. Past the central time-travel gimmick, that first episode also clearly demonstrates just how instrumental the musical element of the story will be moving forward, featuring several performances from Eiko (including a lovingly-rendered and particularly moving one in her apartment halfway through the episode) and even sprinkling in some base knowledge of musical technicalities that it can work off going forward. It's just getting started, but it's still a good time.    But it's the second (and by extension, third) episode of this anime that better showcases the actual structure of the show and its further charms. Kongming formally takes on the role of Eiko's manager and we'll be following her path to stardom step by step, with each part punctuated by the strategist demonstrating his latest Zany Scheme™ in getting her there, potentially rooted in some famous or mythologized bit from Kongming's history. And that, I must tell you, is where I really fell in love with this show. Just seeing Kongming help Eiko out would be pleasant enough, since they're both so appealing and easy to root for, but couching those efforts in demonstrations of strategy and mind games gives things a narrative thrust as well. It's the sort of thing that makes any story based on competition (combat-based or otherwise) interesting, especially when structured on an episodic basis like this. It keeps us engaged as our own mental gears turn, theorizing about what it is that Kongming has actually done this time as we roll up to the revelation.    It definitely helps that a lot of the elements driving that are seeded by the writing even for those not particularly well-versed in Three Kingdoms history, which as the bar's owner laments, is a distressing amount of people these days. In fact, Kongming's discussions with the owner as they nerd out over those historical elements are there to serve that narrative purpose: It's in these conversations that Kongming's famous strategy of illusion and confusion is referenced before he deploys a variant of it in the second episode, and how he brings up his adherence to ""The Thirty-Six Stratagems"" in the third episode, as well as leading into more personal elements of his past. Like so much of this show, it's not just an entertaining characteristic element; it's also just dang effective storytelling overall.    This reliance on such a structured setup does bring up the potential issue that Ya Boy Kongming might wind up too bound by its own formula as it goes on. The third episode even has the characters call attention to the fact that the obstacle Eiko has to deal with – competing for an audience at the same time as a more well-known musical act – is effectively the same as that from the second episode. One wouldn't want a show like this, which thrives on keeping the audience engaged with increasing stakes and galaxy-brain managerial ploys from Kongming, to fall into such structural staleness. While that's a concern more for the future of the show, the way the setup works also rubs up against a potential thematic concern: The show's framing of competition and adversity. This angle does also make sense; Kongming is a military strategist, so his style specifically thrives off of outmaneuvering somebody else to the advantage of himself and his liege. But some aside comments by the rival band Jet Jacket in the third episode make the point of how other musicians in this structure are working for their big break as much as Eiko is, thus her 'victory' might need to come at the cost of someone else's. As cutthroat as the music industry is known to be, there's the possibility that said structure might feel too harshly adversarial for what is, at its heart, an earnest comedy.    Thankfully, the third episode does end up mitigating that tone in a heartening way by its end, with Kongming extending an olive branch to Jet Jacket in assisting with some of their troubles he previously leveraged to Eiko's success. It brings back the all-around good vibes of the series premiere, and also offers another follow-up on some of that conversational information we got on Kongming: The desire to appreciate the humanity of others and enjoy time spent with them as compensation for missing out on partying with the soldiers in his previous life. That ends up being the strongest new component from that episode; despite being a public-domain historical transplant who serves as this show's fundamental gimmick, we will be seeing some characterization and development for Kongming himself.    It forms a neat parallel with the show's overall structure that strengthens the cohesiveness of the whole thing. Just as Kongming's past strategizing exploits inform his efforts in the modern day, his personal experiences and regrets from his past life inform how he chooses to interact with people now. Kongming was already adorably effective just basically acting as this show's mascot, so confirming that he'll be receiving some of that all-important humanity only makes him more appealing.    Any other concerns for how this show might trend forward are firmly questions for the future. I'm not even entirely opposed to the idea of some adversarial elements. Mia, the rival musician introduced in the second episode, has her propensity for Dick Datastardly-style antics which I pretty well enjoy. Plus, come on, this is a show where the opening features everyone dancing around to ""Chikichiki Banban"" (in what's got to be a contender for opener of the year) – things are probably going to work out generally nicely overall. For now, these are opening episodes that immediately make the conceptual hooks clear for Ya Boy Kongming, a series that can seem like an oddly askew gimmick at first pass, but which I've kind of utterly fallen for by this point in its efforts of establishing itself.

Community score: 4.2                  How would you rate episode 2 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.5                  How would you rate episode 3 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.5            The first episode of Ya Boy Kongming! does an effective (and delightful) job of laying out its establishing premise: Three Kingdoms-era strategist Kongming finds himself reincarnated into modern-day Japan, where he winds up tending both a bar and the career of aspiring songstress Eiko. It's fun, it's funny, and perhaps surprisingly cute in its wholesome handling of the whole affair and making clear just how moe ol' Zhuge Liang can be. Past the central time-travel gimmick, that first episode also clearly demonstrates just how instrumental the musical element of the story will be moving forward, featuring several performances from Eiko (including a lovingly-rendered and particularly moving one in her apartment halfway through the episode) and even sprinkling in some base knowledge of musical technicalities that it can work off going forward. It's just getting started, but it's still a good time.    But it's the second (and by extension, third) episode of this anime that better showcases the actual structure of the show and its further charms. Kongming formally takes on the role of Eiko's manager and we'll be following her path to stardom step by step, with each part punctuated by the strategist demonstrating his latest Zany Scheme™ in getting her there, potentially rooted in some famous or mythologized bit from Kongming's history. And that, I must tell you, is where I really fell in love with this show. Just seeing Kongming help Eiko out would be pleasant enough, since they're both so appealing and easy to root for, but couching those efforts in demonstrations of strategy and mind games gives things a narrative thrust as well. It's the sort of thing that makes any story based on competition (combat-based or otherwise) interesting, especially when structured on an episodic basis like this. It keeps us engaged as our own mental gears turn, theorizing about what it is that Kongming has actually done this time as we roll up to the revelation.    It definitely helps that a lot of the elements driving that are seeded by the writing even for those not particularly well-versed in Three Kingdoms history, which as the bar's owner laments, is a distressing amount of people these days. In fact, Kongming's discussions with the owner as they nerd out over those historical elements are there to serve that narrative purpose: It's in these conversations that Kongming's famous strategy of illusion and confusion is referenced before he deploys a variant of it in the second episode, and how he brings up his adherence to ""The Thirty-Six Stratagems"" in the third episode, as well as leading into more personal elements of his past. Like so much of this show, it's not just an entertaining characteristic element; it's also just dang effective storytelling overall.    This reliance on such a structured setup does bring up the potential issue that Ya Boy Kongming might wind up too bound by its own formula as it goes on. The third episode even has the characters call attention to the fact that the obstacle Eiko has to deal with – competing for an audience at the same time as a more well-known musical act – is effectively the same as that from the second episode. One wouldn't want a show like this, which thrives on keeping the audience engaged with increasing stakes and galaxy-brain managerial ploys from Kongming, to fall into such structural staleness. While that's a concern more for the future of the show, the way the setup works also rubs up against a potential thematic concern: The show's framing of competition and adversity. This angle does also make sense; Kongming is a military strategist, so his style specifically thrives off of outmaneuvering somebody else to the advantage of himself and his liege. But some aside comments by the rival band Jet Jacket in the third episode make the point of how other musicians in this structure are working for their big break as much as Eiko is, thus her 'victory' might need to come at the cost of someone else's. As cutthroat as the music industry is known to be, there's the possibility that said structure might feel too harshly adversarial for what is, at its heart, an earnest comedy.    Thankfully, the third episode does end up mitigating that tone in a heartening way by its end, with Kongming extending an olive branch to Jet Jacket in assisting with some of their troubles he previously leveraged to Eiko's success. It brings back the all-around good vibes of the series premiere, and also offers another follow-up on some of that conversational information we got on Kongming: The desire to appreciate the humanity of others and enjoy time spent with them as compensation for missing out on partying with the soldiers in his previous life. That ends up being the strongest new component from that episode; despite being a public-domain historical transplant who serves as this show's fundamental gimmick, we will be seeing some characterization and development for Kongming himself.    It forms a neat parallel with the show's overall structure that strengthens the cohesiveness of the whole thing. Just as Kongming's past strategizing exploits inform his efforts in the modern day, his personal experiences and regrets from his past life inform how he chooses to interact with people now. Kongming was already adorably effective just basically acting as this show's mascot, so confirming that he'll be receiving some of that all-important humanity only makes him more appealing.    Any other concerns for how this show might trend forward are firmly questions for the future. I'm not even entirely opposed to the idea of some adversarial elements. Mia, the rival musician introduced in the second episode, has her propensity for Dick Datastardly-style antics which I pretty well enjoy. Plus, come on, this is a show where the opening features everyone dancing around to ""Chikichiki Banban"" (in what's got to be a contender for opener of the year) – things are probably going to work out generally nicely overall. For now, these are opening episodes that immediately make the conceptual hooks clear for Ya Boy Kongming, a series that can seem like an oddly askew gimmick at first pass, but which I've kind of utterly fallen for by this point in its efforts of establishing itself.

REVIEW: Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision             Note: this is the discussion thread for this article     Anime News Network Forum Index -> Site-related -> Talkback    View previous topic :: View next topic     Author Message        Kirki    Joined: 11 Jun 2019 		    Posts: 213       Posted: Sun Apr 17, 2022 2:43 am            Maybe it's just a personal preference but words can't explain how much I love this series, both the old one and this new one now that it grew on me. I'd argue that the story is much better in anime form than in the light novels, which seemed to be stepping on some serious breaks from the 4th novel onwards. I did not see that in the series at all, instead, it zoomed with relentless speed right up to its finale.    Politicking is number one in LotGH, but small character moments are of equal importance and don't let you get bored through the series 'history documentary' phase. There is so much meat in every episode, from Julian's friend realizing he survived his first battle, Reuenthal's backstory where his mother was essentially bought by his (in name) father and the consequences that resulted into, Mittermeyer's family bringing his future wife purposely into his house, and his goof with the yellow roses, Mittermeyer and Reuenthal's friendship (seriously was the tacky torture scene plucked right out of a BL fanfic or something? So entertaining though!) Oberstein's affection for dogs, Yang refusing to acknowledge the danger he might be into.    I think that what I love the most about this series is that everything just clicks. Everything that's happening will have meaning and severe consequences later on. It just fascinates me that what the audience doesn't realize yet how truly important it was that Kempff was selected to guide the attack at Iserlohn. Eveything, from strategic planning to explaining some aspects of the character's motivations, has or will gain importance. Also keep an eye on Frederica.    Lastly, shout out to the new anime addition of the girl hyping for Reinhard's reforms because she would finally be able to publish her book. ""Honey it wasn't the cencorship's fault in the first place."" Says the husband while feeding their baby. Ouch. Did that guy graduate from University of Savageness or something.

REVIEW: Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision             Note: this is the discussion thread for this article     Anime News Network Forum Index -> Site-related -> Talkback    View previous topic :: View next topic     Author Message        Kirki    Joined: 11 Jun 2019 		    Posts: 213       Posted: Sun Apr 17, 2022 2:43 am            Maybe it's just a personal preference but words can't explain how much I love this series, both the old one and this new one now that it grew on me. I'd argue that the story is much better in anime form than in the light novels, which seemed to be stepping on some serious breaks from the 4th novel onwards. I did not see that in the series at all, instead, it zoomed with relentless speed right up to its finale.    Politicking is number one in LotGH, but small character moments are of equal importance and don't let you get bored through the series 'history documentary' phase. There is so much meat in every episode, from Julian's friend realizing he survived his first battle, Reuenthal's backstory where his mother was essentially bought by his (in name) father and the consequences that resulted into, Mittermeyer's family bringing his future wife purposely into his house, and his goof with the yellow roses, Mittermeyer and Reuenthal's friendship (seriously was the tacky torture scene plucked right out of a BL fanfic or something? So entertaining though!) Oberstein's affection for dogs, Yang refusing to acknowledge the danger he might be into.    I think that what I love the most about this series is that everything just clicks. Everything that's happening will have meaning and severe consequences later on. It just fascinates me that what the audience doesn't realize yet how truly important it was that Kempff was selected to guide the attack at Iserlohn. Eveything, from strategic planning to explaining some aspects of the character's motivations, has or will gain importance. Also keep an eye on Frederica.    Lastly, shout out to the new anime addition of the girl hyping for Reinhard's reforms because she would finally be able to publish her book. ""Honey it wasn't the cencorship's fault in the first place."" Says the husband while feeding their baby. Ouch. Did that guy graduate from University of Savageness or something.

REVIEW: Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision             Note: this is the discussion thread for this article     Anime News Network Forum Index -> Site-related -> Talkback    View previous topic :: View next topic     Author Message        Kirki    Joined: 11 Jun 2019 		    Posts: 213       Posted: Sun Apr 17, 2022 2:43 am            Maybe it's just a personal preference but words can't explain how much I love this series, both the old one and this new one now that it grew on me. I'd argue that the story is much better in anime form than in the light novels, which seemed to be stepping on some serious breaks from the 4th novel onwards. I did not see that in the series at all, instead, it zoomed with relentless speed right up to its finale.    Politicking is number one in LotGH, but small character moments are of equal importance and don't let you get bored through the series 'history documentary' phase. There is so much meat in every episode, from Julian's friend realizing he survived his first battle, Reuenthal's backstory where his mother was essentially bought by his (in name) father and the consequences that resulted into, Mittermeyer's family bringing his future wife purposely into his house, and his goof with the yellow roses, Mittermeyer and Reuenthal's friendship (seriously was the tacky torture scene plucked right out of a BL fanfic or something? So entertaining though!) Oberstein's affection for dogs, Yang refusing to acknowledge the danger he might be into.    I think that what I love the most about this series is that everything just clicks. Everything that's happening will have meaning and severe consequences later on. It just fascinates me that what the audience doesn't realize yet how truly important it was that Kempff was selected to guide the attack at Iserlohn. Eveything, from strategic planning to explaining some aspects of the character's motivations, has or will gain importance. Also keep an eye on Frederica.    Lastly, shout out to the new anime addition of the girl hyping for Reinhard's reforms because she would finally be able to publish her book. ""Honey it wasn't the cencorship's fault in the first place."" Says the husband while feeding their baby. Ouch. Did that guy graduate from University of Savageness or something.

I'd argue that the story is much better in anime form than in the light novels, which seemed to be stepping on some serious breaks from the 4th novel onwards. I did not see that in the series at all, instead, it zoomed with relentless speed right up to its finale.    Politicking is number one in LotGH, but small character moments are of equal importance and don't let you get bored through the series 'history documentary' phase. There is so much meat in every episode, from Julian's friend realizing he survived his first battle, Reuenthal's backstory where his mother was essentially bought by his (in name) father and the consequences that resulted into, Mittermeyer's family bringing his future wife purposely into his house, and his goof with the yellow roses, Mittermeyer and Reuenthal's friendship (seriously was the tacky torture scene plucked right out of a BL fanfic or something? So entertaining though!) Oberstein's affection for dogs, Yang refusing to acknowledge the danger he might be into.    I think that what I love the most about this series is that everything just clicks. Everything that's happening will have meaning and severe consequences later on. It just fascinates me that what the audience doesn't realize yet how truly important it was that Kempff was selected to guide the attack at Iserlohn. Eveything, from strategic planning to explaining some aspects of the character's motivations, has or will gain importance. Also keep an eye on Frederica.

I'd argue that the story is much better in anime form than in the light novels, which seemed to be stepping on some serious breaks from the 4th novel onwards. I did not see that in the series at all, instead, it zoomed with relentless speed right up to its finale.    Politicking is number one in LotGH, but small character moments are of equal importance and don't let you get bored through the series 'history documentary' phase. There is so much meat in every episode, from Julian's friend realizing he survived his first battle, Reuenthal's backstory where his mother was essentially bought by his (in name) father and the consequences that resulted into, Mittermeyer's family bringing his future wife purposely into his house, and his goof with the yellow roses, Mittermeyer and Reuenthal's friendship (seriously was the tacky torture scene plucked right out of a BL fanfic or something? So entertaining though!) Oberstein's affection for dogs, Yang refusing to acknowledge the danger he might be into.    I think that what I love the most about this series is that everything just clicks. Everything that's happening will have meaning and severe consequences later on. It just fascinates me that what the audience doesn't realize yet how truly important it was that Kempff was selected to guide the attack at Iserlohn. Eveything, from strategic planning to explaining some aspects of the character's motivations, has or will gain importance. Also keep an eye on Frederica.

Attack on Titan The Final Season Part 2 Episode 87  by James Beckett, Apr  4th 2022                   How would you rate episode 87 of Attack on Titan The Final Season Part 2 ?                     Community score: 4.4             “I wonder…was there any other choice we could've made? Maybe everything had been decided from the start.” Here, at the end of the season (but not the end of The Final Season!), ""The Dawn of Humanity"" gives its characters one last chance to reflect before they pass the point of no return. To be more specific, it's about Mikasa and Eren, two of the characters we've been with since the very beginning of Attack on Titan. As the crew sails toward Marley, and their final confrontation with their old friend, Mikasa remembers the very last time that she and her friends were truly happy, back when they first set foot in the land across the sea. Eren, on the other hand…we'll get to him. Moments of levity have been few and far between this season (for very understandable reasons), and the episodes that did make the attempt to lighten things up a little in the middle of all this carnage, like with Annie's infamous ""Pie Incident"" a few weeks back, have come up with mixed results. Mikasa's flashback to the gang's first trip to Marley hits all of the right notes, though, because for as zany as the comedy gets, it's all tinged with the utter tragedy of us knowing that this is the last good time these kids are ever going to get, together. Soon, Eren will abandon the plan and rendezvous with Zeke in Liberio, and then the war will begin in earnest.  And when I say ""zany"", I mean zany, because ""The Dawn of Humanity"" wants the inevitable tragedy to sting as much as possible. Sasha gets one last chance to be The Best Character in Attack on Titan™ again when she mistakes a car for a cow and then graphically violates a vanilla ice-cream cone in the span of a couple of minutes. Levi is mistaken for a child gangster by a terrifying clown, Onyakopon is horrified when Sasha and Co. attempt to feed the car carrots, and Hange has to pretend to be Sasha's sister to rescue a refugee pickpocket from the wrath of the Marleyan mob.  Eren is preoccupied with how the Eldians in Marley are being systematically abused and denied the privileges of ice cream and clowns, which Mikasa recognizes as a bit of a red flag in hindsight, but it makes perfect sense to us, knowing what we know. At this point, Eren already knows what he's going to do to this place and these people—what he's going to become—and it's clearly tearing him apart inside.  When Mikasa finds him overlooking the refugee camp and asks him what happened to the boy from the market, he tells her, ""Nothing yet."" It's enough to send chills down your spine. It makes the entirety of the drunken revelry that follows so terribly sad, and not just because we know that soon Eren will be gone, Sasha will be dead, and all of these shenanigans will be a distant memory. If Eren succeeds with his mission, every last one of these refugees will be dead, and the only understanding they will have of their pain and suffering will come from the sight of a hundred titans emerging from the sea to destroy them all.  Mikasa wonders if there was anything they could have done differently to turn Eren away from this path. He's seemed set on it from the moment they attended the hearing over Eldian refugees and learned how deeply the hatred of the Paradis Eldians runs throughout the world, though Mikasa seems to think that Eren might have responded differently if she admitted her feelings for him when he asked her dead on before the party. Could it be that, if Eren had a stronger anchor to this world, something to remind him of his own humanity, he might not have fallen prey to his own darkest impulses? If Eren's half of the episode is anything to go by, the answer is almost certainly no. Mikasa even acknowledges the simple fact of it herself: Maybe Eren has always had this monster living inside of him, and they were just never able (or willing) to see it. After all, from the moment he swore his oath of vengeance as a child, Eren's stated purpose has never really changed. In a way, he has never been able to escape the mindset of that terrified and furious boy he was all the way back in Episode 1, and the fatalistic nihilism that he is embracing now is further proof of that. When a child is confronted with all of the hard and painful truths of the world, and has everything that matters ripped out of their hands, it's only natural that their immediate response would be to throw a tantrum and break everything around them.  So it could be that Eren was always going to go down a path like this, even if nobody could have ever predicted the catastrophic amount of power he would end up wielding. Or perhaps Eren is simply using the perceived permanence of the future he witnessed when he kissed Historia's hand as an excuse to give up the burden of agency. If he is destined to become the beast that kills mankind, then maybe it is better – not to mention easier – to give up on resisting. He can push his friends away, he can use the lie of the Ackerman curse to hurt Mikasa enough for her to give up on him forever, and he can deny the desperate pleas of his Queen. He must. It's already been written in stone…right?  We don't know everything, yet, which makes sense now that we know there is one last ""part"" to go in this Final Season. Attack on Titan has still got to save some surprises for it's endgame, I suppose (and they swear that they mean it, this time, too). Maybe we'll finally get some answers about Historia's pregnancy, which gets teased again despite not being at all relevant to the plot since it first got brought up over a year ago.  There's only one thing that's absolutely certain going into Attack on Titan's climax, and it's that absolutely nobody in the world beyond Paradis will ever forget the face of Eren Jeager for as long as they live (however short a time that may be). While the sight of the Colossal Titans swimming in the ocean was maybe a little goofy (I think it would have been much creepier just to have them walking along the ocean floor), it is impossible to deny the sheer terror of their arrival in Marley. The steam they give off is enough to melt the flesh off of mens' bones, and every step they take crumbles the foundations of civilization into dust.  It's the moment that this story has been building towards for nearly a decade. For Jeagerists like Floch, it's nothing less than the culmination of a lifetime of fighting, the beginning of the Eldians' new golden age. For our heroes, it's the start of their own final battle, and the cost of victory will be steep indeed. For Eren, it's the fulfilling of a dark prophecy that he himself was the author of, making good on the promise a young boy made all those years ago to his mother.  For everyone else, though? It's simply the end of the world.  Rating:                 Attack on Titan The Final Season Part 2 is currently streaming on Crunchyroll and Funimation.

Attack on Titan The Final Season Part 2 Episode 87  by James Beckett, Apr  4th 2022                   How would you rate episode 87 of Attack on Titan The Final Season Part 2 ?                     Community score: 4.4             “I wonder…was there any other choice we could've made? Maybe everything had been decided from the start.” Here, at the end of the season (but not the end of The Final Season!), ""The Dawn of Humanity"" gives its characters one last chance to reflect before they pass the point of no return. To be more specific, it's about Mikasa and Eren, two of the characters we've been with since the very beginning of Attack on Titan. As the crew sails toward Marley, and their final confrontation with their old friend, Mikasa remembers the very last time that she and her friends were truly happy, back when they first set foot in the land across the sea. Eren, on the other hand…we'll get to him. Moments of levity have been few and far between this season (for very understandable reasons), and the episodes that did make the attempt to lighten things up a little in the middle of all this carnage, like with Annie's infamous ""Pie Incident"" a few weeks back, have come up with mixed results. Mikasa's flashback to the gang's first trip to Marley hits all of the right notes, though, because for as zany as the comedy gets, it's all tinged with the utter tragedy of us knowing that this is the last good time these kids are ever going to get, together. Soon, Eren will abandon the plan and rendezvous with Zeke in Liberio, and then the war will begin in earnest.  And when I say ""zany"", I mean zany, because ""The Dawn of Humanity"" wants the inevitable tragedy to sting as much as possible. Sasha gets one last chance to be The Best Character in Attack on Titan™ again when she mistakes a car for a cow and then graphically violates a vanilla ice-cream cone in the span of a couple of minutes. Levi is mistaken for a child gangster by a terrifying clown, Onyakopon is horrified when Sasha and Co. attempt to feed the car carrots, and Hange has to pretend to be Sasha's sister to rescue a refugee pickpocket from the wrath of the Marleyan mob.  Eren is preoccupied with how the Eldians in Marley are being systematically abused and denied the privileges of ice cream and clowns, which Mikasa recognizes as a bit of a red flag in hindsight, but it makes perfect sense to us, knowing what we know. At this point, Eren already knows what he's going to do to this place and these people—what he's going to become—and it's clearly tearing him apart inside.  When Mikasa finds him overlooking the refugee camp and asks him what happened to the boy from the market, he tells her, ""Nothing yet."" It's enough to send chills down your spine. It makes the entirety of the drunken revelry that follows so terribly sad, and not just because we know that soon Eren will be gone, Sasha will be dead, and all of these shenanigans will be a distant memory. If Eren succeeds with his mission, every last one of these refugees will be dead, and the only understanding they will have of their pain and suffering will come from the sight of a hundred titans emerging from the sea to destroy them all.  Mikasa wonders if there was anything they could have done differently to turn Eren away from this path. He's seemed set on it from the moment they attended the hearing over Eldian refugees and learned how deeply the hatred of the Paradis Eldians runs throughout the world, though Mikasa seems to think that Eren might have responded differently if she admitted her feelings for him when he asked her dead on before the party. Could it be that, if Eren had a stronger anchor to this world, something to remind him of his own humanity, he might not have fallen prey to his own darkest impulses? If Eren's half of the episode is anything to go by, the answer is almost certainly no. Mikasa even acknowledges the simple fact of it herself: Maybe Eren has always had this monster living inside of him, and they were just never able (or willing) to see it. After all, from the moment he swore his oath of vengeance as a child, Eren's stated purpose has never really changed. In a way, he has never been able to escape the mindset of that terrified and furious boy he was all the way back in Episode 1, and the fatalistic nihilism that he is embracing now is further proof of that. When a child is confronted with all of the hard and painful truths of the world, and has everything that matters ripped out of their hands, it's only natural that their immediate response would be to throw a tantrum and break everything around them.  So it could be that Eren was always going to go down a path like this, even if nobody could have ever predicted the catastrophic amount of power he would end up wielding. Or perhaps Eren is simply using the perceived permanence of the future he witnessed when he kissed Historia's hand as an excuse to give up the burden of agency. If he is destined to become the beast that kills mankind, then maybe it is better – not to mention easier – to give up on resisting. He can push his friends away, he can use the lie of the Ackerman curse to hurt Mikasa enough for her to give up on him forever, and he can deny the desperate pleas of his Queen. He must. It's already been written in stone…right?  We don't know everything, yet, which makes sense now that we know there is one last ""part"" to go in this Final Season. Attack on Titan has still got to save some surprises for it's endgame, I suppose (and they swear that they mean it, this time, too). Maybe we'll finally get some answers about Historia's pregnancy, which gets teased again despite not being at all relevant to the plot since it first got brought up over a year ago.  There's only one thing that's absolutely certain going into Attack on Titan's climax, and it's that absolutely nobody in the world beyond Paradis will ever forget the face of Eren Jeager for as long as they live (however short a time that may be). While the sight of the Colossal Titans swimming in the ocean was maybe a little goofy (I think it would have been much creepier just to have them walking along the ocean floor), it is impossible to deny the sheer terror of their arrival in Marley. The steam they give off is enough to melt the flesh off of mens' bones, and every step they take crumbles the foundations of civilization into dust.  It's the moment that this story has been building towards for nearly a decade. For Jeagerists like Floch, it's nothing less than the culmination of a lifetime of fighting, the beginning of the Eldians' new golden age. For our heroes, it's the start of their own final battle, and the cost of victory will be steep indeed. For Eren, it's the fulfilling of a dark prophecy that he himself was the author of, making good on the promise a young boy made all those years ago to his mother.  For everyone else, though? It's simply the end of the world.  Rating:                 Attack on Titan The Final Season Part 2 is currently streaming on Crunchyroll and Funimation.

To be more specific, it's about Mikasa and Eren, two of the characters we've been with since the very beginning of Attack on Titan. As the crew sails toward Marley, and their final confrontation with their old friend, Mikasa remembers the very last time that she and her friends were truly happy, back when they first set foot in the land across the sea. Eren, on the other hand…we'll get to him. Moments of levity have been few and far between this season (for very understandable reasons), and the episodes that did make the attempt to lighten things up a little in the middle of all this carnage, like with Annie's infamous ""Pie Incident"" a few weeks back, have come up with mixed results. Mikasa's flashback to the gang's first trip to Marley hits all of the right notes, though, because for as zany as the comedy gets, it's all tinged with the utter tragedy of us knowing that this is the last good time these kids are ever going to get, together. Soon, Eren will abandon the plan and rendezvous with Zeke in Liberio, and then the war will begin in earnest.  And when I say ""zany"", I mean zany, because ""The Dawn of Humanity"" wants the inevitable tragedy to sting as much as possible. Sasha gets one last chance to be The Best Character in Attack on Titan™ again when she mistakes a car for a cow and then graphically violates a vanilla ice-cream cone in the span of a couple of minutes. Levi is mistaken for a child gangster by a terrifying clown, Onyakopon is horrified when Sasha and Co. attempt to feed the car carrots, and Hange has to pretend to be Sasha's sister to rescue a refugee pickpocket from the wrath of the Marleyan mob.  Eren is preoccupied with how the Eldians in Marley are being systematically abused and denied the privileges of ice cream and clowns, which Mikasa recognizes as a bit of a red flag in hindsight, but it makes perfect sense to us, knowing what we know. At this point, Eren already knows what he's going to do to this place and these people—what he's going to become—and it's clearly tearing him apart inside.  When Mikasa finds him overlooking the refugee camp and asks him what happened to the boy from the market, he tells her, ""Nothing yet."" It's enough to send chills down your spine. It makes the entirety of the drunken revelry that follows so terribly sad, and not just because we know that soon Eren will be gone, Sasha will be dead, and all of these shenanigans will be a distant memory. If Eren succeeds with his mission, every last one of these refugees will be dead, and the only understanding they will have of their pain and suffering will come from the sight of a hundred titans emerging from the sea to destroy them all.  Mikasa wonders if there was anything they could have done differently to turn Eren away from this path. He's seemed set on it from the moment they attended the hearing over Eldian refugees and learned how deeply the hatred of the Paradis Eldians runs throughout the world, though Mikasa seems to think that Eren might have responded differently if she admitted her feelings for him when he asked her dead on before the party. Could it be that, if Eren had a stronger anchor to this world, something to remind him of his own humanity, he might not have fallen prey to his own darkest impulses? If Eren's half of the episode is anything to go by, the answer is almost certainly no. Mikasa even acknowledges the simple fact of it herself: Maybe Eren has always had this monster living inside of him, and they were just never able (or willing) to see it. After all, from the moment he swore his oath of vengeance as a child, Eren's stated purpose has never really changed. In a way, he has never been able to escape the mindset of that terrified and furious boy he was all the way back in Episode 1, and the fatalistic nihilism that he is embracing now is further proof of that. When a child is confronted with all of the hard and painful truths of the world, and has everything that matters ripped out of their hands, it's only natural that their immediate response would be to throw a tantrum and break everything around them.  So it could be that Eren was always going to go down a path like this, even if nobody could have ever predicted the catastrophic amount of power he would end up wielding. Or perhaps Eren is simply using the perceived permanence of the future he witnessed when he kissed Historia's hand as an excuse to give up the burden of agency. If he is destined to become the beast that kills mankind, then maybe it is better – not to mention easier – to give up on resisting. He can push his friends away, he can use the lie of the Ackerman curse to hurt Mikasa enough for her to give up on him forever, and he can deny the desperate pleas of his Queen. He must. It's already been written in stone…right?  We don't know everything, yet, which makes sense now that we know there is one last ""part"" to go in this Final Season. Attack on Titan has still got to save some surprises for it's endgame, I suppose (and they swear that they mean it, this time, too). Maybe we'll finally get some answers about Historia's pregnancy, which gets teased again despite not being at all relevant to the plot since it first got brought up over a year ago.  There's only one thing that's absolutely certain going into Attack on Titan's climax, and it's that absolutely nobody in the world beyond Paradis will ever forget the face of Eren Jeager for as long as they live (however short a time that may be). While the sight of the Colossal Titans swimming in the ocean was maybe a little goofy (I think it would have been much creepier just to have them walking along the ocean floor), it is impossible to deny the sheer terror of their arrival in Marley. The steam they give off is enough to melt the flesh off of mens' bones, and every step they take crumbles the foundations of civilization into dust.  It's the moment that this story has been building towards for nearly a decade. For Jeagerists like Floch, it's nothing less than the culmination of a lifetime of fighting, the beginning of the Eldians' new golden age. For our heroes, it's the start of their own final battle, and the cost of victory will be steep indeed. For Eren, it's the fulfilling of a dark prophecy that he himself was the author of, making good on the promise a young boy made all those years ago to his mother.  For everyone else, though? It's simply the end of the world.  Rating:                 Attack on Titan The Final Season Part 2 is currently streaming on Crunchyroll and Funimation.

Attack on Titan The Final Season Part 2 Episode 87  by James Beckett, Apr  4th 2022                   How would you rate episode 87 of Attack on Titan The Final Season Part 2 ?                     Community score: 4.4             “I wonder…was there any other choice we could've made? Maybe everything had been decided from the start.” Here, at the end of the season (but not the end of The Final Season!), ""The Dawn of Humanity"" gives its characters one last chance to reflect before they pass the point of no return. To be more specific, it's about Mikasa and Eren, two of the characters we've been with since the very beginning of Attack on Titan. As the crew sails toward Marley, and their final confrontation with their old friend, Mikasa remembers the very last time that she and her friends were truly happy, back when they first set foot in the land across the sea. Eren, on the other hand…we'll get to him. Moments of levity have been few and far between this season (for very understandable reasons), and the episodes that did make the attempt to lighten things up a little in the middle of all this carnage, like with Annie's infamous ""Pie Incident"" a few weeks back, have come up with mixed results. Mikasa's flashback to the gang's first trip to Marley hits all of the right notes, though, because for as zany as the comedy gets, it's all tinged with the utter tragedy of us knowing that this is the last good time these kids are ever going to get, together. Soon, Eren will abandon the plan and rendezvous with Zeke in Liberio, and then the war will begin in earnest.  And when I say ""zany"", I mean zany, because ""The Dawn of Humanity"" wants the inevitable tragedy to sting as much as possible. Sasha gets one last chance to be The Best Character in Attack on Titan™ again when she mistakes a car for a cow and then graphically violates a vanilla ice-cream cone in the span of a couple of minutes. Levi is mistaken for a child gangster by a terrifying clown, Onyakopon is horrified when Sasha and Co. attempt to feed the car carrots, and Hange has to pretend to be Sasha's sister to rescue a refugee pickpocket from the wrath of the Marleyan mob.  Eren is preoccupied with how the Eldians in Marley are being systematically abused and denied the privileges of ice cream and clowns, which Mikasa recognizes as a bit of a red flag in hindsight, but it makes perfect sense to us, knowing what we know. At this point, Eren already knows what he's going to do to this place and these people—what he's going to become—and it's clearly tearing him apart inside.  When Mikasa finds him overlooking the refugee camp and asks him what happened to the boy from the market, he tells her, ""Nothing yet."" It's enough to send chills down your spine. It makes the entirety of the drunken revelry that follows so terribly sad, and not just because we know that soon Eren will be gone, Sasha will be dead, and all of these shenanigans will be a distant memory. If Eren succeeds with his mission, every last one of these refugees will be dead, and the only understanding they will have of their pain and suffering will come from the sight of a hundred titans emerging from the sea to destroy them all.  Mikasa wonders if there was anything they could have done differently to turn Eren away from this path. He's seemed set on it from the moment they attended the hearing over Eldian refugees and learned how deeply the hatred of the Paradis Eldians runs throughout the world, though Mikasa seems to think that Eren might have responded differently if she admitted her feelings for him when he asked her dead on before the party. Could it be that, if Eren had a stronger anchor to this world, something to remind him of his own humanity, he might not have fallen prey to his own darkest impulses? If Eren's half of the episode is anything to go by, the answer is almost certainly no. Mikasa even acknowledges the simple fact of it herself: Maybe Eren has always had this monster living inside of him, and they were just never able (or willing) to see it. After all, from the moment he swore his oath of vengeance as a child, Eren's stated purpose has never really changed. In a way, he has never been able to escape the mindset of that terrified and furious boy he was all the way back in Episode 1, and the fatalistic nihilism that he is embracing now is further proof of that. When a child is confronted with all of the hard and painful truths of the world, and has everything that matters ripped out of their hands, it's only natural that their immediate response would be to throw a tantrum and break everything around them.  So it could be that Eren was always going to go down a path like this, even if nobody could have ever predicted the catastrophic amount of power he would end up wielding. Or perhaps Eren is simply using the perceived permanence of the future he witnessed when he kissed Historia's hand as an excuse to give up the burden of agency. If he is destined to become the beast that kills mankind, then maybe it is better – not to mention easier – to give up on resisting. He can push his friends away, he can use the lie of the Ackerman curse to hurt Mikasa enough for her to give up on him forever, and he can deny the desperate pleas of his Queen. He must. It's already been written in stone…right?  We don't know everything, yet, which makes sense now that we know there is one last ""part"" to go in this Final Season. Attack on Titan has still got to save some surprises for it's endgame, I suppose (and they swear that they mean it, this time, too). Maybe we'll finally get some answers about Historia's pregnancy, which gets teased again despite not being at all relevant to the plot since it first got brought up over a year ago.  There's only one thing that's absolutely certain going into Attack on Titan's climax, and it's that absolutely nobody in the world beyond Paradis will ever forget the face of Eren Jeager for as long as they live (however short a time that may be). While the sight of the Colossal Titans swimming in the ocean was maybe a little goofy (I think it would have been much creepier just to have them walking along the ocean floor), it is impossible to deny the sheer terror of their arrival in Marley. The steam they give off is enough to melt the flesh off of mens' bones, and every step they take crumbles the foundations of civilization into dust.  It's the moment that this story has been building towards for nearly a decade. For Jeagerists like Floch, it's nothing less than the culmination of a lifetime of fighting, the beginning of the Eldians' new golden age. For our heroes, it's the start of their own final battle, and the cost of victory will be steep indeed. For Eren, it's the fulfilling of a dark prophecy that he himself was the author of, making good on the promise a young boy made all those years ago to his mother.  For everyone else, though? It's simply the end of the world.  Rating:                 Attack on Titan The Final Season Part 2 is currently streaming on Crunchyroll and Funimation.

Mikasa's flashback to the gang's first trip to Marley hits all of the right notes, though, because for as zany as the comedy gets, it's all tinged with the utter tragedy of us knowing that this is the last good time these kids are ever going to get, together. Soon, Eren will abandon the plan and rendezvous with Zeke in Liberio, and then the war will begin in earnest.  And when I say ""zany"", I mean zany, because ""The Dawn of Humanity"" wants the inevitable tragedy to sting as much as possible. Sasha gets one last chance to be The Best Character in Attack on Titan™ again when she mistakes a car for a cow and then graphically violates a vanilla ice-cream cone in the span of a couple of minutes. Levi is mistaken for a child gangster by a terrifying clown, Onyakopon is horrified when Sasha and Co. attempt to feed the car carrots, and Hange has to pretend to be Sasha's sister to rescue a refugee pickpocket from the wrath of the Marleyan mob.  Eren is preoccupied with how the Eldians in Marley are being systematically abused and denied the privileges of ice cream and clowns, which Mikasa recognizes as a bit of a red flag in hindsight, but it makes perfect sense to us, knowing what we know. At this point, Eren already knows what he's going to do to this place and these people—what he's going to become—and it's clearly tearing him apart inside.  When Mikasa finds him overlooking the refugee camp and asks him what happened to the boy from the market, he tells her, ""Nothing yet."" It's enough to send chills down your spine. It makes the entirety of the drunken revelry that follows so terribly sad, and not just because we know that soon Eren will be gone, Sasha will be dead, and all of these shenanigans will be a distant memory. If Eren succeeds with his mission, every last one of these refugees will be dead, and the only understanding they will have of their pain and suffering will come from the sight of a hundred titans emerging from the sea to destroy them all.  Mikasa wonders if there was anything they could have done differently to turn Eren away from this path. He's seemed set on it from the moment they attended the hearing over Eldian refugees and learned how deeply the hatred of the Paradis Eldians runs throughout the world, though Mikasa seems to think that Eren might have responded differently if she admitted her feelings for him when he asked her dead on before the party. Could it be that, if Eren had a stronger anchor to this world, something to remind him of his own humanity, he might not have fallen prey to his own darkest impulses? If Eren's half of the episode is anything to go by, the answer is almost certainly no. Mikasa even acknowledges the simple fact of it herself: Maybe Eren has always had this monster living inside of him, and they were just never able (or willing) to see it. After all, from the moment he swore his oath of vengeance as a child, Eren's stated purpose has never really changed. In a way, he has never been able to escape the mindset of that terrified and furious boy he was all the way back in Episode 1, and the fatalistic nihilism that he is embracing now is further proof of that. When a child is confronted with all of the hard and painful truths of the world, and has everything that matters ripped out of their hands, it's only natural that their immediate response would be to throw a tantrum and break everything around them.  So it could be that Eren was always going to go down a path like this, even if nobody could have ever predicted the catastrophic amount of power he would end up wielding. Or perhaps Eren is simply using the perceived permanence of the future he witnessed when he kissed Historia's hand as an excuse to give up the burden of agency. If he is destined to become the beast that kills mankind, then maybe it is better – not to mention easier – to give up on resisting. He can push his friends away, he can use the lie of the Ackerman curse to hurt Mikasa enough for her to give up on him forever, and he can deny the desperate pleas of his Queen. He must. It's already been written in stone…right?  We don't know everything, yet, which makes sense now that we know there is one last ""part"" to go in this Final Season. Attack on Titan has still got to save some surprises for it's endgame, I suppose (and they swear that they mean it, this time, too). Maybe we'll finally get some answers about Historia's pregnancy, which gets teased again despite not being at all relevant to the plot since it first got brought up over a year ago.  There's only one thing that's absolutely certain going into Attack on Titan's climax, and it's that absolutely nobody in the world beyond Paradis will ever forget the face of Eren Jeager for as long as they live (however short a time that may be). While the sight of the Colossal Titans swimming in the ocean was maybe a little goofy (I think it would have been much creepier just to have them walking along the ocean floor), it is impossible to deny the sheer terror of their arrival in Marley. The steam they give off is enough to melt the flesh off of mens' bones, and every step they take crumbles the foundations of civilization into dust.  It's the moment that this story has been building towards for nearly a decade. For Jeagerists like Floch, it's nothing less than the culmination of a lifetime of fighting, the beginning of the Eldians' new golden age. For our heroes, it's the start of their own final battle, and the cost of victory will be steep indeed. For Eren, it's the fulfilling of a dark prophecy that he himself was the author of, making good on the promise a young boy made all those years ago to his mother.  For everyone else, though?

To be more specific, it's about Mikasa and Eren, two of the characters we've been with since the very beginning of Attack on Titan. As the crew sails toward Marley, and their final confrontation with their old friend, Mikasa remembers the very last time that she and her friends were truly happy, back when they first set foot in the land across the sea. Eren, on the other hand…we'll get to him. Moments of levity have been few and far between this season (for very understandable reasons), and the episodes that did make the attempt to lighten things up a little in the middle of all this carnage, like with Annie's infamous ""Pie Incident"" a few weeks back, have come up with mixed results. Mikasa's flashback to the gang's first trip to Marley hits all of the right notes, though, because for as zany as the comedy gets, it's all tinged with the utter tragedy of us knowing that this is the last good time these kids are ever going to get, together. Soon, Eren will abandon the plan and rendezvous with Zeke in Liberio, and then the war will begin in earnest.  And when I say ""zany"", I mean zany, because ""The Dawn of Humanity"" wants the inevitable tragedy to sting as much as possible. Sasha gets one last chance to be The Best Character in Attack on Titan™ again when she mistakes a car for a cow and then graphically violates a vanilla ice-cream cone in the span of a couple of minutes. Levi is mistaken for a child gangster by a terrifying clown, Onyakopon is horrified when Sasha and Co. attempt to feed the car carrots, and Hange has to pretend to be Sasha's sister to rescue a refugee pickpocket from the wrath of the Marleyan mob.  Eren is preoccupied with how the Eldians in Marley are being systematically abused and denied the privileges of ice cream and clowns, which Mikasa recognizes as a bit of a red flag in hindsight, but it makes perfect sense to us, knowing what we know. At this point, Eren already knows what he's going to do to this place and these people—what he's going to become—and it's clearly tearing him apart inside.  When Mikasa finds him overlooking the refugee camp and asks him what happened to the boy from the market, he tells her, ""Nothing yet."" It's enough to send chills down your spine. It makes the entirety of the drunken revelry that follows so terribly sad, and not just because we know that soon Eren will be gone, Sasha will be dead, and all of these shenanigans will be a distant memory. If Eren succeeds with his mission, every last one of these refugees will be dead, and the only understanding they will have of their pain and suffering will come from the sight of a hundred titans emerging from the sea to destroy them all.  Mikasa wonders if there was anything they could have done differently to turn Eren away from this path. He's seemed set on it from the moment they attended the hearing over Eldian refugees and learned how deeply the hatred of the Paradis Eldians runs throughout the world, though Mikasa seems to think that Eren might have responded differently if she admitted her feelings for him when he asked her dead on before the party. Could it be that, if Eren had a stronger anchor to this world, something to remind him of his own humanity, he might not have fallen prey to his own darkest impulses? If Eren's half of the episode is anything to go by, the answer is almost certainly no. Mikasa even acknowledges the simple fact of it herself: Maybe Eren has always had this monster living inside of him, and they were just never able (or willing) to see it. After all, from the moment he swore his oath of vengeance as a child, Eren's stated purpose has never really changed. In a way, he has never been able to escape the mindset of that terrified and furious boy he was all the way back in Episode 1, and the fatalistic nihilism that he is embracing now is further proof of that. When a child is confronted with all of the hard and painful truths of the world, and has everything that matters ripped out of their hands, it's only natural that their immediate response would be to throw a tantrum and break everything around them.  So it could be that Eren was always going to go down a path like this, even if nobody could have ever predicted the catastrophic amount of power he would end up wielding. Or perhaps Eren is simply using the perceived permanence of the future he witnessed when he kissed Historia's hand as an excuse to give up the burden of agency. If he is destined to become the beast that kills mankind, then maybe it is better – not to mention easier – to give up on resisting. He can push his friends away, he can use the lie of the Ackerman curse to hurt Mikasa enough for her to give up on him forever, and he can deny the desperate pleas of his Queen. He must. It's already been written in stone…right?  We don't know everything, yet, which makes sense now that we know there is one last ""part"" to go in this Final Season. Attack on Titan has still got to save some surprises for it's endgame, I suppose (and they swear that they mean it, this time, too). Maybe we'll finally get some answers about Historia's pregnancy, which gets teased again despite not being at all relevant to the plot since it first got brought up over a year ago.  There's only one thing that's absolutely certain going into Attack on Titan's climax, and it's that absolutely nobody in the world beyond Paradis will ever forget the face of Eren Jeager for as long as they live (however short a time that may be). While the sight of the Colossal Titans swimming in the ocean was maybe a little goofy (I think it would have been much creepier just to have them walking along the ocean floor), it is impossible to deny the sheer terror of their arrival in Marley. The steam they give off is enough to melt the flesh off of mens' bones, and every step they take crumbles the foundations of civilization into dust.  It's the moment that this story has been building towards for nearly a decade. For Jeagerists like Floch, it's nothing less than the culmination of a lifetime of fighting, the beginning of the Eldians' new golden age. For our heroes, it's the start of their own final battle, and the cost of victory will be steep indeed. For Eren, it's the fulfilling of a dark prophecy that he himself was the author of, making good on the promise a young boy made all those years ago to his mother.  For everyone else, though? It's simply the end of the world.  Rating:                 Attack on Titan The Final Season Part 2 is currently streaming on Crunchyroll and Funimation.

He brings the whole series down with his stupid incestuous shenanigans towards his sister (big siscon energy, which only gets more flanderized as the story progresses). Take that away from him (or tone it down a notch and make it less obsessive) and you already have a much better character to work with. It's for comedy, but much like in Black Clover, it just doesn't work well, and most of the english-speaking fanbase seem to find that an annoyance at best, and I agree (easily the most divisive character in the cast going by discussions and threads of the series so far).    Then again, afaik this sort of trope usually just works when it's more about sibling jealousy than an actual crush on their sister (particularly when the characters are grown adults). Gintama worked around that very well, for a positive example (even because Shinpachi does not rely on that sort of gag at all for the most part, unlike Yuri).   Should be amusing seeing him getting voiced by Japanese Harry Potter though (he did great in a similar role in Shingeki no Kyojin as Floch, I bet at least that will get us some funny memes) lol     dm wrote:    The opening is fantastic.   Only, no sign of Bond!            His arc will probably be the last of this cour considering the really nice pacing they are going with this, so they may add him in a v2 of the opening by the end, perhaps.

He brings the whole series down with his stupid incestuous shenanigans towards his sister (big siscon energy, which only gets more flanderized as the story progresses). Take that away from him (or tone it down a notch and make it less obsessive) and you already have a much better character to work with. It's for comedy, but much like in Black Clover, it just doesn't work well, and most of the english-speaking fanbase seem to find that an annoyance at best, and I agree (easily the most divisive character in the cast going by discussions and threads of the series so far).    Then again, afaik this sort of trope usually just works when it's more about sibling jealousy than an actual crush on their sister (particularly when the characters are grown adults). Gintama worked around that very well, for a positive example (even because Shinpachi does not rely on that sort of gag at all for the most part, unlike Yuri).   Should be amusing seeing him getting voiced by Japanese Harry Potter though (he did great in a similar role in Shingeki no Kyojin as Floch, I bet at least that will get us some funny memes) lol     dm wrote:    The opening is fantastic.   Only, no sign of Bond!            His arc will probably be the last of this cour considering the really nice pacing they are going with this, so they may add him in a v2 of the opening by the end, perhaps.

Honestly they could tone down Yuri in the original as well unless fans legit think the gag is that funny.

I feel like if anyone can work Yuri's character and the many different sides to him, it's him. He might even make him come off more likeable.    Also, Junichi Suwabe!

He brings the whole series down with his stupid incestuous shenanigans towards his sister (big siscon energy, which only gets more flanderized as the story progresses). Take that away from him (or tone it down a notch and make it less obsessive) and you already have a much better character to work with. It's for comedy, but much like in Black Clover, it just doesn't work well, and most of the english-speaking fanbase seem to find that an annoyance at best, and I agree (easily the most divisive character in the cast going by discussions and threads of the series so far).    Then again, afaik this sort of trope usually just works when it's more about sibling jealousy than an actual crush on their sister (particularly when the characters are grown adults). Gintama worked around that very well, for a positive example (even because Shinpachi does not rely on that sort of gag at all for the most part, unlike Yuri).   Should be amusing seeing him getting voiced by Japanese Harry Potter though (he did great in a similar role in Shingeki no Kyojin as Floch, I bet at least that will get us some funny memes) lol     dm wrote:    The opening is fantastic.   Only, no sign of Bond!            His arc will probably be the last of this cour considering the really nice pacing they are going with this, so they may add him in a v2 of the opening by the end, perhaps.

He brings the whole series down with his stupid incestuous shenanigans towards his sister (big siscon energy, which only gets more flanderized as the story progresses). Take that away from him (or tone it down a notch and make it less obsessive) and you already have a much better character to work with.

Then again, afaik this sort of trope usually just works when it's more about sibling jealousy than an actual crush on their sister (particularly when the characters are grown adults).

The Executioner and Her Way of Life Episodes 1-3  by James Beckett, Apr 18th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Executioner and Her Way of Life ?                     Community score: 4.0                  How would you rate episode 2 of The Executioner and Her Way of Life ?                     Community score: 4.1                  How would you rate episode 3 of The Executioner and Her Way of Life ?                     Community score: 4.2             The premiere episode of The Executioner and Her Way of Life was  a hell of a good time, as it managed to put a fun twist on some of the most tired modern isekai tropes while also telling a very fun story in its own right. I was excited enough when we got to watch our heroine Menou stab Potato McIsekaiFace in the skull just as he was beginning to get a little too excited about the prospect of murdering all of his enemies with his terrifying nullification magic. Everything that came after that only made the premise of the show all the more compelling. Menou is a conflicted and relatable heroine, and the flashback to the traumatizing destruction of her hometown kills two birds with one stone: It makes you understand exactly how and why a girl like Menou would become a sactioned Executioner, and it shows off the spectacle that the show is capable of when its using its setting and magical rules to the fullest. There are plenty of shows that had a stellar premiere, only to run out of steam in the long term. What I was really looking for in these following episodes were signs that Executioner could hold its own as a series without all of the shock value it mustered with Menou's introduction.  We have a whole world to build, after all, not to mention a central relationship to develop between Menou and Akari, the latter of whom possesses a very powerful magic that can literally turn the tides of time itself. Twelve episodes isn't a whole lot of time to tell a coherent and satisfying story, and we're about a quarter of the way through the series already. (at least, if the HIDIVE episode count is anything to go by). Thankfully, I think I can say that, so far, the show is doing a good job of living up to its potential…mostly.   I have a few nagging quibbles that I will get to shortly, but my biggest takeaway from Episodes 2 and 3 of The Executioner and Her Way of Life is that the show is consistently fun to watch, and that's a good sign. There are some holes in its writing and production that could lead to problems in the long term, but the show has officially passed the all-important Three Episode Test. Even if I wasn't being asked to cover this anime for my job, I'd want to keep up with it on my own time. When you have to watch as much anime as we do around these parts, that's quite the compliment.  More than anything, this series is a testament to how you don't need to completely rely on shocking twists and subverted expectations to deliver a good story. Menou's conflict over having to escort the functionally immortal Akari to the city of Garm is maybe a little straightforward—we all know that Menou is going to eventually start to question her role as Akari's murderer—but the show sells her character well enough that you buy it anyway. It helps that Akari is a sweetheart, so you totally understand why Menou would feel at least kind of bad about gutting Akari like a fish (for a second time, that is).   I'm even starting to warm up to Momo, whose “aggressive lesbian comedy relief” shtick was one of the only major gripes I had with the premiere. The character is still a bit much for my tastes, and I'm not jazzed about how her entire role in the story feels based entirely on her feelings for Menou, but she plays better when she has more to do than make obvious passes at her friend and comment on Akari's boob size. She gets to play more notes than “aggressively horny” once Menou and Akari set off on their journey to Garm, and she even gets a major action highlight when the train attack gets going in Episode 3.   Episode 3 is where I think we've gotten the best look so far at what kind of show The Executioner and Her Way of Life is actually going to be. The premiere was mostly a hook, and an effective one at that, and Episode 2 was devoted entirely to introducing Akari and setting up her journey with Menou. When our heroines get caught up in a terrorist plot on the ether train bound for Garm, though, we have our first proper plot for the girls to work through, and the results are pretty good! Momo gets to show off her sadistic side on the terrorist she tortures for information, and her fight with Princess Ashuna is a great setpiece. I love the magic-infused chain that Momo uses for a weapon, and Ashuna is an interesting and flamboyant character in her own right. The royal family and the Church's growing conflict with one another will hopefully add some depth and flavor to Menou and Akari's story.  One of the only downsides to the train adventure is Menou and Akari's showdown with the armored warrior inside of the train. The fight simply isn't as dynamic or fun as the one going on up above, and the production values for this scene (and several others throughout episodes 2 and 3) are noticeably weaker than the generally stellar-looking premiere. The show is never downright ugly, but it's not the kind of anime that can get by on flash and style alone, either.  The final scene of the episode is also worth mentioning, but not because it's bad. I actually loved the reveal that Akari saved everyone from dying horribly in a train crash with her time powers; it's a great cap to the episode-long thread of Menou constantly reminding Akari of how “useless” she is in a fight. That said, if I had any major reservations about the series beyond some potentially shoddy visuals, it would be with Akari herself, and only because I want to see more of the tragic and painful side of her existence in this world. So far, the girl has proven to be a sweet and bubbly presence, and while I think there have been a few hints that she knows more than she lets on, she hasn't been given a lot to do other than be impressed with Menou. Even that excellent train-crash scene is something we only see in the past tense. I guess what I'm saying is that I hope it doesn't take much longer for Akari to be given the same level of depth that Menou has been afforded; it would be a shame if she only existed to be a precious puppy of a girl for Menou to feel guilty about.  These are all minor issues, though, since they're mostly just hypothetical at this point. While The Executioner and Her Way of Life hasn't yet managed to be as blazingly awesome as it was in that first episode, the show is still a very good time time, and I'm excited to see where it goes from here.

The Executioner and Her Way of Life Episodes 1-3  by James Beckett, Apr 18th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Executioner and Her Way of Life ?                     Community score: 4.0                  How would you rate episode 2 of The Executioner and Her Way of Life ?                     Community score: 4.1                  How would you rate episode 3 of The Executioner and Her Way of Life ?                     Community score: 4.2             The premiere episode of The Executioner and Her Way of Life was  a hell of a good time, as it managed to put a fun twist on some of the most tired modern isekai tropes while also telling a very fun story in its own right. I was excited enough when we got to watch our heroine Menou stab Potato McIsekaiFace in the skull just as he was beginning to get a little too excited about the prospect of murdering all of his enemies with his terrifying nullification magic. Everything that came after that only made the premise of the show all the more compelling. Menou is a conflicted and relatable heroine, and the flashback to the traumatizing destruction of her hometown kills two birds with one stone: It makes you understand exactly how and why a girl like Menou would become a sactioned Executioner, and it shows off the spectacle that the show is capable of when its using its setting and magical rules to the fullest. There are plenty of shows that had a stellar premiere, only to run out of steam in the long term. What I was really looking for in these following episodes were signs that Executioner could hold its own as a series without all of the shock value it mustered with Menou's introduction.  We have a whole world to build, after all, not to mention a central relationship to develop between Menou and Akari, the latter of whom possesses a very powerful magic that can literally turn the tides of time itself. Twelve episodes isn't a whole lot of time to tell a coherent and satisfying story, and we're about a quarter of the way through the series already. (at least, if the HIDIVE episode count is anything to go by). Thankfully, I think I can say that, so far, the show is doing a good job of living up to its potential…mostly.   I have a few nagging quibbles that I will get to shortly, but my biggest takeaway from Episodes 2 and 3 of The Executioner and Her Way of Life is that the show is consistently fun to watch, and that's a good sign. There are some holes in its writing and production that could lead to problems in the long term, but the show has officially passed the all-important Three Episode Test. Even if I wasn't being asked to cover this anime for my job, I'd want to keep up with it on my own time. When you have to watch as much anime as we do around these parts, that's quite the compliment.  More than anything, this series is a testament to how you don't need to completely rely on shocking twists and subverted expectations to deliver a good story. Menou's conflict over having to escort the functionally immortal Akari to the city of Garm is maybe a little straightforward—we all know that Menou is going to eventually start to question her role as Akari's murderer—but the show sells her character well enough that you buy it anyway. It helps that Akari is a sweetheart, so you totally understand why Menou would feel at least kind of bad about gutting Akari like a fish (for a second time, that is).   I'm even starting to warm up to Momo, whose “aggressive lesbian comedy relief” shtick was one of the only major gripes I had with the premiere. The character is still a bit much for my tastes, and I'm not jazzed about how her entire role in the story feels based entirely on her feelings for Menou, but she plays better when she has more to do than make obvious passes at her friend and comment on Akari's boob size. She gets to play more notes than “aggressively horny” once Menou and Akari set off on their journey to Garm, and she even gets a major action highlight when the train attack gets going in Episode 3.   Episode 3 is where I think we've gotten the best look so far at what kind of show The Executioner and Her Way of Life is actually going to be. The premiere was mostly a hook, and an effective one at that, and Episode 2 was devoted entirely to introducing Akari and setting up her journey with Menou. When our heroines get caught up in a terrorist plot on the ether train bound for Garm, though, we have our first proper plot for the girls to work through, and the results are pretty good! Momo gets to show off her sadistic side on the terrorist she tortures for information, and her fight with Princess Ashuna is a great setpiece. I love the magic-infused chain that Momo uses for a weapon, and Ashuna is an interesting and flamboyant character in her own right. The royal family and the Church's growing conflict with one another will hopefully add some depth and flavor to Menou and Akari's story.  One of the only downsides to the train adventure is Menou and Akari's showdown with the armored warrior inside of the train. The fight simply isn't as dynamic or fun as the one going on up above, and the production values for this scene (and several others throughout episodes 2 and 3) are noticeably weaker than the generally stellar-looking premiere. The show is never downright ugly, but it's not the kind of anime that can get by on flash and style alone, either.  The final scene of the episode is also worth mentioning, but not because it's bad. I actually loved the reveal that Akari saved everyone from dying horribly in a train crash with her time powers; it's a great cap to the episode-long thread of Menou constantly reminding Akari of how “useless” she is in a fight. That said, if I had any major reservations about the series beyond some potentially shoddy visuals, it would be with Akari herself, and only because I want to see more of the tragic and painful side of her existence in this world. So far, the girl has proven to be a sweet and bubbly presence, and while I think there have been a few hints that she knows more than she lets on, she hasn't been given a lot to do other than be impressed with Menou. Even that excellent train-crash scene is something we only see in the past tense. I guess what I'm saying is that I hope it doesn't take much longer for Akari to be given the same level of depth that Menou has been afforded; it would be a shame if she only existed to be a precious puppy of a girl for Menou to feel guilty about.  These are all minor issues, though, since they're mostly just hypothetical at this point. While The Executioner and Her Way of Life hasn't yet managed to be as blazingly awesome as it was in that first episode, the show is still a very good time time, and I'm excited to see where it goes from here.

The Executioner and Her Way of Life Episodes 1-3  by James Beckett, Apr 18th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Executioner and Her Way of Life ?                     Community score: 4.0                  How would you rate episode 2 of The Executioner and Her Way of Life ?                     Community score: 4.1                  How would you rate episode 3 of The Executioner and Her Way of Life ?                     Community score: 4.2             The premiere episode of The Executioner and Her Way of Life was  a hell of a good time, as it managed to put a fun twist on some of the most tired modern isekai tropes while also telling a very fun story in its own right. I was excited enough when we got to watch our heroine Menou stab Potato McIsekaiFace in the skull just as he was beginning to get a little too excited about the prospect of murdering all of his enemies with his terrifying nullification magic. Everything that came after that only made the premise of the show all the more compelling. Menou is a conflicted and relatable heroine, and the flashback to the traumatizing destruction of her hometown kills two birds with one stone: It makes you understand exactly how and why a girl like Menou would become a sactioned Executioner, and it shows off the spectacle that the show is capable of when its using its setting and magical rules to the fullest. There are plenty of shows that had a stellar premiere, only to run out of steam in the long term. What I was really looking for in these following episodes were signs that Executioner could hold its own as a series without all of the shock value it mustered with Menou's introduction.  We have a whole world to build, after all, not to mention a central relationship to develop between Menou and Akari, the latter of whom possesses a very powerful magic that can literally turn the tides of time itself. Twelve episodes isn't a whole lot of time to tell a coherent and satisfying story, and we're about a quarter of the way through the series already. (at least, if the HIDIVE episode count is anything to go by). Thankfully, I think I can say that, so far, the show is doing a good job of living up to its potential…mostly.   I have a few nagging quibbles that I will get to shortly, but my biggest takeaway from Episodes 2 and 3 of The Executioner and Her Way of Life is that the show is consistently fun to watch, and that's a good sign. There are some holes in its writing and production that could lead to problems in the long term, but the show has officially passed the all-important Three Episode Test. Even if I wasn't being asked to cover this anime for my job, I'd want to keep up with it on my own time. When you have to watch as much anime as we do around these parts, that's quite the compliment.  More than anything, this series is a testament to how you don't need to completely rely on shocking twists and subverted expectations to deliver a good story. Menou's conflict over having to escort the functionally immortal Akari to the city of Garm is maybe a little straightforward—we all know that Menou is going to eventually start to question her role as Akari's murderer—but the show sells her character well enough that you buy it anyway. It helps that Akari is a sweetheart, so you totally understand why Menou would feel at least kind of bad about gutting Akari like a fish (for a second time, that is).   I'm even starting to warm up to Momo, whose “aggressive lesbian comedy relief” shtick was one of the only major gripes I had with the premiere. The character is still a bit much for my tastes, and I'm not jazzed about how her entire role in the story feels based entirely on her feelings for Menou, but she plays better when she has more to do than make obvious passes at her friend and comment on Akari's boob size. She gets to play more notes than “aggressively horny” once Menou and Akari set off on their journey to Garm, and she even gets a major action highlight when the train attack gets going in Episode 3.   Episode 3 is where I think we've gotten the best look so far at what kind of show The Executioner and Her Way of Life is actually going to be. The premiere was mostly a hook, and an effective one at that, and Episode 2 was devoted entirely to introducing Akari and setting up her journey with Menou. When our heroines get caught up in a terrorist plot on the ether train bound for Garm, though, we have our first proper plot for the girls to work through, and the results are pretty good! Momo gets to show off her sadistic side on the terrorist she tortures for information, and her fight with Princess Ashuna is a great setpiece. I love the magic-infused chain that Momo uses for a weapon, and Ashuna is an interesting and flamboyant character in her own right. The royal family and the Church's growing conflict with one another will hopefully add some depth and flavor to Menou and Akari's story.  One of the only downsides to the train adventure is Menou and Akari's showdown with the armored warrior inside of the train. The fight simply isn't as dynamic or fun as the one going on up above, and the production values for this scene (and several others throughout episodes 2 and 3) are noticeably weaker than the generally stellar-looking premiere. The show is never downright ugly, but it's not the kind of anime that can get by on flash and style alone, either.  The final scene of the episode is also worth mentioning, but not because it's bad. I actually loved the reveal that Akari saved everyone from dying horribly in a train crash with her time powers; it's a great cap to the episode-long thread of Menou constantly reminding Akari of how “useless” she is in a fight. That said, if I had any major reservations about the series beyond some potentially shoddy visuals, it would be with Akari herself, and only because I want to see more of the tragic and painful side of her existence in this world. So far, the girl has proven to be a sweet and bubbly presence, and while I think there have been a few hints that she knows more than she lets on, she hasn't been given a lot to do other than be impressed with Menou. Even that excellent train-crash scene is something we only see in the past tense. I guess what I'm saying is that I hope it doesn't take much longer for Akari to be given the same level of depth that Menou has been afforded; it would be a shame if she only existed to be a precious puppy of a girl for Menou to feel guilty about.  These are all minor issues, though, since they're mostly just hypothetical at this point. While The Executioner and Her Way of Life hasn't yet managed to be as blazingly awesome as it was in that first episode, the show is still a very good time time, and I'm excited to see where it goes from here.

The Executioner and Her Way of Life Episodes 1-3  by James Beckett, Apr 18th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Executioner and Her Way of Life ?                     Community score: 4.0                  How would you rate episode 2 of The Executioner and Her Way of Life ?                     Community score: 4.1                  How would you rate episode 3 of The Executioner and Her Way of Life ?                     Community score: 4.2             The premiere episode of The Executioner and Her Way of Life was  a hell of a good time, as it managed to put a fun twist on some of the most tired modern isekai tropes while also telling a very fun story in its own right. I was excited enough when we got to watch our heroine Menou stab Potato McIsekaiFace in the skull just as he was beginning to get a little too excited about the prospect of murdering all of his enemies with his terrifying nullification magic. Everything that came after that only made the premise of the show all the more compelling. Menou is a conflicted and relatable heroine, and the flashback to the traumatizing destruction of her hometown kills two birds with one stone: It makes you understand exactly how and why a girl like Menou would become a sactioned Executioner, and it shows off the spectacle that the show is capable of when its using its setting and magical rules to the fullest. There are plenty of shows that had a stellar premiere, only to run out of steam in the long term. What I was really looking for in these following episodes were signs that Executioner could hold its own as a series without all of the shock value it mustered with Menou's introduction.  We have a whole world to build, after all, not to mention a central relationship to develop between Menou and Akari, the latter of whom possesses a very powerful magic that can literally turn the tides of time itself. Twelve episodes isn't a whole lot of time to tell a coherent and satisfying story, and we're about a quarter of the way through the series already. (at least, if the HIDIVE episode count is anything to go by). Thankfully, I think I can say that, so far, the show is doing a good job of living up to its potential…mostly.   I have a few nagging quibbles that I will get to shortly, but my biggest takeaway from Episodes 2 and 3 of The Executioner and Her Way of Life is that the show is consistently fun to watch, and that's a good sign. There are some holes in its writing and production that could lead to problems in the long term, but the show has officially passed the all-important Three Episode Test. Even if I wasn't being asked to cover this anime for my job, I'd want to keep up with it on my own time. When you have to watch as much anime as we do around these parts, that's quite the compliment.  More than anything, this series is a testament to how you don't need to completely rely on shocking twists and subverted expectations to deliver a good story. Menou's conflict over having to escort the functionally immortal Akari to the city of Garm is maybe a little straightforward—we all know that Menou is going to eventually start to question her role as Akari's murderer—but the show sells her character well enough that you buy it anyway. It helps that Akari is a sweetheart, so you totally understand why Menou would feel at least kind of bad about gutting Akari like a fish (for a second time, that is).   I'm even starting to warm up to Momo, whose “aggressive lesbian comedy relief” shtick was one of the only major gripes I had with the premiere. The character is still a bit much for my tastes, and I'm not jazzed about how her entire role in the story feels based entirely on her feelings for Menou, but she plays better when she has more to do than make obvious passes at her friend and comment on Akari's boob size. She gets to play more notes than “aggressively horny” once Menou and Akari set off on their journey to Garm, and she even gets a major action highlight when the train attack gets going in Episode 3.   Episode 3 is where I think we've gotten the best look so far at what kind of show The Executioner and Her Way of Life is actually going to be. The premiere was mostly a hook, and an effective one at that, and Episode 2 was devoted entirely to introducing Akari and setting up her journey with Menou. When our heroines get caught up in a terrorist plot on the ether train bound for Garm, though, we have our first proper plot for the girls to work through, and the results are pretty good! Momo gets to show off her sadistic side on the terrorist she tortures for information, and her fight with Princess Ashuna is a great setpiece. I love the magic-infused chain that Momo uses for a weapon, and Ashuna is an interesting and flamboyant character in her own right. The royal family and the Church's growing conflict with one another will hopefully add some depth and flavor to Menou and Akari's story.  One of the only downsides to the train adventure is Menou and Akari's showdown with the armored warrior inside of the train. The fight simply isn't as dynamic or fun as the one going on up above, and the production values for this scene (and several others throughout episodes 2 and 3) are noticeably weaker than the generally stellar-looking premiere. The show is never downright ugly, but it's not the kind of anime that can get by on flash and style alone, either.  The final scene of the episode is also worth mentioning, but not because it's bad. I actually loved the reveal that Akari saved everyone from dying horribly in a train crash with her time powers; it's a great cap to the episode-long thread of Menou constantly reminding Akari of how “useless” she is in a fight. That said, if I had any major reservations about the series beyond some potentially shoddy visuals, it would be with Akari herself, and only because I want to see more of the tragic and painful side of her existence in this world. So far, the girl has proven to be a sweet and bubbly presence, and while I think there have been a few hints that she knows more than she lets on, she hasn't been given a lot to do other than be impressed with Menou. Even that excellent train-crash scene is something we only see in the past tense. I guess what I'm saying is that I hope it doesn't take much longer for Akari to be given the same level of depth that Menou has been afforded; it would be a shame if she only existed to be a precious puppy of a girl for Menou to feel guilty about.  These are all minor issues, though, since they're mostly just hypothetical at this point. While The Executioner and Her Way of Life hasn't yet managed to be as blazingly awesome as it was in that first episode, the show is still a very good time time, and I'm excited to see where it goes from here.

While The Executioner and Her Way of Life hasn't yet managed to be as blazingly awesome as it was in that first episode, the show is still a very good time time, and I'm excited to see where it goes from here.

The Executioner and Her Way of Life Episodes 1-3  by James Beckett, Apr 18th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Executioner and Her Way of Life ?                     Community score: 4.0                  How would you rate episode 2 of The Executioner and Her Way of Life ?                     Community score: 4.1                  How would you rate episode 3 of The Executioner and Her Way of Life ?                     Community score: 4.2             The premiere episode of The Executioner and Her Way of Life was  a hell of a good time, as it managed to put a fun twist on some of the most tired modern isekai tropes while also telling a very fun story in its own right. I was excited enough when we got to watch our heroine Menou stab Potato McIsekaiFace in the skull just as he was beginning to get a little too excited about the prospect of murdering all of his enemies with his terrifying nullification magic. Everything that came after that only made the premise of the show all the more compelling. Menou is a conflicted and relatable heroine, and the flashback to the traumatizing destruction of her hometown kills two birds with one stone: It makes you understand exactly how and why a girl like Menou would become a sactioned Executioner, and it shows off the spectacle that the show is capable of when its using its setting and magical rules to the fullest. There are plenty of shows that had a stellar premiere, only to run out of steam in the long term. What I was really looking for in these following episodes were signs that Executioner could hold its own as a series without all of the shock value it mustered with Menou's introduction.  We have a whole world to build, after all, not to mention a central relationship to develop between Menou and Akari, the latter of whom possesses a very powerful magic that can literally turn the tides of time itself. Twelve episodes isn't a whole lot of time to tell a coherent and satisfying story, and we're about a quarter of the way through the series already. (at least, if the HIDIVE episode count is anything to go by). Thankfully, I think I can say that, so far, the show is doing a good job of living up to its potential…mostly.   I have a few nagging quibbles that I will get to shortly, but my biggest takeaway from Episodes 2 and 3 of The Executioner and Her Way of Life is that the show is consistently fun to watch, and that's a good sign. There are some holes in its writing and production that could lead to problems in the long term, but the show has officially passed the all-important Three Episode Test. Even if I wasn't being asked to cover this anime for my job, I'd want to keep up with it on my own time. When you have to watch as much anime as we do around these parts, that's quite the compliment.  More than anything, this series is a testament to how you don't need to completely rely on shocking twists and subverted expectations to deliver a good story. Menou's conflict over having to escort the functionally immortal Akari to the city of Garm is maybe a little straightforward—we all know that Menou is going to eventually start to question her role as Akari's murderer—but the show sells her character well enough that you buy it anyway. It helps that Akari is a sweetheart, so you totally understand why Menou would feel at least kind of bad about gutting Akari like a fish (for a second time, that is).   I'm even starting to warm up to Momo, whose “aggressive lesbian comedy relief” shtick was one of the only major gripes I had with the premiere. The character is still a bit much for my tastes, and I'm not jazzed about how her entire role in the story feels based entirely on her feelings for Menou, but she plays better when she has more to do than make obvious passes at her friend and comment on Akari's boob size. She gets to play more notes than “aggressively horny” once Menou and Akari set off on their journey to Garm, and she even gets a major action highlight when the train attack gets going in Episode 3.   Episode 3 is where I think we've gotten the best look so far at what kind of show The Executioner and Her Way of Life is actually going to be. The premiere was mostly a hook, and an effective one at that, and Episode 2 was devoted entirely to introducing Akari and setting up her journey with Menou. When our heroines get caught up in a terrorist plot on the ether train bound for Garm, though, we have our first proper plot for the girls to work through, and the results are pretty good! Momo gets to show off her sadistic side on the terrorist she tortures for information, and her fight with Princess Ashuna is a great setpiece. I love the magic-infused chain that Momo uses for a weapon, and Ashuna is an interesting and flamboyant character in her own right. The royal family and the Church's growing conflict with one another will hopefully add some depth and flavor to Menou and Akari's story.  One of the only downsides to the train adventure is Menou and Akari's showdown with the armored warrior inside of the train. The fight simply isn't as dynamic or fun as the one going on up above, and the production values for this scene (and several others throughout episodes 2 and 3) are noticeably weaker than the generally stellar-looking premiere. The show is never downright ugly, but it's not the kind of anime that can get by on flash and style alone, either.  The final scene of the episode is also worth mentioning, but not because it's bad. I actually loved the reveal that Akari saved everyone from dying horribly in a train crash with her time powers; it's a great cap to the episode-long thread of Menou constantly reminding Akari of how “useless” she is in a fight. That said, if I had any major reservations about the series beyond some potentially shoddy visuals, it would be with Akari herself, and only because I want to see more of the tragic and painful side of her existence in this world. So far, the girl has proven to be a sweet and bubbly presence, and while I think there have been a few hints that she knows more than she lets on, she hasn't been given a lot to do other than be impressed with Menou. Even that excellent train-crash scene is something we only see in the past tense. I guess what I'm saying is that I hope it doesn't take much longer for Akari to be given the same level of depth that Menou has been afforded; it would be a shame if she only existed to be a precious puppy of a girl for Menou to feel guilty about.  These are all minor issues, though, since they're mostly just hypothetical at this point. While The Executioner and Her Way of Life hasn't yet managed to be as blazingly awesome as it was in that first episode, the show is still a very good time time, and I'm excited to see where it goes from here.

When our heroines get caught up in a terrorist plot on the ether train bound for Garm, though, we have our first proper plot for the girls to work through, and the results are pretty good! Momo gets to show off her sadistic side on the terrorist she tortures for information, and her fight with Princess Ashuna is a great setpiece. I love the magic-infused chain that Momo uses for a weapon, and Ashuna is an interesting and flamboyant character in her own right. The royal family and the Church's growing conflict with one another will hopefully add some depth and flavor to Menou and Akari's story.  One of the only downsides to the train adventure is Menou and Akari's showdown with the armored warrior inside of the train. The fight simply isn't as dynamic or fun as the one going on up above, and the production values for this scene (and several others throughout episodes 2 and 3) are noticeably weaker than the generally stellar-looking premiere. The show is never downright ugly, but it's not the kind of anime that can get by on flash and style alone, either.  The final scene of the episode is also worth mentioning, but not because it's bad. I actually loved the reveal that Akari saved everyone from dying horribly in a train crash with her time powers; it's a great cap to the episode-long thread of Menou constantly reminding Akari of how “useless” she is in a fight. That said, if I had any major reservations about the series beyond some potentially shoddy visuals, it would be with Akari herself, and only because I want to see more of the tragic and painful side of her existence in this world. So far, the girl has proven to be a sweet and bubbly presence, and while I think there have been a few hints that she knows more than she lets on, she hasn't been given a lot to do other than be impressed with Menou. Even that excellent train-crash scene is something we only see in the past tense. I guess what I'm saying is that I hope it doesn't take much longer for Akari to be given the same level of depth that Menou has been afforded; it would be a shame if she only existed to be a precious puppy of a girl for Menou to feel guilty about.  These are all minor issues, though, since they're mostly just hypothetical at this point. While The Executioner and Her Way of Life hasn't yet managed to be as blazingly awesome as it was in that first episode, the show is still a very good time time, and I'm excited to see where it goes from here.

Community score: 4.2             The premiere episode of The Executioner and Her Way of Life was  a hell of a good time, as it managed to put a fun twist on some of the most tired modern isekai tropes while also telling a very fun story in its own right. I was excited enough when we got to watch our heroine Menou stab Potato McIsekaiFace in the skull just as he was beginning to get a little too excited about the prospect of murdering all of his enemies with his terrifying nullification magic. Everything that came after that only made the premise of the show all the more compelling. Menou is a conflicted and relatable heroine, and the flashback to the traumatizing destruction of her hometown kills two birds with one stone: It makes you understand exactly how and why a girl like Menou would become a sactioned Executioner, and it shows off the spectacle that the show is capable of when its using its setting and magical rules to the fullest. There are plenty of shows that had a stellar premiere, only to run out of steam in the long term. What I was really looking for in these following episodes were signs that Executioner could hold its own as a series without all of the shock value it mustered with Menou's introduction.  We have a whole world to build, after all, not to mention a central relationship to develop between Menou and Akari, the latter of whom possesses a very powerful magic that can literally turn the tides of time itself. Twelve episodes isn't a whole lot of time to tell a coherent and satisfying story, and we're about a quarter of the way through the series already. (at least, if the HIDIVE episode count is anything to go by). Thankfully, I think I can say that, so far, the show is doing a good job of living up to its potential…mostly.   I have a few nagging quibbles that I will get to shortly, but my biggest takeaway from Episodes 2 and 3 of The Executioner and Her Way of Life is that the show is consistently fun to watch, and that's a good sign. There are some holes in its writing and production that could lead to problems in the long term, but the show has officially passed the all-important Three Episode Test. Even if I wasn't being asked to cover this anime for my job, I'd want to keep up with it on my own time. When you have to watch as much anime as we do around these parts, that's quite the compliment.  More than anything, this series is a testament to how you don't need to completely rely on shocking twists and subverted expectations to deliver a good story. Menou's conflict over having to escort the functionally immortal Akari to the city of Garm is maybe a little straightforward—we all know that Menou is going to eventually start to question her role as Akari's murderer—but the show sells her character well enough that you buy it anyway. It helps that Akari is a sweetheart, so you totally understand why Menou would feel at least kind of bad about gutting Akari like a fish (for a second time, that is).   I'm even starting to warm up to Momo, whose “aggressive lesbian comedy relief” shtick was one of the only major gripes I had with the premiere. The character is still a bit much for my tastes, and I'm not jazzed about how her entire role in the story feels based entirely on her feelings for Menou, but she plays better when she has more to do than make obvious passes at her friend and comment on Akari's boob size. She gets to play more notes than “aggressively horny” once Menou and Akari set off on their journey to Garm, and she even gets a major action highlight when the train attack gets going in Episode 3.

News Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Film Ranks #2 in U.S., Crosses US$119 Million   posted on 2022-04-18 20:15 UTC-8 by Adriana Hazra          Jujutsu Kaisen 0 film earns total of US$29,693,448 in U.S.    Box Office Mojo records Paramount Pictures' Sonic the Hedgehog 2 sequel film as earning a cumulative total of US$119,612,388, ranking #2 in its second weekend in the United States. The film earned approximately US$30 million over the weekend, earning US$10,850,000 on Friday, US$11,675,000 on Saturday, and US$7,550,000 on Sunday.    The film screened in 4,258 theaters, and had a per-theater average of US$7,045 over the weekend. Box Office Mojo also lists the film's worldwide gross at US$231,812,388.    Box Office Mojo also lists that the Jujutsu Kaisen 0 film earned a cumulative total of US$29,693,448 in the United States as of April 3 (Box Office Mojo has no earnings for the film past that date). The film earned US$1,970,000 in its third weekend in the U.S. on April 1-3.    Sonic the Hedgehog 2 opened in the United States on April 8 and earned an estimated US$26.5 million on its opening day, according to Box Office Mojo. It earned an estimated US$70 million internationally, and an estimated worldwide total of US$141 million in its opening weekend.    The film will open in Japan on August 19.      Idris Elba plays Knuckles in the film, and Colleen O'Shaughnessey reprises her role as Tails. O'Shaughnessey has voiced the character since the 2014 Sonic Boom animated series.    Paramount Pictures announced in February that it has already started development on a third Sonic the Hedgehog film, as well as the first live-action series for the Sonic franchise. The live-action series will debut on Paramount Pictures' Paramount+ streaming service in 2023, and will center on the character Knuckles, with Idris Elba reprising the role.      Ben Schwartz (DuckTales, Parks and Recreation) voiced the title character Sonic in the original film. James Marsden (Westworld, X-Men) and Tika Sumpter starred in the film, and Jim Carrey (The Truman Show, Ace Ventura: Pet Detective) played the villain Robotnik.

News Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Film Ranks #2 in U.S., Crosses US$119 Million   posted on 2022-04-18 20:15 UTC-8 by Adriana Hazra          Jujutsu Kaisen 0 film earns total of US$29,693,448 in U.S.    Box Office Mojo records Paramount Pictures' Sonic the Hedgehog 2 sequel film as earning a cumulative total of US$119,612,388, ranking #2 in its second weekend in the United States. The film earned approximately US$30 million over the weekend, earning US$10,850,000 on Friday, US$11,675,000 on Saturday, and US$7,550,000 on Sunday.    The film screened in 4,258 theaters, and had a per-theater average of US$7,045 over the weekend. Box Office Mojo also lists the film's worldwide gross at US$231,812,388.    Box Office Mojo also lists that the Jujutsu Kaisen 0 film earned a cumulative total of US$29,693,448 in the United States as of April 3 (Box Office Mojo has no earnings for the film past that date). The film earned US$1,970,000 in its third weekend in the U.S. on April 1-3.    Sonic the Hedgehog 2 opened in the United States on April 8 and earned an estimated US$26.5 million on its opening day, according to Box Office Mojo. It earned an estimated US$70 million internationally, and an estimated worldwide total of US$141 million in its opening weekend.    The film will open in Japan on August 19.      Idris Elba plays Knuckles in the film, and Colleen O'Shaughnessey reprises her role as Tails. O'Shaughnessey has voiced the character since the 2014 Sonic Boom animated series.    Paramount Pictures announced in February that it has already started development on a third Sonic the Hedgehog film, as well as the first live-action series for the Sonic franchise. The live-action series will debut on Paramount Pictures' Paramount+ streaming service in 2023, and will center on the character Knuckles, with Idris Elba reprising the role.      Ben Schwartz (DuckTales, Parks and Recreation) voiced the title character Sonic in the original film. James Marsden (Westworld, X-Men) and Tika Sumpter starred in the film, and Jim Carrey (The Truman Show, Ace Ventura: Pet Detective) played the villain Robotnik.

News Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Film Ranks #2 in U.S., Crosses US$119 Million   posted on 2022-04-18 20:15 UTC-8 by Adriana Hazra          Jujutsu Kaisen 0 film earns total of US$29,693,448 in U.S.    Box Office Mojo records Paramount Pictures' Sonic the Hedgehog 2 sequel film as earning a cumulative total of US$119,612,388, ranking #2 in its second weekend in the United States. The film earned approximately US$30 million over the weekend, earning US$10,850,000 on Friday, US$11,675,000 on Saturday, and US$7,550,000 on Sunday.    The film screened in 4,258 theaters, and had a per-theater average of US$7,045 over the weekend. Box Office Mojo also lists the film's worldwide gross at US$231,812,388.    Box Office Mojo also lists that the Jujutsu Kaisen 0 film earned a cumulative total of US$29,693,448 in the United States as of April 3 (Box Office Mojo has no earnings for the film past that date). The film earned US$1,970,000 in its third weekend in the U.S. on April 1-3.    Sonic the Hedgehog 2 opened in the United States on April 8 and earned an estimated US$26.5 million on its opening day, according to Box Office Mojo. It earned an estimated US$70 million internationally, and an estimated worldwide total of US$141 million in its opening weekend.    The film will open in Japan on August 19.      Idris Elba plays Knuckles in the film, and Colleen O'Shaughnessey reprises her role as Tails. O'Shaughnessey has voiced the character since the 2014 Sonic Boom animated series.

The live-action series will debut on Paramount Pictures' Paramount+ streaming service in 2023, and will center on the character Knuckles, with Idris Elba reprising the role.      Ben Schwartz (DuckTales, Parks and Recreation) voiced the title character Sonic in the original film.

Titles with less than 4 votes are removed from the list but are still counted in the ranking. This explains why there may be gaps in the ""#"" column.

Titles with many votes will tend to be at the top, but this is modified a little by the ratings. In other words, the popularity is the straight average score of a title (the value in the rating column) multiplied by the number of votes.
