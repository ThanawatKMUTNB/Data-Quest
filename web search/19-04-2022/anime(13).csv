I could be wrong, but I hardly even get the sense that anyone is paying attention to the anime anymore.

I could be wrong, but I hardly even get the sense that anyone is paying attention to the anime anymore.

Anime News Network was created as a news source that focuses on the medium of Japanese Animation(anime) and Japanese Comics (manga). ANN was founded by Justin Sevakis in July of 1998, and has since lead the online anime news medium with a tradition of strong unbiased coverage of major breaking news. With in-depth coverage, analysis and commentary to provide insight into the world of anime and manga, ANN has been and continues to be the #1 English language source for anime and manga news on the Internet. ANN's goal is to make the latest, most comprehensive Anime news available to new fans and veteran Otaku alike.  What ANN is not:  A television network or station; A subsidiary of another company; A dubbing / voice recording studio; An animation company; A licensing or distribution company; A manufacturer or distributor of merchandise; For sale.    What is anime? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of anime, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, anime is animation that is primarily produced and conceived in Japan. This includes animation conceived in Japan that has portions outsourced to other countries, but does not include animation primarily produced outside Japan and with the animation outsourced to Japan. It does however include animation that is co-conceived inside and outside of Japan and at least partially produced inside Japan.  What is manga? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of manga, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, manga are comic books or strips that are produced and conceived in Japan. This includes include comics that are co-conceived inside and outside of Japan but produced in Japan.  Who operates ANN? ANN is operated by a team of people, under the guidance of Christopher Macdonald, Daniel DeLorme, Zac Bertschy, Egan Loo and Hori Shinsuke. A full list of the staff can be found on the staff page.   Who owns ANN? The website is owned by Anime News Network Inc., a privately owned corporation. The corporation's shareholders include: Christopher Macdonald (Minority owner, controlling shareholder), Hori Shinsuke (Minority owner), Anime Consortium Japan (Minority owner), others.   Where is ANN based? Wow, that question is so 1999! ANN is based everywhere and nowhere. We're based on the Internet! We don't have an office; our staff all work at home and are based around the world with the most full-time staff based in Japan and the United States. Anime News Network, Inc. the corporation that maintains ANN is a Canadian corporation.  Who is the mascot? When the site was first launched in 1998 it featured a blond-haired mascot named Jadress, created by Robin Sevakis. She was eventually replaced by Nina, who was featured in a webcomic (also created by Robin Sevakis) that ran from 2007 to 2013.  How often do you update? The site is run on a daily content format, as opposed to a monthly or bi-monthly magazine format. We update the news and reviews daily, and other content, such as features, columns, and editorials are also added throughout the week. Our encyclopedia is updated daily as well.  Under what settings is ANN best viewed? The site uses a responsive design that should look good at any resolution, from smartphones to large desktop screens.  How do I find older articles on ANN? Links to archives for news, features, columns, reviews, etc. can be found in their respective sections in the menu. You can also use the search engine.  What was used to make the site, as well as maintain it? The site is a combination of older parts in PHP and newer parts in Ruby, with a MySQL database to manage the content. Apart from the phpBB forum, we haven't used any pre-made packages; all the content is managed and presented with custom software.  How do I get permission to reprint an ANN Story, or obtain an ANN graphic or photo? ANN has a newsfeed program where you can get the latest anime news headlines on your very own website. If you wish to entirely reprint anything on your site please contact the editors. For more details about what you can and can not re-print with or without our permission, see our copyright statement.  How many people hear or read an ANN story? We get a bit over 200,000 visits every day. In addition to regular visitors, ANN's news is often sourced in print and occasionally on the airwaves.  How can I get in touch with the staff? Visit our contact page or visit our staff page for further contact and personal information. If a member's e-mail address is not there you can send your comments to the editors and we'll forward them.  Do you attend any public events? Yes. ANN tries to provide coverage to as many anime conventions/festivals/symposiums as our staff can manage. For more details on this see our events section and our events forum.  Do you have a newsfeed? You really should have an RSS newsfeed! Look at our newsfeed section for links to various RSS & Atom feeds as well as our custom newsfeed program. Submitting Content  How should I submit news ? Send an e-mail to [email protected] , this e-mail address is regularly monitored by several staff (someone is always ""on duty""). Other methods (e-mail directly to staff, PM, Forum, Twitter, etc...) are less reliable, and may lead to delays and/or a complete failure to notice your submission.  I have something to say about an online petition. Stop. Virtually every e-petition is a waste of time.   I submitted a news item, why wasn't it posted? We could still be in the process of verifying the details, we may not have been able to verify the items, or perhaps we didn't find it newsworthy enough to post. On a ""slow"" news day we're more likely to post less significant items.  I submitted a news item, why was it credited to someone else? They either submitted it first--or more importantly--submitted more information.  Can I submit news about a non-Japanese animation? No. We're Anime News Network, not ""Animation News Network"", not ""Asian Animation Network."" There's plenty of good animation from around the world, including Korea and China, but we only cover Japanese animation, not French, Mexican, Chinese, African, Korean or Afghanistanimation.  Can I submit a review? / How do I become a reviewer? Anime News Network does not accept unsolicited reviews. Take a quick look at the Staff Openings page, if there is an opening, it will be mentioned there. More often than not, we hire experienced writers who are known to us. Best piece of advice we can give is to make a name for yourself then we'll come to you when the time is right.  Can I submit an article? If you are an experienced writer/journalist with a portfolio you can point to, please E-mail the editors and ask about the topic, we'd be glad to consider your article idea.  Can I have a column? No. Only previous, regular contributors who have shown an ability to consistently write timely, quality articles (or reviews) are permitted to write columns. Try submitting some articles or reviews first.  Information X is missing from the Encyclopedia, can you add it? We can't add it, but YOU can. The Encyclopedia is a user-contributed database; it's made specially so that you can add missing information by yourself. You just need a user account. So please do take the time to register and submit the information you found was missing. Each page contains pointers about how to add information, and if that's not enough you can check the Encyclopedia FAQ or the memoranda.  How can I contribute to the encyclopedia? Any registered user can contribute standard data to the Encyclopedia for Anime, Manga and People. But if that's not enough for you and you're near the top of the contributors list and you'd like to help out with the releases, lexicon, or editing and verifying data submitted by other people, please contact the Encyclopedist.  Please note, that we'll be looking for someone who is inputting quality data, not just large amounts of data.   What if I want to contribute in some other way? We always appreciate whatever help and support that readers can give. If you'd like to help out at ANN in a way other than the ones described above, please contact the editors. There's so much to do at ANN that we're very appreciative of any help offered.   My company is making Anime, can you post a news article about it? Sorry, too many companies are trying to cash in on the popularity of Anime by making cartoons with big eyes and purple hair. We're sure you aren't like that, but... well actually, we aren't sure.  Why doesn't Anime News Network review world manga? Please see our definition of manga. It is Anime News Network's official position, and the personal belief of many of our staff, than there is nothing inheritently superior about Japanese manga when compared to world manga. However Anime News Network's purpose is to cover Japanese animation and comic books. Currently we do not have the resources to review all the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America. If and when we are able to review 100% of the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America, we will then consider expanding our area of review coverage to include manga-style comics (world manga) that originate outside of Japan.  Why didn't you post a news article about my (company's) new Anime or Manga? If your item is picked up in a distribution deal by a company that isn't being run out of someone's garage, then maybe its newsworthy. So when that happens, give us a shout, and we'll consider it, but if you can't tell us what makes your creation manga or anime (other than big eyes, purple hair and the like) you can pretty much forget it.  May I send you my company's product to review? If it's anime or manga-related, then yes. Contact editors[at]animenewsnetwork.com for shipping information.  I'm starting a new webmanga, is it news? No, there are a billion and one ""webmangas"", and most only last a couple of months. Now, if your webmanga gets licensed by a publisher... that might be news.  Can you mention my site? Only if you do something newsworthy, sorry.  Why have we been blacklisted? ANN has a 2-strikes rule regarding inappropriate PR. After 2 strikes for the following reasons we will blacklist your company or PR firm (when we blacklist a PR firm, we notify their relevant clients). i) Completely irrelevant PR that has nothing to do with anime, manga, Japanese pop-culture or any other related content; ii) Unauthorized stealth marketing on our forums; iii) Harassing our staff; iv) Continued PR submissions to inappropriate e-mail address. v) Any attempt to illicitly influence editorial We'll send you a link to this post after your first offense. After your second offense you'll never hear from us again (and our readers will never hear from you or your clients).  Isn't this a bit harsh? Perhaps, but we're tired of getting PRs for toilets, accounting firm management changes and World War 2 museums.   But we offer an opt-out! Clicking that link might opt us out of all your press releases, including your relevant ones. It would be the same as blacklisting you, without giving you the warning. Showing you this warning is actually less harsh than clicking your opt-out.  Forum / Account  I didn't receive my forum registration. If you are using a spam filter, please check your spam folder, some mail servers catch the registration code as spam. Search your spamfolder & inbox for e-mail from [email protected] or [email protected]. If you are using any sort of white list, please make sure that your e-mail account is set up to accept e-mails from [email protected] and [email protected]. If you are using a mail service that bounces the e-mail back to the sender and asks them to confirm that it is not spam, we will not do that. These services usually allow you to add the e-mail address to a white-list before hand. Once you have checked all of the above, you can have the server re-send you your activation code by going here. It should be instant, but sometimes e-mail is slow, give it a couple hours (the slowness is usually not because of our server). If you still don't get your activation code, then and ONLY then, e-mail us at h[email protected] make sure that: 1) Your e-mail is sent from the e-mail address you submitted to ANN; 2) You include your user name; 3) Do not send us your password; 4) The subject of your e-mail must be ""activation code"".   How do I become a moderator? You're invited. When we feel there is a need for a new moderator, we look at our best forum users (the ones that contribute intelligently to conversation and act maturely) and ask them if they'd be willing to help us moderate the forum.  Will there ever be an off topic / general conversation forum among the forums? Not in the public areas, no. We do however maintain a community section for subscribers, and off-topic discussion is permitted there.  Why aren't my posts showing up? Posts from new users sometimes take a while to show up. Please be patient, they should appear within a few hours. Believe it or not, this is a ""feature"" not a ""bug.""  Is there a set of forum rules? Right here - read them if you haven't already.  Help, I've been banned or moderated! Read this.  How do I attach a picture (avatar) to my account? Read this.  Can I change my user name? You can make changes in your user account settings. But because other users depend on your username to recognize you, we have a ""no identity switcheroos"" policy: once you start using the forum we do not allow changes to your username beyond punctuation and capitalization.  Can I delete my account? Yes, you can. Go to your account settings page and you will be able to delete your account from there. Contests  Can I enter give-aways more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No.  Can I enter creative contests more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, Yes.  Does ANN ""own"" my entry? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No. But as a condition of your entry we generaly require you to give us the unrevocable right to display your entry on Anime News Network for all eternity.  Can I display my entry elsewhere? Yes, anywhere you please, unless otherwise stated in the contest rules.  Why do I have to put your logo and/or the sponsor's logo on my submission There are two reasons for this. First, it adds some extra benefit to the contest sponsors and second, it helps us insure that you made the entry for the contest, instead of just grabing some existing art and submiting it.  Explain those rules about where I live and whether or not I can enter and if you will ship me a prize. Most of our contest are open to anyone, regardless of where you live, because we don't believe in geographic discrimination. However sometimes our sponsors want a contest to only be open to their potential clients, so in those cases we have no choice to abide by their request to limit contest entry to a certain geographic area. While we don't believe in geographic discrimination, we also don't believe in spending a fortune on shipping and trying to figure out custom laws in order to get you your prize so that's why we only ship to the USA and Canada.   What does a complete mailing address look like? Short answer: ""It's what we need to put on a package to mail it to you."" It looks something like this:  416 William St. #402 Moralton, SS 70707 USA 24 Sussex Dr Ottawa, ON  K1A 0A3 Canada 1000 J.P. Laurel St. San Miguel 1005, Manila  Philippines   You'd be amazed at how many people enter our contests and leave out critical mailing information like their city, province/state and or postal/zip code. You'd also be amazed at how many people ask us ""What do you mean by complete mailing address?"" In fact, if you're reading this, it's quite possible that we referred you here because you asked that very question. Since we usually only ship to the USA and Canada, we won't disqualify you for leaving out the country, but if anything else is missing, we'll just pick another winner to replace you. We will not contact you to verify your mailing address. BTW, your name is not part of your mailing address, but we won't disqualify you for putting it in there...  Why do some contests not ship to PO Boxes? ANN usually doesn't handle shipping for our contest prizes. Shipping is done by the contest sponsor. If the contest states ""no PO boxes"" this is because our sponsor requested it. Most likely it is because they are shipping via a courier like UPS, which will not ship to PO boxes.  I'd really prefer it if you didn't post my name & city if I win This is done for legal reasons, sorry. That said, if you want to enter with an alias, that's fine as long as you are certain the package will reach you (we can't guarantee it will).  Why did you stop accepting art contest entries from Facebook By default, Facebook posts usually aren't public. Most people who submit Facebook URLs to our art contests forget to share their entries publicly, and we are often forced to disqualify these entries. It's better to just avoid the problem altogether. If you want to enter with Facebook, and you remember to make your entry public go ahead, we'll accept it. But if you forget to share it properly, we will simply ignore your entry.   Miscellaneous   Can I link to you? Yes, please feel free. Currently we don't have any banners to offer you for this, we'll be making some new ones shortly.  Can you link to me? No. We are not a link exchange site.  Wait, I can link to you, but you won't link to me?? Yes, we know it sounds a little conceited of us, but that's how it is. To be fair, we don't expect you to link to us, but we're honored if you do decide that you'd like to link to our site despite the fact that we won't be returning the favor. Please don't link to us if you're only doing it because you hope to get something in return; link to us because you feel that you want more people to know about Anime News Network.   Can we trade banners? Sorry, ANN relies on its banners to survive. We very seldom trade banners with another website or publication. If your publication is in print (10 000+ circulation) or a website with 10 million+ impressions per month, we may consider it. Please understand, ANN receives this question at least once a week, it isn't possible for us to even consider swapping / affiliating with so many sites, so we generally don't swap / affiliate with any.  Can you affiliate with us? Anime News Network would be happy to setup an affiliate program with any online store that pays referral fees provided that store meets certain pre-requisites. Anime News Network is unfortunately unable to affiliate itself with fan-sites much for the same reason that we can not link to you or trade banners with you (see above two entries).  Why'd you give this show a rating of ... in your review? Clearly it deserved a ... ! Obviously our reviewer disagrees.  When is title X coming out, how many episodes is it, and/or who is releasing it? Look it up in the encyclopedia, ask Answerman, or ask in the forum.  Why'd you make X change to the programming on [Cartoon Network, YTV, etc]? Uhh, try contacting the broadcaster, network or station. We're a news site and we have no more control over the schedule at [TV Station] than any other media source. Yes, believe it or not we get this question every so often.  I'd like to license, work on, be involved with, etc... one of your titles Just like we aren't involved in TV broadcasting, we are not licensors. Even for shows that we stream on ANN, we are not authorized to sub-license them to other companies. Contact the producers or the licensors, not us.  I'd like permission to do something with one of your titles Sorry, we do not control copyright permissions for any anime or manga. If you need permission to do something, contact the local licensee / master licensor; or failing that, contact the master licensor in Japan. A bit of advice though, for personal, non commercial projects, don't bother contacting them unless you absolutely need permission. They don't care if you make a 1-off t-shirt to wear to school, but if you ask them, they'll probably say ""No,"" as a matter of policy. Sorry we can not help you get in contact with a rights holder.  Why'd you take my video show off YouTube? We get this question a lot. We didn't take your video down. See the above answer as well as the first one. ANN has no involvement in the process of taking pirated materials off of websites like YouTube. For your information, the material was probably taken down because it was uploaded without permission (therefore illegally) and the licensors want you to watch it somewhere they will make money (on DVD, on TV, or on an authorized website). Go here for a list of places where you can legally watch anime and support the creators at the same time.  On a related note, allow us to point out that your video was probably automatically removed by a technology called video-fingerprinting. By this semi-automated process, YouTube removes videos that it believes infringe on copyrights without waiting for complaints from copyright holders. So it's quite possible that no anime company was involved in the removal of your video.   Sadly, this process can affect videos that are legitimate ""fair-use."" Even more sadly, the employees at the anime companies are too busy to bother reading all the e-mails they get about videos (the vast majority of are from morons that don't understand that ""I wasn't making money"" doesn't make it okay) so you can e-mail them to your hearts content, but they probably won't answer (not because they're fan-hating assholes, but because they don't have the time).    If you believe your video is legitimate fair-use (full episodes are never fair use, significant episode clips are rarely fair use, AMVs are almost never fair use of the music) try posting it again and include in the description why you feel it is fair use. If you're lucky, YouTube will take this into consideration (some videos are deleted automatically, others are looked at by a human employee at YouTube after the fingerprinting process identifies them) and not delete your video. You really should read up on ""fair use"" before you make any claims that your video is fair use though. And by ""read-up,"" we mean read professional, expert explanations, not your friend's blog.   I have a great idea for an anime or manga, where do I submit it? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not involved with the creation process of any anime or manga and we can not put you in contact with creators (more on that here). Finally, we'd recommend you read this and this.  How do I get your television channel? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not The Anime Network (TAN). For details on TAN, read the transcript of our chat with them, read our TAN news coverage, or visit their website.  Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? No. As a policy, ANN never gives out contact information. Don't send us this question unless you've exhausted every other resource available (phone book, 411, Google, their website, etc...), even then, we will only forward your request to them, and we will only do so provided it is a business-to-business request being made by a company we've actually heard of. If you can't find Hayao Miyazaki's e-mail address online, it's probably because he doesn't want to receive a thousand e-mails a day. The one exception to this rule is that we will give out the Public Relations / Press Relations (PR) contact information for a company provided we have it readily available. Generally you can find this information on your own though, so please don't be lazy. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? I'm an old acquaintance of theirs. The answer is still no. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? They worked on one of your projects. Just to be clear, our encyclopedia carries information about a myriad of projects (anime,manga, etc...) most of which (99.9%) Anime News Network is not, and never was, involved with. It is not a list of our projects. So if the person actually worked for ANN, please see this answer, but if they are one of the 67023+ people listed in the encyclopedia, they probably didn't work for us and therefore the previous two answers apply. Okay, I understand, you can't or won't put me in contact with them, but I really want/need to contact this person. Can you offer any suggestions on how to proceed? Depending on who you're trying to contact, they might have a fanclub, official webpage, or e-mail address listed in their encyclopedia entry. If not, try looking for the latest production they worked on and contacting the production company, they might be able and willing to forward your e-mail. Just a note, if you're contacting someone in Japan, it's highly recommended that at least your intro be in Japanese. Even if your intended recipient understands English, the person you ask to forward your e-mail might not. For your benefit, here's a quick intro you can prepend to any e-mail you send to Japan (replaces the blanks by the name of the person you are trying to contact): ご担当者様へ お世話になっております。 本社は____様にご連絡を取りたがっています。お手数ですが、このメールを____様へ転送して頂けないでしょうか? 宜しくお願いします。  Literally: To whom it may concern/the person in charge: Thank you for your time. We are trying to contact _____. If it isn't too much trouble, could you forward this e-mail to ____? Thank you very much.    Can you send me your catalog? We don't have a catalog, we don't sell anything.  Where can I buy Anime ? You can buy it at retail movie stores like Blockbuster and Suncoast as well as specialty Anime Shops. You can also buy it online at websites like Anime Castle, Anime Nation, J List, Roberts Anime Corner Store and The Right Stuf International.  Where can I download anime or watch it online? For the most part, you can't legally download anime online. Fansubs are generally illegal (whether or not they're unethical is a completely different topic), and as such, we can't help you obtain them. You might want to check the sites listed below, and read our news, when there's legal anime to download or watched online we generally mention it.  Don't ask us where to get bootlegs or fansubs, we won't tell you.  Some sites/services that allow you to download or watch anime online legally(may or may not be free):  Amazon Prime crunchyroll Funimation's Website HiDive Apple iTunes hulu Netflix Viz Anime  * Why isn't YouTube listed? Because a lot of the content on YouTube is illegally uploaded. One day we'll have an index of legal anime on YouTube, but until then we aren't listing it as a site where all content is legal/authorized.   How do I watch anime on ANN? ANN has stopped streaming anime episodes. Go to the websites above!  Can you help me with my school assignment No. We get this question about once a week, and we don't really want to spend 25 hours a year answering school questions. The worst part is that most people who e-mail us are actually asking us to provide information they could find with a little bit of research, in other words, they're asking us to do their work for them. On the other hand, if you're working on a master's project or PhD thesis related to anime, that interests us, so we'd probably be more than happy to help.  Does ANN offer Internships? Yes, Anime News Network offers internships in our newsroom and our web-development departments. Further details are available here   What happened to ANN UK? In late May the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into effect. The EU determined that any website targeting European readers would be ""doing business in Europe."" Anime News Network does not disagree with this conclusion. Unfortunately, the GDPR requires all websites doing business in Europe to meet a stringent set of privacy regulations. While ANN supports the intent of these regulations, some of them are extremely difficult to comply with. While it is our intention, for the benefit of all readers our readers around the world, to comply with these new standards, we are not able to do so immediately. Once we are fully compliant with GDPR requirements, we will re-launch ANN UK. In the meantime, ANN's global edition is available to all readers worldwide and is the default version for readers outside of North America, Australia, New Zealand and South East Asia.             bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Misc Page homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review          1 comment       Hello, Melancholic!

Anime News Network was created as a news source that focuses on the medium of Japanese Animation(anime) and Japanese Comics (manga). ANN was founded by Justin Sevakis in July of 1998, and has since lead the online anime news medium with a tradition of strong unbiased coverage of major breaking news. With in-depth coverage, analysis and commentary to provide insight into the world of anime and manga, ANN has been and continues to be the #1 English language source for anime and manga news on the Internet. ANN's goal is to make the latest, most comprehensive Anime news available to new fans and veteran Otaku alike.  What ANN is not:  A television network or station; A subsidiary of another company; A dubbing / voice recording studio; An animation company; A licensing or distribution company; A manufacturer or distributor of merchandise; For sale.    What is anime? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of anime, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, anime is animation that is primarily produced and conceived in Japan. This includes animation conceived in Japan that has portions outsourced to other countries, but does not include animation primarily produced outside Japan and with the animation outsourced to Japan. It does however include animation that is co-conceived inside and outside of Japan and at least partially produced inside Japan.  What is manga? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of manga, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, manga are comic books or strips that are produced and conceived in Japan. This includes include comics that are co-conceived inside and outside of Japan but produced in Japan.  Who operates ANN? ANN is operated by a team of people, under the guidance of Christopher Macdonald, Daniel DeLorme, Zac Bertschy, Egan Loo and Hori Shinsuke. A full list of the staff can be found on the staff page.   Who owns ANN? The website is owned by Anime News Network Inc., a privately owned corporation. The corporation's shareholders include: Christopher Macdonald (Minority owner, controlling shareholder), Hori Shinsuke (Minority owner), Anime Consortium Japan (Minority owner), others.   Where is ANN based? Wow, that question is so 1999! ANN is based everywhere and nowhere. We're based on the Internet! We don't have an office; our staff all work at home and are based around the world with the most full-time staff based in Japan and the United States. Anime News Network, Inc. the corporation that maintains ANN is a Canadian corporation.  Who is the mascot? When the site was first launched in 1998 it featured a blond-haired mascot named Jadress, created by Robin Sevakis. She was eventually replaced by Nina, who was featured in a webcomic (also created by Robin Sevakis) that ran from 2007 to 2013.  How often do you update? The site is run on a daily content format, as opposed to a monthly or bi-monthly magazine format. We update the news and reviews daily, and other content, such as features, columns, and editorials are also added throughout the week. Our encyclopedia is updated daily as well.  Under what settings is ANN best viewed? The site uses a responsive design that should look good at any resolution, from smartphones to large desktop screens.  How do I find older articles on ANN? Links to archives for news, features, columns, reviews, etc. can be found in their respective sections in the menu. You can also use the search engine.  What was used to make the site, as well as maintain it? The site is a combination of older parts in PHP and newer parts in Ruby, with a MySQL database to manage the content. Apart from the phpBB forum, we haven't used any pre-made packages; all the content is managed and presented with custom software.  How do I get permission to reprint an ANN Story, or obtain an ANN graphic or photo? ANN has a newsfeed program where you can get the latest anime news headlines on your very own website. If you wish to entirely reprint anything on your site please contact the editors. For more details about what you can and can not re-print with or without our permission, see our copyright statement.  How many people hear or read an ANN story? We get a bit over 200,000 visits every day. In addition to regular visitors, ANN's news is often sourced in print and occasionally on the airwaves.  How can I get in touch with the staff? Visit our contact page or visit our staff page for further contact and personal information. If a member's e-mail address is not there you can send your comments to the editors and we'll forward them.  Do you attend any public events? Yes. ANN tries to provide coverage to as many anime conventions/festivals/symposiums as our staff can manage. For more details on this see our events section and our events forum.  Do you have a newsfeed? You really should have an RSS newsfeed! Look at our newsfeed section for links to various RSS & Atom feeds as well as our custom newsfeed program. Submitting Content  How should I submit news ? Send an e-mail to [email protected] , this e-mail address is regularly monitored by several staff (someone is always ""on duty""). Other methods (e-mail directly to staff, PM, Forum, Twitter, etc...) are less reliable, and may lead to delays and/or a complete failure to notice your submission.  I have something to say about an online petition. Stop. Virtually every e-petition is a waste of time.   I submitted a news item, why wasn't it posted? We could still be in the process of verifying the details, we may not have been able to verify the items, or perhaps we didn't find it newsworthy enough to post. On a ""slow"" news day we're more likely to post less significant items.  I submitted a news item, why was it credited to someone else? They either submitted it first--or more importantly--submitted more information.  Can I submit news about a non-Japanese animation? No. We're Anime News Network, not ""Animation News Network"", not ""Asian Animation Network."" There's plenty of good animation from around the world, including Korea and China, but we only cover Japanese animation, not French, Mexican, Chinese, African, Korean or Afghanistanimation.  Can I submit a review? / How do I become a reviewer? Anime News Network does not accept unsolicited reviews. Take a quick look at the Staff Openings page, if there is an opening, it will be mentioned there. More often than not, we hire experienced writers who are known to us. Best piece of advice we can give is to make a name for yourself then we'll come to you when the time is right.  Can I submit an article? If you are an experienced writer/journalist with a portfolio you can point to, please E-mail the editors and ask about the topic, we'd be glad to consider your article idea.  Can I have a column? No. Only previous, regular contributors who have shown an ability to consistently write timely, quality articles (or reviews) are permitted to write columns. Try submitting some articles or reviews first.  Information X is missing from the Encyclopedia, can you add it? We can't add it, but YOU can. The Encyclopedia is a user-contributed database; it's made specially so that you can add missing information by yourself. You just need a user account. So please do take the time to register and submit the information you found was missing. Each page contains pointers about how to add information, and if that's not enough you can check the Encyclopedia FAQ or the memoranda.  How can I contribute to the encyclopedia? Any registered user can contribute standard data to the Encyclopedia for Anime, Manga and People. But if that's not enough for you and you're near the top of the contributors list and you'd like to help out with the releases, lexicon, or editing and verifying data submitted by other people, please contact the Encyclopedist.  Please note, that we'll be looking for someone who is inputting quality data, not just large amounts of data.   What if I want to contribute in some other way? We always appreciate whatever help and support that readers can give. If you'd like to help out at ANN in a way other than the ones described above, please contact the editors. There's so much to do at ANN that we're very appreciative of any help offered.   My company is making Anime, can you post a news article about it? Sorry, too many companies are trying to cash in on the popularity of Anime by making cartoons with big eyes and purple hair. We're sure you aren't like that, but... well actually, we aren't sure.  Why doesn't Anime News Network review world manga? Please see our definition of manga. It is Anime News Network's official position, and the personal belief of many of our staff, than there is nothing inheritently superior about Japanese manga when compared to world manga. However Anime News Network's purpose is to cover Japanese animation and comic books. Currently we do not have the resources to review all the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America. If and when we are able to review 100% of the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America, we will then consider expanding our area of review coverage to include manga-style comics (world manga) that originate outside of Japan.  Why didn't you post a news article about my (company's) new Anime or Manga? If your item is picked up in a distribution deal by a company that isn't being run out of someone's garage, then maybe its newsworthy. So when that happens, give us a shout, and we'll consider it, but if you can't tell us what makes your creation manga or anime (other than big eyes, purple hair and the like) you can pretty much forget it.  May I send you my company's product to review? If it's anime or manga-related, then yes. Contact editors[at]animenewsnetwork.com for shipping information.  I'm starting a new webmanga, is it news? No, there are a billion and one ""webmangas"", and most only last a couple of months. Now, if your webmanga gets licensed by a publisher... that might be news.  Can you mention my site? Only if you do something newsworthy, sorry.  Why have we been blacklisted? ANN has a 2-strikes rule regarding inappropriate PR. After 2 strikes for the following reasons we will blacklist your company or PR firm (when we blacklist a PR firm, we notify their relevant clients). i) Completely irrelevant PR that has nothing to do with anime, manga, Japanese pop-culture or any other related content; ii) Unauthorized stealth marketing on our forums; iii) Harassing our staff; iv) Continued PR submissions to inappropriate e-mail address. v) Any attempt to illicitly influence editorial We'll send you a link to this post after your first offense. After your second offense you'll never hear from us again (and our readers will never hear from you or your clients).  Isn't this a bit harsh? Perhaps, but we're tired of getting PRs for toilets, accounting firm management changes and World War 2 museums.   But we offer an opt-out! Clicking that link might opt us out of all your press releases, including your relevant ones. It would be the same as blacklisting you, without giving you the warning. Showing you this warning is actually less harsh than clicking your opt-out.  Forum / Account  I didn't receive my forum registration. If you are using a spam filter, please check your spam folder, some mail servers catch the registration code as spam. Search your spamfolder & inbox for e-mail from [email protected] or [email protected]. If you are using any sort of white list, please make sure that your e-mail account is set up to accept e-mails from [email protected] and [email protected]. If you are using a mail service that bounces the e-mail back to the sender and asks them to confirm that it is not spam, we will not do that. These services usually allow you to add the e-mail address to a white-list before hand. Once you have checked all of the above, you can have the server re-send you your activation code by going here. It should be instant, but sometimes e-mail is slow, give it a couple hours (the slowness is usually not because of our server). If you still don't get your activation code, then and ONLY then, e-mail us at h[email protected] make sure that: 1) Your e-mail is sent from the e-mail address you submitted to ANN; 2) You include your user name; 3) Do not send us your password; 4) The subject of your e-mail must be ""activation code"".   How do I become a moderator? You're invited. When we feel there is a need for a new moderator, we look at our best forum users (the ones that contribute intelligently to conversation and act maturely) and ask them if they'd be willing to help us moderate the forum.  Will there ever be an off topic / general conversation forum among the forums? Not in the public areas, no. We do however maintain a community section for subscribers, and off-topic discussion is permitted there.  Why aren't my posts showing up? Posts from new users sometimes take a while to show up. Please be patient, they should appear within a few hours. Believe it or not, this is a ""feature"" not a ""bug.""  Is there a set of forum rules? Right here - read them if you haven't already.  Help, I've been banned or moderated! Read this.  How do I attach a picture (avatar) to my account? Read this.  Can I change my user name? You can make changes in your user account settings. But because other users depend on your username to recognize you, we have a ""no identity switcheroos"" policy: once you start using the forum we do not allow changes to your username beyond punctuation and capitalization.  Can I delete my account? Yes, you can. Go to your account settings page and you will be able to delete your account from there. Contests  Can I enter give-aways more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No.  Can I enter creative contests more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, Yes.  Does ANN ""own"" my entry? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No. But as a condition of your entry we generaly require you to give us the unrevocable right to display your entry on Anime News Network for all eternity.  Can I display my entry elsewhere? Yes, anywhere you please, unless otherwise stated in the contest rules.  Why do I have to put your logo and/or the sponsor's logo on my submission There are two reasons for this. First, it adds some extra benefit to the contest sponsors and second, it helps us insure that you made the entry for the contest, instead of just grabing some existing art and submiting it.  Explain those rules about where I live and whether or not I can enter and if you will ship me a prize. Most of our contest are open to anyone, regardless of where you live, because we don't believe in geographic discrimination. However sometimes our sponsors want a contest to only be open to their potential clients, so in those cases we have no choice to abide by their request to limit contest entry to a certain geographic area. While we don't believe in geographic discrimination, we also don't believe in spending a fortune on shipping and trying to figure out custom laws in order to get you your prize so that's why we only ship to the USA and Canada.   What does a complete mailing address look like? Short answer: ""It's what we need to put on a package to mail it to you."" It looks something like this:  416 William St. #402 Moralton, SS 70707 USA 24 Sussex Dr Ottawa, ON  K1A 0A3 Canada 1000 J.P. Laurel St. San Miguel 1005, Manila  Philippines   You'd be amazed at how many people enter our contests and leave out critical mailing information like their city, province/state and or postal/zip code. You'd also be amazed at how many people ask us ""What do you mean by complete mailing address?"" In fact, if you're reading this, it's quite possible that we referred you here because you asked that very question. Since we usually only ship to the USA and Canada, we won't disqualify you for leaving out the country, but if anything else is missing, we'll just pick another winner to replace you. We will not contact you to verify your mailing address. BTW, your name is not part of your mailing address, but we won't disqualify you for putting it in there...  Why do some contests not ship to PO Boxes? ANN usually doesn't handle shipping for our contest prizes. Shipping is done by the contest sponsor. If the contest states ""no PO boxes"" this is because our sponsor requested it. Most likely it is because they are shipping via a courier like UPS, which will not ship to PO boxes.  I'd really prefer it if you didn't post my name & city if I win This is done for legal reasons, sorry. That said, if you want to enter with an alias, that's fine as long as you are certain the package will reach you (we can't guarantee it will).  Why did you stop accepting art contest entries from Facebook By default, Facebook posts usually aren't public. Most people who submit Facebook URLs to our art contests forget to share their entries publicly, and we are often forced to disqualify these entries. It's better to just avoid the problem altogether. If you want to enter with Facebook, and you remember to make your entry public go ahead, we'll accept it. But if you forget to share it properly, we will simply ignore your entry.   Miscellaneous   Can I link to you? Yes, please feel free. Currently we don't have any banners to offer you for this, we'll be making some new ones shortly.  Can you link to me? No. We are not a link exchange site.  Wait, I can link to you, but you won't link to me?? Yes, we know it sounds a little conceited of us, but that's how it is. To be fair, we don't expect you to link to us, but we're honored if you do decide that you'd like to link to our site despite the fact that we won't be returning the favor. Please don't link to us if you're only doing it because you hope to get something in return; link to us because you feel that you want more people to know about Anime News Network.   Can we trade banners? Sorry, ANN relies on its banners to survive. We very seldom trade banners with another website or publication. If your publication is in print (10 000+ circulation) or a website with 10 million+ impressions per month, we may consider it. Please understand, ANN receives this question at least once a week, it isn't possible for us to even consider swapping / affiliating with so many sites, so we generally don't swap / affiliate with any.  Can you affiliate with us? Anime News Network would be happy to setup an affiliate program with any online store that pays referral fees provided that store meets certain pre-requisites. Anime News Network is unfortunately unable to affiliate itself with fan-sites much for the same reason that we can not link to you or trade banners with you (see above two entries).  Why'd you give this show a rating of ... in your review? Clearly it deserved a ... ! Obviously our reviewer disagrees.  When is title X coming out, how many episodes is it, and/or who is releasing it? Look it up in the encyclopedia, ask Answerman, or ask in the forum.  Why'd you make X change to the programming on [Cartoon Network, YTV, etc]? Uhh, try contacting the broadcaster, network or station. We're a news site and we have no more control over the schedule at [TV Station] than any other media source. Yes, believe it or not we get this question every so often.  I'd like to license, work on, be involved with, etc... one of your titles Just like we aren't involved in TV broadcasting, we are not licensors. Even for shows that we stream on ANN, we are not authorized to sub-license them to other companies. Contact the producers or the licensors, not us.  I'd like permission to do something with one of your titles Sorry, we do not control copyright permissions for any anime or manga. If you need permission to do something, contact the local licensee / master licensor; or failing that, contact the master licensor in Japan. A bit of advice though, for personal, non commercial projects, don't bother contacting them unless you absolutely need permission. They don't care if you make a 1-off t-shirt to wear to school, but if you ask them, they'll probably say ""No,"" as a matter of policy. Sorry we can not help you get in contact with a rights holder.  Why'd you take my video show off YouTube? We get this question a lot. We didn't take your video down. See the above answer as well as the first one. ANN has no involvement in the process of taking pirated materials off of websites like YouTube. For your information, the material was probably taken down because it was uploaded without permission (therefore illegally) and the licensors want you to watch it somewhere they will make money (on DVD, on TV, or on an authorized website). Go here for a list of places where you can legally watch anime and support the creators at the same time.  On a related note, allow us to point out that your video was probably automatically removed by a technology called video-fingerprinting. By this semi-automated process, YouTube removes videos that it believes infringe on copyrights without waiting for complaints from copyright holders. So it's quite possible that no anime company was involved in the removal of your video.   Sadly, this process can affect videos that are legitimate ""fair-use."" Even more sadly, the employees at the anime companies are too busy to bother reading all the e-mails they get about videos (the vast majority of are from morons that don't understand that ""I wasn't making money"" doesn't make it okay) so you can e-mail them to your hearts content, but they probably won't answer (not because they're fan-hating assholes, but because they don't have the time).    If you believe your video is legitimate fair-use (full episodes are never fair use, significant episode clips are rarely fair use, AMVs are almost never fair use of the music) try posting it again and include in the description why you feel it is fair use. If you're lucky, YouTube will take this into consideration (some videos are deleted automatically, others are looked at by a human employee at YouTube after the fingerprinting process identifies them) and not delete your video. You really should read up on ""fair use"" before you make any claims that your video is fair use though. And by ""read-up,"" we mean read professional, expert explanations, not your friend's blog.   I have a great idea for an anime or manga, where do I submit it? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not involved with the creation process of any anime or manga and we can not put you in contact with creators (more on that here). Finally, we'd recommend you read this and this.  How do I get your television channel? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not The Anime Network (TAN). For details on TAN, read the transcript of our chat with them, read our TAN news coverage, or visit their website.  Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? No. As a policy, ANN never gives out contact information. Don't send us this question unless you've exhausted every other resource available (phone book, 411, Google, their website, etc...), even then, we will only forward your request to them, and we will only do so provided it is a business-to-business request being made by a company we've actually heard of. If you can't find Hayao Miyazaki's e-mail address online, it's probably because he doesn't want to receive a thousand e-mails a day. The one exception to this rule is that we will give out the Public Relations / Press Relations (PR) contact information for a company provided we have it readily available. Generally you can find this information on your own though, so please don't be lazy. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? I'm an old acquaintance of theirs. The answer is still no. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? They worked on one of your projects. Just to be clear, our encyclopedia carries information about a myriad of projects (anime,manga, etc...) most of which (99.9%) Anime News Network is not, and never was, involved with. It is not a list of our projects. So if the person actually worked for ANN, please see this answer, but if they are one of the 67023+ people listed in the encyclopedia, they probably didn't work for us and therefore the previous two answers apply. Okay, I understand, you can't or won't put me in contact with them, but I really want/need to contact this person. Can you offer any suggestions on how to proceed? Depending on who you're trying to contact, they might have a fanclub, official webpage, or e-mail address listed in their encyclopedia entry. If not, try looking for the latest production they worked on and contacting the production company, they might be able and willing to forward your e-mail. Just a note, if you're contacting someone in Japan, it's highly recommended that at least your intro be in Japanese. Even if your intended recipient understands English, the person you ask to forward your e-mail might not. For your benefit, here's a quick intro you can prepend to any e-mail you send to Japan (replaces the blanks by the name of the person you are trying to contact): ご担当者様へ お世話になっております。 本社は____様にご連絡を取りたがっています。お手数ですが、このメールを____様へ転送して頂けないでしょうか? 宜しくお願いします。  Literally: To whom it may concern/the person in charge: Thank you for your time. We are trying to contact _____. If it isn't too much trouble, could you forward this e-mail to ____? Thank you very much.    Can you send me your catalog? We don't have a catalog, we don't sell anything.  Where can I buy Anime ? You can buy it at retail movie stores like Blockbuster and Suncoast as well as specialty Anime Shops. You can also buy it online at websites like Anime Castle, Anime Nation, J List, Roberts Anime Corner Store and The Right Stuf International.  Where can I download anime or watch it online? For the most part, you can't legally download anime online. Fansubs are generally illegal (whether or not they're unethical is a completely different topic), and as such, we can't help you obtain them. You might want to check the sites listed below, and read our news, when there's legal anime to download or watched online we generally mention it.  Don't ask us where to get bootlegs or fansubs, we won't tell you.  Some sites/services that allow you to download or watch anime online legally(may or may not be free):  Amazon Prime crunchyroll Funimation's Website HiDive Apple iTunes hulu Netflix Viz Anime  * Why isn't YouTube listed? Because a lot of the content on YouTube is illegally uploaded. One day we'll have an index of legal anime on YouTube, but until then we aren't listing it as a site where all content is legal/authorized.   How do I watch anime on ANN? ANN has stopped streaming anime episodes. Go to the websites above!  Can you help me with my school assignment No. We get this question about once a week, and we don't really want to spend 25 hours a year answering school questions. The worst part is that most people who e-mail us are actually asking us to provide information they could find with a little bit of research, in other words, they're asking us to do their work for them. On the other hand, if you're working on a master's project or PhD thesis related to anime, that interests us, so we'd probably be more than happy to help.  Does ANN offer Internships? Yes, Anime News Network offers internships in our newsroom and our web-development departments. Further details are available here   What happened to ANN UK? In late May the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into effect. The EU determined that any website targeting European readers would be ""doing business in Europe."" Anime News Network does not disagree with this conclusion. Unfortunately, the GDPR requires all websites doing business in Europe to meet a stringent set of privacy regulations. While ANN supports the intent of these regulations, some of them are extremely difficult to comply with. While it is our intention, for the benefit of all readers our readers around the world, to comply with these new standards, we are not able to do so immediately. Once we are fully compliant with GDPR requirements, we will re-launch ANN UK. In the meantime, ANN's global edition is available to all readers worldwide and is the default version for readers outside of North America, Australia, New Zealand and South East Asia.             bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Misc Page homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review          1 comment       Hello, Melancholic!

Anime News Network was created as a news source that focuses on the medium of Japanese Animation(anime) and Japanese Comics (manga). ANN was founded by Justin Sevakis in July of 1998, and has since lead the online anime news medium with a tradition of strong unbiased coverage of major breaking news. With in-depth coverage, analysis and commentary to provide insight into the world of anime and manga, ANN has been and continues to be the #1 English language source for anime and manga news on the Internet. ANN's goal is to make the latest, most comprehensive Anime news available to new fans and veteran Otaku alike.  What ANN is not:  A television network or station; A subsidiary of another company; A dubbing / voice recording studio; An animation company; A licensing or distribution company; A manufacturer or distributor of merchandise; For sale.    What is anime? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of anime, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, anime is animation that is primarily produced and conceived in Japan. This includes animation conceived in Japan that has portions outsourced to other countries, but does not include animation primarily produced outside Japan and with the animation outsourced to Japan. It does however include animation that is co-conceived inside and outside of Japan and at least partially produced inside Japan.  What is manga? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of manga, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, manga are comic books or strips that are produced and conceived in Japan. This includes include comics that are co-conceived inside and outside of Japan but produced in Japan.  Who operates ANN? ANN is operated by a team of people, under the guidance of Christopher Macdonald, Daniel DeLorme, Zac Bertschy, Egan Loo and Hori Shinsuke. A full list of the staff can be found on the staff page.   Who owns ANN? The website is owned by Anime News Network Inc., a privately owned corporation. The corporation's shareholders include: Christopher Macdonald (Minority owner, controlling shareholder), Hori Shinsuke (Minority owner), Anime Consortium Japan (Minority owner), others.   Where is ANN based? Wow, that question is so 1999! ANN is based everywhere and nowhere. We're based on the Internet! We don't have an office; our staff all work at home and are based around the world with the most full-time staff based in Japan and the United States. Anime News Network, Inc. the corporation that maintains ANN is a Canadian corporation.  Who is the mascot? When the site was first launched in 1998 it featured a blond-haired mascot named Jadress, created by Robin Sevakis. She was eventually replaced by Nina, who was featured in a webcomic (also created by Robin Sevakis) that ran from 2007 to 2013.  How often do you update? The site is run on a daily content format, as opposed to a monthly or bi-monthly magazine format. We update the news and reviews daily, and other content, such as features, columns, and editorials are also added throughout the week. Our encyclopedia is updated daily as well.  Under what settings is ANN best viewed? The site uses a responsive design that should look good at any resolution, from smartphones to large desktop screens.  How do I find older articles on ANN? Links to archives for news, features, columns, reviews, etc. can be found in their respective sections in the menu. You can also use the search engine.  What was used to make the site, as well as maintain it? The site is a combination of older parts in PHP and newer parts in Ruby, with a MySQL database to manage the content. Apart from the phpBB forum, we haven't used any pre-made packages; all the content is managed and presented with custom software.  How do I get permission to reprint an ANN Story, or obtain an ANN graphic or photo? ANN has a newsfeed program where you can get the latest anime news headlines on your very own website. If you wish to entirely reprint anything on your site please contact the editors. For more details about what you can and can not re-print with or without our permission, see our copyright statement.  How many people hear or read an ANN story? We get a bit over 200,000 visits every day. In addition to regular visitors, ANN's news is often sourced in print and occasionally on the airwaves.  How can I get in touch with the staff? Visit our contact page or visit our staff page for further contact and personal information. If a member's e-mail address is not there you can send your comments to the editors and we'll forward them.  Do you attend any public events? Yes. ANN tries to provide coverage to as many anime conventions/festivals/symposiums as our staff can manage. For more details on this see our events section and our events forum.  Do you have a newsfeed? You really should have an RSS newsfeed! Look at our newsfeed section for links to various RSS & Atom feeds as well as our custom newsfeed program. Submitting Content  How should I submit news ? Send an e-mail to [email protected] , this e-mail address is regularly monitored by several staff (someone is always ""on duty""). Other methods (e-mail directly to staff, PM, Forum, Twitter, etc...) are less reliable, and may lead to delays and/or a complete failure to notice your submission.  I have something to say about an online petition. Stop. Virtually every e-petition is a waste of time.   I submitted a news item, why wasn't it posted? We could still be in the process of verifying the details, we may not have been able to verify the items, or perhaps we didn't find it newsworthy enough to post. On a ""slow"" news day we're more likely to post less significant items.  I submitted a news item, why was it credited to someone else? They either submitted it first--or more importantly--submitted more information.  Can I submit news about a non-Japanese animation? No. We're Anime News Network, not ""Animation News Network"", not ""Asian Animation Network."" There's plenty of good animation from around the world, including Korea and China, but we only cover Japanese animation, not French, Mexican, Chinese, African, Korean or Afghanistanimation.  Can I submit a review? / How do I become a reviewer? Anime News Network does not accept unsolicited reviews. Take a quick look at the Staff Openings page, if there is an opening, it will be mentioned there. More often than not, we hire experienced writers who are known to us. Best piece of advice we can give is to make a name for yourself then we'll come to you when the time is right.  Can I submit an article? If you are an experienced writer/journalist with a portfolio you can point to, please E-mail the editors and ask about the topic, we'd be glad to consider your article idea.  Can I have a column? No. Only previous, regular contributors who have shown an ability to consistently write timely, quality articles (or reviews) are permitted to write columns. Try submitting some articles or reviews first.  Information X is missing from the Encyclopedia, can you add it? We can't add it, but YOU can. The Encyclopedia is a user-contributed database; it's made specially so that you can add missing information by yourself. You just need a user account. So please do take the time to register and submit the information you found was missing. Each page contains pointers about how to add information, and if that's not enough you can check the Encyclopedia FAQ or the memoranda.  How can I contribute to the encyclopedia? Any registered user can contribute standard data to the Encyclopedia for Anime, Manga and People. But if that's not enough for you and you're near the top of the contributors list and you'd like to help out with the releases, lexicon, or editing and verifying data submitted by other people, please contact the Encyclopedist.  Please note, that we'll be looking for someone who is inputting quality data, not just large amounts of data.   What if I want to contribute in some other way? We always appreciate whatever help and support that readers can give. If you'd like to help out at ANN in a way other than the ones described above, please contact the editors. There's so much to do at ANN that we're very appreciative of any help offered.   My company is making Anime, can you post a news article about it? Sorry, too many companies are trying to cash in on the popularity of Anime by making cartoons with big eyes and purple hair. We're sure you aren't like that, but... well actually, we aren't sure.  Why doesn't Anime News Network review world manga? Please see our definition of manga. It is Anime News Network's official position, and the personal belief of many of our staff, than there is nothing inheritently superior about Japanese manga when compared to world manga. However Anime News Network's purpose is to cover Japanese animation and comic books. Currently we do not have the resources to review all the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America. If and when we are able to review 100% of the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America, we will then consider expanding our area of review coverage to include manga-style comics (world manga) that originate outside of Japan.  Why didn't you post a news article about my (company's) new Anime or Manga? If your item is picked up in a distribution deal by a company that isn't being run out of someone's garage, then maybe its newsworthy. So when that happens, give us a shout, and we'll consider it, but if you can't tell us what makes your creation manga or anime (other than big eyes, purple hair and the like) you can pretty much forget it.  May I send you my company's product to review? If it's anime or manga-related, then yes. Contact editors[at]animenewsnetwork.com for shipping information.  I'm starting a new webmanga, is it news? No, there are a billion and one ""webmangas"", and most only last a couple of months. Now, if your webmanga gets licensed by a publisher... that might be news.  Can you mention my site? Only if you do something newsworthy, sorry.  Why have we been blacklisted? ANN has a 2-strikes rule regarding inappropriate PR. After 2 strikes for the following reasons we will blacklist your company or PR firm (when we blacklist a PR firm, we notify their relevant clients). i) Completely irrelevant PR that has nothing to do with anime, manga, Japanese pop-culture or any other related content; ii) Unauthorized stealth marketing on our forums; iii) Harassing our staff; iv) Continued PR submissions to inappropriate e-mail address. v) Any attempt to illicitly influence editorial We'll send you a link to this post after your first offense. After your second offense you'll never hear from us again (and our readers will never hear from you or your clients).  Isn't this a bit harsh? Perhaps, but we're tired of getting PRs for toilets, accounting firm management changes and World War 2 museums.   But we offer an opt-out! Clicking that link might opt us out of all your press releases, including your relevant ones. It would be the same as blacklisting you, without giving you the warning. Showing you this warning is actually less harsh than clicking your opt-out.  Forum / Account  I didn't receive my forum registration. If you are using a spam filter, please check your spam folder, some mail servers catch the registration code as spam. Search your spamfolder & inbox for e-mail from [email protected] or [email protected]. If you are using any sort of white list, please make sure that your e-mail account is set up to accept e-mails from [email protected] and [email protected]. If you are using a mail service that bounces the e-mail back to the sender and asks them to confirm that it is not spam, we will not do that. These services usually allow you to add the e-mail address to a white-list before hand. Once you have checked all of the above, you can have the server re-send you your activation code by going here. It should be instant, but sometimes e-mail is slow, give it a couple hours (the slowness is usually not because of our server). If you still don't get your activation code, then and ONLY then, e-mail us at h[email protected] make sure that: 1) Your e-mail is sent from the e-mail address you submitted to ANN; 2) You include your user name; 3) Do not send us your password; 4) The subject of your e-mail must be ""activation code"".   How do I become a moderator? You're invited. When we feel there is a need for a new moderator, we look at our best forum users (the ones that contribute intelligently to conversation and act maturely) and ask them if they'd be willing to help us moderate the forum.  Will there ever be an off topic / general conversation forum among the forums? Not in the public areas, no. We do however maintain a community section for subscribers, and off-topic discussion is permitted there.  Why aren't my posts showing up? Posts from new users sometimes take a while to show up. Please be patient, they should appear within a few hours. Believe it or not, this is a ""feature"" not a ""bug.""  Is there a set of forum rules? Right here - read them if you haven't already.  Help, I've been banned or moderated! Read this.  How do I attach a picture (avatar) to my account? Read this.  Can I change my user name? You can make changes in your user account settings. But because other users depend on your username to recognize you, we have a ""no identity switcheroos"" policy: once you start using the forum we do not allow changes to your username beyond punctuation and capitalization.  Can I delete my account? Yes, you can. Go to your account settings page and you will be able to delete your account from there. Contests  Can I enter give-aways more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No.  Can I enter creative contests more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, Yes.  Does ANN ""own"" my entry? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No. But as a condition of your entry we generaly require you to give us the unrevocable right to display your entry on Anime News Network for all eternity.  Can I display my entry elsewhere? Yes, anywhere you please, unless otherwise stated in the contest rules.  Why do I have to put your logo and/or the sponsor's logo on my submission There are two reasons for this. First, it adds some extra benefit to the contest sponsors and second, it helps us insure that you made the entry for the contest, instead of just grabing some existing art and submiting it.  Explain those rules about where I live and whether or not I can enter and if you will ship me a prize. Most of our contest are open to anyone, regardless of where you live, because we don't believe in geographic discrimination. However sometimes our sponsors want a contest to only be open to their potential clients, so in those cases we have no choice to abide by their request to limit contest entry to a certain geographic area. While we don't believe in geographic discrimination, we also don't believe in spending a fortune on shipping and trying to figure out custom laws in order to get you your prize so that's why we only ship to the USA and Canada.   What does a complete mailing address look like? Short answer: ""It's what we need to put on a package to mail it to you."" It looks something like this:  416 William St. #402 Moralton, SS 70707 USA 24 Sussex Dr Ottawa, ON  K1A 0A3 Canada 1000 J.P. Laurel St. San Miguel 1005, Manila  Philippines   You'd be amazed at how many people enter our contests and leave out critical mailing information like their city, province/state and or postal/zip code. You'd also be amazed at how many people ask us ""What do you mean by complete mailing address?"" In fact, if you're reading this, it's quite possible that we referred you here because you asked that very question. Since we usually only ship to the USA and Canada, we won't disqualify you for leaving out the country, but if anything else is missing, we'll just pick another winner to replace you. We will not contact you to verify your mailing address. BTW, your name is not part of your mailing address, but we won't disqualify you for putting it in there...  Why do some contests not ship to PO Boxes? ANN usually doesn't handle shipping for our contest prizes. Shipping is done by the contest sponsor. If the contest states ""no PO boxes"" this is because our sponsor requested it. Most likely it is because they are shipping via a courier like UPS, which will not ship to PO boxes.  I'd really prefer it if you didn't post my name & city if I win This is done for legal reasons, sorry. That said, if you want to enter with an alias, that's fine as long as you are certain the package will reach you (we can't guarantee it will).  Why did you stop accepting art contest entries from Facebook By default, Facebook posts usually aren't public. Most people who submit Facebook URLs to our art contests forget to share their entries publicly, and we are often forced to disqualify these entries. It's better to just avoid the problem altogether. If you want to enter with Facebook, and you remember to make your entry public go ahead, we'll accept it. But if you forget to share it properly, we will simply ignore your entry.   Miscellaneous   Can I link to you? Yes, please feel free. Currently we don't have any banners to offer you for this, we'll be making some new ones shortly.  Can you link to me? No. We are not a link exchange site.  Wait, I can link to you, but you won't link to me?? Yes, we know it sounds a little conceited of us, but that's how it is. To be fair, we don't expect you to link to us, but we're honored if you do decide that you'd like to link to our site despite the fact that we won't be returning the favor. Please don't link to us if you're only doing it because you hope to get something in return; link to us because you feel that you want more people to know about Anime News Network.   Can we trade banners? Sorry, ANN relies on its banners to survive. We very seldom trade banners with another website or publication. If your publication is in print (10 000+ circulation) or a website with 10 million+ impressions per month, we may consider it. Please understand, ANN receives this question at least once a week, it isn't possible for us to even consider swapping / affiliating with so many sites, so we generally don't swap / affiliate with any.  Can you affiliate with us? Anime News Network would be happy to setup an affiliate program with any online store that pays referral fees provided that store meets certain pre-requisites. Anime News Network is unfortunately unable to affiliate itself with fan-sites much for the same reason that we can not link to you or trade banners with you (see above two entries).  Why'd you give this show a rating of ... in your review? Clearly it deserved a ... ! Obviously our reviewer disagrees.  When is title X coming out, how many episodes is it, and/or who is releasing it? Look it up in the encyclopedia, ask Answerman, or ask in the forum.  Why'd you make X change to the programming on [Cartoon Network, YTV, etc]? Uhh, try contacting the broadcaster, network or station. We're a news site and we have no more control over the schedule at [TV Station] than any other media source. Yes, believe it or not we get this question every so often.  I'd like to license, work on, be involved with, etc... one of your titles Just like we aren't involved in TV broadcasting, we are not licensors. Even for shows that we stream on ANN, we are not authorized to sub-license them to other companies. Contact the producers or the licensors, not us.  I'd like permission to do something with one of your titles Sorry, we do not control copyright permissions for any anime or manga. If you need permission to do something, contact the local licensee / master licensor; or failing that, contact the master licensor in Japan. A bit of advice though, for personal, non commercial projects, don't bother contacting them unless you absolutely need permission. They don't care if you make a 1-off t-shirt to wear to school, but if you ask them, they'll probably say ""No,"" as a matter of policy. Sorry we can not help you get in contact with a rights holder.  Why'd you take my video show off YouTube? We get this question a lot. We didn't take your video down. See the above answer as well as the first one. ANN has no involvement in the process of taking pirated materials off of websites like YouTube. For your information, the material was probably taken down because it was uploaded without permission (therefore illegally) and the licensors want you to watch it somewhere they will make money (on DVD, on TV, or on an authorized website). Go here for a list of places where you can legally watch anime and support the creators at the same time.  On a related note, allow us to point out that your video was probably automatically removed by a technology called video-fingerprinting. By this semi-automated process, YouTube removes videos that it believes infringe on copyrights without waiting for complaints from copyright holders. So it's quite possible that no anime company was involved in the removal of your video.   Sadly, this process can affect videos that are legitimate ""fair-use."" Even more sadly, the employees at the anime companies are too busy to bother reading all the e-mails they get about videos (the vast majority of are from morons that don't understand that ""I wasn't making money"" doesn't make it okay) so you can e-mail them to your hearts content, but they probably won't answer (not because they're fan-hating assholes, but because they don't have the time).    If you believe your video is legitimate fair-use (full episodes are never fair use, significant episode clips are rarely fair use, AMVs are almost never fair use of the music) try posting it again and include in the description why you feel it is fair use. If you're lucky, YouTube will take this into consideration (some videos are deleted automatically, others are looked at by a human employee at YouTube after the fingerprinting process identifies them) and not delete your video. You really should read up on ""fair use"" before you make any claims that your video is fair use though. And by ""read-up,"" we mean read professional, expert explanations, not your friend's blog.   I have a great idea for an anime or manga, where do I submit it? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not involved with the creation process of any anime or manga and we can not put you in contact with creators (more on that here). Finally, we'd recommend you read this and this.  How do I get your television channel? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not The Anime Network (TAN). For details on TAN, read the transcript of our chat with them, read our TAN news coverage, or visit their website.  Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? No. As a policy, ANN never gives out contact information. Don't send us this question unless you've exhausted every other resource available (phone book, 411, Google, their website, etc...), even then, we will only forward your request to them, and we will only do so provided it is a business-to-business request being made by a company we've actually heard of. If you can't find Hayao Miyazaki's e-mail address online, it's probably because he doesn't want to receive a thousand e-mails a day. The one exception to this rule is that we will give out the Public Relations / Press Relations (PR) contact information for a company provided we have it readily available. Generally you can find this information on your own though, so please don't be lazy. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? I'm an old acquaintance of theirs. The answer is still no. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? They worked on one of your projects. Just to be clear, our encyclopedia carries information about a myriad of projects (anime,manga, etc...) most of which (99.9%) Anime News Network is not, and never was, involved with. It is not a list of our projects. So if the person actually worked for ANN, please see this answer, but if they are one of the 67023+ people listed in the encyclopedia, they probably didn't work for us and therefore the previous two answers apply. Okay, I understand, you can't or won't put me in contact with them, but I really want/need to contact this person. Can you offer any suggestions on how to proceed? Depending on who you're trying to contact, they might have a fanclub, official webpage, or e-mail address listed in their encyclopedia entry. If not, try looking for the latest production they worked on and contacting the production company, they might be able and willing to forward your e-mail. Just a note, if you're contacting someone in Japan, it's highly recommended that at least your intro be in Japanese. Even if your intended recipient understands English, the person you ask to forward your e-mail might not. For your benefit, here's a quick intro you can prepend to any e-mail you send to Japan (replaces the blanks by the name of the person you are trying to contact): ご担当者様へ お世話になっております。 本社は____様にご連絡を取りたがっています。お手数ですが、このメールを____様へ転送して頂けないでしょうか? 宜しくお願いします。  Literally: To whom it may concern/the person in charge: Thank you for your time. We are trying to contact _____. If it isn't too much trouble, could you forward this e-mail to ____? Thank you very much.    Can you send me your catalog? We don't have a catalog, we don't sell anything.  Where can I buy Anime ? You can buy it at retail movie stores like Blockbuster and Suncoast as well as specialty Anime Shops. You can also buy it online at websites like Anime Castle, Anime Nation, J List, Roberts Anime Corner Store and The Right Stuf International.  Where can I download anime or watch it online? For the most part, you can't legally download anime online. Fansubs are generally illegal (whether or not they're unethical is a completely different topic), and as such, we can't help you obtain them. You might want to check the sites listed below, and read our news, when there's legal anime to download or watched online we generally mention it.  Don't ask us where to get bootlegs or fansubs, we won't tell you.  Some sites/services that allow you to download or watch anime online legally(may or may not be free):  Amazon Prime crunchyroll Funimation's Website HiDive Apple iTunes hulu Netflix Viz Anime  * Why isn't YouTube listed? Because a lot of the content on YouTube is illegally uploaded. One day we'll have an index of legal anime on YouTube, but until then we aren't listing it as a site where all content is legal/authorized.   How do I watch anime on ANN? ANN has stopped streaming anime episodes. Go to the websites above!  Can you help me with my school assignment No. We get this question about once a week, and we don't really want to spend 25 hours a year answering school questions. The worst part is that most people who e-mail us are actually asking us to provide information they could find with a little bit of research, in other words, they're asking us to do their work for them. On the other hand, if you're working on a master's project or PhD thesis related to anime, that interests us, so we'd probably be more than happy to help.  Does ANN offer Internships? Yes, Anime News Network offers internships in our newsroom and our web-development departments. Further details are available here   What happened to ANN UK? In late May the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into effect. The EU determined that any website targeting European readers would be ""doing business in Europe."" Anime News Network does not disagree with this conclusion. Unfortunately, the GDPR requires all websites doing business in Europe to meet a stringent set of privacy regulations. While ANN supports the intent of these regulations, some of them are extremely difficult to comply with. While it is our intention, for the benefit of all readers our readers around the world, to comply with these new standards, we are not able to do so immediately. Once we are fully compliant with GDPR requirements, we will re-launch ANN UK. In the meantime, ANN's global edition is available to all readers worldwide and is the default version for readers outside of North America, Australia, New Zealand and South East Asia.             bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Misc Page homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review          1 comment       Hello, Melancholic!

Anime News Network was created as a news source that focuses on the medium of Japanese Animation(anime) and Japanese Comics (manga). ANN was founded by Justin Sevakis in July of 1998, and has since lead the online anime news medium with a tradition of strong unbiased coverage of major breaking news. With in-depth coverage, analysis and commentary to provide insight into the world of anime and manga, ANN has been and continues to be the #1 English language source for anime and manga news on the Internet. ANN's goal is to make the latest, most comprehensive Anime news available to new fans and veteran Otaku alike.  What ANN is not:  A television network or station; A subsidiary of another company; A dubbing / voice recording studio; An animation company; A licensing or distribution company; A manufacturer or distributor of merchandise; For sale.    What is anime? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of anime, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, anime is animation that is primarily produced and conceived in Japan. This includes animation conceived in Japan that has portions outsourced to other countries, but does not include animation primarily produced outside Japan and with the animation outsourced to Japan. It does however include animation that is co-conceived inside and outside of Japan and at least partially produced inside Japan.  What is manga? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of manga, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, manga are comic books or strips that are produced and conceived in Japan. This includes include comics that are co-conceived inside and outside of Japan but produced in Japan.  Who operates ANN? ANN is operated by a team of people, under the guidance of Christopher Macdonald, Daniel DeLorme, Zac Bertschy, Egan Loo and Hori Shinsuke. A full list of the staff can be found on the staff page.   Who owns ANN? The website is owned by Anime News Network Inc., a privately owned corporation. The corporation's shareholders include: Christopher Macdonald (Minority owner, controlling shareholder), Hori Shinsuke (Minority owner), Anime Consortium Japan (Minority owner), others.   Where is ANN based? Wow, that question is so 1999! ANN is based everywhere and nowhere. We're based on the Internet! We don't have an office; our staff all work at home and are based around the world with the most full-time staff based in Japan and the United States. Anime News Network, Inc. the corporation that maintains ANN is a Canadian corporation.  Who is the mascot? When the site was first launched in 1998 it featured a blond-haired mascot named Jadress, created by Robin Sevakis. She was eventually replaced by Nina, who was featured in a webcomic (also created by Robin Sevakis) that ran from 2007 to 2013.  How often do you update? The site is run on a daily content format, as opposed to a monthly or bi-monthly magazine format. We update the news and reviews daily, and other content, such as features, columns, and editorials are also added throughout the week. Our encyclopedia is updated daily as well.  Under what settings is ANN best viewed? The site uses a responsive design that should look good at any resolution, from smartphones to large desktop screens.  How do I find older articles on ANN? Links to archives for news, features, columns, reviews, etc. can be found in their respective sections in the menu. You can also use the search engine.  What was used to make the site, as well as maintain it? The site is a combination of older parts in PHP and newer parts in Ruby, with a MySQL database to manage the content. Apart from the phpBB forum, we haven't used any pre-made packages; all the content is managed and presented with custom software.  How do I get permission to reprint an ANN Story, or obtain an ANN graphic or photo? ANN has a newsfeed program where you can get the latest anime news headlines on your very own website. If you wish to entirely reprint anything on your site please contact the editors. For more details about what you can and can not re-print with or without our permission, see our copyright statement.  How many people hear or read an ANN story? We get a bit over 200,000 visits every day. In addition to regular visitors, ANN's news is often sourced in print and occasionally on the airwaves.  How can I get in touch with the staff? Visit our contact page or visit our staff page for further contact and personal information. If a member's e-mail address is not there you can send your comments to the editors and we'll forward them.  Do you attend any public events? Yes. ANN tries to provide coverage to as many anime conventions/festivals/symposiums as our staff can manage. For more details on this see our events section and our events forum.  Do you have a newsfeed? You really should have an RSS newsfeed! Look at our newsfeed section for links to various RSS & Atom feeds as well as our custom newsfeed program. Submitting Content  How should I submit news ? Send an e-mail to [email protected] , this e-mail address is regularly monitored by several staff (someone is always ""on duty""). Other methods (e-mail directly to staff, PM, Forum, Twitter, etc...) are less reliable, and may lead to delays and/or a complete failure to notice your submission.  I have something to say about an online petition. Stop. Virtually every e-petition is a waste of time.   I submitted a news item, why wasn't it posted? We could still be in the process of verifying the details, we may not have been able to verify the items, or perhaps we didn't find it newsworthy enough to post. On a ""slow"" news day we're more likely to post less significant items.  I submitted a news item, why was it credited to someone else? They either submitted it first--or more importantly--submitted more information.  Can I submit news about a non-Japanese animation? No. We're Anime News Network, not ""Animation News Network"", not ""Asian Animation Network."" There's plenty of good animation from around the world, including Korea and China, but we only cover Japanese animation, not French, Mexican, Chinese, African, Korean or Afghanistanimation.  Can I submit a review? / How do I become a reviewer? Anime News Network does not accept unsolicited reviews. Take a quick look at the Staff Openings page, if there is an opening, it will be mentioned there. More often than not, we hire experienced writers who are known to us. Best piece of advice we can give is to make a name for yourself then we'll come to you when the time is right.  Can I submit an article? If you are an experienced writer/journalist with a portfolio you can point to, please E-mail the editors and ask about the topic, we'd be glad to consider your article idea.  Can I have a column? No. Only previous, regular contributors who have shown an ability to consistently write timely, quality articles (or reviews) are permitted to write columns. Try submitting some articles or reviews first.  Information X is missing from the Encyclopedia, can you add it? We can't add it, but YOU can. The Encyclopedia is a user-contributed database; it's made specially so that you can add missing information by yourself. You just need a user account. So please do take the time to register and submit the information you found was missing. Each page contains pointers about how to add information, and if that's not enough you can check the Encyclopedia FAQ or the memoranda.  How can I contribute to the encyclopedia? Any registered user can contribute standard data to the Encyclopedia for Anime, Manga and People. But if that's not enough for you and you're near the top of the contributors list and you'd like to help out with the releases, lexicon, or editing and verifying data submitted by other people, please contact the Encyclopedist.  Please note, that we'll be looking for someone who is inputting quality data, not just large amounts of data.   What if I want to contribute in some other way? We always appreciate whatever help and support that readers can give. If you'd like to help out at ANN in a way other than the ones described above, please contact the editors. There's so much to do at ANN that we're very appreciative of any help offered.   My company is making Anime, can you post a news article about it? Sorry, too many companies are trying to cash in on the popularity of Anime by making cartoons with big eyes and purple hair. We're sure you aren't like that, but... well actually, we aren't sure.  Why doesn't Anime News Network review world manga? Please see our definition of manga. It is Anime News Network's official position, and the personal belief of many of our staff, than there is nothing inheritently superior about Japanese manga when compared to world manga. However Anime News Network's purpose is to cover Japanese animation and comic books. Currently we do not have the resources to review all the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America. If and when we are able to review 100% of the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America, we will then consider expanding our area of review coverage to include manga-style comics (world manga) that originate outside of Japan.  Why didn't you post a news article about my (company's) new Anime or Manga? If your item is picked up in a distribution deal by a company that isn't being run out of someone's garage, then maybe its newsworthy. So when that happens, give us a shout, and we'll consider it, but if you can't tell us what makes your creation manga or anime (other than big eyes, purple hair and the like) you can pretty much forget it.  May I send you my company's product to review? If it's anime or manga-related, then yes. Contact editors[at]animenewsnetwork.com for shipping information.  I'm starting a new webmanga, is it news? No, there are a billion and one ""webmangas"", and most only last a couple of months. Now, if your webmanga gets licensed by a publisher... that might be news.  Can you mention my site? Only if you do something newsworthy, sorry.  Why have we been blacklisted? ANN has a 2-strikes rule regarding inappropriate PR. After 2 strikes for the following reasons we will blacklist your company or PR firm (when we blacklist a PR firm, we notify their relevant clients). i) Completely irrelevant PR that has nothing to do with anime, manga, Japanese pop-culture or any other related content; ii) Unauthorized stealth marketing on our forums; iii) Harassing our staff; iv) Continued PR submissions to inappropriate e-mail address. v) Any attempt to illicitly influence editorial We'll send you a link to this post after your first offense. After your second offense you'll never hear from us again (and our readers will never hear from you or your clients).  Isn't this a bit harsh? Perhaps, but we're tired of getting PRs for toilets, accounting firm management changes and World War 2 museums.   But we offer an opt-out! Clicking that link might opt us out of all your press releases, including your relevant ones. It would be the same as blacklisting you, without giving you the warning. Showing you this warning is actually less harsh than clicking your opt-out.  Forum / Account  I didn't receive my forum registration. If you are using a spam filter, please check your spam folder, some mail servers catch the registration code as spam. Search your spamfolder & inbox for e-mail from [email protected] or [email protected]. If you are using any sort of white list, please make sure that your e-mail account is set up to accept e-mails from [email protected] and [email protected]. If you are using a mail service that bounces the e-mail back to the sender and asks them to confirm that it is not spam, we will not do that. These services usually allow you to add the e-mail address to a white-list before hand. Once you have checked all of the above, you can have the server re-send you your activation code by going here. It should be instant, but sometimes e-mail is slow, give it a couple hours (the slowness is usually not because of our server). If you still don't get your activation code, then and ONLY then, e-mail us at h[email protected] make sure that: 1) Your e-mail is sent from the e-mail address you submitted to ANN; 2) You include your user name; 3) Do not send us your password; 4) The subject of your e-mail must be ""activation code"".   How do I become a moderator? You're invited. When we feel there is a need for a new moderator, we look at our best forum users (the ones that contribute intelligently to conversation and act maturely) and ask them if they'd be willing to help us moderate the forum.  Will there ever be an off topic / general conversation forum among the forums? Not in the public areas, no. We do however maintain a community section for subscribers, and off-topic discussion is permitted there.  Why aren't my posts showing up? Posts from new users sometimes take a while to show up. Please be patient, they should appear within a few hours. Believe it or not, this is a ""feature"" not a ""bug.""  Is there a set of forum rules? Right here - read them if you haven't already.  Help, I've been banned or moderated! Read this.  How do I attach a picture (avatar) to my account? Read this.  Can I change my user name? You can make changes in your user account settings. But because other users depend on your username to recognize you, we have a ""no identity switcheroos"" policy: once you start using the forum we do not allow changes to your username beyond punctuation and capitalization.  Can I delete my account? Yes, you can. Go to your account settings page and you will be able to delete your account from there. Contests  Can I enter give-aways more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No.  Can I enter creative contests more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, Yes.  Does ANN ""own"" my entry? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No. But as a condition of your entry we generaly require you to give us the unrevocable right to display your entry on Anime News Network for all eternity.  Can I display my entry elsewhere? Yes, anywhere you please, unless otherwise stated in the contest rules.  Why do I have to put your logo and/or the sponsor's logo on my submission There are two reasons for this. First, it adds some extra benefit to the contest sponsors and second, it helps us insure that you made the entry for the contest, instead of just grabing some existing art and submiting it.  Explain those rules about where I live and whether or not I can enter and if you will ship me a prize. Most of our contest are open to anyone, regardless of where you live, because we don't believe in geographic discrimination. However sometimes our sponsors want a contest to only be open to their potential clients, so in those cases we have no choice to abide by their request to limit contest entry to a certain geographic area. While we don't believe in geographic discrimination, we also don't believe in spending a fortune on shipping and trying to figure out custom laws in order to get you your prize so that's why we only ship to the USA and Canada.   What does a complete mailing address look like? Short answer: ""It's what we need to put on a package to mail it to you."" It looks something like this:  416 William St. #402 Moralton, SS 70707 USA 24 Sussex Dr Ottawa, ON  K1A 0A3 Canada 1000 J.P. Laurel St. San Miguel 1005, Manila  Philippines   You'd be amazed at how many people enter our contests and leave out critical mailing information like their city, province/state and or postal/zip code. You'd also be amazed at how many people ask us ""What do you mean by complete mailing address?"" In fact, if you're reading this, it's quite possible that we referred you here because you asked that very question. Since we usually only ship to the USA and Canada, we won't disqualify you for leaving out the country, but if anything else is missing, we'll just pick another winner to replace you. We will not contact you to verify your mailing address. BTW, your name is not part of your mailing address, but we won't disqualify you for putting it in there...  Why do some contests not ship to PO Boxes? ANN usually doesn't handle shipping for our contest prizes. Shipping is done by the contest sponsor. If the contest states ""no PO boxes"" this is because our sponsor requested it. Most likely it is because they are shipping via a courier like UPS, which will not ship to PO boxes.  I'd really prefer it if you didn't post my name & city if I win This is done for legal reasons, sorry. That said, if you want to enter with an alias, that's fine as long as you are certain the package will reach you (we can't guarantee it will).  Why did you stop accepting art contest entries from Facebook By default, Facebook posts usually aren't public. Most people who submit Facebook URLs to our art contests forget to share their entries publicly, and we are often forced to disqualify these entries. It's better to just avoid the problem altogether. If you want to enter with Facebook, and you remember to make your entry public go ahead, we'll accept it. But if you forget to share it properly, we will simply ignore your entry.   Miscellaneous   Can I link to you? Yes, please feel free. Currently we don't have any banners to offer you for this, we'll be making some new ones shortly.  Can you link to me? No. We are not a link exchange site.  Wait, I can link to you, but you won't link to me?? Yes, we know it sounds a little conceited of us, but that's how it is. To be fair, we don't expect you to link to us, but we're honored if you do decide that you'd like to link to our site despite the fact that we won't be returning the favor. Please don't link to us if you're only doing it because you hope to get something in return; link to us because you feel that you want more people to know about Anime News Network.   Can we trade banners? Sorry, ANN relies on its banners to survive. We very seldom trade banners with another website or publication. If your publication is in print (10 000+ circulation) or a website with 10 million+ impressions per month, we may consider it. Please understand, ANN receives this question at least once a week, it isn't possible for us to even consider swapping / affiliating with so many sites, so we generally don't swap / affiliate with any.  Can you affiliate with us? Anime News Network would be happy to setup an affiliate program with any online store that pays referral fees provided that store meets certain pre-requisites. Anime News Network is unfortunately unable to affiliate itself with fan-sites much for the same reason that we can not link to you or trade banners with you (see above two entries).  Why'd you give this show a rating of ... in your review? Clearly it deserved a ... ! Obviously our reviewer disagrees.  When is title X coming out, how many episodes is it, and/or who is releasing it? Look it up in the encyclopedia, ask Answerman, or ask in the forum.  Why'd you make X change to the programming on [Cartoon Network, YTV, etc]? Uhh, try contacting the broadcaster, network or station. We're a news site and we have no more control over the schedule at [TV Station] than any other media source. Yes, believe it or not we get this question every so often.  I'd like to license, work on, be involved with, etc... one of your titles Just like we aren't involved in TV broadcasting, we are not licensors. Even for shows that we stream on ANN, we are not authorized to sub-license them to other companies. Contact the producers or the licensors, not us.  I'd like permission to do something with one of your titles Sorry, we do not control copyright permissions for any anime or manga. If you need permission to do something, contact the local licensee / master licensor; or failing that, contact the master licensor in Japan. A bit of advice though, for personal, non commercial projects, don't bother contacting them unless you absolutely need permission. They don't care if you make a 1-off t-shirt to wear to school, but if you ask them, they'll probably say ""No,"" as a matter of policy. Sorry we can not help you get in contact with a rights holder.  Why'd you take my video show off YouTube? We get this question a lot. We didn't take your video down. See the above answer as well as the first one. ANN has no involvement in the process of taking pirated materials off of websites like YouTube. For your information, the material was probably taken down because it was uploaded without permission (therefore illegally) and the licensors want you to watch it somewhere they will make money (on DVD, on TV, or on an authorized website). Go here for a list of places where you can legally watch anime and support the creators at the same time.  On a related note, allow us to point out that your video was probably automatically removed by a technology called video-fingerprinting. By this semi-automated process, YouTube removes videos that it believes infringe on copyrights without waiting for complaints from copyright holders. So it's quite possible that no anime company was involved in the removal of your video.   Sadly, this process can affect videos that are legitimate ""fair-use."" Even more sadly, the employees at the anime companies are too busy to bother reading all the e-mails they get about videos (the vast majority of are from morons that don't understand that ""I wasn't making money"" doesn't make it okay) so you can e-mail them to your hearts content, but they probably won't answer (not because they're fan-hating assholes, but because they don't have the time).    If you believe your video is legitimate fair-use (full episodes are never fair use, significant episode clips are rarely fair use, AMVs are almost never fair use of the music) try posting it again and include in the description why you feel it is fair use. If you're lucky, YouTube will take this into consideration (some videos are deleted automatically, others are looked at by a human employee at YouTube after the fingerprinting process identifies them) and not delete your video. You really should read up on ""fair use"" before you make any claims that your video is fair use though. And by ""read-up,"" we mean read professional, expert explanations, not your friend's blog.   I have a great idea for an anime or manga, where do I submit it? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not involved with the creation process of any anime or manga and we can not put you in contact with creators (more on that here). Finally, we'd recommend you read this and this.  How do I get your television channel? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not The Anime Network (TAN). For details on TAN, read the transcript of our chat with them, read our TAN news coverage, or visit their website.  Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? No. As a policy, ANN never gives out contact information. Don't send us this question unless you've exhausted every other resource available (phone book, 411, Google, their website, etc...), even then, we will only forward your request to them, and we will only do so provided it is a business-to-business request being made by a company we've actually heard of. If you can't find Hayao Miyazaki's e-mail address online, it's probably because he doesn't want to receive a thousand e-mails a day. The one exception to this rule is that we will give out the Public Relations / Press Relations (PR) contact information for a company provided we have it readily available. Generally you can find this information on your own though, so please don't be lazy. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? I'm an old acquaintance of theirs. The answer is still no. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? They worked on one of your projects. Just to be clear, our encyclopedia carries information about a myriad of projects (anime,manga, etc...) most of which (99.9%) Anime News Network is not, and never was, involved with. It is not a list of our projects. So if the person actually worked for ANN, please see this answer, but if they are one of the 67023+ people listed in the encyclopedia, they probably didn't work for us and therefore the previous two answers apply. Okay, I understand, you can't or won't put me in contact with them, but I really want/need to contact this person. Can you offer any suggestions on how to proceed? Depending on who you're trying to contact, they might have a fanclub, official webpage, or e-mail address listed in their encyclopedia entry. If not, try looking for the latest production they worked on and contacting the production company, they might be able and willing to forward your e-mail. Just a note, if you're contacting someone in Japan, it's highly recommended that at least your intro be in Japanese. Even if your intended recipient understands English, the person you ask to forward your e-mail might not. For your benefit, here's a quick intro you can prepend to any e-mail you send to Japan (replaces the blanks by the name of the person you are trying to contact): ご担当者様へ お世話になっております。 本社は____様にご連絡を取りたがっています。お手数ですが、このメールを____様へ転送して頂けないでしょうか? 宜しくお願いします。  Literally: To whom it may concern/the person in charge: Thank you for your time. We are trying to contact _____. If it isn't too much trouble, could you forward this e-mail to ____? Thank you very much.    Can you send me your catalog? We don't have a catalog, we don't sell anything.  Where can I buy Anime ? You can buy it at retail movie stores like Blockbuster and Suncoast as well as specialty Anime Shops. You can also buy it online at websites like Anime Castle, Anime Nation, J List, Roberts Anime Corner Store and The Right Stuf International.  Where can I download anime or watch it online? For the most part, you can't legally download anime online. Fansubs are generally illegal (whether or not they're unethical is a completely different topic), and as such, we can't help you obtain them. You might want to check the sites listed below, and read our news, when there's legal anime to download or watched online we generally mention it.  Don't ask us where to get bootlegs or fansubs, we won't tell you.  Some sites/services that allow you to download or watch anime online legally(may or may not be free):  Amazon Prime crunchyroll Funimation's Website HiDive Apple iTunes hulu Netflix Viz Anime  * Why isn't YouTube listed? Because a lot of the content on YouTube is illegally uploaded. One day we'll have an index of legal anime on YouTube, but until then we aren't listing it as a site where all content is legal/authorized.   How do I watch anime on ANN? ANN has stopped streaming anime episodes. Go to the websites above!  Can you help me with my school assignment No. We get this question about once a week, and we don't really want to spend 25 hours a year answering school questions. The worst part is that most people who e-mail us are actually asking us to provide information they could find with a little bit of research, in other words, they're asking us to do their work for them. On the other hand, if you're working on a master's project or PhD thesis related to anime, that interests us, so we'd probably be more than happy to help.  Does ANN offer Internships? Yes, Anime News Network offers internships in our newsroom and our web-development departments. Further details are available here   What happened to ANN UK? In late May the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into effect. The EU determined that any website targeting European readers would be ""doing business in Europe."" Anime News Network does not disagree with this conclusion. Unfortunately, the GDPR requires all websites doing business in Europe to meet a stringent set of privacy regulations. While ANN supports the intent of these regulations, some of them are extremely difficult to comply with. While it is our intention, for the benefit of all readers our readers around the world, to comply with these new standards, we are not able to do so immediately. Once we are fully compliant with GDPR requirements, we will re-launch ANN UK. In the meantime, ANN's global edition is available to all readers worldwide and is the default version for readers outside of North America, Australia, New Zealand and South East Asia.             bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Misc Page homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review          1 comment       Hello, Melancholic!

Does ANN offer Internships? What happened to ANN UK?    About ANN  What is Anime News Network (ANN)? Anime News Network was created as a news source that focuses on the medium of Japanese Animation(anime) and Japanese Comics (manga). ANN was founded by Justin Sevakis in July of 1998, and has since lead the online anime news medium with a tradition of strong unbiased coverage of major breaking news. With in-depth coverage, analysis and commentary to provide insight into the world of anime and manga, ANN has been and continues to be the #1 English language source for anime and manga news on the Internet. ANN's goal is to make the latest, most comprehensive Anime news available to new fans and veteran Otaku alike.  What ANN is not:  A television network or station; A subsidiary of another company; A dubbing / voice recording studio; An animation company; A licensing or distribution company; A manufacturer or distributor of merchandise; For sale.    What is anime? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of anime, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, anime is animation that is primarily produced and conceived in Japan. This includes animation conceived in Japan that has portions outsourced to other countries, but does not include animation primarily produced outside Japan and with the animation outsourced to Japan. It does however include animation that is co-conceived inside and outside of Japan and at least partially produced inside Japan.  What is manga? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of manga, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, manga are comic books or strips that are produced and conceived in Japan. This includes include comics that are co-conceived inside and outside of Japan but produced in Japan.  Who operates ANN? ANN is operated by a team of people, under the guidance of Christopher Macdonald, Daniel DeLorme, Zac Bertschy, Egan Loo and Hori Shinsuke. A full list of the staff can be found on the staff page.   Who owns ANN? The website is owned by Anime News Network Inc., a privately owned corporation. The corporation's shareholders include: Christopher Macdonald (Minority owner, controlling shareholder), Hori Shinsuke (Minority owner), Anime Consortium Japan (Minority owner), others.   Where is ANN based? Wow, that question is so 1999! ANN is based everywhere and nowhere. We're based on the Internet! We don't have an office; our staff all work at home and are based around the world with the most full-time staff based in Japan and the United States. Anime News Network, Inc. the corporation that maintains ANN is a Canadian corporation.  Who is the mascot? When the site was first launched in 1998 it featured a blond-haired mascot named Jadress, created by Robin Sevakis. She was eventually replaced by Nina, who was featured in a webcomic (also created by Robin Sevakis) that ran from 2007 to 2013.  How often do you update? The site is run on a daily content format, as opposed to a monthly or bi-monthly magazine format. We update the news and reviews daily, and other content, such as features, columns, and editorials are also added throughout the week. Our encyclopedia is updated daily as well.  Under what settings is ANN best viewed? The site uses a responsive design that should look good at any resolution, from smartphones to large desktop screens.  How do I find older articles on ANN? Links to archives for news, features, columns, reviews, etc. can be found in their respective sections in the menu. You can also use the search engine.  What was used to make the site, as well as maintain it? The site is a combination of older parts in PHP and newer parts in Ruby, with a MySQL database to manage the content. Apart from the phpBB forum, we haven't used any pre-made packages; all the content is managed and presented with custom software.  How do I get permission to reprint an ANN Story, or obtain an ANN graphic or photo? ANN has a newsfeed program where you can get the latest anime news headlines on your very own website. If you wish to entirely reprint anything on your site please contact the editors. For more details about what you can and can not re-print with or without our permission, see our copyright statement.  How many people hear or read an ANN story? We get a bit over 200,000 visits every day. In addition to regular visitors, ANN's news is often sourced in print and occasionally on the airwaves.  How can I get in touch with the staff? Visit our contact page or visit our staff page for further contact and personal information. If a member's e-mail address is not there you can send your comments to the editors and we'll forward them.  Do you attend any public events? Yes. ANN tries to provide coverage to as many anime conventions/festivals/symposiums as our staff can manage. For more details on this see our events section and our events forum.  Do you have a newsfeed? You really should have an RSS newsfeed! Look at our newsfeed section for links to various RSS & Atom feeds as well as our custom newsfeed program. Submitting Content  How should I submit news ? Send an e-mail to [email protected] , this e-mail address is regularly monitored by several staff (someone is always ""on duty""). Other methods (e-mail directly to staff, PM, Forum, Twitter, etc...) are less reliable, and may lead to delays and/or a complete failure to notice your submission.  I have something to say about an online petition. Stop. Virtually every e-petition is a waste of time.   I submitted a news item, why wasn't it posted? We could still be in the process of verifying the details, we may not have been able to verify the items, or perhaps we didn't find it newsworthy enough to post. On a ""slow"" news day we're more likely to post less significant items.  I submitted a news item, why was it credited to someone else? They either submitted it first--or more importantly--submitted more information.  Can I submit news about a non-Japanese animation? No. We're Anime News Network, not ""Animation News Network"", not ""Asian Animation Network."" There's plenty of good animation from around the world, including Korea and China, but we only cover Japanese animation, not French, Mexican, Chinese, African, Korean or Afghanistanimation.  Can I submit a review? / How do I become a reviewer? Anime News Network does not accept unsolicited reviews. Take a quick look at the Staff Openings page, if there is an opening, it will be mentioned there. More often than not, we hire experienced writers who are known to us. Best piece of advice we can give is to make a name for yourself then we'll come to you when the time is right.  Can I submit an article? If you are an experienced writer/journalist with a portfolio you can point to, please E-mail the editors and ask about the topic, we'd be glad to consider your article idea.  Can I have a column? No. Only previous, regular contributors who have shown an ability to consistently write timely, quality articles (or reviews) are permitted to write columns. Try submitting some articles or reviews first.  Information X is missing from the Encyclopedia, can you add it? We can't add it, but YOU can. The Encyclopedia is a user-contributed database; it's made specially so that you can add missing information by yourself. You just need a user account. So please do take the time to register and submit the information you found was missing. Each page contains pointers about how to add information, and if that's not enough you can check the Encyclopedia FAQ or the memoranda.  How can I contribute to the encyclopedia? Any registered user can contribute standard data to the Encyclopedia for Anime, Manga and People. But if that's not enough for you and you're near the top of the contributors list and you'd like to help out with the releases, lexicon, or editing and verifying data submitted by other people, please contact the Encyclopedist.  Please note, that we'll be looking for someone who is inputting quality data, not just large amounts of data.   What if I want to contribute in some other way? We always appreciate whatever help and support that readers can give. If you'd like to help out at ANN in a way other than the ones described above, please contact the editors. There's so much to do at ANN that we're very appreciative of any help offered.   My company is making Anime, can you post a news article about it? Sorry, too many companies are trying to cash in on the popularity of Anime by making cartoons with big eyes and purple hair. We're sure you aren't like that, but... well actually, we aren't sure.  Why doesn't Anime News Network review world manga? Please see our definition of manga. It is Anime News Network's official position, and the personal belief of many of our staff, than there is nothing inheritently superior about Japanese manga when compared to world manga. However Anime News Network's purpose is to cover Japanese animation and comic books. Currently we do not have the resources to review all the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America. If and when we are able to review 100% of the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America, we will then consider expanding our area of review coverage to include manga-style comics (world manga) that originate outside of Japan.  Why didn't you post a news article about my (company's) new Anime or Manga? If your item is picked up in a distribution deal by a company that isn't being run out of someone's garage, then maybe its newsworthy. So when that happens, give us a shout, and we'll consider it, but if you can't tell us what makes your creation manga or anime (other than big eyes, purple hair and the like) you can pretty much forget it.  May I send you my company's product to review? If it's anime or manga-related, then yes. Contact editors[at]animenewsnetwork.com for shipping information.  I'm starting a new webmanga, is it news? No, there are a billion and one ""webmangas"", and most only last a couple of months. Now, if your webmanga gets licensed by a publisher... that might be news.  Can you mention my site? Only if you do something newsworthy, sorry.  Why have we been blacklisted? ANN has a 2-strikes rule regarding inappropriate PR. After 2 strikes for the following reasons we will blacklist your company or PR firm (when we blacklist a PR firm, we notify their relevant clients). i) Completely irrelevant PR that has nothing to do with anime, manga, Japanese pop-culture or any other related content; ii) Unauthorized stealth marketing on our forums; iii) Harassing our staff; iv) Continued PR submissions to inappropriate e-mail address. v) Any attempt to illicitly influence editorial We'll send you a link to this post after your first offense. After your second offense you'll never hear from us again (and our readers will never hear from you or your clients).  Isn't this a bit harsh? Perhaps, but we're tired of getting PRs for toilets, accounting firm management changes and World War 2 museums.   But we offer an opt-out! Clicking that link might opt us out of all your press releases, including your relevant ones. It would be the same as blacklisting you, without giving you the warning. Showing you this warning is actually less harsh than clicking your opt-out.  Forum / Account  I didn't receive my forum registration. If you are using a spam filter, please check your spam folder, some mail servers catch the registration code as spam. Search your spamfolder & inbox for e-mail from [email protected] or [email protected]. If you are using any sort of white list, please make sure that your e-mail account is set up to accept e-mails from [email protected] and [email protected]. If you are using a mail service that bounces the e-mail back to the sender and asks them to confirm that it is not spam, we will not do that. These services usually allow you to add the e-mail address to a white-list before hand. Once you have checked all of the above, you can have the server re-send you your activation code by going here. It should be instant, but sometimes e-mail is slow, give it a couple hours (the slowness is usually not because of our server). If you still don't get your activation code, then and ONLY then, e-mail us at h[email protected] make sure that: 1) Your e-mail is sent from the e-mail address you submitted to ANN; 2) You include your user name; 3) Do not send us your password; 4) The subject of your e-mail must be ""activation code"".   How do I become a moderator? You're invited. When we feel there is a need for a new moderator, we look at our best forum users (the ones that contribute intelligently to conversation and act maturely) and ask them if they'd be willing to help us moderate the forum.  Will there ever be an off topic / general conversation forum among the forums? Not in the public areas, no. We do however maintain a community section for subscribers, and off-topic discussion is permitted there.  Why aren't my posts showing up? Posts from new users sometimes take a while to show up. Please be patient, they should appear within a few hours. Believe it or not, this is a ""feature"" not a ""bug.""  Is there a set of forum rules? Right here - read them if you haven't already.  Help, I've been banned or moderated! Read this.  How do I attach a picture (avatar) to my account? Read this.  Can I change my user name? You can make changes in your user account settings. But because other users depend on your username to recognize you, we have a ""no identity switcheroos"" policy: once you start using the forum we do not allow changes to your username beyond punctuation and capitalization.  Can I delete my account? Yes, you can. Go to your account settings page and you will be able to delete your account from there. Contests  Can I enter give-aways more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No.  Can I enter creative contests more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, Yes.  Does ANN ""own"" my entry? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No. But as a condition of your entry we generaly require you to give us the unrevocable right to display your entry on Anime News Network for all eternity.  Can I display my entry elsewhere? Yes, anywhere you please, unless otherwise stated in the contest rules.  Why do I have to put your logo and/or the sponsor's logo on my submission There are two reasons for this. First, it adds some extra benefit to the contest sponsors and second, it helps us insure that you made the entry for the contest, instead of just grabing some existing art and submiting it.  Explain those rules about where I live and whether or not I can enter and if you will ship me a prize. Most of our contest are open to anyone, regardless of where you live, because we don't believe in geographic discrimination. However sometimes our sponsors want a contest to only be open to their potential clients, so in those cases we have no choice to abide by their request to limit contest entry to a certain geographic area. While we don't believe in geographic discrimination, we also don't believe in spending a fortune on shipping and trying to figure out custom laws in order to get you your prize so that's why we only ship to the USA and Canada.   What does a complete mailing address look like? Short answer: ""It's what we need to put on a package to mail it to you."" It looks something like this:  416 William St. #402 Moralton, SS 70707 USA 24 Sussex Dr Ottawa, ON  K1A 0A3 Canada 1000 J.P. Laurel St. San Miguel 1005, Manila  Philippines   You'd be amazed at how many people enter our contests and leave out critical mailing information like their city, province/state and or postal/zip code. You'd also be amazed at how many people ask us ""What do you mean by complete mailing address?"" In fact, if you're reading this, it's quite possible that we referred you here because you asked that very question. Since we usually only ship to the USA and Canada, we won't disqualify you for leaving out the country, but if anything else is missing, we'll just pick another winner to replace you. We will not contact you to verify your mailing address. BTW, your name is not part of your mailing address, but we won't disqualify you for putting it in there...  Why do some contests not ship to PO Boxes? ANN usually doesn't handle shipping for our contest prizes. Shipping is done by the contest sponsor. If the contest states ""no PO boxes"" this is because our sponsor requested it. Most likely it is because they are shipping via a courier like UPS, which will not ship to PO boxes.  I'd really prefer it if you didn't post my name & city if I win This is done for legal reasons, sorry. That said, if you want to enter with an alias, that's fine as long as you are certain the package will reach you (we can't guarantee it will).  Why did you stop accepting art contest entries from Facebook By default, Facebook posts usually aren't public. Most people who submit Facebook URLs to our art contests forget to share their entries publicly, and we are often forced to disqualify these entries. It's better to just avoid the problem altogether. If you want to enter with Facebook, and you remember to make your entry public go ahead, we'll accept it. But if you forget to share it properly, we will simply ignore your entry.   Miscellaneous   Can I link to you? Yes, please feel free. Currently we don't have any banners to offer you for this, we'll be making some new ones shortly.  Can you link to me? No. We are not a link exchange site.  Wait, I can link to you, but you won't link to me?? Yes, we know it sounds a little conceited of us, but that's how it is. To be fair, we don't expect you to link to us, but we're honored if you do decide that you'd like to link to our site despite the fact that we won't be returning the favor. Please don't link to us if you're only doing it because you hope to get something in return; link to us because you feel that you want more people to know about Anime News Network.   Can we trade banners? Sorry, ANN relies on its banners to survive. We very seldom trade banners with another website or publication. If your publication is in print (10 000+ circulation) or a website with 10 million+ impressions per month, we may consider it. Please understand, ANN receives this question at least once a week, it isn't possible for us to even consider swapping / affiliating with so many sites, so we generally don't swap / affiliate with any.  Can you affiliate with us? Anime News Network would be happy to setup an affiliate program with any online store that pays referral fees provided that store meets certain pre-requisites. Anime News Network is unfortunately unable to affiliate itself with fan-sites much for the same reason that we can not link to you or trade banners with you (see above two entries).  Why'd you give this show a rating of ... in your review? Clearly it deserved a ... ! Obviously our reviewer disagrees.  When is title X coming out, how many episodes is it, and/or who is releasing it? Look it up in the encyclopedia, ask Answerman, or ask in the forum.  Why'd you make X change to the programming on [Cartoon Network, YTV, etc]? Uhh, try contacting the broadcaster, network or station. We're a news site and we have no more control over the schedule at [TV Station] than any other media source. Yes, believe it or not we get this question every so often.  I'd like to license, work on, be involved with, etc... one of your titles Just like we aren't involved in TV broadcasting, we are not licensors. Even for shows that we stream on ANN, we are not authorized to sub-license them to other companies. Contact the producers or the licensors, not us.  I'd like permission to do something with one of your titles Sorry, we do not control copyright permissions for any anime or manga. If you need permission to do something, contact the local licensee / master licensor; or failing that, contact the master licensor in Japan. A bit of advice though, for personal, non commercial projects, don't bother contacting them unless you absolutely need permission. They don't care if you make a 1-off t-shirt to wear to school, but if you ask them, they'll probably say ""No,"" as a matter of policy. Sorry we can not help you get in contact with a rights holder.  Why'd you take my video show off YouTube? We get this question a lot. We didn't take your video down. See the above answer as well as the first one. ANN has no involvement in the process of taking pirated materials off of websites like YouTube. For your information, the material was probably taken down because it was uploaded without permission (therefore illegally) and the licensors want you to watch it somewhere they will make money (on DVD, on TV, or on an authorized website). Go here for a list of places where you can legally watch anime and support the creators at the same time.  On a related note, allow us to point out that your video was probably automatically removed by a technology called video-fingerprinting. By this semi-automated process, YouTube removes videos that it believes infringe on copyrights without waiting for complaints from copyright holders. So it's quite possible that no anime company was involved in the removal of your video.   Sadly, this process can affect videos that are legitimate ""fair-use."" Even more sadly, the employees at the anime companies are too busy to bother reading all the e-mails they get about videos (the vast majority of are from morons that don't understand that ""I wasn't making money"" doesn't make it okay) so you can e-mail them to your hearts content, but they probably won't answer (not because they're fan-hating assholes, but because they don't have the time).    If you believe your video is legitimate fair-use (full episodes are never fair use, significant episode clips are rarely fair use, AMVs are almost never fair use of the music) try posting it again and include in the description why you feel it is fair use. If you're lucky, YouTube will take this into consideration (some videos are deleted automatically, others are looked at by a human employee at YouTube after the fingerprinting process identifies them) and not delete your video. You really should read up on ""fair use"" before you make any claims that your video is fair use though. And by ""read-up,"" we mean read professional, expert explanations, not your friend's blog.   I have a great idea for an anime or manga, where do I submit it? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not involved with the creation process of any anime or manga and we can not put you in contact with creators (more on that here). Finally, we'd recommend you read this and this.  How do I get your television channel? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not The Anime Network (TAN). For details on TAN, read the transcript of our chat with them, read our TAN news coverage, or visit their website.  Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? No. As a policy, ANN never gives out contact information. Don't send us this question unless you've exhausted every other resource available (phone book, 411, Google, their website, etc...), even then, we will only forward your request to them, and we will only do so provided it is a business-to-business request being made by a company we've actually heard of. If you can't find Hayao Miyazaki's e-mail address online, it's probably because he doesn't want to receive a thousand e-mails a day. The one exception to this rule is that we will give out the Public Relations / Press Relations (PR) contact information for a company provided we have it readily available. Generally you can find this information on your own though, so please don't be lazy. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? I'm an old acquaintance of theirs. The answer is still no. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? They worked on one of your projects. Just to be clear, our encyclopedia carries information about a myriad of projects (anime,manga, etc...) most of which (99.9%) Anime News Network is not, and never was, involved with. It is not a list of our projects. So if the person actually worked for ANN, please see this answer, but if they are one of the 67023+ people listed in the encyclopedia, they probably didn't work for us and therefore the previous two answers apply. Okay, I understand, you can't or won't put me in contact with them, but I really want/need to contact this person. Can you offer any suggestions on how to proceed? Depending on who you're trying to contact, they might have a fanclub, official webpage, or e-mail address listed in their encyclopedia entry. If not, try looking for the latest production they worked on and contacting the production company, they might be able and willing to forward your e-mail. Just a note, if you're contacting someone in Japan, it's highly recommended that at least your intro be in Japanese. Even if your intended recipient understands English, the person you ask to forward your e-mail might not. For your benefit, here's a quick intro you can prepend to any e-mail you send to Japan (replaces the blanks by the name of the person you are trying to contact): ご担当者様へ お世話になっております。 本社は____様にご連絡を取りたがっています。お手数ですが、このメールを____様へ転送して頂けないでしょうか? 宜しくお願いします。  Literally: To whom it may concern/the person in charge: Thank you for your time. We are trying to contact _____. If it isn't too much trouble, could you forward this e-mail to ____? Thank you very much.    Can you send me your catalog? We don't have a catalog, we don't sell anything.  Where can I buy Anime ? You can buy it at retail movie stores like Blockbuster and Suncoast as well as specialty Anime Shops. You can also buy it online at websites like Anime Castle, Anime Nation, J List, Roberts Anime Corner Store and The Right Stuf International.  Where can I download anime or watch it online? For the most part, you can't legally download anime online. Fansubs are generally illegal (whether or not they're unethical is a completely different topic), and as such, we can't help you obtain them. You might want to check the sites listed below, and read our news, when there's legal anime to download or watched online we generally mention it.  Don't ask us where to get bootlegs or fansubs, we won't tell you.  Some sites/services that allow you to download or watch anime online legally(may or may not be free):  Amazon Prime crunchyroll Funimation's Website HiDive Apple iTunes hulu Netflix Viz Anime  * Why isn't YouTube listed? Because a lot of the content on YouTube is illegally uploaded. One day we'll have an index of legal anime on YouTube, but until then we aren't listing it as a site where all content is legal/authorized.   How do I watch anime on ANN? ANN has stopped streaming anime episodes. Go to the websites above!  Can you help me with my school assignment No. We get this question about once a week, and we don't really want to spend 25 hours a year answering school questions. The worst part is that most people who e-mail us are actually asking us to provide information they could find with a little bit of research, in other words, they're asking us to do their work for them. On the other hand, if you're working on a master's project or PhD thesis related to anime, that interests us, so we'd probably be more than happy to help.  Does ANN offer Internships? Yes, Anime News Network offers internships in our newsroom and our web-development departments. Further details are available here   What happened to ANN UK? In late May the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into effect. The EU determined that any website targeting European readers would be ""doing business in Europe."" Anime News Network does not disagree with this conclusion. Unfortunately, the GDPR requires all websites doing business in Europe to meet a stringent set of privacy regulations. While ANN supports the intent of these regulations, some of them are extremely difficult to comply with. While it is our intention, for the benefit of all readers our readers around the world, to comply with these new standards, we are not able to do so immediately. Once we are fully compliant with GDPR requirements, we will re-launch ANN UK. In the meantime, ANN's global edition is available to all readers worldwide and is the default version for readers outside of North America, Australia, New Zealand and South East Asia.             bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Misc Page homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4, 'http://www.theanimenetwork.com/': 1, 'http://www.animecastle.com': 1, 'http://www.animenation.com': 1, 'https://www.jlist.com': 1, 'https://store.yahoo.com/cgi-bin/clink?animecorner+DwdEaM+index.html': 1, 'http://www.rightstuf.com': 1, 'https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=sr_nr_p_n_theme_browse-bin_1?fst=as%3Aoff&rh=n%3A2676882011%2Ck%3Aanime': 1, 'http://www.crunchyroll.com': 1, 'http://www.funimation.com/f_index.cfm?page=videos': 1, 'http://hidive.com': 1, 'https://www.apple.com/itunes/overview/': 1, 'http://www.hulu.com': 1, 'https://netflix.com': 1, 'http://www.vizanime.com': 1}"

Does ANN offer Internships? What happened to ANN UK?    About ANN  What is Anime News Network (ANN)? Anime News Network was created as a news source that focuses on the medium of Japanese Animation(anime) and Japanese Comics (manga). ANN was founded by Justin Sevakis in July of 1998, and has since lead the online anime news medium with a tradition of strong unbiased coverage of major breaking news. With in-depth coverage, analysis and commentary to provide insight into the world of anime and manga, ANN has been and continues to be the #1 English language source for anime and manga news on the Internet. ANN's goal is to make the latest, most comprehensive Anime news available to new fans and veteran Otaku alike.  What ANN is not:  A television network or station; A subsidiary of another company; A dubbing / voice recording studio; An animation company; A licensing or distribution company; A manufacturer or distributor of merchandise; For sale.

For all purposes related to Anime News Network, anime is animation that is primarily produced and conceived in Japan.

ANN is operated by a team of people, under the guidance of Christopher Macdonald, Daniel DeLorme, Zac Bertschy, Egan Loo and Hori Shinsuke. A full list of the staff can be found on the staff page.   Who owns ANN? The website is owned by Anime News Network Inc., a privately owned corporation. The corporation's shareholders include: Christopher Macdonald (Minority owner, controlling shareholder), Hori Shinsuke (Minority owner), Anime Consortium Japan (Minority owner), others.   Where is ANN based? Wow, that question is so 1999! ANN is based everywhere and nowhere. We're based on the Internet! We don't have an office; our staff all work at home and are based around the world with the most full-time staff based in Japan and the United States. Anime News Network, Inc. the corporation that maintains ANN is a Canadian corporation.  Who is the mascot? When the site was first launched in 1998 it featured a blond-haired mascot named Jadress, created by Robin Sevakis. She was eventually replaced by Nina, who was featured in a webcomic (also created by Robin Sevakis) that ran from 2007 to 2013.  How often do you update? The site is run on a daily content format, as opposed to a monthly or bi-monthly magazine format. We update the news and reviews daily, and other content, such as features, columns, and editorials are also added throughout the week. Our encyclopedia is updated daily as well.  Under what settings is ANN best viewed? The site uses a responsive design that should look good at any resolution, from smartphones to large desktop screens.  How do I find older articles on ANN? Links to archives for news, features, columns, reviews, etc. can be found in their respective sections in the menu. You can also use the search engine.  What was used to make the site, as well as maintain it? The site is a combination of older parts in PHP and newer parts in Ruby, with a MySQL database to manage the content. Apart from the phpBB forum, we haven't used any pre-made packages; all the content is managed and presented with custom software.  How do I get permission to reprint an ANN Story, or obtain an ANN graphic or photo? ANN has a newsfeed program where you can get the latest anime news headlines on your very own website. If you wish to entirely reprint anything on your site please contact the editors. For more details about what you can and can not re-print with or without our permission, see our copyright statement.  How many people hear or read an ANN story? We get a bit over 200,000 visits every day. In addition to regular visitors, ANN's news is often sourced in print and occasionally on the airwaves.  How can I get in touch with the staff? Visit our contact page or visit our staff page for further contact and personal information. If a member's e-mail address is not there you can send your comments to the editors and we'll forward them.  Do you attend any public events? Yes. ANN tries to provide coverage to as many anime conventions/festivals/symposiums as our staff can manage. For more details on this see our events section and our events forum.  Do you have a newsfeed? You really should have an RSS newsfeed! Look at our newsfeed section for links to various RSS & Atom feeds as well as our custom newsfeed program. Submitting Content  How should I submit news ? Send an e-mail to [email protected] , this e-mail address is regularly monitored by several staff (someone is always ""on duty""). Other methods (e-mail directly to staff, PM, Forum, Twitter, etc...) are less reliable, and may lead to delays and/or a complete failure to notice your submission.  I have something to say about an online petition. Stop. Virtually every e-petition is a waste of time.   I submitted a news item, why wasn't it posted? We could still be in the process of verifying the details, we may not have been able to verify the items, or perhaps we didn't find it newsworthy enough to post. On a ""slow"" news day we're more likely to post less significant items.  I submitted a news item, why was it credited to someone else? They either submitted it first--or more importantly--submitted more information.  Can I submit news about a non-Japanese animation? No. We're Anime News Network, not ""Animation News Network"", not ""Asian Animation Network."" There's plenty of good animation from around the world, including Korea and China, but we only cover Japanese animation, not French, Mexican, Chinese, African, Korean or Afghanistanimation.  Can I submit a review? / How do I become a reviewer? Anime News Network does not accept unsolicited reviews. Take a quick look at the Staff Openings page, if there is an opening, it will be mentioned there. More often than not, we hire experienced writers who are known to us. Best piece of advice we can give is to make a name for yourself then we'll come to you when the time is right.  Can I submit an article? If you are an experienced writer/journalist with a portfolio you can point to, please E-mail the editors and ask about the topic, we'd be glad to consider your article idea.  Can I have a column? No. Only previous, regular contributors who have shown an ability to consistently write timely, quality articles (or reviews) are permitted to write columns. Try submitting some articles or reviews first.  Information X is missing from the Encyclopedia, can you add it? We can't add it, but YOU can. The Encyclopedia is a user-contributed database; it's made specially so that you can add missing information by yourself. You just need a user account. So please do take the time to register and submit the information you found was missing. Each page contains pointers about how to add information, and if that's not enough you can check the Encyclopedia FAQ or the memoranda.  How can I contribute to the encyclopedia? Any registered user can contribute standard data to the Encyclopedia for Anime, Manga and People. But if that's not enough for you and you're near the top of the contributors list and you'd like to help out with the releases, lexicon, or editing and verifying data submitted by other people, please contact the Encyclopedist.  Please note, that we'll be looking for someone who is inputting quality data, not just large amounts of data.   What if I want to contribute in some other way? We always appreciate whatever help and support that readers can give. If you'd like to help out at ANN in a way other than the ones described above, please contact the editors. There's so much to do at ANN that we're very appreciative of any help offered.   My company is making Anime, can you post a news article about it? Sorry, too many companies are trying to cash in on the popularity of Anime by making cartoons with big eyes and purple hair. We're sure you aren't like that, but... well actually, we aren't sure.  Why doesn't Anime News Network review world manga? Please see our definition of manga. It is Anime News Network's official position, and the personal belief of many of our staff, than there is nothing inheritently superior about Japanese manga when compared to world manga. However Anime News Network's purpose is to cover Japanese animation and comic books. Currently we do not have the resources to review all the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America. If and when we are able to review 100% of the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America, we will then consider expanding our area of review coverage to include manga-style comics (world manga) that originate outside of Japan.  Why didn't you post a news article about my (company's) new Anime or Manga? If your item is picked up in a distribution deal by a company that isn't being run out of someone's garage, then maybe its newsworthy. So when that happens, give us a shout, and we'll consider it, but if you can't tell us what makes your creation manga or anime (other than big eyes, purple hair and the like) you can pretty much forget it.  May I send you my company's product to review? If it's anime or manga-related, then yes. Contact editors[at]animenewsnetwork.com for shipping information.  I'm starting a new webmanga, is it news? No, there are a billion and one ""webmangas"", and most only last a couple of months. Now, if your webmanga gets licensed by a publisher... that might be news.  Can you mention my site? Only if you do something newsworthy, sorry.  Why have we been blacklisted? ANN has a 2-strikes rule regarding inappropriate PR. After 2 strikes for the following reasons we will blacklist your company or PR firm (when we blacklist a PR firm, we notify their relevant clients). i) Completely irrelevant PR that has nothing to do with anime, manga, Japanese pop-culture or any other related content; ii) Unauthorized stealth marketing on our forums; iii) Harassing our staff; iv) Continued PR submissions to inappropriate e-mail address. v) Any attempt to illicitly influence editorial We'll send you a link to this post after your first offense. After your second offense you'll never hear from us again (and our readers will never hear from you or your clients).  Isn't this a bit harsh? Perhaps, but we're tired of getting PRs for toilets, accounting firm management changes and World War 2 museums.   But we offer an opt-out! Clicking that link might opt us out of all your press releases, including your relevant ones. It would be the same as blacklisting you, without giving you the warning. Showing you this warning is actually less harsh than clicking your opt-out.  Forum / Account  I didn't receive my forum registration. If you are using a spam filter, please check your spam folder, some mail servers catch the registration code as spam. Search your spamfolder & inbox for e-mail from [email protected] or [email protected]. If you are using any sort of white list, please make sure that your e-mail account is set up to accept e-mails from [email protected] and [email protected]. If you are using a mail service that bounces the e-mail back to the sender and asks them to confirm that it is not spam, we will not do that. These services usually allow you to add the e-mail address to a white-list before hand. Once you have checked all of the above, you can have the server re-send you your activation code by going here. It should be instant, but sometimes e-mail is slow, give it a couple hours (the slowness is usually not because of our server). If you still don't get your activation code, then and ONLY then, e-mail us at h[email protected] make sure that: 1) Your e-mail is sent from the e-mail address you submitted to ANN; 2) You include your user name; 3) Do not send us your password; 4) The subject of your e-mail must be ""activation code"".   How do I become a moderator? You're invited. When we feel there is a need for a new moderator, we look at our best forum users (the ones that contribute intelligently to conversation and act maturely) and ask them if they'd be willing to help us moderate the forum.  Will there ever be an off topic / general conversation forum among the forums? Not in the public areas, no. We do however maintain a community section for subscribers, and off-topic discussion is permitted there.  Why aren't my posts showing up? Posts from new users sometimes take a while to show up. Please be patient, they should appear within a few hours. Believe it or not, this is a ""feature"" not a ""bug.""  Is there a set of forum rules? Right here - read them if you haven't already.  Help, I've been banned or moderated! Read this.  How do I attach a picture (avatar) to my account? Read this.  Can I change my user name? You can make changes in your user account settings. But because other users depend on your username to recognize you, we have a ""no identity switcheroos"" policy: once you start using the forum we do not allow changes to your username beyond punctuation and capitalization.  Can I delete my account? Yes, you can. Go to your account settings page and you will be able to delete your account from there. Contests  Can I enter give-aways more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No.  Can I enter creative contests more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, Yes.  Does ANN ""own"" my entry? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No. But as a condition of your entry we generaly require you to give us the unrevocable right to display your entry on Anime News Network for all eternity.  Can I display my entry elsewhere? Yes, anywhere you please, unless otherwise stated in the contest rules.  Why do I have to put your logo and/or the sponsor's logo on my submission There are two reasons for this. First, it adds some extra benefit to the contest sponsors and second, it helps us insure that you made the entry for the contest, instead of just grabing some existing art and submiting it.  Explain those rules about where I live and whether or not I can enter and if you will ship me a prize. Most of our contest are open to anyone, regardless of where you live, because we don't believe in geographic discrimination. However sometimes our sponsors want a contest to only be open to their potential clients, so in those cases we have no choice to abide by their request to limit contest entry to a certain geographic area. While we don't believe in geographic discrimination, we also don't believe in spending a fortune on shipping and trying to figure out custom laws in order to get you your prize so that's why we only ship to the USA and Canada.   What does a complete mailing address look like? Short answer: ""It's what we need to put on a package to mail it to you."" It looks something like this:  416 William St. #402 Moralton, SS 70707 USA 24 Sussex Dr Ottawa, ON  K1A 0A3 Canada 1000 J.P. Laurel St. San Miguel 1005, Manila  Philippines   You'd be amazed at how many people enter our contests and leave out critical mailing information like their city, province/state and or postal/zip code. You'd also be amazed at how many people ask us ""What do you mean by complete mailing address?"" In fact, if you're reading this, it's quite possible that we referred you here because you asked that very question. Since we usually only ship to the USA and Canada, we won't disqualify you for leaving out the country, but if anything else is missing, we'll just pick another winner to replace you. We will not contact you to verify your mailing address. BTW, your name is not part of your mailing address, but we won't disqualify you for putting it in there...  Why do some contests not ship to PO Boxes? ANN usually doesn't handle shipping for our contest prizes. Shipping is done by the contest sponsor. If the contest states ""no PO boxes"" this is because our sponsor requested it. Most likely it is because they are shipping via a courier like UPS, which will not ship to PO boxes.  I'd really prefer it if you didn't post my name & city if I win This is done for legal reasons, sorry. That said, if you want to enter with an alias, that's fine as long as you are certain the package will reach you (we can't guarantee it will).  Why did you stop accepting art contest entries from Facebook By default, Facebook posts usually aren't public. Most people who submit Facebook URLs to our art contests forget to share their entries publicly, and we are often forced to disqualify these entries. It's better to just avoid the problem altogether. If you want to enter with Facebook, and you remember to make your entry public go ahead, we'll accept it. But if you forget to share it properly, we will simply ignore your entry.   Miscellaneous   Can I link to you? Yes, please feel free. Currently we don't have any banners to offer you for this, we'll be making some new ones shortly.  Can you link to me? No. We are not a link exchange site.  Wait, I can link to you, but you won't link to me?? Yes, we know it sounds a little conceited of us, but that's how it is. To be fair, we don't expect you to link to us, but we're honored if you do decide that you'd like to link to our site despite the fact that we won't be returning the favor. Please don't link to us if you're only doing it because you hope to get something in return; link to us because you feel that you want more people to know about Anime News Network.   Can we trade banners? Sorry, ANN relies on its banners to survive. We very seldom trade banners with another website or publication. If your publication is in print (10 000+ circulation) or a website with 10 million+ impressions per month, we may consider it. Please understand, ANN receives this question at least once a week, it isn't possible for us to even consider swapping / affiliating with so many sites, so we generally don't swap / affiliate with any.  Can you affiliate with us? Anime News Network would be happy to setup an affiliate program with any online store that pays referral fees provided that store meets certain pre-requisites. Anime News Network is unfortunately unable to affiliate itself with fan-sites much for the same reason that we can not link to you or trade banners with you (see above two entries).  Why'd you give this show a rating of ... in your review? Clearly it deserved a ... ! Obviously our reviewer disagrees.  When is title X coming out, how many episodes is it, and/or who is releasing it? Look it up in the encyclopedia, ask Answerman, or ask in the forum.  Why'd you make X change to the programming on [Cartoon Network, YTV, etc]? Uhh, try contacting the broadcaster, network or station. We're a news site and we have no more control over the schedule at [TV Station] than any other media source. Yes, believe it or not we get this question every so often.  I'd like to license, work on, be involved with, etc... one of your titles Just like we aren't involved in TV broadcasting, we are not licensors. Even for shows that we stream on ANN, we are not authorized to sub-license them to other companies. Contact the producers or the licensors, not us.  I'd like permission to do something with one of your titles Sorry, we do not control copyright permissions for any anime or manga. If you need permission to do something, contact the local licensee / master licensor; or failing that, contact the master licensor in Japan. A bit of advice though, for personal, non commercial projects, don't bother contacting them unless you absolutely need permission. They don't care if you make a 1-off t-shirt to wear to school, but if you ask them, they'll probably say ""No,"" as a matter of policy. Sorry we can not help you get in contact with a rights holder.  Why'd you take my video show off YouTube? We get this question a lot. We didn't take your video down. See the above answer as well as the first one. ANN has no involvement in the process of taking pirated materials off of websites like YouTube. For your information, the material was probably taken down because it was uploaded without permission (therefore illegally) and the licensors want you to watch it somewhere they will make money (on DVD, on TV, or on an authorized website). Go here for a list of places where you can legally watch anime and support the creators at the same time.  On a related note, allow us to point out that your video was probably automatically removed by a technology called video-fingerprinting. By this semi-automated process, YouTube removes videos that it believes infringe on copyrights without waiting for complaints from copyright holders. So it's quite possible that no anime company was involved in the removal of your video.   Sadly, this process can affect videos that are legitimate ""fair-use."" Even more sadly, the employees at the anime companies are too busy to bother reading all the e-mails they get about videos (the vast majority of are from morons that don't understand that ""I wasn't making money"" doesn't make it okay) so you can e-mail them to your hearts content, but they probably won't answer (not because they're fan-hating assholes, but because they don't have the time).    If you believe your video is legitimate fair-use (full episodes are never fair use, significant episode clips are rarely fair use, AMVs are almost never fair use of the music) try posting it again and include in the description why you feel it is fair use. If you're lucky, YouTube will take this into consideration (some videos are deleted automatically, others are looked at by a human employee at YouTube after the fingerprinting process identifies them) and not delete your video. You really should read up on ""fair use"" before you make any claims that your video is fair use though. And by ""read-up,"" we mean read professional, expert explanations, not your friend's blog.   I have a great idea for an anime or manga, where do I submit it? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not involved with the creation process of any anime or manga and we can not put you in contact with creators (more on that here). Finally, we'd recommend you read this and this.  How do I get your television channel? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not The Anime Network (TAN). For details on TAN, read the transcript of our chat with them, read our TAN news coverage, or visit their website.  Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? No. As a policy, ANN never gives out contact information. Don't send us this question unless you've exhausted every other resource available (phone book, 411, Google, their website, etc...), even then, we will only forward your request to them, and we will only do so provided it is a business-to-business request being made by a company we've actually heard of. If you can't find Hayao Miyazaki's e-mail address online, it's probably because he doesn't want to receive a thousand e-mails a day. The one exception to this rule is that we will give out the Public Relations / Press Relations (PR) contact information for a company provided we have it readily available. Generally you can find this information on your own though, so please don't be lazy. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? I'm an old acquaintance of theirs. The answer is still no. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? They worked on one of your projects. Just to be clear, our encyclopedia carries information about a myriad of projects (anime,manga, etc...) most of which (99.9%) Anime News Network is not, and never was, involved with. It is not a list of our projects. So if the person actually worked for ANN, please see this answer, but if they are one of the 67023+ people listed in the encyclopedia, they probably didn't work for us and therefore the previous two answers apply. Okay, I understand, you can't or won't put me in contact with them, but I really want/need to contact this person. Can you offer any suggestions on how to proceed? Depending on who you're trying to contact, they might have a fanclub, official webpage, or e-mail address listed in their encyclopedia entry. If not, try looking for the latest production they worked on and contacting the production company, they might be able and willing to forward your e-mail. Just a note, if you're contacting someone in Japan, it's highly recommended that at least your intro be in Japanese. Even if your intended recipient understands English, the person you ask to forward your e-mail might not. For your benefit, here's a quick intro you can prepend to any e-mail you send to Japan (replaces the blanks by the name of the person you are trying to contact): ご担当者様へ お世話になっております。 本社は____様にご連絡を取りたがっています。お手数ですが、このメールを____様へ転送して頂けないでしょうか? 宜しくお願いします。  Literally: To whom it may concern/the person in charge: Thank you for your time. We are trying to contact _____. If it isn't too much trouble, could you forward this e-mail to ____? Thank you very much.    Can you send me your catalog? We don't have a catalog, we don't sell anything.  Where can I buy Anime ? You can buy it at retail movie stores like Blockbuster and Suncoast as well as specialty Anime Shops. You can also buy it online at websites like Anime Castle, Anime Nation, J List, Roberts Anime Corner Store and The Right Stuf International.  Where can I download anime or watch it online? For the most part, you can't legally download anime online. Fansubs are generally illegal (whether or not they're unethical is a completely different topic), and as such, we can't help you obtain them. You might want to check the sites listed below, and read our news, when there's legal anime to download or watched online we generally mention it.  Don't ask us where to get bootlegs or fansubs, we won't tell you.  Some sites/services that allow you to download or watch anime online legally(may or may not be free):  Amazon Prime crunchyroll Funimation's Website HiDive Apple iTunes hulu Netflix Viz Anime  * Why isn't YouTube listed? Because a lot of the content on YouTube is illegally uploaded. One day we'll have an index of legal anime on YouTube, but until then we aren't listing it as a site where all content is legal/authorized.   How do I watch anime on ANN? ANN has stopped streaming anime episodes. Go to the websites above!  Can you help me with my school assignment No. We get this question about once a week, and we don't really want to spend 25 hours a year answering school questions. The worst part is that most people who e-mail us are actually asking us to provide information they could find with a little bit of research, in other words, they're asking us to do their work for them. On the other hand, if you're working on a master's project or PhD thesis related to anime, that interests us, so we'd probably be more than happy to help.  Does ANN offer Internships? Yes, Anime News Network offers internships in our newsroom and our web-development departments. Further details are available here   What happened to ANN UK? In late May the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into effect. The EU determined that any website targeting European readers would be ""doing business in Europe."" Anime News Network does not disagree with this conclusion. Unfortunately, the GDPR requires all websites doing business in Europe to meet a stringent set of privacy regulations. While ANN supports the intent of these regulations, some of them are extremely difficult to comply with. While it is our intention, for the benefit of all readers our readers around the world, to comply with these new standards, we are not able to do so immediately. Once we are fully compliant with GDPR requirements, we will re-launch ANN UK. In the meantime, ANN's global edition is available to all readers worldwide and is the default version for readers outside of North America, Australia, New Zealand and South East Asia.             bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Misc Page homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More     ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4, 'http://www.theanimenetwork.com/': 1, 'http://www.animecastle.com': 1, 'http://www.animenation.com': 1, 'https://www.jlist.com': 1, 'https://store.yahoo.com/cgi-bin/clink?animecorner+DwdEaM+index.html': 1, 'http://www.rightstuf.com': 1, 'https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=sr_nr_p_n_theme_browse-bin_1?fst=as%3Aoff&rh=n%3A2676882011%2Ck%3Aanime': 1, 'http://www.crunchyroll.com': 1, 'http://www.funimation.com/f_index.cfm?page=videos': 1, 'http://hidive.com': 1, 'https://www.apple.com/itunes/overview/': 1, 'http://www.hulu.com': 1, 'https://netflix.com': 1, 'http://www.vizanime.com': 1}"

With in-depth coverage, analysis and commentary to provide insight into the world of anime and manga, ANN has been and continues to be the #1 English language source for anime and manga news on the Internet.

Who owns ANN? The website is owned by Anime News Network Inc., a privately owned corporation. The corporation's shareholders include: Christopher Macdonald (Minority owner, controlling shareholder), Hori Shinsuke (Minority owner), Anime Consortium Japan (Minority owner), others.   Where is ANN based? Wow, that question is so 1999! ANN is based everywhere and nowhere. We're based on the Internet! We don't have an office; our staff all work at home and are based around the world with the most full-time staff based in Japan and the United States. Anime News Network, Inc. the corporation that maintains ANN is a Canadian corporation.  Who is the mascot? When the site was first launched in 1998 it featured a blond-haired mascot named Jadress, created by Robin Sevakis. She was eventually replaced by Nina, who was featured in a webcomic (also created by Robin Sevakis) that ran from 2007 to 2013.  How often do you update? The site is run on a daily content format, as opposed to a monthly or bi-monthly magazine format. We update the news and reviews daily, and other content, such as features, columns, and editorials are also added throughout the week. Our encyclopedia is updated daily as well.  Under what settings is ANN best viewed? The site uses a responsive design that should look good at any resolution, from smartphones to large desktop screens.  How do I find older articles on ANN?

Apart from the phpBB forum, we haven't used any pre-made packages; all the content is managed and presented with custom software.  How do I get permission to reprint an ANN Story, or obtain an ANN graphic or photo? ANN has a newsfeed program where you can get the latest anime news headlines on your very own website. If you wish to entirely reprint anything on your site please contact the editors. For more details about what you can and can not re-print with or without our permission, see our copyright statement.  How many people hear or read an ANN story?

ANN tries to provide coverage to as many anime conventions/festivals/symposiums as our staff can manage. For more details on this see our events section and our events forum.  Do you have a newsfeed? You really should have an RSS newsfeed! Look at our newsfeed section for links to various RSS & Atom feeds as well as our custom newsfeed program. Submitting Content  How should I submit news ? Send an e-mail to [email protected] , this e-mail address is regularly monitored by several staff (someone is always ""on duty""). Other methods (e-mail directly to staff, PM, Forum, Twitter, etc...) are less reliable, and may lead to delays and/or a complete failure to notice your submission.  I have something to say about an online petition. Stop. Virtually every e-petition is a waste of time.   I submitted a news item, why wasn't it posted? We could still be in the process of verifying the details, we may not have been able to verify the items, or perhaps we didn't find it newsworthy enough to post. On a ""slow"" news day we're more likely to post less significant items.  I submitted a news item, why was it credited to someone else? They either submitted it first--or more importantly--submitted more information.  Can I submit news about a non-Japanese animation? No. We're Anime News Network, not ""Animation News Network"", not ""Asian Animation Network."" There's plenty of good animation from around the world, including Korea and China, but we only cover Japanese animation, not French, Mexican, Chinese, African, Korean or Afghanistanimation.  Can I submit a review? / How do I become a reviewer? Anime News Network does not accept unsolicited reviews. Take a quick look at the Staff Openings page, if there is an opening, it will be mentioned there. More often than not, we hire experienced writers who are known to us. Best piece of advice we can give is to make a name for yourself then we'll come to you when the time is right.  Can I submit an article? If you are an experienced writer/journalist with a portfolio you can point to, please E-mail the editors and ask about the topic, we'd be glad to consider your article idea.  Can I have a column? No. Only previous, regular contributors who have shown an ability to consistently write timely, quality articles (or reviews) are permitted to write columns. Try submitting some articles or reviews first.  Information X is missing from the Encyclopedia, can you add it? We can't add it, but YOU can. The Encyclopedia is a user-contributed database; it's made specially so that you can add missing information by yourself. You just need a user account. So please do take the time to register and submit the information you found was missing. Each page contains pointers about how to add information, and if that's not enough you can check the Encyclopedia FAQ or the memoranda.  How can I contribute to the encyclopedia? Any registered user can contribute standard data to the Encyclopedia for Anime, Manga and People. But if that's not enough for you and you're near the top of the contributors list and you'd like to help out with the releases, lexicon, or editing and verifying data submitted by other people, please contact the Encyclopedist.  Please note, that we'll be looking for someone who is inputting quality data, not just large amounts of data.   What if I want to contribute in some other way? We always appreciate whatever help and support that readers can give. If you'd like to help out at ANN in a way other than the ones described above, please contact the editors. There's so much to do at ANN that we're very appreciative of any help offered.   My company is making Anime, can you post a news article about it? Sorry, too many companies are trying to cash in on the popularity of Anime by making cartoons with big eyes and purple hair. We're sure you aren't like that, but... well actually, we aren't sure.  Why doesn't Anime News Network review world manga? Please see our definition of manga. It is Anime News Network's official position, and the personal belief of many of our staff, than there is nothing inheritently superior about Japanese manga when compared to world manga. However Anime News Network's purpose is to cover Japanese animation and comic books. Currently we do not have the resources to review all the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America. If and when we are able to review 100% of the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America, we will then consider expanding our area of review coverage to include manga-style comics (world manga) that originate outside of Japan.  Why didn't you post a news article about my (company's) new Anime or Manga? If your item is picked up in a distribution deal by a company that isn't being run out of someone's garage, then maybe its newsworthy. So when that happens, give us a shout, and we'll consider it, but if you can't tell us what makes your creation manga or anime (other than big eyes, purple hair and the like) you can pretty much forget it.  May I send you my company's product to review? If it's anime or manga-related, then yes. Contact editors[at]animenewsnetwork.com for shipping information.  I'm starting a new webmanga, is it news? No, there are a billion and one ""webmangas"", and most only last a couple of months. Now, if your webmanga gets licensed by a publisher... that might be news.  Can you mention my site? Only if you do something newsworthy, sorry.  Why have we been blacklisted? ANN has a 2-strikes rule regarding inappropriate PR. After 2 strikes for the following reasons we will blacklist your company or PR firm (when we blacklist a PR firm, we notify their relevant clients). i) Completely irrelevant PR that has nothing to do with anime, manga, Japanese pop-culture or any other related content; ii) Unauthorized stealth marketing on our forums; iii) Harassing our staff; iv) Continued PR submissions to inappropriate e-mail address. v) Any attempt to illicitly influence editorial We'll send you a link to this post after your first offense. After your second offense you'll never hear from us again (and our readers will never hear from you or your clients).  Isn't this a bit harsh? Perhaps, but we're tired of getting PRs for toilets, accounting firm management changes and World War 2 museums.   But we offer an opt-out! Clicking that link might opt us out of all your press releases, including your relevant ones. It would be the same as blacklisting you, without giving you the warning. Showing you this warning is actually less harsh than clicking your opt-out.  Forum / Account  I didn't receive my forum registration. If you are using a spam filter, please check your spam folder, some mail servers catch the registration code as spam. Search your spamfolder & inbox for e-mail from [email protected] or [email protected]. If you are using any sort of white list, please make sure that your e-mail account is set up to accept e-mails from [email protected] and [email protected]. If you are using a mail service that bounces the e-mail back to the sender and asks them to confirm that it is not spam, we will not do that. These services usually allow you to add the e-mail address to a white-list before hand. Once you have checked all of the above, you can have the server re-send you your activation code by going here. It should be instant, but sometimes e-mail is slow, give it a couple hours (the slowness is usually not because of our server). If you still don't get your activation code, then and ONLY then, e-mail us at h[email protected] make sure that: 1) Your e-mail is sent from the e-mail address you submitted to ANN; 2) You include your user name; 3) Do not send us your password; 4) The subject of your e-mail must be ""activation code"".   How do I become a moderator? You're invited. When we feel there is a need for a new moderator, we look at our best forum users (the ones that contribute intelligently to conversation and act maturely) and ask them if they'd be willing to help us moderate the forum.  Will there ever be an off topic / general conversation forum among the forums? Not in the public areas, no. We do however maintain a community section for subscribers, and off-topic discussion is permitted there.  Why aren't my posts showing up? Posts from new users sometimes take a while to show up. Please be patient, they should appear within a few hours. Believe it or not, this is a ""feature"" not a ""bug.""  Is there a set of forum rules? Right here - read them if you haven't already.  Help, I've been banned or moderated! Read this.  How do I attach a picture (avatar) to my account? Read this.  Can I change my user name? You can make changes in your user account settings. But because other users depend on your username to recognize you, we have a ""no identity switcheroos"" policy: once you start using the forum we do not allow changes to your username beyond punctuation and capitalization.  Can I delete my account? Yes, you can. Go to your account settings page and you will be able to delete your account from there. Contests  Can I enter give-aways more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No.  Can I enter creative contests more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, Yes.  Does ANN ""own"" my entry? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No. But as a condition of your entry we generaly require you to give us the unrevocable right to display your entry on Anime News Network for all eternity.  Can I display my entry elsewhere? Yes, anywhere you please, unless otherwise stated in the contest rules.  Why do I have to put your logo and/or the sponsor's logo on my submission There are two reasons for this. First, it adds some extra benefit to the contest sponsors and second, it helps us insure that you made the entry for the contest, instead of just grabing some existing art and submiting it.  Explain those rules about where I live and whether or not I can enter and if you will ship me a prize. Most of our contest are open to anyone, regardless of where you live, because we don't believe in geographic discrimination. However sometimes our sponsors want a contest to only be open to their potential clients, so in those cases we have no choice to abide by their request to limit contest entry to a certain geographic area. While we don't believe in geographic discrimination, we also don't believe in spending a fortune on shipping and trying to figure out custom laws in order to get you your prize so that's why we only ship to the USA and Canada.   What does a complete mailing address look like? Short answer: ""It's what we need to put on a package to mail it to you."" It looks something like this:  416 William St. #402 Moralton, SS 70707 USA 24 Sussex Dr Ottawa, ON  K1A 0A3 Canada 1000 J.P. Laurel St. San Miguel 1005, Manila  Philippines   You'd be amazed at how many people enter our contests and leave out critical mailing information like their city, province/state and or postal/zip code. You'd also be amazed at how many people ask us ""What do you mean by complete mailing address?"" In fact, if you're reading this, it's quite possible that we referred you here because you asked that very question. Since we usually only ship to the USA and Canada, we won't disqualify you for leaving out the country, but if anything else is missing, we'll just pick another winner to replace you. We will not contact you to verify your mailing address. BTW, your name is not part of your mailing address, but we won't disqualify you for putting it in there...  Why do some contests not ship to PO Boxes? ANN usually doesn't handle shipping for our contest prizes. Shipping is done by the contest sponsor. If the contest states ""no PO boxes"" this is because our sponsor requested it. Most likely it is because they are shipping via a courier like UPS, which will not ship to PO boxes.  I'd really prefer it if you didn't post my name & city if I win This is done for legal reasons, sorry. That said, if you want to enter with an alias, that's fine as long as you are certain the package will reach you (we can't guarantee it will).  Why did you stop accepting art contest entries from Facebook By default, Facebook posts usually aren't public. Most people who submit Facebook URLs to our art contests forget to share their entries publicly, and we are often forced to disqualify these entries. It's better to just avoid the problem altogether. If you want to enter with Facebook, and you remember to make your entry public go ahead, we'll accept it. But if you forget to share it properly, we will simply ignore your entry.   Miscellaneous   Can I link to you? Yes, please feel free. Currently we don't have any banners to offer you for this, we'll be making some new ones shortly.  Can you link to me? No. We are not a link exchange site.  Wait, I can link to you, but you won't link to me?? Yes, we know it sounds a little conceited of us, but that's how it is. To be fair, we don't expect you to link to us, but we're honored if you do decide that you'd like to link to our site despite the fact that we won't be returning the favor. Please don't link to us if you're only doing it because you hope to get something in return; link to us because you feel that you want more people to know about Anime News Network.   Can we trade banners? Sorry, ANN relies on its banners to survive. We very seldom trade banners with another website or publication. If your publication is in print (10 000+ circulation) or a website with 10 million+ impressions per month, we may consider it. Please understand, ANN receives this question at least once a week, it isn't possible for us to even consider swapping / affiliating with so many sites, so we generally don't swap / affiliate with any.  Can you affiliate with us? Anime News Network would be happy to setup an affiliate program with any online store that pays referral fees provided that store meets certain pre-requisites. Anime News Network is unfortunately unable to affiliate itself with fan-sites much for the same reason that we can not link to you or trade banners with you (see above two entries).  Why'd you give this show a rating of ... in your review? Clearly it deserved a ... ! Obviously our reviewer disagrees.  When is title X coming out, how many episodes is it, and/or who is releasing it? Look it up in the encyclopedia, ask Answerman, or ask in the forum.  Why'd you make X change to the programming on [Cartoon Network, YTV, etc]? Uhh, try contacting the broadcaster, network or station. We're a news site and we have no more control over the schedule at [TV Station] than any other media source. Yes, believe it or not we get this question every so often.  I'd like to license, work on, be involved with, etc... one of your titles Just like we aren't involved in TV broadcasting, we are not licensors. Even for shows that we stream on ANN, we are not authorized to sub-license them to other companies. Contact the producers or the licensors, not us.  I'd like permission to do something with one of your titles Sorry, we do not control copyright permissions for any anime or manga. If you need permission to do something, contact the local licensee / master licensor; or failing that, contact the master licensor in Japan. A bit of advice though, for personal, non commercial projects, don't bother contacting them unless you absolutely need permission. They don't care if you make a 1-off t-shirt to wear to school, but if you ask them, they'll probably say ""No,"" as a matter of policy. Sorry we can not help you get in contact with a rights holder.  Why'd you take my video show off YouTube? We get this question a lot. We didn't take your video down. See the above answer as well as the first one. ANN has no involvement in the process of taking pirated materials off of websites like YouTube. For your information, the material was probably taken down because it was uploaded without permission (therefore illegally) and the licensors want you to watch it somewhere they will make money (on DVD, on TV, or on an authorized website). Go here for a list of places where you can legally watch anime and support the creators at the same time.  On a related note, allow us to point out that your video was probably automatically removed by a technology called video-fingerprinting. By this semi-automated process, YouTube removes videos that it believes infringe on copyrights without waiting for complaints from copyright holders. So it's quite possible that no anime company was involved in the removal of your video.   Sadly, this process can affect videos that are legitimate ""fair-use."" Even more sadly, the employees at the anime companies are too busy to bother reading all the e-mails they get about videos (the vast majority of are from morons that don't understand that ""I wasn't making money"" doesn't make it okay) so you can e-mail them to your hearts content, but they probably won't answer (not because they're fan-hating assholes, but because they don't have the time).    If you believe your video is legitimate fair-use (full episodes are never fair use, significant episode clips are rarely fair use, AMVs are almost never fair use of the music) try posting it again and include in the description why you feel it is fair use. If you're lucky, YouTube will take this into consideration (some videos are deleted automatically, others are looked at by a human employee at YouTube after the fingerprinting process identifies them) and not delete your video. You really should read up on ""fair use"" before you make any claims that your video is fair use though. And by ""read-up,"" we mean read professional, expert explanations, not your friend's blog.   I have a great idea for an anime or manga, where do I submit it? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not involved with the creation process of any anime or manga and we can not put you in contact with creators (more on that here). Finally, we'd recommend you read this and this.  How do I get your television channel? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not The Anime Network (TAN). For details on TAN, read the transcript of our chat with them, read our TAN news coverage, or visit their website.  Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? No. As a policy, ANN never gives out contact information. Don't send us this question unless you've exhausted every other resource available (phone book, 411, Google, their website, etc...), even then, we will only forward your request to them, and we will only do so provided it is a business-to-business request being made by a company we've actually heard of. If you can't find Hayao Miyazaki's e-mail address online, it's probably because he doesn't want to receive a thousand e-mails a day. The one exception to this rule is that we will give out the Public Relations / Press Relations (PR) contact information for a company provided we have it readily available. Generally you can find this information on your own though, so please don't be lazy. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? I'm an old acquaintance of theirs. The answer is still no. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? They worked on one of your projects. Just to be clear, our encyclopedia carries information about a myriad of projects (anime,manga, etc...) most of which (99.9%) Anime News Network is not, and never was, involved with. It is not a list of our projects. So if the person actually worked for ANN, please see this answer, but if they are one of the 67023+ people listed in the encyclopedia, they probably didn't work for us and therefore the previous two answers apply. Okay, I understand, you can't or won't put me in contact with them, but I really want/need to contact this person. Can you offer any suggestions on how to proceed? Depending on who you're trying to contact, they might have a fanclub, official webpage, or e-mail address listed in their encyclopedia entry. If not, try looking for the latest production they worked on and contacting the production company, they might be able and willing to forward your e-mail. Just a note, if you're contacting someone in Japan, it's highly recommended that at least your intro be in Japanese. Even if your intended recipient understands English, the person you ask to forward your e-mail might not. For your benefit, here's a quick intro you can prepend to any e-mail you send to Japan (replaces the blanks by the name of the person you are trying to contact): ご担当者様へ お世話になっております。 本社は____様にご連絡を取りたがっています。お手数ですが、このメールを____様へ転送して頂けないでしょうか? 宜しくお願いします。  Literally: To whom it may concern/the person in charge: Thank you for your time. We are trying to contact _____. If it isn't too much trouble, could you forward this e-mail to ____? Thank you very much.    Can you send me your catalog? We don't have a catalog, we don't sell anything.  Where can I buy Anime ? You can buy it at retail movie stores like Blockbuster and Suncoast as well as specialty Anime Shops. You can also buy it online at websites like Anime Castle, Anime Nation, J List, Roberts Anime Corner Store and The Right Stuf International.  Where can I download anime or watch it online? For the most part, you can't legally download anime online. Fansubs are generally illegal (whether or not they're unethical is a completely different topic), and as such, we can't help you obtain them. You might want to check the sites listed below, and read our news, when there's legal anime to download or watched online we generally mention it.  Don't ask us where to get bootlegs or fansubs, we won't tell you.  Some sites/services that allow you to download or watch anime online legally(may or may not be free):  Amazon Prime crunchyroll Funimation's Website HiDive Apple iTunes hulu Netflix Viz Anime  * Why isn't YouTube listed? Because a lot of the content on YouTube is illegally uploaded. One day we'll have an index of legal anime on YouTube, but until then we aren't listing it as a site where all content is legal/authorized.   How do I watch anime on ANN? ANN has stopped streaming anime episodes. Go to the websites above!  Can you help me with my school assignment No. We get this question about once a week, and we don't really want to spend 25 hours a year answering school questions. The worst part is that most people who e-mail us are actually asking us to provide information they could find with a little bit of research, in other words, they're asking us to do their work for them. On the other hand, if you're working on a master's project or PhD thesis related to anime, that interests us, so we'd probably be more than happy to help.  Does ANN offer Internships? Yes, Anime News Network offers internships in our newsroom and our web-development departments. Further details are available here   What happened to ANN UK? In late May the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into effect. The EU determined that any website targeting European readers would be ""doing business in Europe."" Anime News Network does not disagree with this conclusion. Unfortunately, the GDPR requires all websites doing business in Europe to meet a stringent set of privacy regulations. While ANN supports the intent of these regulations, some of them are extremely difficult to comply with. While it is our intention, for the benefit of all readers our readers around the world, to comply with these new standards, we are not able to do so immediately. Once we are fully compliant with GDPR requirements, we will re-launch ANN UK. In the meantime, ANN's global edition is available to all readers worldwide and is the default version for readers outside of North America, Australia, New Zealand and South East Asia.             bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Misc Page homepage / archives      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4, 'http://www.theanimenetwork.com/': 1, 'http://www.animecastle.com': 1, 'http://www.animenation.com': 1, 'https://www.jlist.com': 1, 'https://store.yahoo.com/cgi-bin/clink?animecorner+DwdEaM+index.html': 1, 'http://www.rightstuf.com': 1, 'https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=sr_nr_p_n_theme_browse-bin_1?fst=as%3Aoff&rh=n%3A2676882011%2Ck%3Aanime': 1, 'http://www.crunchyroll.com': 1, 'http://www.funimation.com/f_index.cfm?page=videos': 1, 'http://hidive.com': 1, 'https://www.apple.com/itunes/overview/': 1, 'http://www.hulu.com': 1, 'https://netflix.com': 1, 'http://www.vizanime.com': 1}"

Does ANN offer Internships? What happened to ANN UK?    About ANN  What is Anime News Network (ANN)? Anime News Network was created as a news source that focuses on the medium of Japanese Animation(anime) and Japanese Comics (manga). ANN was founded by Justin Sevakis in July of 1998, and has since lead the online anime news medium with a tradition of strong unbiased coverage of major breaking news. With in-depth coverage, analysis and commentary to provide insight into the world of anime and manga, ANN has been and continues to be the #1 English language source for anime and manga news on the Internet. ANN's goal is to make the latest, most comprehensive Anime news available to new fans and veteran Otaku alike.

For all purposes related to Anime News Network, anime is animation that is primarily produced and conceived in Japan.

It does however include animation that is co-conceived inside and outside of Japan and at least partially produced inside Japan.  What is manga?

Who owns ANN? The website is owned by Anime News Network Inc., a privately owned corporation. The corporation's shareholders include: Christopher Macdonald (Minority owner, controlling shareholder), Hori Shinsuke (Minority owner), Anime Consortium Japan (Minority owner), others.   Where is ANN based? Wow, that question is so 1999! ANN is based everywhere and nowhere. We're based on the Internet! We don't have an office; our staff all work at home and are based around the world with the most full-time staff based in Japan and the United States. Anime News Network, Inc. the corporation that maintains ANN is a Canadian corporation.  Who is the mascot? When the site was first launched in 1998 it featured a blond-haired mascot named Jadress, created by Robin Sevakis. She was eventually replaced by Nina, who was featured in a webcomic (also created by Robin Sevakis) that ran from 2007 to 2013.  How often do you update? The site is run on a daily content format, as opposed to a monthly or bi-monthly magazine format. We update the news and reviews daily, and other content, such as features, columns, and editorials are also added throughout the week. Our encyclopedia is updated daily as well.  Under what settings is ANN best viewed? The site uses a responsive design that should look good at any resolution, from smartphones to large desktop screens.  How do I find older articles on ANN? Links to archives for news, features, columns, reviews, etc. can be found in their respective sections in the menu. You can also use the search engine.

Apart from the phpBB forum, we haven't used any pre-made packages; all the content is managed and presented with custom software.  How do I get permission to reprint an ANN Story, or obtain an ANN graphic or photo? ANN has a newsfeed program where you can get the latest anime news headlines on your very own website. If you wish to entirely reprint anything on your site please contact the editors. For more details about what you can and can not re-print with or without our permission, see our copyright statement.  How many people hear or read an ANN story? We get a bit over 200,000 visits every day. In addition to regular visitors, ANN's news is often sourced in print and occasionally on the airwaves.  How can I get in touch with the staff? Visit our contact page or visit our staff page for further contact and personal information. If a member's e-mail address is not there you can send your comments to the editors and we'll forward them.  Do you attend any public events? Yes. ANN tries to provide coverage to as many anime conventions/festivals/symposiums as our staff can manage. For more details on this see our events section and our events forum.  Do you have a newsfeed? You really should have an RSS newsfeed! Look at our newsfeed section for links to various RSS & Atom feeds as well as our custom newsfeed program. Submitting Content  How should I submit news ? Send an e-mail to [email protected] , this e-mail address is regularly monitored by several staff (someone is always ""on duty""). Other methods (e-mail directly to staff, PM, Forum, Twitter, etc...) are less reliable, and may lead to delays and/or a complete failure to notice your submission.  I have something to say about an online petition. Stop. Virtually every e-petition is a waste of time.   I submitted a news item, why wasn't it posted? We could still be in the process of verifying the details, we may not have been able to verify the items, or perhaps we didn't find it newsworthy enough to post. On a ""slow"" news day we're more likely to post less significant items.  I submitted a news item, why was it credited to someone else? They either submitted it first--or more importantly--submitted more information.  Can I submit news about a non-Japanese animation? No. We're Anime News Network, not ""Animation News Network"", not ""Asian Animation Network."" There's plenty of good animation from around the world, including Korea and China, but we only cover Japanese animation, not French, Mexican, Chinese, African, Korean or Afghanistanimation.  Can I submit a review? / How do I become a reviewer? Anime News Network does not accept unsolicited reviews. Take a quick look at the Staff Openings page, if there is an opening, it will be mentioned there. More often than not, we hire experienced writers who are known to us. Best piece of advice we can give is to make a name for yourself then we'll come to you when the time is right.  Can I submit an article? If you are an experienced writer/journalist with a portfolio you can point to, please E-mail the editors and ask about the topic, we'd be glad to consider your article idea.  Can I have a column? No. Only previous, regular contributors who have shown an ability to consistently write timely, quality articles (or reviews) are permitted to write columns. Try submitting some articles or reviews first.  Information X is missing from the Encyclopedia, can you add it? We can't add it, but YOU can. The Encyclopedia is a user-contributed database; it's made specially so that you can add missing information by yourself. You just need a user account. So please do take the time to register and submit the information you found was missing. Each page contains pointers about how to add information, and if that's not enough you can check the Encyclopedia FAQ or the memoranda.  How can I contribute to the encyclopedia? Any registered user can contribute standard data to the Encyclopedia for Anime, Manga and People. But if that's not enough for you and you're near the top of the contributors list and you'd like to help out with the releases, lexicon, or editing and verifying data submitted by other people, please contact the Encyclopedist.  Please note, that we'll be looking for someone who is inputting quality data, not just large amounts of data.   What if I want to contribute in some other way? We always appreciate whatever help and support that readers can give. If you'd like to help out at ANN in a way other than the ones described above, please contact the editors. There's so much to do at ANN that we're very appreciative of any help offered.   My company is making Anime, can you post a news article about it? Sorry, too many companies are trying to cash in on the popularity of Anime by making cartoons with big eyes and purple hair. We're sure you aren't like that, but... well actually, we aren't sure.  Why doesn't Anime News Network review world manga? Please see our definition of manga. It is Anime News Network's official position, and the personal belief of many of our staff, than there is nothing inheritently superior about Japanese manga when compared to world manga. However Anime News Network's purpose is to cover Japanese animation and comic books. Currently we do not have the resources to review all the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America. If and when we are able to review 100% of the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America, we will then consider expanding our area of review coverage to include manga-style comics (world manga) that originate outside of Japan.  Why didn't you post a news article about my (company's) new Anime or Manga? If your item is picked up in a distribution deal by a company that isn't being run out of someone's garage, then maybe its newsworthy. So when that happens, give us a shout, and we'll consider it, but if you can't tell us what makes your creation manga or anime (other than big eyes, purple hair and the like) you can pretty much forget it.  May I send you my company's product to review? If it's anime or manga-related, then yes. Contact editors[at]animenewsnetwork.com for shipping information.  I'm starting a new webmanga, is it news? No, there are a billion and one ""webmangas"", and most only last a couple of months. Now, if your webmanga gets licensed by a publisher... that might be news.  Can you mention my site? Only if you do something newsworthy, sorry.  Why have we been blacklisted? ANN has a 2-strikes rule regarding inappropriate PR. After 2 strikes for the following reasons we will blacklist your company or PR firm (when we blacklist a PR firm, we notify their relevant clients). i) Completely irrelevant PR that has nothing to do with anime, manga, Japanese pop-culture or any other related content; ii) Unauthorized stealth marketing on our forums; iii) Harassing our staff; iv) Continued PR submissions to inappropriate e-mail address. v) Any attempt to illicitly influence editorial We'll send you a link to this post after your first offense. After your second offense you'll never hear from us again (and our readers will never hear from you or your clients).  Isn't this a bit harsh? Perhaps, but we're tired of getting PRs for toilets, accounting firm management changes and World War 2 museums.   But we offer an opt-out! Clicking that link might opt us out of all your press releases, including your relevant ones. It would be the same as blacklisting you, without giving you the warning. Showing you this warning is actually less harsh than clicking your opt-out.  Forum / Account  I didn't receive my forum registration. If you are using a spam filter, please check your spam folder, some mail servers catch the registration code as spam. Search your spamfolder & inbox for e-mail from [email protected] or [email protected]. If you are using any sort of white list, please make sure that your e-mail account is set up to accept e-mails from [email protected] and [email protected]. If you are using a mail service that bounces the e-mail back to the sender and asks them to confirm that it is not spam, we will not do that. These services usually allow you to add the e-mail address to a white-list before hand. Once you have checked all of the above, you can have the server re-send you your activation code by going here. It should be instant, but sometimes e-mail is slow, give it a couple hours (the slowness is usually not because of our server). If you still don't get your activation code, then and ONLY then, e-mail us at h[email protected] make sure that: 1) Your e-mail is sent from the e-mail address you submitted to ANN; 2) You include your user name; 3) Do not send us your password; 4) The subject of your e-mail must be ""activation code"".   How do I become a moderator? You're invited. When we feel there is a need for a new moderator, we look at our best forum users (the ones that contribute intelligently to conversation and act maturely) and ask them if they'd be willing to help us moderate the forum.  Will there ever be an off topic / general conversation forum among the forums? Not in the public areas, no. We do however maintain a community section for subscribers, and off-topic discussion is permitted there.  Why aren't my posts showing up? Posts from new users sometimes take a while to show up. Please be patient, they should appear within a few hours. Believe it or not, this is a ""feature"" not a ""bug.""  Is there a set of forum rules? Right here - read them if you haven't already.  Help, I've been banned or moderated! Read this.  How do I attach a picture (avatar) to my account? Read this.  Can I change my user name? You can make changes in your user account settings. But because other users depend on your username to recognize you, we have a ""no identity switcheroos"" policy: once you start using the forum we do not allow changes to your username beyond punctuation and capitalization.  Can I delete my account? Yes, you can. Go to your account settings page and you will be able to delete your account from there. Contests  Can I enter give-aways more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No.  Can I enter creative contests more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, Yes.  Does ANN ""own"" my entry? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No. But as a condition of your entry we generaly require you to give us the unrevocable right to display your entry on Anime News Network for all eternity.  Can I display my entry elsewhere? Yes, anywhere you please, unless otherwise stated in the contest rules.  Why do I have to put your logo and/or the sponsor's logo on my submission There are two reasons for this. First, it adds some extra benefit to the contest sponsors and second, it helps us insure that you made the entry for the contest, instead of just grabing some existing art and submiting it.  Explain those rules about where I live and whether or not I can enter and if you will ship me a prize. Most of our contest are open to anyone, regardless of where you live, because we don't believe in geographic discrimination. However sometimes our sponsors want a contest to only be open to their potential clients, so in those cases we have no choice to abide by their request to limit contest entry to a certain geographic area. While we don't believe in geographic discrimination, we also don't believe in spending a fortune on shipping and trying to figure out custom laws in order to get you your prize so that's why we only ship to the USA and Canada.   What does a complete mailing address look like? Short answer: ""It's what we need to put on a package to mail it to you."" It looks something like this:  416 William St. #402 Moralton, SS 70707 USA 24 Sussex Dr Ottawa, ON  K1A 0A3 Canada 1000 J.P. Laurel St. San Miguel 1005, Manila  Philippines   You'd be amazed at how many people enter our contests and leave out critical mailing information like their city, province/state and or postal/zip code. You'd also be amazed at how many people ask us ""What do you mean by complete mailing address?"" In fact, if you're reading this, it's quite possible that we referred you here because you asked that very question. Since we usually only ship to the USA and Canada, we won't disqualify you for leaving out the country, but if anything else is missing, we'll just pick another winner to replace you. We will not contact you to verify your mailing address. BTW, your name is not part of your mailing address, but we won't disqualify you for putting it in there...  Why do some contests not ship to PO Boxes? ANN usually doesn't handle shipping for our contest prizes. Shipping is done by the contest sponsor. If the contest states ""no PO boxes"" this is because our sponsor requested it. Most likely it is because they are shipping via a courier like UPS, which will not ship to PO boxes.  I'd really prefer it if you didn't post my name & city if I win This is done for legal reasons, sorry. That said, if you want to enter with an alias, that's fine as long as you are certain the package will reach you (we can't guarantee it will).  Why did you stop accepting art contest entries from Facebook By default, Facebook posts usually aren't public. Most people who submit Facebook URLs to our art contests forget to share their entries publicly, and we are often forced to disqualify these entries. It's better to just avoid the problem altogether. If you want to enter with Facebook, and you remember to make your entry public go ahead, we'll accept it. But if you forget to share it properly, we will simply ignore your entry.   Miscellaneous   Can I link to you? Yes, please feel free. Currently we don't have any banners to offer you for this, we'll be making some new ones shortly.  Can you link to me? No. We are not a link exchange site.  Wait, I can link to you, but you won't link to me?? Yes, we know it sounds a little conceited of us, but that's how it is. To be fair, we don't expect you to link to us, but we're honored if you do decide that you'd like to link to our site despite the fact that we won't be returning the favor. Please don't link to us if you're only doing it because you hope to get something in return; link to us because you feel that you want more people to know about Anime News Network.   Can we trade banners? Sorry, ANN relies on its banners to survive. We very seldom trade banners with another website or publication. If your publication is in print (10 000+ circulation) or a website with 10 million+ impressions per month, we may consider it. Please understand, ANN receives this question at least once a week, it isn't possible for us to even consider swapping / affiliating with so many sites, so we generally don't swap / affiliate with any.  Can you affiliate with us? Anime News Network would be happy to setup an affiliate program with any online store that pays referral fees provided that store meets certain pre-requisites. Anime News Network is unfortunately unable to affiliate itself with fan-sites much for the same reason that we can not link to you or trade banners with you (see above two entries).  Why'd you give this show a rating of ... in your review? Clearly it deserved a ... ! Obviously our reviewer disagrees.  When is title X coming out, how many episodes is it, and/or who is releasing it? Look it up in the encyclopedia, ask Answerman, or ask in the forum.  Why'd you make X change to the programming on [Cartoon Network, YTV, etc]? Uhh, try contacting the broadcaster, network or station. We're a news site and we have no more control over the schedule at [TV Station] than any other media source. Yes, believe it or not we get this question every so often.  I'd like to license, work on, be involved with, etc... one of your titles Just like we aren't involved in TV broadcasting, we are not licensors. Even for shows that we stream on ANN, we are not authorized to sub-license them to other companies. Contact the producers or the licensors, not us.  I'd like permission to do something with one of your titles Sorry, we do not control copyright permissions for any anime or manga. If you need permission to do something, contact the local licensee / master licensor; or failing that, contact the master licensor in Japan. A bit of advice though, for personal, non commercial projects, don't bother contacting them unless you absolutely need permission. They don't care if you make a 1-off t-shirt to wear to school, but if you ask them, they'll probably say ""No,"" as a matter of policy. Sorry we can not help you get in contact with a rights holder.  Why'd you take my video show off YouTube? We get this question a lot. We didn't take your video down. See the above answer as well as the first one. ANN has no involvement in the process of taking pirated materials off of websites like YouTube. For your information, the material was probably taken down because it was uploaded without permission (therefore illegally) and the licensors want you to watch it somewhere they will make money (on DVD, on TV, or on an authorized website). Go here for a list of places where you can legally watch anime and support the creators at the same time.  On a related note, allow us to point out that your video was probably automatically removed by a technology called video-fingerprinting. By this semi-automated process, YouTube removes videos that it believes infringe on copyrights without waiting for complaints from copyright holders. So it's quite possible that no anime company was involved in the removal of your video.   Sadly, this process can affect videos that are legitimate ""fair-use."" Even more sadly, the employees at the anime companies are too busy to bother reading all the e-mails they get about videos (the vast majority of are from morons that don't understand that ""I wasn't making money"" doesn't make it okay) so you can e-mail them to your hearts content, but they probably won't answer (not because they're fan-hating assholes, but because they don't have the time).    If you believe your video is legitimate fair-use (full episodes are never fair use, significant episode clips are rarely fair use, AMVs are almost never fair use of the music) try posting it again and include in the description why you feel it is fair use. If you're lucky, YouTube will take this into consideration (some videos are deleted automatically, others are looked at by a human employee at YouTube after the fingerprinting process identifies them) and not delete your video. You really should read up on ""fair use"" before you make any claims that your video is fair use though. And by ""read-up,"" we mean read professional, expert explanations, not your friend's blog.   I have a great idea for an anime or manga, where do I submit it? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not involved with the creation process of any anime or manga and we can not put you in contact with creators (more on that here). Finally, we'd recommend you read this and this.  How do I get your television channel? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not The Anime Network (TAN). For details on TAN, read the transcript of our chat with them, read our TAN news coverage, or visit their website.  Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? No. As a policy, ANN never gives out contact information. Don't send us this question unless you've exhausted every other resource available (phone book, 411, Google, their website, etc...), even then, we will only forward your request to them, and we will only do so provided it is a business-to-business request being made by a company we've actually heard of. If you can't find Hayao Miyazaki's e-mail address online, it's probably because he doesn't want to receive a thousand e-mails a day. The one exception to this rule is that we will give out the Public Relations / Press Relations (PR) contact information for a company provided we have it readily available. Generally you can find this information on your own though, so please don't be lazy. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? I'm an old acquaintance of theirs. The answer is still no. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? They worked on one of your projects. Just to be clear, our encyclopedia carries information about a myriad of projects (anime,manga, etc...) most of which (99.9%) Anime News Network is not, and never was, involved with. It is not a list of our projects. So if the person actually worked for ANN, please see this answer, but if they are one of the 67023+ people listed in the encyclopedia, they probably didn't work for us and therefore the previous two answers apply. Okay, I understand, you can't or won't put me in contact with them, but I really want/need to contact this person. Can you offer any suggestions on how to proceed? Depending on who you're trying to contact, they might have a fanclub, official webpage, or e-mail address listed in their encyclopedia entry. If not, try looking for the latest production they worked on and contacting the production company, they might be able and willing to forward your e-mail. Just a note, if you're contacting someone in Japan, it's highly recommended that at least your intro be in Japanese. Even if your intended recipient understands English, the person you ask to forward your e-mail might not. For your benefit, here's a quick intro you can prepend to any e-mail you send to Japan (replaces the blanks by the name of the person you are trying to contact): ご担当者様へ お世話になっております。 本社は____様にご連絡を取りたがっています。お手数ですが、このメールを____様へ転送して頂けないでしょうか? 宜しくお願いします。  Literally: To whom it may concern/the person in charge: Thank you for your time. We are trying to contact _____. If it isn't too much trouble, could you forward this e-mail to ____? Thank you very much.    Can you send me your catalog? We don't have a catalog, we don't sell anything.  Where can I buy Anime ? You can buy it at retail movie stores like Blockbuster and Suncoast as well as specialty Anime Shops. You can also buy it online at websites like Anime Castle, Anime Nation, J List, Roberts Anime Corner Store and The Right Stuf International.  Where can I download anime or watch it online? For the most part, you can't legally download anime online. Fansubs are generally illegal (whether or not they're unethical is a completely different topic), and as such, we can't help you obtain them. You might want to check the sites listed below, and read our news, when there's legal anime to download or watched online we generally mention it.  Don't ask us where to get bootlegs or fansubs, we won't tell you.  Some sites/services that allow you to download or watch anime online legally(may or may not be free):  Amazon Prime crunchyroll Funimation's Website HiDive Apple iTunes hulu Netflix Viz Anime  * Why isn't YouTube listed? Because a lot of the content on YouTube is illegally uploaded. One day we'll have an index of legal anime on YouTube, but until then we aren't listing it as a site where all content is legal/authorized.   How do I watch anime on ANN? ANN has stopped streaming anime episodes. Go to the websites above!  Can you help me with my school assignment No. We get this question about once a week, and we don't really want to spend 25 hours a year answering school questions. The worst part is that most people who e-mail us are actually asking us to provide information they could find with a little bit of research, in other words, they're asking us to do their work for them. On the other hand, if you're working on a master's project or PhD thesis related to anime, that interests us, so we'd probably be more than happy to help.  Does ANN offer Internships? Yes, Anime News Network offers internships in our newsroom and our web-development departments. Further details are available here   What happened to ANN UK? In late May the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into effect. The EU determined that any website targeting European readers would be ""doing business in Europe."" Anime News Network does not disagree with this conclusion. Unfortunately, the GDPR requires all websites doing business in Europe to meet a stringent set of privacy regulations. While ANN supports the intent of these regulations, some of them are extremely difficult to comply with. While it is our intention, for the benefit of all readers our readers around the world, to comply with these new standards, we are not able to do so immediately. Once we are fully compliant with GDPR requirements, we will re-launch ANN UK. In the meantime, ANN's global edition is available to all readers worldwide and is the default version for readers outside of North America, Australia, New Zealand and South East Asia.             bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Misc Page homepage / archives     ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4, 'http://www.theanimenetwork.com/': 1, 'http://www.animecastle.com': 1, 'http://www.animenation.com': 1, 'https://www.jlist.com': 1, 'https://store.yahoo.com/cgi-bin/clink?animecorner+DwdEaM+index.html': 1, 'http://www.rightstuf.com': 1, 'https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=sr_nr_p_n_theme_browse-bin_1?fst=as%3Aoff&rh=n%3A2676882011%2Ck%3Aanime': 1, 'http://www.crunchyroll.com': 1, 'http://www.funimation.com/f_index.cfm?page=videos': 1, 'http://hidive.com': 1, 'https://www.apple.com/itunes/overview/': 1, 'http://www.hulu.com': 1, 'https://netflix.com': 1, 'http://www.vizanime.com': 1}"

Does ANN offer Internships? What happened to ANN UK?    About ANN  What is Anime News Network (ANN)? Anime News Network was created as a news source that focuses on the medium of Japanese Animation(anime) and Japanese Comics (manga). ANN was founded by Justin Sevakis in July of 1998, and has since lead the online anime news medium with a tradition of strong unbiased coverage of major breaking news. With in-depth coverage, analysis and commentary to provide insight into the world of anime and manga, ANN has been and continues to be the #1 English language source for anime and manga news on the Internet. ANN's goal is to make the latest, most comprehensive Anime news available to new fans and veteran Otaku alike.  What ANN is not:  A television network or station; A subsidiary of another company; A dubbing / voice recording studio; An animation company; A licensing or distribution company; A manufacturer or distributor of merchandise; For sale.    What is anime? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of anime, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, anime is animation that is primarily produced and conceived in Japan. This includes animation conceived in Japan that has portions outsourced to other countries, but does not include animation primarily produced outside Japan and with the animation outsourced to Japan. It does however include animation that is co-conceived inside and outside of Japan and at least partially produced inside Japan.  What is manga?

ANN is operated by a team of people, under the guidance of Christopher Macdonald, Daniel DeLorme, Zac Bertschy, Egan Loo and Hori Shinsuke. A full list of the staff can be found on the staff page.   Who owns ANN? The website is owned by Anime News Network Inc., a privately owned corporation. The corporation's shareholders include: Christopher Macdonald (Minority owner, controlling shareholder), Hori Shinsuke (Minority owner), Anime Consortium Japan (Minority owner), others.   Where is ANN based? Wow, that question is so 1999! ANN is based everywhere and nowhere. We're based on the Internet! We don't have an office; our staff all work at home and are based around the world with the most full-time staff based in Japan and the United States. Anime News Network, Inc. the corporation that maintains ANN is a Canadian corporation.  Who is the mascot? When the site was first launched in 1998 it featured a blond-haired mascot named Jadress, created by Robin Sevakis. She was eventually replaced by Nina, who was featured in a webcomic (also created by Robin Sevakis) that ran from 2007 to 2013.  How often do you update? The site is run on a daily content format, as opposed to a monthly or bi-monthly magazine format. We update the news and reviews daily, and other content, such as features, columns, and editorials are also added throughout the week. Our encyclopedia is updated daily as well.  Under what settings is ANN best viewed? The site uses a responsive design that should look good at any resolution, from smartphones to large desktop screens.  How do I find older articles on ANN? Links to archives for news, features, columns, reviews, etc. can be found in their respective sections in the menu. You can also use the search engine.  What was used to make the site, as well as maintain it? The site is a combination of older parts in PHP and newer parts in Ruby, with a MySQL database to manage the content. Apart from the phpBB forum, we haven't used any pre-made packages; all the content is managed and presented with custom software.  How do I get permission to reprint an ANN Story, or obtain an ANN graphic or photo? ANN has a newsfeed program where you can get the latest anime news headlines on your very own website. If you wish to entirely reprint anything on your site please contact the editors. For more details about what you can and can not re-print with or without our permission, see our copyright statement.  How many people hear or read an ANN story? We get a bit over 200,000 visits every day. In addition to regular visitors, ANN's news is often sourced in print and occasionally on the airwaves.  How can I get in touch with the staff? Visit our contact page or visit our staff page for further contact and personal information. If a member's e-mail address is not there you can send your comments to the editors and we'll forward them.  Do you attend any public events? Yes. ANN tries to provide coverage to as many anime conventions/festivals/symposiums as our staff can manage. For more details on this see our events section and our events forum.  Do you have a newsfeed? You really should have an RSS newsfeed! Look at our newsfeed section for links to various RSS & Atom feeds as well as our custom newsfeed program. Submitting Content  How should I submit news ? Send an e-mail to [email protected] , this e-mail address is regularly monitored by several staff (someone is always ""on duty""). Other methods (e-mail directly to staff, PM, Forum, Twitter, etc...) are less reliable, and may lead to delays and/or a complete failure to notice your submission.  I have something to say about an online petition. Stop. Virtually every e-petition is a waste of time.   I submitted a news item, why wasn't it posted? We could still be in the process of verifying the details, we may not have been able to verify the items, or perhaps we didn't find it newsworthy enough to post. On a ""slow"" news day we're more likely to post less significant items.  I submitted a news item, why was it credited to someone else? They either submitted it first--or more importantly--submitted more information.  Can I submit news about a non-Japanese animation? No. We're Anime News Network, not ""Animation News Network"", not ""Asian Animation Network."" There's plenty of good animation from around the world, including Korea and China, but we only cover Japanese animation, not French, Mexican, Chinese, African, Korean or Afghanistanimation.  Can I submit a review? / How do I become a reviewer? Anime News Network does not accept unsolicited reviews. Take a quick look at the Staff Openings page, if there is an opening, it will be mentioned there. More often than not, we hire experienced writers who are known to us. Best piece of advice we can give is to make a name for yourself then we'll come to you when the time is right.  Can I submit an article? If you are an experienced writer/journalist with a portfolio you can point to, please E-mail the editors and ask about the topic, we'd be glad to consider your article idea.  Can I have a column? No. Only previous, regular contributors who have shown an ability to consistently write timely, quality articles (or reviews) are permitted to write columns. Try submitting some articles or reviews first.  Information X is missing from the Encyclopedia, can you add it? We can't add it, but YOU can. The Encyclopedia is a user-contributed database; it's made specially so that you can add missing information by yourself. You just need a user account. So please do take the time to register and submit the information you found was missing. Each page contains pointers about how to add information, and if that's not enough you can check the Encyclopedia FAQ or the memoranda.  How can I contribute to the encyclopedia? Any registered user can contribute standard data to the Encyclopedia for Anime, Manga and People. But if that's not enough for you and you're near the top of the contributors list and you'd like to help out with the releases, lexicon, or editing and verifying data submitted by other people, please contact the Encyclopedist.  Please note, that we'll be looking for someone who is inputting quality data, not just large amounts of data.   What if I want to contribute in some other way? We always appreciate whatever help and support that readers can give. If you'd like to help out at ANN in a way other than the ones described above, please contact the editors. There's so much to do at ANN that we're very appreciative of any help offered.   My company is making Anime, can you post a news article about it? Sorry, too many companies are trying to cash in on the popularity of Anime by making cartoons with big eyes and purple hair. We're sure you aren't like that, but... well actually, we aren't sure.  Why doesn't Anime News Network review world manga? Please see our definition of manga. It is Anime News Network's official position, and the personal belief of many of our staff, than there is nothing inheritently superior about Japanese manga when compared to world manga. However Anime News Network's purpose is to cover Japanese animation and comic books. Currently we do not have the resources to review all the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America. If and when we are able to review 100% of the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America, we will then consider expanding our area of review coverage to include manga-style comics (world manga) that originate outside of Japan.  Why didn't you post a news article about my (company's) new Anime or Manga? If your item is picked up in a distribution deal by a company that isn't being run out of someone's garage, then maybe its newsworthy. So when that happens, give us a shout, and we'll consider it, but if you can't tell us what makes your creation manga or anime (other than big eyes, purple hair and the like) you can pretty much forget it.  May I send you my company's product to review? If it's anime or manga-related, then yes. Contact editors[at]animenewsnetwork.com for shipping information.  I'm starting a new webmanga, is it news? No, there are a billion and one ""webmangas"", and most only last a couple of months. Now, if your webmanga gets licensed by a publisher... that might be news.  Can you mention my site? Only if you do something newsworthy, sorry.  Why have we been blacklisted? ANN has a 2-strikes rule regarding inappropriate PR. After 2 strikes for the following reasons we will blacklist your company or PR firm (when we blacklist a PR firm, we notify their relevant clients). i) Completely irrelevant PR that has nothing to do with anime, manga, Japanese pop-culture or any other related content; ii) Unauthorized stealth marketing on our forums; iii) Harassing our staff; iv) Continued PR submissions to inappropriate e-mail address. v) Any attempt to illicitly influence editorial We'll send you a link to this post after your first offense. After your second offense you'll never hear from us again (and our readers will never hear from you or your clients).  Isn't this a bit harsh? Perhaps, but we're tired of getting PRs for toilets, accounting firm management changes and World War 2 museums.   But we offer an opt-out! Clicking that link might opt us out of all your press releases, including your relevant ones. It would be the same as blacklisting you, without giving you the warning. Showing you this warning is actually less harsh than clicking your opt-out.  Forum / Account  I didn't receive my forum registration. If you are using a spam filter, please check your spam folder, some mail servers catch the registration code as spam. Search your spamfolder & inbox for e-mail from [email protected] or [email protected]. If you are using any sort of white list, please make sure that your e-mail account is set up to accept e-mails from [email protected] and [email protected]. If you are using a mail service that bounces the e-mail back to the sender and asks them to confirm that it is not spam, we will not do that. These services usually allow you to add the e-mail address to a white-list before hand. Once you have checked all of the above, you can have the server re-send you your activation code by going here. It should be instant, but sometimes e-mail is slow, give it a couple hours (the slowness is usually not because of our server). If you still don't get your activation code, then and ONLY then, e-mail us at h[email protected] make sure that: 1) Your e-mail is sent from the e-mail address you submitted to ANN; 2) You include your user name; 3) Do not send us your password; 4) The subject of your e-mail must be ""activation code"".   How do I become a moderator? You're invited. When we feel there is a need for a new moderator, we look at our best forum users (the ones that contribute intelligently to conversation and act maturely) and ask them if they'd be willing to help us moderate the forum.  Will there ever be an off topic / general conversation forum among the forums? Not in the public areas, no. We do however maintain a community section for subscribers, and off-topic discussion is permitted there.  Why aren't my posts showing up? Posts from new users sometimes take a while to show up. Please be patient, they should appear within a few hours. Believe it or not, this is a ""feature"" not a ""bug.""  Is there a set of forum rules? Right here - read them if you haven't already.  Help, I've been banned or moderated! Read this.  How do I attach a picture (avatar) to my account? Read this.  Can I change my user name? You can make changes in your user account settings. But because other users depend on your username to recognize you, we have a ""no identity switcheroos"" policy: once you start using the forum we do not allow changes to your username beyond punctuation and capitalization.  Can I delete my account? Yes, you can. Go to your account settings page and you will be able to delete your account from there. Contests  Can I enter give-aways more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No.  Can I enter creative contests more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, Yes.  Does ANN ""own"" my entry? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No. But as a condition of your entry we generaly require you to give us the unrevocable right to display your entry on Anime News Network for all eternity.  Can I display my entry elsewhere? Yes, anywhere you please, unless otherwise stated in the contest rules.  Why do I have to put your logo and/or the sponsor's logo on my submission There are two reasons for this. First, it adds some extra benefit to the contest sponsors and second, it helps us insure that you made the entry for the contest, instead of just grabing some existing art and submiting it.  Explain those rules about where I live and whether or not I can enter and if you will ship me a prize. Most of our contest are open to anyone, regardless of where you live, because we don't believe in geographic discrimination. However sometimes our sponsors want a contest to only be open to their potential clients, so in those cases we have no choice to abide by their request to limit contest entry to a certain geographic area. While we don't believe in geographic discrimination, we also don't believe in spending a fortune on shipping and trying to figure out custom laws in order to get you your prize so that's why we only ship to the USA and Canada.   What does a complete mailing address look like? Short answer: ""It's what we need to put on a package to mail it to you."" It looks something like this:  416 William St. #402 Moralton, SS 70707 USA 24 Sussex Dr Ottawa, ON  K1A 0A3 Canada 1000 J.P. Laurel St. San Miguel 1005, Manila  Philippines   You'd be amazed at how many people enter our contests and leave out critical mailing information like their city, province/state and or postal/zip code. You'd also be amazed at how many people ask us ""What do you mean by complete mailing address?"" In fact, if you're reading this, it's quite possible that we referred you here because you asked that very question. Since we usually only ship to the USA and Canada, we won't disqualify you for leaving out the country, but if anything else is missing, we'll just pick another winner to replace you. We will not contact you to verify your mailing address. BTW, your name is not part of your mailing address, but we won't disqualify you for putting it in there...  Why do some contests not ship to PO Boxes? ANN usually doesn't handle shipping for our contest prizes. Shipping is done by the contest sponsor. If the contest states ""no PO boxes"" this is because our sponsor requested it. Most likely it is because they are shipping via a courier like UPS, which will not ship to PO boxes.  I'd really prefer it if you didn't post my name & city if I win This is done for legal reasons, sorry. That said, if you want to enter with an alias, that's fine as long as you are certain the package will reach you (we can't guarantee it will).  Why did you stop accepting art contest entries from Facebook By default, Facebook posts usually aren't public. Most people who submit Facebook URLs to our art contests forget to share their entries publicly, and we are often forced to disqualify these entries. It's better to just avoid the problem altogether. If you want to enter with Facebook, and you remember to make your entry public go ahead, we'll accept it. But if you forget to share it properly, we will simply ignore your entry.   Miscellaneous   Can I link to you? Yes, please feel free. Currently we don't have any banners to offer you for this, we'll be making some new ones shortly.  Can you link to me? No. We are not a link exchange site.  Wait, I can link to you, but you won't link to me?? Yes, we know it sounds a little conceited of us, but that's how it is. To be fair, we don't expect you to link to us, but we're honored if you do decide that you'd like to link to our site despite the fact that we won't be returning the favor. Please don't link to us if you're only doing it because you hope to get something in return; link to us because you feel that you want more people to know about Anime News Network.   Can we trade banners? Sorry, ANN relies on its banners to survive. We very seldom trade banners with another website or publication. If your publication is in print (10 000+ circulation) or a website with 10 million+ impressions per month, we may consider it. Please understand, ANN receives this question at least once a week, it isn't possible for us to even consider swapping / affiliating with so many sites, so we generally don't swap / affiliate with any.  Can you affiliate with us? Anime News Network would be happy to setup an affiliate program with any online store that pays referral fees provided that store meets certain pre-requisites. Anime News Network is unfortunately unable to affiliate itself with fan-sites much for the same reason that we can not link to you or trade banners with you (see above two entries).  Why'd you give this show a rating of ... in your review? Clearly it deserved a ... ! Obviously our reviewer disagrees.  When is title X coming out, how many episodes is it, and/or who is releasing it? Look it up in the encyclopedia, ask Answerman, or ask in the forum.  Why'd you make X change to the programming on [Cartoon Network, YTV, etc]? Uhh, try contacting the broadcaster, network or station. We're a news site and we have no more control over the schedule at [TV Station] than any other media source. Yes, believe it or not we get this question every so often.  I'd like to license, work on, be involved with, etc... one of your titles Just like we aren't involved in TV broadcasting, we are not licensors. Even for shows that we stream on ANN, we are not authorized to sub-license them to other companies. Contact the producers or the licensors, not us.  I'd like permission to do something with one of your titles Sorry, we do not control copyright permissions for any anime or manga. If you need permission to do something, contact the local licensee / master licensor; or failing that, contact the master licensor in Japan. A bit of advice though, for personal, non commercial projects, don't bother contacting them unless you absolutely need permission. They don't care if you make a 1-off t-shirt to wear to school, but if you ask them, they'll probably say ""No,"" as a matter of policy. Sorry we can not help you get in contact with a rights holder.  Why'd you take my video show off YouTube? We get this question a lot. We didn't take your video down. See the above answer as well as the first one. ANN has no involvement in the process of taking pirated materials off of websites like YouTube. For your information, the material was probably taken down because it was uploaded without permission (therefore illegally) and the licensors want you to watch it somewhere they will make money (on DVD, on TV, or on an authorized website). Go here for a list of places where you can legally watch anime and support the creators at the same time.  On a related note, allow us to point out that your video was probably automatically removed by a technology called video-fingerprinting. By this semi-automated process, YouTube removes videos that it believes infringe on copyrights without waiting for complaints from copyright holders. So it's quite possible that no anime company was involved in the removal of your video.   Sadly, this process can affect videos that are legitimate ""fair-use."" Even more sadly, the employees at the anime companies are too busy to bother reading all the e-mails they get about videos (the vast majority of are from morons that don't understand that ""I wasn't making money"" doesn't make it okay) so you can e-mail them to your hearts content, but they probably won't answer (not because they're fan-hating assholes, but because they don't have the time).    If you believe your video is legitimate fair-use (full episodes are never fair use, significant episode clips are rarely fair use, AMVs are almost never fair use of the music) try posting it again and include in the description why you feel it is fair use. If you're lucky, YouTube will take this into consideration (some videos are deleted automatically, others are looked at by a human employee at YouTube after the fingerprinting process identifies them) and not delete your video. You really should read up on ""fair use"" before you make any claims that your video is fair use though. And by ""read-up,"" we mean read professional, expert explanations, not your friend's blog.   I have a great idea for an anime or manga, where do I submit it? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not involved with the creation process of any anime or manga and we can not put you in contact with creators (more on that here). Finally, we'd recommend you read this and this.  How do I get your television channel? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not The Anime Network (TAN). For details on TAN, read the transcript of our chat with them, read our TAN news coverage, or visit their website.  Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? No. As a policy, ANN never gives out contact information. Don't send us this question unless you've exhausted every other resource available (phone book, 411, Google, their website, etc...), even then, we will only forward your request to them, and we will only do so provided it is a business-to-business request being made by a company we've actually heard of. If you can't find Hayao Miyazaki's e-mail address online, it's probably because he doesn't want to receive a thousand e-mails a day. The one exception to this rule is that we will give out the Public Relations / Press Relations (PR) contact information for a company provided we have it readily available. Generally you can find this information on your own though, so please don't be lazy. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? I'm an old acquaintance of theirs. The answer is still no. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? They worked on one of your projects. Just to be clear, our encyclopedia carries information about a myriad of projects (anime,manga, etc...) most of which (99.9%) Anime News Network is not, and never was, involved with. It is not a list of our projects. So if the person actually worked for ANN, please see this answer, but if they are one of the 67023+ people listed in the encyclopedia, they probably didn't work for us and therefore the previous two answers apply. Okay, I understand, you can't or won't put me in contact with them, but I really want/need to contact this person. Can you offer any suggestions on how to proceed? Depending on who you're trying to contact, they might have a fanclub, official webpage, or e-mail address listed in their encyclopedia entry. If not, try looking for the latest production they worked on and contacting the production company, they might be able and willing to forward your e-mail. Just a note, if you're contacting someone in Japan, it's highly recommended that at least your intro be in Japanese. Even if your intended recipient understands English, the person you ask to forward your e-mail might not. For your benefit, here's a quick intro you can prepend to any e-mail you send to Japan (replaces the blanks by the name of the person you are trying to contact): ご担当者様へ お世話になっております。 本社は____様にご連絡を取りたがっています。お手数ですが、このメールを____様へ転送して頂けないでしょうか? 宜しくお願いします。  Literally: To whom it may concern/the person in charge: Thank you for your time. We are trying to contact _____. If it isn't too much trouble, could you forward this e-mail to ____? Thank you very much.    Can you send me your catalog? We don't have a catalog, we don't sell anything.  Where can I buy Anime ? You can buy it at retail movie stores like Blockbuster and Suncoast as well as specialty Anime Shops. You can also buy it online at websites like Anime Castle, Anime Nation, J List, Roberts Anime Corner Store and The Right Stuf International.  Where can I download anime or watch it online? For the most part, you can't legally download anime online. Fansubs are generally illegal (whether or not they're unethical is a completely different topic), and as such, we can't help you obtain them. You might want to check the sites listed below, and read our news, when there's legal anime to download or watched online we generally mention it.  Don't ask us where to get bootlegs or fansubs, we won't tell you.  Some sites/services that allow you to download or watch anime online legally(may or may not be free):  Amazon Prime crunchyroll Funimation's Website HiDive Apple iTunes hulu Netflix Viz Anime  * Why isn't YouTube listed? Because a lot of the content on YouTube is illegally uploaded. One day we'll have an index of legal anime on YouTube, but until then we aren't listing it as a site where all content is legal/authorized.   How do I watch anime on ANN? ANN has stopped streaming anime episodes. Go to the websites above!  Can you help me with my school assignment No. We get this question about once a week, and we don't really want to spend 25 hours a year answering school questions. The worst part is that most people who e-mail us are actually asking us to provide information they could find with a little bit of research, in other words, they're asking us to do their work for them. On the other hand, if you're working on a master's project or PhD thesis related to anime, that interests us, so we'd probably be more than happy to help.  Does ANN offer Internships? Yes, Anime News Network offers internships in our newsroom and our web-development departments. Further details are available here   What happened to ANN UK? In late May the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into effect. The EU determined that any website targeting European readers would be ""doing business in Europe."" Anime News Network does not disagree with this conclusion. Unfortunately, the GDPR requires all websites doing business in Europe to meet a stringent set of privacy regulations. While ANN supports the intent of these regulations, some of them are extremely difficult to comply with. While it is our intention, for the benefit of all readers our readers around the world, to comply with these new standards, we are not able to do so immediately. Once we are fully compliant with GDPR requirements, we will re-launch ANN UK. In the meantime, ANN's global edition is available to all readers worldwide and is the default version for readers outside of North America, Australia, New Zealand and South East Asia.             bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Misc Page homepage / archives    ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4, 'http://www.theanimenetwork.com/': 1, 'http://www.animecastle.com': 1, 'http://www.animenation.com': 1, 'https://www.jlist.com': 1, 'https://store.yahoo.com/cgi-bin/clink?animecorner+DwdEaM+index.html': 1, 'http://www.rightstuf.com': 1, 'https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=sr_nr_p_n_theme_browse-bin_1?fst=as%3Aoff&rh=n%3A2676882011%2Ck%3Aanime': 1, 'http://www.crunchyroll.com': 1, 'http://www.funimation.com/f_index.cfm?page=videos': 1, 'http://hidive.com': 1, 'https://www.apple.com/itunes/overview/': 1, 'http://www.hulu.com': 1, 'https://netflix.com': 1, 'http://www.vizanime.com': 1}"

Does ANN offer Internships? What happened to ANN UK?    About ANN  What is Anime News Network (ANN)? Anime News Network was created as a news source that focuses on the medium of Japanese Animation(anime) and Japanese Comics (manga). ANN was founded by Justin Sevakis in July of 1998, and has since lead the online anime news medium with a tradition of strong unbiased coverage of major breaking news. With in-depth coverage, analysis and commentary to provide insight into the world of anime and manga, ANN has been and continues to be the #1 English language source for anime and manga news on the Internet. ANN's goal is to make the latest, most comprehensive Anime news available to new fans and veteran Otaku alike.  What ANN is not:  A television network or station; A subsidiary of another company; A dubbing / voice recording studio; An animation company; A licensing or distribution company; A manufacturer or distributor of merchandise; For sale.

For all purposes related to Anime News Network, anime is animation that is primarily produced and conceived in Japan.

It does however include animation that is co-conceived inside and outside of Japan and at least partially produced inside Japan.  What is manga?

ANN is operated by a team of people, under the guidance of Christopher Macdonald, Daniel DeLorme, Zac Bertschy, Egan Loo and Hori Shinsuke. A full list of the staff can be found on the staff page.   Who owns ANN? The website is owned by Anime News Network Inc., a privately owned corporation. The corporation's shareholders include: Christopher Macdonald (Minority owner, controlling shareholder), Hori Shinsuke (Minority owner), Anime Consortium Japan (Minority owner), others.   Where is ANN based? Wow, that question is so 1999! ANN is based everywhere and nowhere. We're based on the Internet! We don't have an office; our staff all work at home and are based around the world with the most full-time staff based in Japan and the United States. Anime News Network, Inc. the corporation that maintains ANN is a Canadian corporation.  Who is the mascot? When the site was first launched in 1998 it featured a blond-haired mascot named Jadress, created by Robin Sevakis. She was eventually replaced by Nina, who was featured in a webcomic (also created by Robin Sevakis) that ran from 2007 to 2013.  How often do you update? The site is run on a daily content format, as opposed to a monthly or bi-monthly magazine format. We update the news and reviews daily, and other content, such as features, columns, and editorials are also added throughout the week. Our encyclopedia is updated daily as well.  Under what settings is ANN best viewed? The site uses a responsive design that should look good at any resolution, from smartphones to large desktop screens.  How do I find older articles on ANN? Links to archives for news, features, columns, reviews, etc. can be found in their respective sections in the menu. You can also use the search engine.  What was used to make the site, as well as maintain it? The site is a combination of older parts in PHP and newer parts in Ruby, with a MySQL database to manage the content. Apart from the phpBB forum, we haven't used any pre-made packages; all the content is managed and presented with custom software.  How do I get permission to reprint an ANN Story, or obtain an ANN graphic or photo? ANN has a newsfeed program where you can get the latest anime news headlines on your very own website. If you wish to entirely reprint anything on your site please contact the editors. For more details about what you can and can not re-print with or without our permission, see our copyright statement.  How many people hear or read an ANN story? We get a bit over 200,000 visits every day. In addition to regular visitors, ANN's news is often sourced in print and occasionally on the airwaves.  How can I get in touch with the staff? Visit our contact page or visit our staff page for further contact and personal information. If a member's e-mail address is not there you can send your comments to the editors and we'll forward them.  Do you attend any public events? Yes. ANN tries to provide coverage to as many anime conventions/festivals/symposiums as our staff can manage. For more details on this see our events section and our events forum.  Do you have a newsfeed? You really should have an RSS newsfeed! Look at our newsfeed section for links to various RSS & Atom feeds as well as our custom newsfeed program. Submitting Content  How should I submit news ? Send an e-mail to [email protected] , this e-mail address is regularly monitored by several staff (someone is always ""on duty""). Other methods (e-mail directly to staff, PM, Forum, Twitter, etc...) are less reliable, and may lead to delays and/or a complete failure to notice your submission.  I have something to say about an online petition. Stop. Virtually every e-petition is a waste of time.   I submitted a news item, why wasn't it posted? We could still be in the process of verifying the details, we may not have been able to verify the items, or perhaps we didn't find it newsworthy enough to post. On a ""slow"" news day we're more likely to post less significant items.  I submitted a news item, why was it credited to someone else? They either submitted it first--or more importantly--submitted more information.  Can I submit news about a non-Japanese animation? No. We're Anime News Network, not ""Animation News Network"", not ""Asian Animation Network."" There's plenty of good animation from around the world, including Korea and China, but we only cover Japanese animation, not French, Mexican, Chinese, African, Korean or Afghanistanimation.  Can I submit a review? / How do I become a reviewer? Anime News Network does not accept unsolicited reviews. Take a quick look at the Staff Openings page, if there is an opening, it will be mentioned there. More often than not, we hire experienced writers who are known to us. Best piece of advice we can give is to make a name for yourself then we'll come to you when the time is right.  Can I submit an article? If you are an experienced writer/journalist with a portfolio you can point to, please E-mail the editors and ask about the topic, we'd be glad to consider your article idea.  Can I have a column? No. Only previous, regular contributors who have shown an ability to consistently write timely, quality articles (or reviews) are permitted to write columns. Try submitting some articles or reviews first.  Information X is missing from the Encyclopedia, can you add it? We can't add it, but YOU can. The Encyclopedia is a user-contributed database; it's made specially so that you can add missing information by yourself. You just need a user account. So please do take the time to register and submit the information you found was missing. Each page contains pointers about how to add information, and if that's not enough you can check the Encyclopedia FAQ or the memoranda.  How can I contribute to the encyclopedia? Any registered user can contribute standard data to the Encyclopedia for Anime, Manga and People. But if that's not enough for you and you're near the top of the contributors list and you'd like to help out with the releases, lexicon, or editing and verifying data submitted by other people, please contact the Encyclopedist.  Please note, that we'll be looking for someone who is inputting quality data, not just large amounts of data.   What if I want to contribute in some other way? We always appreciate whatever help and support that readers can give. If you'd like to help out at ANN in a way other than the ones described above, please contact the editors. There's so much to do at ANN that we're very appreciative of any help offered.   My company is making Anime, can you post a news article about it? Sorry, too many companies are trying to cash in on the popularity of Anime by making cartoons with big eyes and purple hair. We're sure you aren't like that, but... well actually, we aren't sure.  Why doesn't Anime News Network review world manga? Please see our definition of manga. It is Anime News Network's official position, and the personal belief of many of our staff, than there is nothing inheritently superior about Japanese manga when compared to world manga. However Anime News Network's purpose is to cover Japanese animation and comic books. Currently we do not have the resources to review all the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America. If and when we are able to review 100% of the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America, we will then consider expanding our area of review coverage to include manga-style comics (world manga) that originate outside of Japan.  Why didn't you post a news article about my (company's) new Anime or Manga? If your item is picked up in a distribution deal by a company that isn't being run out of someone's garage, then maybe its newsworthy. So when that happens, give us a shout, and we'll consider it, but if you can't tell us what makes your creation manga or anime (other than big eyes, purple hair and the like) you can pretty much forget it.  May I send you my company's product to review? If it's anime or manga-related, then yes. Contact editors[at]animenewsnetwork.com for shipping information.  I'm starting a new webmanga, is it news? No, there are a billion and one ""webmangas"", and most only last a couple of months. Now, if your webmanga gets licensed by a publisher... that might be news.  Can you mention my site? Only if you do something newsworthy, sorry.  Why have we been blacklisted? ANN has a 2-strikes rule regarding inappropriate PR. After 2 strikes for the following reasons we will blacklist your company or PR firm (when we blacklist a PR firm, we notify their relevant clients). i) Completely irrelevant PR that has nothing to do with anime, manga, Japanese pop-culture or any other related content; ii) Unauthorized stealth marketing on our forums; iii) Harassing our staff; iv) Continued PR submissions to inappropriate e-mail address. v) Any attempt to illicitly influence editorial We'll send you a link to this post after your first offense. After your second offense you'll never hear from us again (and our readers will never hear from you or your clients).  Isn't this a bit harsh? Perhaps, but we're tired of getting PRs for toilets, accounting firm management changes and World War 2 museums.   But we offer an opt-out! Clicking that link might opt us out of all your press releases, including your relevant ones. It would be the same as blacklisting you, without giving you the warning. Showing you this warning is actually less harsh than clicking your opt-out.  Forum / Account  I didn't receive my forum registration. If you are using a spam filter, please check your spam folder, some mail servers catch the registration code as spam. Search your spamfolder & inbox for e-mail from [email protected] or [email protected]. If you are using any sort of white list, please make sure that your e-mail account is set up to accept e-mails from [email protected] and [email protected]. If you are using a mail service that bounces the e-mail back to the sender and asks them to confirm that it is not spam, we will not do that. These services usually allow you to add the e-mail address to a white-list before hand. Once you have checked all of the above, you can have the server re-send you your activation code by going here. It should be instant, but sometimes e-mail is slow, give it a couple hours (the slowness is usually not because of our server). If you still don't get your activation code, then and ONLY then, e-mail us at h[email protected] make sure that: 1) Your e-mail is sent from the e-mail address you submitted to ANN; 2) You include your user name; 3) Do not send us your password; 4) The subject of your e-mail must be ""activation code"".   How do I become a moderator? You're invited. When we feel there is a need for a new moderator, we look at our best forum users (the ones that contribute intelligently to conversation and act maturely) and ask them if they'd be willing to help us moderate the forum.  Will there ever be an off topic / general conversation forum among the forums? Not in the public areas, no. We do however maintain a community section for subscribers, and off-topic discussion is permitted there.  Why aren't my posts showing up? Posts from new users sometimes take a while to show up. Please be patient, they should appear within a few hours. Believe it or not, this is a ""feature"" not a ""bug.""  Is there a set of forum rules? Right here - read them if you haven't already.  Help, I've been banned or moderated! Read this.  How do I attach a picture (avatar) to my account? Read this.  Can I change my user name? You can make changes in your user account settings. But because other users depend on your username to recognize you, we have a ""no identity switcheroos"" policy: once you start using the forum we do not allow changes to your username beyond punctuation and capitalization.  Can I delete my account? Yes, you can. Go to your account settings page and you will be able to delete your account from there. Contests  Can I enter give-aways more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No.  Can I enter creative contests more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, Yes.  Does ANN ""own"" my entry? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No. But as a condition of your entry we generaly require you to give us the unrevocable right to display your entry on Anime News Network for all eternity.  Can I display my entry elsewhere? Yes, anywhere you please, unless otherwise stated in the contest rules.  Why do I have to put your logo and/or the sponsor's logo on my submission There are two reasons for this. First, it adds some extra benefit to the contest sponsors and second, it helps us insure that you made the entry for the contest, instead of just grabing some existing art and submiting it.  Explain those rules about where I live and whether or not I can enter and if you will ship me a prize. Most of our contest are open to anyone, regardless of where you live, because we don't believe in geographic discrimination. However sometimes our sponsors want a contest to only be open to their potential clients, so in those cases we have no choice to abide by their request to limit contest entry to a certain geographic area. While we don't believe in geographic discrimination, we also don't believe in spending a fortune on shipping and trying to figure out custom laws in order to get you your prize so that's why we only ship to the USA and Canada.   What does a complete mailing address look like? Short answer: ""It's what we need to put on a package to mail it to you."" It looks something like this:  416 William St. #402 Moralton, SS 70707 USA 24 Sussex Dr Ottawa, ON  K1A 0A3 Canada 1000 J.P. Laurel St. San Miguel 1005, Manila  Philippines   You'd be amazed at how many people enter our contests and leave out critical mailing information like their city, province/state and or postal/zip code. You'd also be amazed at how many people ask us ""What do you mean by complete mailing address?"" In fact, if you're reading this, it's quite possible that we referred you here because you asked that very question. Since we usually only ship to the USA and Canada, we won't disqualify you for leaving out the country, but if anything else is missing, we'll just pick another winner to replace you. We will not contact you to verify your mailing address. BTW, your name is not part of your mailing address, but we won't disqualify you for putting it in there...  Why do some contests not ship to PO Boxes? ANN usually doesn't handle shipping for our contest prizes. Shipping is done by the contest sponsor. If the contest states ""no PO boxes"" this is because our sponsor requested it. Most likely it is because they are shipping via a courier like UPS, which will not ship to PO boxes.  I'd really prefer it if you didn't post my name & city if I win This is done for legal reasons, sorry. That said, if you want to enter with an alias, that's fine as long as you are certain the package will reach you (we can't guarantee it will).  Why did you stop accepting art contest entries from Facebook By default, Facebook posts usually aren't public. Most people who submit Facebook URLs to our art contests forget to share their entries publicly, and we are often forced to disqualify these entries. It's better to just avoid the problem altogether. If you want to enter with Facebook, and you remember to make your entry public go ahead, we'll accept it. But if you forget to share it properly, we will simply ignore your entry.   Miscellaneous   Can I link to you? Yes, please feel free. Currently we don't have any banners to offer you for this, we'll be making some new ones shortly.  Can you link to me? No. We are not a link exchange site.  Wait, I can link to you, but you won't link to me?? Yes, we know it sounds a little conceited of us, but that's how it is. To be fair, we don't expect you to link to us, but we're honored if you do decide that you'd like to link to our site despite the fact that we won't be returning the favor. Please don't link to us if you're only doing it because you hope to get something in return; link to us because you feel that you want more people to know about Anime News Network.   Can we trade banners? Sorry, ANN relies on its banners to survive. We very seldom trade banners with another website or publication. If your publication is in print (10 000+ circulation) or a website with 10 million+ impressions per month, we may consider it. Please understand, ANN receives this question at least once a week, it isn't possible for us to even consider swapping / affiliating with so many sites, so we generally don't swap / affiliate with any.  Can you affiliate with us? Anime News Network would be happy to setup an affiliate program with any online store that pays referral fees provided that store meets certain pre-requisites. Anime News Network is unfortunately unable to affiliate itself with fan-sites much for the same reason that we can not link to you or trade banners with you (see above two entries).  Why'd you give this show a rating of ... in your review? Clearly it deserved a ... ! Obviously our reviewer disagrees.  When is title X coming out, how many episodes is it, and/or who is releasing it? Look it up in the encyclopedia, ask Answerman, or ask in the forum.  Why'd you make X change to the programming on [Cartoon Network, YTV, etc]? Uhh, try contacting the broadcaster, network or station. We're a news site and we have no more control over the schedule at [TV Station] than any other media source. Yes, believe it or not we get this question every so often.  I'd like to license, work on, be involved with, etc... one of your titles Just like we aren't involved in TV broadcasting, we are not licensors. Even for shows that we stream on ANN, we are not authorized to sub-license them to other companies. Contact the producers or the licensors, not us.  I'd like permission to do something with one of your titles Sorry, we do not control copyright permissions for any anime or manga. If you need permission to do something, contact the local licensee / master licensor; or failing that, contact the master licensor in Japan. A bit of advice though, for personal, non commercial projects, don't bother contacting them unless you absolutely need permission. They don't care if you make a 1-off t-shirt to wear to school, but if you ask them, they'll probably say ""No,"" as a matter of policy. Sorry we can not help you get in contact with a rights holder.  Why'd you take my video show off YouTube? We get this question a lot. We didn't take your video down. See the above answer as well as the first one. ANN has no involvement in the process of taking pirated materials off of websites like YouTube. For your information, the material was probably taken down because it was uploaded without permission (therefore illegally) and the licensors want you to watch it somewhere they will make money (on DVD, on TV, or on an authorized website). Go here for a list of places where you can legally watch anime and support the creators at the same time.  On a related note, allow us to point out that your video was probably automatically removed by a technology called video-fingerprinting. By this semi-automated process, YouTube removes videos that it believes infringe on copyrights without waiting for complaints from copyright holders. So it's quite possible that no anime company was involved in the removal of your video.   Sadly, this process can affect videos that are legitimate ""fair-use."" Even more sadly, the employees at the anime companies are too busy to bother reading all the e-mails they get about videos (the vast majority of are from morons that don't understand that ""I wasn't making money"" doesn't make it okay) so you can e-mail them to your hearts content, but they probably won't answer (not because they're fan-hating assholes, but because they don't have the time).    If you believe your video is legitimate fair-use (full episodes are never fair use, significant episode clips are rarely fair use, AMVs are almost never fair use of the music) try posting it again and include in the description why you feel it is fair use. If you're lucky, YouTube will take this into consideration (some videos are deleted automatically, others are looked at by a human employee at YouTube after the fingerprinting process identifies them) and not delete your video. You really should read up on ""fair use"" before you make any claims that your video is fair use though. And by ""read-up,"" we mean read professional, expert explanations, not your friend's blog.   I have a great idea for an anime or manga, where do I submit it? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not involved with the creation process of any anime or manga and we can not put you in contact with creators (more on that here). Finally, we'd recommend you read this and this.  How do I get your television channel? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not The Anime Network (TAN). For details on TAN, read the transcript of our chat with them, read our TAN news coverage, or visit their website.  Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? No. As a policy, ANN never gives out contact information. Don't send us this question unless you've exhausted every other resource available (phone book, 411, Google, their website, etc...), even then, we will only forward your request to them, and we will only do so provided it is a business-to-business request being made by a company we've actually heard of. If you can't find Hayao Miyazaki's e-mail address online, it's probably because he doesn't want to receive a thousand e-mails a day. The one exception to this rule is that we will give out the Public Relations / Press Relations (PR) contact information for a company provided we have it readily available. Generally you can find this information on your own though, so please don't be lazy. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? I'm an old acquaintance of theirs. The answer is still no. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? They worked on one of your projects. Just to be clear, our encyclopedia carries information about a myriad of projects (anime,manga, etc...) most of which (99.9%) Anime News Network is not, and never was, involved with. It is not a list of our projects. So if the person actually worked for ANN, please see this answer, but if they are one of the 67023+ people listed in the encyclopedia, they probably didn't work for us and therefore the previous two answers apply. Okay, I understand, you can't or won't put me in contact with them, but I really want/need to contact this person. Can you offer any suggestions on how to proceed? Depending on who you're trying to contact, they might have a fanclub, official webpage, or e-mail address listed in their encyclopedia entry. If not, try looking for the latest production they worked on and contacting the production company, they might be able and willing to forward your e-mail. Just a note, if you're contacting someone in Japan, it's highly recommended that at least your intro be in Japanese. Even if your intended recipient understands English, the person you ask to forward your e-mail might not. For your benefit, here's a quick intro you can prepend to any e-mail you send to Japan (replaces the blanks by the name of the person you are trying to contact): ご担当者様へ お世話になっております。 本社は____様にご連絡を取りたがっています。お手数ですが、このメールを____様へ転送して頂けないでしょうか? 宜しくお願いします。  Literally: To whom it may concern/the person in charge: Thank you for your time. We are trying to contact _____. If it isn't too much trouble, could you forward this e-mail to ____? Thank you very much.    Can you send me your catalog? We don't have a catalog, we don't sell anything.  Where can I buy Anime ? You can buy it at retail movie stores like Blockbuster and Suncoast as well as specialty Anime Shops. You can also buy it online at websites like Anime Castle, Anime Nation, J List, Roberts Anime Corner Store and The Right Stuf International.  Where can I download anime or watch it online? For the most part, you can't legally download anime online. Fansubs are generally illegal (whether or not they're unethical is a completely different topic), and as such, we can't help you obtain them. You might want to check the sites listed below, and read our news, when there's legal anime to download or watched online we generally mention it.  Don't ask us where to get bootlegs or fansubs, we won't tell you.  Some sites/services that allow you to download or watch anime online legally(may or may not be free):  Amazon Prime crunchyroll Funimation's Website HiDive Apple iTunes hulu Netflix Viz Anime  * Why isn't YouTube listed? Because a lot of the content on YouTube is illegally uploaded. One day we'll have an index of legal anime on YouTube, but until then we aren't listing it as a site where all content is legal/authorized.   How do I watch anime on ANN? ANN has stopped streaming anime episodes. Go to the websites above!  Can you help me with my school assignment No. We get this question about once a week, and we don't really want to spend 25 hours a year answering school questions. The worst part is that most people who e-mail us are actually asking us to provide information they could find with a little bit of research, in other words, they're asking us to do their work for them. On the other hand, if you're working on a master's project or PhD thesis related to anime, that interests us, so we'd probably be more than happy to help.  Does ANN offer Internships? Yes, Anime News Network offers internships in our newsroom and our web-development departments. Further details are available here   What happened to ANN UK? In late May the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into effect. The EU determined that any website targeting European readers would be ""doing business in Europe."" Anime News Network does not disagree with this conclusion. Unfortunately, the GDPR requires all websites doing business in Europe to meet a stringent set of privacy regulations. While ANN supports the intent of these regulations, some of them are extremely difficult to comply with. While it is our intention, for the benefit of all readers our readers around the world, to comply with these new standards, we are not able to do so immediately. Once we are fully compliant with GDPR requirements, we will re-launch ANN UK. In the meantime, ANN's global edition is available to all readers worldwide and is the default version for readers outside of North America, Australia, New Zealand and South East Asia.             bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Misc Page homepage / archives   ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4, 'http://www.theanimenetwork.com/': 1, 'http://www.animecastle.com': 1, 'http://www.animenation.com': 1, 'https://www.jlist.com': 1, 'https://store.yahoo.com/cgi-bin/clink?animecorner+DwdEaM+index.html': 1, 'http://www.rightstuf.com': 1, 'https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=sr_nr_p_n_theme_browse-bin_1?fst=as%3Aoff&rh=n%3A2676882011%2Ck%3Aanime': 1, 'http://www.crunchyroll.com': 1, 'http://www.funimation.com/f_index.cfm?page=videos': 1, 'http://hidive.com': 1, 'https://www.apple.com/itunes/overview/': 1, 'http://www.hulu.com': 1, 'https://netflix.com': 1, 'http://www.vizanime.com': 1}"

Does ANN offer Internships? What happened to ANN UK?    About ANN  What is Anime News Network (ANN)? Anime News Network was created as a news source that focuses on the medium of Japanese Animation(anime) and Japanese Comics (manga). ANN was founded by Justin Sevakis in July of 1998, and has since lead the online anime news medium with a tradition of strong unbiased coverage of major breaking news. With in-depth coverage, analysis and commentary to provide insight into the world of anime and manga, ANN has been and continues to be the #1 English language source for anime and manga news on the Internet. ANN's goal is to make the latest, most comprehensive Anime news available to new fans and veteran Otaku alike.  What ANN is not:  A television network or station; A subsidiary of another company; A dubbing / voice recording studio; An animation company; A licensing or distribution company; A manufacturer or distributor of merchandise; For sale.

For all purposes related to Anime News Network, anime is animation that is primarily produced and conceived in Japan.

ANN is operated by a team of people, under the guidance of Christopher Macdonald, Daniel DeLorme, Zac Bertschy, Egan Loo and Hori Shinsuke. A full list of the staff can be found on the staff page.   Who owns ANN? The website is owned by Anime News Network Inc., a privately owned corporation. The corporation's shareholders include: Christopher Macdonald (Minority owner, controlling shareholder), Hori Shinsuke (Minority owner), Anime Consortium Japan (Minority owner), others.   Where is ANN based? Wow, that question is so 1999! ANN is based everywhere and nowhere. We're based on the Internet! We don't have an office; our staff all work at home and are based around the world with the most full-time staff based in Japan and the United States. Anime News Network, Inc. the corporation that maintains ANN is a Canadian corporation.  Who is the mascot? When the site was first launched in 1998 it featured a blond-haired mascot named Jadress, created by Robin Sevakis. She was eventually replaced by Nina, who was featured in a webcomic (also created by Robin Sevakis) that ran from 2007 to 2013.  How often do you update? The site is run on a daily content format, as opposed to a monthly or bi-monthly magazine format. We update the news and reviews daily, and other content, such as features, columns, and editorials are also added throughout the week. Our encyclopedia is updated daily as well.  Under what settings is ANN best viewed? The site uses a responsive design that should look good at any resolution, from smartphones to large desktop screens.  How do I find older articles on ANN? Links to archives for news, features, columns, reviews, etc. can be found in their respective sections in the menu. You can also use the search engine.  What was used to make the site, as well as maintain it? The site is a combination of older parts in PHP and newer parts in Ruby, with a MySQL database to manage the content. Apart from the phpBB forum, we haven't used any pre-made packages; all the content is managed and presented with custom software.  How do I get permission to reprint an ANN Story, or obtain an ANN graphic or photo? ANN has a newsfeed program where you can get the latest anime news headlines on your very own website. If you wish to entirely reprint anything on your site please contact the editors. For more details about what you can and can not re-print with or without our permission, see our copyright statement.  How many people hear or read an ANN story? We get a bit over 200,000 visits every day. In addition to regular visitors, ANN's news is often sourced in print and occasionally on the airwaves.  How can I get in touch with the staff? Visit our contact page or visit our staff page for further contact and personal information. If a member's e-mail address is not there you can send your comments to the editors and we'll forward them.  Do you attend any public events? Yes. ANN tries to provide coverage to as many anime conventions/festivals/symposiums as our staff can manage. For more details on this see our events section and our events forum.  Do you have a newsfeed? You really should have an RSS newsfeed! Look at our newsfeed section for links to various RSS & Atom feeds as well as our custom newsfeed program. Submitting Content  How should I submit news ? Send an e-mail to [email protected] , this e-mail address is regularly monitored by several staff (someone is always ""on duty""). Other methods (e-mail directly to staff, PM, Forum, Twitter, etc...) are less reliable, and may lead to delays and/or a complete failure to notice your submission.  I have something to say about an online petition. Stop. Virtually every e-petition is a waste of time.   I submitted a news item, why wasn't it posted? We could still be in the process of verifying the details, we may not have been able to verify the items, or perhaps we didn't find it newsworthy enough to post. On a ""slow"" news day we're more likely to post less significant items.  I submitted a news item, why was it credited to someone else? They either submitted it first--or more importantly--submitted more information.  Can I submit news about a non-Japanese animation? No. We're Anime News Network, not ""Animation News Network"", not ""Asian Animation Network."" There's plenty of good animation from around the world, including Korea and China, but we only cover Japanese animation, not French, Mexican, Chinese, African, Korean or Afghanistanimation.  Can I submit a review? / How do I become a reviewer? Anime News Network does not accept unsolicited reviews. Take a quick look at the Staff Openings page, if there is an opening, it will be mentioned there. More often than not, we hire experienced writers who are known to us. Best piece of advice we can give is to make a name for yourself then we'll come to you when the time is right.  Can I submit an article? If you are an experienced writer/journalist with a portfolio you can point to, please E-mail the editors and ask about the topic, we'd be glad to consider your article idea.  Can I have a column? No. Only previous, regular contributors who have shown an ability to consistently write timely, quality articles (or reviews) are permitted to write columns. Try submitting some articles or reviews first.  Information X is missing from the Encyclopedia, can you add it? We can't add it, but YOU can. The Encyclopedia is a user-contributed database; it's made specially so that you can add missing information by yourself. You just need a user account. So please do take the time to register and submit the information you found was missing. Each page contains pointers about how to add information, and if that's not enough you can check the Encyclopedia FAQ or the memoranda.  How can I contribute to the encyclopedia? Any registered user can contribute standard data to the Encyclopedia for Anime, Manga and People. But if that's not enough for you and you're near the top of the contributors list and you'd like to help out with the releases, lexicon, or editing and verifying data submitted by other people, please contact the Encyclopedist.  Please note, that we'll be looking for someone who is inputting quality data, not just large amounts of data.   What if I want to contribute in some other way? We always appreciate whatever help and support that readers can give. If you'd like to help out at ANN in a way other than the ones described above, please contact the editors. There's so much to do at ANN that we're very appreciative of any help offered.   My company is making Anime, can you post a news article about it? Sorry, too many companies are trying to cash in on the popularity of Anime by making cartoons with big eyes and purple hair. We're sure you aren't like that, but... well actually, we aren't sure.  Why doesn't Anime News Network review world manga? Please see our definition of manga. It is Anime News Network's official position, and the personal belief of many of our staff, than there is nothing inheritently superior about Japanese manga when compared to world manga. However Anime News Network's purpose is to cover Japanese animation and comic books. Currently we do not have the resources to review all the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America. If and when we are able to review 100% of the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America, we will then consider expanding our area of review coverage to include manga-style comics (world manga) that originate outside of Japan.  Why didn't you post a news article about my (company's) new Anime or Manga? If your item is picked up in a distribution deal by a company that isn't being run out of someone's garage, then maybe its newsworthy. So when that happens, give us a shout, and we'll consider it, but if you can't tell us what makes your creation manga or anime (other than big eyes, purple hair and the like) you can pretty much forget it.  May I send you my company's product to review? If it's anime or manga-related, then yes. Contact editors[at]animenewsnetwork.com for shipping information.  I'm starting a new webmanga, is it news? No, there are a billion and one ""webmangas"", and most only last a couple of months. Now, if your webmanga gets licensed by a publisher... that might be news.  Can you mention my site? Only if you do something newsworthy, sorry.  Why have we been blacklisted? ANN has a 2-strikes rule regarding inappropriate PR. After 2 strikes for the following reasons we will blacklist your company or PR firm (when we blacklist a PR firm, we notify their relevant clients). i) Completely irrelevant PR that has nothing to do with anime, manga, Japanese pop-culture or any other related content; ii) Unauthorized stealth marketing on our forums; iii) Harassing our staff; iv) Continued PR submissions to inappropriate e-mail address. v) Any attempt to illicitly influence editorial We'll send you a link to this post after your first offense. After your second offense you'll never hear from us again (and our readers will never hear from you or your clients).  Isn't this a bit harsh? Perhaps, but we're tired of getting PRs for toilets, accounting firm management changes and World War 2 museums.   But we offer an opt-out! Clicking that link might opt us out of all your press releases, including your relevant ones. It would be the same as blacklisting you, without giving you the warning. Showing you this warning is actually less harsh than clicking your opt-out.  Forum / Account  I didn't receive my forum registration. If you are using a spam filter, please check your spam folder, some mail servers catch the registration code as spam. Search your spamfolder & inbox for e-mail from [email protected] or [email protected]. If you are using any sort of white list, please make sure that your e-mail account is set up to accept e-mails from [email protected] and [email protected]. If you are using a mail service that bounces the e-mail back to the sender and asks them to confirm that it is not spam, we will not do that. These services usually allow you to add the e-mail address to a white-list before hand. Once you have checked all of the above, you can have the server re-send you your activation code by going here. It should be instant, but sometimes e-mail is slow, give it a couple hours (the slowness is usually not because of our server). If you still don't get your activation code, then and ONLY then, e-mail us at h[email protected] make sure that: 1) Your e-mail is sent from the e-mail address you submitted to ANN; 2) You include your user name; 3) Do not send us your password; 4) The subject of your e-mail must be ""activation code"".   How do I become a moderator? You're invited. When we feel there is a need for a new moderator, we look at our best forum users (the ones that contribute intelligently to conversation and act maturely) and ask them if they'd be willing to help us moderate the forum.  Will there ever be an off topic / general conversation forum among the forums? Not in the public areas, no. We do however maintain a community section for subscribers, and off-topic discussion is permitted there.  Why aren't my posts showing up? Posts from new users sometimes take a while to show up. Please be patient, they should appear within a few hours. Believe it or not, this is a ""feature"" not a ""bug.""  Is there a set of forum rules? Right here - read them if you haven't already.  Help, I've been banned or moderated! Read this.  How do I attach a picture (avatar) to my account? Read this.  Can I change my user name? You can make changes in your user account settings. But because other users depend on your username to recognize you, we have a ""no identity switcheroos"" policy: once you start using the forum we do not allow changes to your username beyond punctuation and capitalization.  Can I delete my account? Yes, you can. Go to your account settings page and you will be able to delete your account from there. Contests  Can I enter give-aways more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No.  Can I enter creative contests more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, Yes.  Does ANN ""own"" my entry? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No. But as a condition of your entry we generaly require you to give us the unrevocable right to display your entry on Anime News Network for all eternity.  Can I display my entry elsewhere? Yes, anywhere you please, unless otherwise stated in the contest rules.  Why do I have to put your logo and/or the sponsor's logo on my submission There are two reasons for this. First, it adds some extra benefit to the contest sponsors and second, it helps us insure that you made the entry for the contest, instead of just grabing some existing art and submiting it.  Explain those rules about where I live and whether or not I can enter and if you will ship me a prize. Most of our contest are open to anyone, regardless of where you live, because we don't believe in geographic discrimination. However sometimes our sponsors want a contest to only be open to their potential clients, so in those cases we have no choice to abide by their request to limit contest entry to a certain geographic area. While we don't believe in geographic discrimination, we also don't believe in spending a fortune on shipping and trying to figure out custom laws in order to get you your prize so that's why we only ship to the USA and Canada.   What does a complete mailing address look like? Short answer: ""It's what we need to put on a package to mail it to you."" It looks something like this:  416 William St. #402 Moralton, SS 70707 USA 24 Sussex Dr Ottawa, ON  K1A 0A3 Canada 1000 J.P. Laurel St. San Miguel 1005, Manila  Philippines   You'd be amazed at how many people enter our contests and leave out critical mailing information like their city, province/state and or postal/zip code. You'd also be amazed at how many people ask us ""What do you mean by complete mailing address?"" In fact, if you're reading this, it's quite possible that we referred you here because you asked that very question. Since we usually only ship to the USA and Canada, we won't disqualify you for leaving out the country, but if anything else is missing, we'll just pick another winner to replace you. We will not contact you to verify your mailing address. BTW, your name is not part of your mailing address, but we won't disqualify you for putting it in there...  Why do some contests not ship to PO Boxes? ANN usually doesn't handle shipping for our contest prizes. Shipping is done by the contest sponsor. If the contest states ""no PO boxes"" this is because our sponsor requested it. Most likely it is because they are shipping via a courier like UPS, which will not ship to PO boxes.  I'd really prefer it if you didn't post my name & city if I win This is done for legal reasons, sorry. That said, if you want to enter with an alias, that's fine as long as you are certain the package will reach you (we can't guarantee it will).  Why did you stop accepting art contest entries from Facebook By default, Facebook posts usually aren't public. Most people who submit Facebook URLs to our art contests forget to share their entries publicly, and we are often forced to disqualify these entries. It's better to just avoid the problem altogether. If you want to enter with Facebook, and you remember to make your entry public go ahead, we'll accept it. But if you forget to share it properly, we will simply ignore your entry.   Miscellaneous   Can I link to you? Yes, please feel free. Currently we don't have any banners to offer you for this, we'll be making some new ones shortly.  Can you link to me? No. We are not a link exchange site.  Wait, I can link to you, but you won't link to me?? Yes, we know it sounds a little conceited of us, but that's how it is. To be fair, we don't expect you to link to us, but we're honored if you do decide that you'd like to link to our site despite the fact that we won't be returning the favor. Please don't link to us if you're only doing it because you hope to get something in return; link to us because you feel that you want more people to know about Anime News Network.   Can we trade banners? Sorry, ANN relies on its banners to survive. We very seldom trade banners with another website or publication. If your publication is in print (10 000+ circulation) or a website with 10 million+ impressions per month, we may consider it. Please understand, ANN receives this question at least once a week, it isn't possible for us to even consider swapping / affiliating with so many sites, so we generally don't swap / affiliate with any.  Can you affiliate with us? Anime News Network would be happy to setup an affiliate program with any online store that pays referral fees provided that store meets certain pre-requisites. Anime News Network is unfortunately unable to affiliate itself with fan-sites much for the same reason that we can not link to you or trade banners with you (see above two entries).  Why'd you give this show a rating of ... in your review? Clearly it deserved a ... ! Obviously our reviewer disagrees.  When is title X coming out, how many episodes is it, and/or who is releasing it? Look it up in the encyclopedia, ask Answerman, or ask in the forum.  Why'd you make X change to the programming on [Cartoon Network, YTV, etc]? Uhh, try contacting the broadcaster, network or station. We're a news site and we have no more control over the schedule at [TV Station] than any other media source. Yes, believe it or not we get this question every so often.  I'd like to license, work on, be involved with, etc... one of your titles Just like we aren't involved in TV broadcasting, we are not licensors. Even for shows that we stream on ANN, we are not authorized to sub-license them to other companies. Contact the producers or the licensors, not us.  I'd like permission to do something with one of your titles Sorry, we do not control copyright permissions for any anime or manga. If you need permission to do something, contact the local licensee / master licensor; or failing that, contact the master licensor in Japan. A bit of advice though, for personal, non commercial projects, don't bother contacting them unless you absolutely need permission. They don't care if you make a 1-off t-shirt to wear to school, but if you ask them, they'll probably say ""No,"" as a matter of policy. Sorry we can not help you get in contact with a rights holder.  Why'd you take my video show off YouTube? We get this question a lot. We didn't take your video down. See the above answer as well as the first one. ANN has no involvement in the process of taking pirated materials off of websites like YouTube. For your information, the material was probably taken down because it was uploaded without permission (therefore illegally) and the licensors want you to watch it somewhere they will make money (on DVD, on TV, or on an authorized website). Go here for a list of places where you can legally watch anime and support the creators at the same time.  On a related note, allow us to point out that your video was probably automatically removed by a technology called video-fingerprinting. By this semi-automated process, YouTube removes videos that it believes infringe on copyrights without waiting for complaints from copyright holders. So it's quite possible that no anime company was involved in the removal of your video.   Sadly, this process can affect videos that are legitimate ""fair-use."" Even more sadly, the employees at the anime companies are too busy to bother reading all the e-mails they get about videos (the vast majority of are from morons that don't understand that ""I wasn't making money"" doesn't make it okay) so you can e-mail them to your hearts content, but they probably won't answer (not because they're fan-hating assholes, but because they don't have the time).    If you believe your video is legitimate fair-use (full episodes are never fair use, significant episode clips are rarely fair use, AMVs are almost never fair use of the music) try posting it again and include in the description why you feel it is fair use. If you're lucky, YouTube will take this into consideration (some videos are deleted automatically, others are looked at by a human employee at YouTube after the fingerprinting process identifies them) and not delete your video. You really should read up on ""fair use"" before you make any claims that your video is fair use though. And by ""read-up,"" we mean read professional, expert explanations, not your friend's blog.   I have a great idea for an anime or manga, where do I submit it? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not involved with the creation process of any anime or manga and we can not put you in contact with creators (more on that here). Finally, we'd recommend you read this and this.  How do I get your television channel? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not The Anime Network (TAN). For details on TAN, read the transcript of our chat with them, read our TAN news coverage, or visit their website.  Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? No. As a policy, ANN never gives out contact information. Don't send us this question unless you've exhausted every other resource available (phone book, 411, Google, their website, etc...), even then, we will only forward your request to them, and we will only do so provided it is a business-to-business request being made by a company we've actually heard of. If you can't find Hayao Miyazaki's e-mail address online, it's probably because he doesn't want to receive a thousand e-mails a day. The one exception to this rule is that we will give out the Public Relations / Press Relations (PR) contact information for a company provided we have it readily available. Generally you can find this information on your own though, so please don't be lazy. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? I'm an old acquaintance of theirs. The answer is still no. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? They worked on one of your projects. Just to be clear, our encyclopedia carries information about a myriad of projects (anime,manga, etc...) most of which (99.9%) Anime News Network is not, and never was, involved with. It is not a list of our projects. So if the person actually worked for ANN, please see this answer, but if they are one of the 67023+ people listed in the encyclopedia, they probably didn't work for us and therefore the previous two answers apply. Okay, I understand, you can't or won't put me in contact with them, but I really want/need to contact this person. Can you offer any suggestions on how to proceed? Depending on who you're trying to contact, they might have a fanclub, official webpage, or e-mail address listed in their encyclopedia entry. If not, try looking for the latest production they worked on and contacting the production company, they might be able and willing to forward your e-mail. Just a note, if you're contacting someone in Japan, it's highly recommended that at least your intro be in Japanese. Even if your intended recipient understands English, the person you ask to forward your e-mail might not. For your benefit, here's a quick intro you can prepend to any e-mail you send to Japan (replaces the blanks by the name of the person you are trying to contact): ご担当者様へ お世話になっております。 本社は____様にご連絡を取りたがっています。お手数ですが、このメールを____様へ転送して頂けないでしょうか? 宜しくお願いします。  Literally: To whom it may concern/the person in charge: Thank you for your time. We are trying to contact _____. If it isn't too much trouble, could you forward this e-mail to ____? Thank you very much.    Can you send me your catalog? We don't have a catalog, we don't sell anything.  Where can I buy Anime ? You can buy it at retail movie stores like Blockbuster and Suncoast as well as specialty Anime Shops. You can also buy it online at websites like Anime Castle, Anime Nation, J List, Roberts Anime Corner Store and The Right Stuf International.  Where can I download anime or watch it online? For the most part, you can't legally download anime online. Fansubs are generally illegal (whether or not they're unethical is a completely different topic), and as such, we can't help you obtain them. You might want to check the sites listed below, and read our news, when there's legal anime to download or watched online we generally mention it.  Don't ask us where to get bootlegs or fansubs, we won't tell you.  Some sites/services that allow you to download or watch anime online legally(may or may not be free):  Amazon Prime crunchyroll Funimation's Website HiDive Apple iTunes hulu Netflix Viz Anime  * Why isn't YouTube listed? Because a lot of the content on YouTube is illegally uploaded. One day we'll have an index of legal anime on YouTube, but until then we aren't listing it as a site where all content is legal/authorized.   How do I watch anime on ANN? ANN has stopped streaming anime episodes. Go to the websites above!  Can you help me with my school assignment No. We get this question about once a week, and we don't really want to spend 25 hours a year answering school questions. The worst part is that most people who e-mail us are actually asking us to provide information they could find with a little bit of research, in other words, they're asking us to do their work for them. On the other hand, if you're working on a master's project or PhD thesis related to anime, that interests us, so we'd probably be more than happy to help.  Does ANN offer Internships? Yes, Anime News Network offers internships in our newsroom and our web-development departments. Further details are available here   What happened to ANN UK? In late May the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into effect. The EU determined that any website targeting European readers would be ""doing business in Europe."" Anime News Network does not disagree with this conclusion. Unfortunately, the GDPR requires all websites doing business in Europe to meet a stringent set of privacy regulations. While ANN supports the intent of these regulations, some of them are extremely difficult to comply with. While it is our intention, for the benefit of all readers our readers around the world, to comply with these new standards, we are not able to do so immediately. Once we are fully compliant with GDPR requirements, we will re-launch ANN UK. In the meantime, ANN's global edition is available to all readers worldwide and is the default version for readers outside of North America, Australia, New Zealand and South East Asia.

Anime News Network was created as a news source that focuses on the medium of Japanese Animation(anime) and Japanese Comics (manga). ANN was founded by Justin Sevakis in July of 1998, and has since lead the online anime news medium with a tradition of strong unbiased coverage of major breaking news. With in-depth coverage, analysis and commentary to provide insight into the world of anime and manga, ANN has been and continues to be the #1 English language source for anime and manga news on the Internet.

Who owns ANN? The website is owned by Anime News Network Inc., a privately owned corporation. The corporation's shareholders include: Christopher Macdonald (Minority owner, controlling shareholder), Hori Shinsuke (Minority owner), Anime Consortium Japan (Minority owner), others.   Where is ANN based? Wow, that question is so 1999! ANN is based everywhere and nowhere. We're based on the Internet! We don't have an office; our staff all work at home and are based around the world with the most full-time staff based in Japan and the United States. Anime News Network, Inc. the corporation that maintains ANN is a Canadian corporation.  Who is the mascot? When the site was first launched in 1998 it featured a blond-haired mascot named Jadress, created by Robin Sevakis. She was eventually replaced by Nina, who was featured in a webcomic (also created by Robin Sevakis) that ran from 2007 to 2013.  How often do you update? The site is run on a daily content format, as opposed to a monthly or bi-monthly magazine format. We update the news and reviews daily, and other content, such as features, columns, and editorials are also added throughout the week. Our encyclopedia is updated daily as well.  Under what settings is ANN best viewed? The site uses a responsive design that should look good at any resolution, from smartphones to large desktop screens.  How do I find older articles on ANN?

Apart from the phpBB forum, we haven't used any pre-made packages; all the content is managed and presented with custom software.  How do I get permission to reprint an ANN Story, or obtain an ANN graphic or photo? ANN has a newsfeed program where you can get the latest anime news headlines on your very own website. If you wish to entirely reprint anything on your site please contact the editors. For more details about what you can and can not re-print with or without our permission, see our copyright statement.  How many people hear or read an ANN story? We get a bit over 200,000 visits every day. In addition to regular visitors, ANN's news is often sourced in print and occasionally on the airwaves.  How can I get in touch with the staff?

If a member's e-mail address is not there you can send your comments to the editors and we'll forward them.  Do you attend any public events? Yes. ANN tries to provide coverage to as many anime conventions/festivals/symposiums as our staff can manage. For more details on this see our events section and our events forum.  Do you have a newsfeed? You really should have an RSS newsfeed! Look at our newsfeed section for links to various RSS & Atom feeds as well as our custom newsfeed program. Submitting Content  How should I submit news ? Send an e-mail to [email protected] , this e-mail address is regularly monitored by several staff (someone is always ""on duty""). Other methods (e-mail directly to staff, PM, Forum, Twitter, etc...) are less reliable, and may lead to delays and/or a complete failure to notice your submission.  I have something to say about an online petition. Stop. Virtually every e-petition is a waste of time.   I submitted a news item, why wasn't it posted? We could still be in the process of verifying the details, we may not have been able to verify the items, or perhaps we didn't find it newsworthy enough to post. On a ""slow"" news day we're more likely to post less significant items.  I submitted a news item, why was it credited to someone else? They either submitted it first--or more importantly--submitted more information.  Can I submit news about a non-Japanese animation? No. We're Anime News Network, not ""Animation News Network"", not ""Asian Animation Network."" There's plenty of good animation from around the world, including Korea and China, but we only cover Japanese animation, not French, Mexican, Chinese, African, Korean or Afghanistanimation.  Can I submit a review? / How do I become a reviewer? Anime News Network does not accept unsolicited reviews. Take a quick look at the Staff Openings page, if there is an opening, it will be mentioned there. More often than not, we hire experienced writers who are known to us. Best piece of advice we can give is to make a name for yourself then we'll come to you when the time is right.  Can I submit an article? If you are an experienced writer/journalist with a portfolio you can point to, please E-mail the editors and ask about the topic, we'd be glad to consider your article idea.  Can I have a column? No. Only previous, regular contributors who have shown an ability to consistently write timely, quality articles (or reviews) are permitted to write columns. Try submitting some articles or reviews first.  Information X is missing from the Encyclopedia, can you add it? We can't add it, but YOU can. The Encyclopedia is a user-contributed database; it's made specially so that you can add missing information by yourself. You just need a user account. So please do take the time to register and submit the information you found was missing. Each page contains pointers about how to add information, and if that's not enough you can check the Encyclopedia FAQ or the memoranda.  How can I contribute to the encyclopedia? Any registered user can contribute standard data to the Encyclopedia for Anime, Manga and People. But if that's not enough for you and you're near the top of the contributors list and you'd like to help out with the releases, lexicon, or editing and verifying data submitted by other people, please contact the Encyclopedist.  Please note, that we'll be looking for someone who is inputting quality data, not just large amounts of data.   What if I want to contribute in some other way? We always appreciate whatever help and support that readers can give. If you'd like to help out at ANN in a way other than the ones described above, please contact the editors. There's so much to do at ANN that we're very appreciative of any help offered.   My company is making Anime, can you post a news article about it? Sorry, too many companies are trying to cash in on the popularity of Anime by making cartoons with big eyes and purple hair. We're sure you aren't like that, but... well actually, we aren't sure.  Why doesn't Anime News Network review world manga? Please see our definition of manga. It is Anime News Network's official position, and the personal belief of many of our staff, than there is nothing inheritently superior about Japanese manga when compared to world manga. However Anime News Network's purpose is to cover Japanese animation and comic books. Currently we do not have the resources to review all the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America. If and when we are able to review 100% of the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America, we will then consider expanding our area of review coverage to include manga-style comics (world manga) that originate outside of Japan.  Why didn't you post a news article about my (company's) new Anime or Manga? If your item is picked up in a distribution deal by a company that isn't being run out of someone's garage, then maybe its newsworthy. So when that happens, give us a shout, and we'll consider it, but if you can't tell us what makes your creation manga or anime (other than big eyes, purple hair and the like) you can pretty much forget it.  May I send you my company's product to review? If it's anime or manga-related, then yes. Contact editors[at]animenewsnetwork.com for shipping information.  I'm starting a new webmanga, is it news? No, there are a billion and one ""webmangas"", and most only last a couple of months. Now, if your webmanga gets licensed by a publisher... that might be news.  Can you mention my site? Only if you do something newsworthy, sorry.  Why have we been blacklisted? ANN has a 2-strikes rule regarding inappropriate PR. After 2 strikes for the following reasons we will blacklist your company or PR firm (when we blacklist a PR firm, we notify their relevant clients). i) Completely irrelevant PR that has nothing to do with anime, manga, Japanese pop-culture or any other related content; ii) Unauthorized stealth marketing on our forums; iii) Harassing our staff; iv) Continued PR submissions to inappropriate e-mail address. v) Any attempt to illicitly influence editorial We'll send you a link to this post after your first offense. After your second offense you'll never hear from us again (and our readers will never hear from you or your clients).  Isn't this a bit harsh? Perhaps, but we're tired of getting PRs for toilets, accounting firm management changes and World War 2 museums.   But we offer an opt-out! Clicking that link might opt us out of all your press releases, including your relevant ones. It would be the same as blacklisting you, without giving you the warning. Showing you this warning is actually less harsh than clicking your opt-out.  Forum / Account  I didn't receive my forum registration. If you are using a spam filter, please check your spam folder, some mail servers catch the registration code as spam. Search your spamfolder & inbox for e-mail from [email protected] or [email protected]. If you are using any sort of white list, please make sure that your e-mail account is set up to accept e-mails from [email protected] and [email protected]. If you are using a mail service that bounces the e-mail back to the sender and asks them to confirm that it is not spam, we will not do that. These services usually allow you to add the e-mail address to a white-list before hand. Once you have checked all of the above, you can have the server re-send you your activation code by going here. It should be instant, but sometimes e-mail is slow, give it a couple hours (the slowness is usually not because of our server). If you still don't get your activation code, then and ONLY then, e-mail us at h[email protected] make sure that: 1) Your e-mail is sent from the e-mail address you submitted to ANN; 2) You include your user name; 3) Do not send us your password; 4) The subject of your e-mail must be ""activation code"".   How do I become a moderator? You're invited. When we feel there is a need for a new moderator, we look at our best forum users (the ones that contribute intelligently to conversation and act maturely) and ask them if they'd be willing to help us moderate the forum.  Will there ever be an off topic / general conversation forum among the forums? Not in the public areas, no. We do however maintain a community section for subscribers, and off-topic discussion is permitted there.  Why aren't my posts showing up? Posts from new users sometimes take a while to show up. Please be patient, they should appear within a few hours. Believe it or not, this is a ""feature"" not a ""bug.""  Is there a set of forum rules? Right here - read them if you haven't already.  Help, I've been banned or moderated! Read this.  How do I attach a picture (avatar) to my account? Read this.  Can I change my user name? You can make changes in your user account settings. But because other users depend on your username to recognize you, we have a ""no identity switcheroos"" policy: once you start using the forum we do not allow changes to your username beyond punctuation and capitalization.  Can I delete my account? Yes, you can. Go to your account settings page and you will be able to delete your account from there. Contests  Can I enter give-aways more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No.  Can I enter creative contests more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, Yes.  Does ANN ""own"" my entry? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No. But as a condition of your entry we generaly require you to give us the unrevocable right to display your entry on Anime News Network for all eternity.  Can I display my entry elsewhere? Yes, anywhere you please, unless otherwise stated in the contest rules.  Why do I have to put your logo and/or the sponsor's logo on my submission There are two reasons for this. First, it adds some extra benefit to the contest sponsors and second, it helps us insure that you made the entry for the contest, instead of just grabing some existing art and submiting it.  Explain those rules about where I live and whether or not I can enter and if you will ship me a prize. Most of our contest are open to anyone, regardless of where you live, because we don't believe in geographic discrimination. However sometimes our sponsors want a contest to only be open to their potential clients, so in those cases we have no choice to abide by their request to limit contest entry to a certain geographic area. While we don't believe in geographic discrimination, we also don't believe in spending a fortune on shipping and trying to figure out custom laws in order to get you your prize so that's why we only ship to the USA and Canada.   What does a complete mailing address look like? Short answer: ""It's what we need to put on a package to mail it to you."" It looks something like this:  416 William St. #402 Moralton, SS 70707 USA 24 Sussex Dr Ottawa, ON  K1A 0A3 Canada 1000 J.P. Laurel St. San Miguel 1005, Manila  Philippines   You'd be amazed at how many people enter our contests and leave out critical mailing information like their city, province/state and or postal/zip code. You'd also be amazed at how many people ask us ""What do you mean by complete mailing address?"" In fact, if you're reading this, it's quite possible that we referred you here because you asked that very question. Since we usually only ship to the USA and Canada, we won't disqualify you for leaving out the country, but if anything else is missing, we'll just pick another winner to replace you. We will not contact you to verify your mailing address. BTW, your name is not part of your mailing address, but we won't disqualify you for putting it in there...  Why do some contests not ship to PO Boxes? ANN usually doesn't handle shipping for our contest prizes. Shipping is done by the contest sponsor. If the contest states ""no PO boxes"" this is because our sponsor requested it. Most likely it is because they are shipping via a courier like UPS, which will not ship to PO boxes.  I'd really prefer it if you didn't post my name & city if I win This is done for legal reasons, sorry. That said, if you want to enter with an alias, that's fine as long as you are certain the package will reach you (we can't guarantee it will).  Why did you stop accepting art contest entries from Facebook By default, Facebook posts usually aren't public. Most people who submit Facebook URLs to our art contests forget to share their entries publicly, and we are often forced to disqualify these entries. It's better to just avoid the problem altogether. If you want to enter with Facebook, and you remember to make your entry public go ahead, we'll accept it. But if you forget to share it properly, we will simply ignore your entry.   Miscellaneous   Can I link to you? Yes, please feel free. Currently we don't have any banners to offer you for this, we'll be making some new ones shortly.  Can you link to me? No. We are not a link exchange site.  Wait, I can link to you, but you won't link to me?? Yes, we know it sounds a little conceited of us, but that's how it is. To be fair, we don't expect you to link to us, but we're honored if you do decide that you'd like to link to our site despite the fact that we won't be returning the favor. Please don't link to us if you're only doing it because you hope to get something in return; link to us because you feel that you want more people to know about Anime News Network.   Can we trade banners? Sorry, ANN relies on its banners to survive. We very seldom trade banners with another website or publication. If your publication is in print (10 000+ circulation) or a website with 10 million+ impressions per month, we may consider it. Please understand, ANN receives this question at least once a week, it isn't possible for us to even consider swapping / affiliating with so many sites, so we generally don't swap / affiliate with any.  Can you affiliate with us? Anime News Network would be happy to setup an affiliate program with any online store that pays referral fees provided that store meets certain pre-requisites. Anime News Network is unfortunately unable to affiliate itself with fan-sites much for the same reason that we can not link to you or trade banners with you (see above two entries).  Why'd you give this show a rating of ... in your review? Clearly it deserved a ... ! Obviously our reviewer disagrees.  When is title X coming out, how many episodes is it, and/or who is releasing it? Look it up in the encyclopedia, ask Answerman, or ask in the forum.  Why'd you make X change to the programming on [Cartoon Network, YTV, etc]? Uhh, try contacting the broadcaster, network or station. We're a news site and we have no more control over the schedule at [TV Station] than any other media source. Yes, believe it or not we get this question every so often.  I'd like to license, work on, be involved with, etc... one of your titles Just like we aren't involved in TV broadcasting, we are not licensors. Even for shows that we stream on ANN, we are not authorized to sub-license them to other companies. Contact the producers or the licensors, not us.  I'd like permission to do something with one of your titles Sorry, we do not control copyright permissions for any anime or manga. If you need permission to do something, contact the local licensee / master licensor; or failing that, contact the master licensor in Japan. A bit of advice though, for personal, non commercial projects, don't bother contacting them unless you absolutely need permission. They don't care if you make a 1-off t-shirt to wear to school, but if you ask them, they'll probably say ""No,"" as a matter of policy. Sorry we can not help you get in contact with a rights holder.  Why'd you take my video show off YouTube? We get this question a lot. We didn't take your video down. See the above answer as well as the first one. ANN has no involvement in the process of taking pirated materials off of websites like YouTube. For your information, the material was probably taken down because it was uploaded without permission (therefore illegally) and the licensors want you to watch it somewhere they will make money (on DVD, on TV, or on an authorized website). Go here for a list of places where you can legally watch anime and support the creators at the same time.  On a related note, allow us to point out that your video was probably automatically removed by a technology called video-fingerprinting. By this semi-automated process, YouTube removes videos that it believes infringe on copyrights without waiting for complaints from copyright holders. So it's quite possible that no anime company was involved in the removal of your video.   Sadly, this process can affect videos that are legitimate ""fair-use."" Even more sadly, the employees at the anime companies are too busy to bother reading all the e-mails they get about videos (the vast majority of are from morons that don't understand that ""I wasn't making money"" doesn't make it okay) so you can e-mail them to your hearts content, but they probably won't answer (not because they're fan-hating assholes, but because they don't have the time).    If you believe your video is legitimate fair-use (full episodes are never fair use, significant episode clips are rarely fair use, AMVs are almost never fair use of the music) try posting it again and include in the description why you feel it is fair use. If you're lucky, YouTube will take this into consideration (some videos are deleted automatically, others are looked at by a human employee at YouTube after the fingerprinting process identifies them) and not delete your video. You really should read up on ""fair use"" before you make any claims that your video is fair use though. And by ""read-up,"" we mean read professional, expert explanations, not your friend's blog.   I have a great idea for an anime or manga, where do I submit it? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not involved with the creation process of any anime or manga and we can not put you in contact with creators (more on that here). Finally, we'd recommend you read this and this.  How do I get your television channel? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not The Anime Network (TAN). For details on TAN, read the transcript of our chat with them, read our TAN news coverage, or visit their website.  Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? No. As a policy, ANN never gives out contact information. Don't send us this question unless you've exhausted every other resource available (phone book, 411, Google, their website, etc...), even then, we will only forward your request to them, and we will only do so provided it is a business-to-business request being made by a company we've actually heard of. If you can't find Hayao Miyazaki's e-mail address online, it's probably because he doesn't want to receive a thousand e-mails a day. The one exception to this rule is that we will give out the Public Relations / Press Relations (PR) contact information for a company provided we have it readily available. Generally you can find this information on your own though, so please don't be lazy. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? I'm an old acquaintance of theirs. The answer is still no. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? They worked on one of your projects. Just to be clear, our encyclopedia carries information about a myriad of projects (anime,manga, etc...) most of which (99.9%) Anime News Network is not, and never was, involved with. It is not a list of our projects. So if the person actually worked for ANN, please see this answer, but if they are one of the 67023+ people listed in the encyclopedia, they probably didn't work for us and therefore the previous two answers apply. Okay, I understand, you can't or won't put me in contact with them, but I really want/need to contact this person. Can you offer any suggestions on how to proceed? Depending on who you're trying to contact, they might have a fanclub, official webpage, or e-mail address listed in their encyclopedia entry. If not, try looking for the latest production they worked on and contacting the production company, they might be able and willing to forward your e-mail. Just a note, if you're contacting someone in Japan, it's highly recommended that at least your intro be in Japanese. Even if your intended recipient understands English, the person you ask to forward your e-mail might not. For your benefit, here's a quick intro you can prepend to any e-mail you send to Japan (replaces the blanks by the name of the person you are trying to contact): ご担当者様へ お世話になっております。 本社は____様にご連絡を取りたがっています。お手数ですが、このメールを____様へ転送して頂けないでしょうか? 宜しくお願いします。  Literally: To whom it may concern/the person in charge: Thank you for your time. We are trying to contact _____. If it isn't too much trouble, could you forward this e-mail to ____? Thank you very much.    Can you send me your catalog? We don't have a catalog, we don't sell anything.  Where can I buy Anime ? You can buy it at retail movie stores like Blockbuster and Suncoast as well as specialty Anime Shops. You can also buy it online at websites like Anime Castle, Anime Nation, J List, Roberts Anime Corner Store and The Right Stuf International.  Where can I download anime or watch it online? For the most part, you can't legally download anime online. Fansubs are generally illegal (whether or not they're unethical is a completely different topic), and as such, we can't help you obtain them. You might want to check the sites listed below, and read our news, when there's legal anime to download or watched online we generally mention it.  Don't ask us where to get bootlegs or fansubs, we won't tell you.  Some sites/services that allow you to download or watch anime online legally(may or may not be free):  Amazon Prime crunchyroll Funimation's Website HiDive Apple iTunes hulu Netflix Viz Anime  * Why isn't YouTube listed? Because a lot of the content on YouTube is illegally uploaded. One day we'll have an index of legal anime on YouTube, but until then we aren't listing it as a site where all content is legal/authorized.   How do I watch anime on ANN? ANN has stopped streaming anime episodes. Go to the websites above!  Can you help me with my school assignment No. We get this question about once a week, and we don't really want to spend 25 hours a year answering school questions. The worst part is that most people who e-mail us are actually asking us to provide information they could find with a little bit of research, in other words, they're asking us to do their work for them. On the other hand, if you're working on a master's project or PhD thesis related to anime, that interests us, so we'd probably be more than happy to help.  Does ANN offer Internships? Yes, Anime News Network offers internships in our newsroom and our web-development departments. Further details are available here   What happened to ANN UK? In late May the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into effect. The EU determined that any website targeting European readers would be ""doing business in Europe."" Anime News Network does not disagree with this conclusion. Unfortunately, the GDPR requires all websites doing business in Europe to meet a stringent set of privacy regulations. While ANN supports the intent of these regulations, some of them are extremely difficult to comply with. While it is our intention, for the benefit of all readers our readers around the world, to comply with these new standards, we are not able to do so immediately. Once we are fully compliant with GDPR requirements, we will re-launch ANN UK. In the meantime, ANN's global edition is available to all readers worldwide and is the default version for readers outside of North America, Australia, New Zealand and South East Asia.

While I'm an avid otome isekai reader I'm actually most excited about a later print release of Omniscient Reader!   Villains are Destined to Die is a very cool and flashy title, but it uses tropes I have become tired of (maids abusing their master, kinda weird about slavery, etc.). Its artwork is really gorgeous tho so I might just buy a print to admire the art.  I like My gently raised Beast but I don't know if I would buy all volumes of it. I think reading it on webtoon is enough for me.  And Remarried Empress... I did like the romance in it but boy did I get bothered by how a certain female character was written and treated in it. The longer I stayed away from the story the more it annoyed me.    My personal favorites in this loose genre are Lady Evony, Fantasie of a Stepmother, Kill the Villainess, Your Throne, and Surviving Romance. It would make me super happy if one of those got a print release someday!

While I'm an avid otome isekai reader I'm actually most excited about a later print release of Omniscient Reader!   Villains are Destined to Die is a very cool and flashy title, but it uses tropes I have become tired of (maids abusing their master, kinda weird about slavery, etc.). Its artwork is really gorgeous tho so I might just buy a print to admire the art.  I like My gently raised Beast but I don't know if I would buy all volumes of it. I think reading it on webtoon is enough for me.  And Remarried Empress... I did like the romance in it but boy did I get bothered by how a certain female character was written and treated in it. The longer I stayed away from the story the more it annoyed me.    My personal favorites in this loose genre are Lady Evony, Fantasie of a Stepmother, Kill the Villainess, Your Throne, and Surviving Romance. It would make me super happy if one of those got a print release someday!

While I'm an avid otome isekai reader I'm actually most excited about a later print release of Omniscient Reader!   Villains are Destined to Die is a very cool and flashy title, but it uses tropes I have become tired of (maids abusing their master, kinda weird about slavery, etc.). Its artwork is really gorgeous tho so I might just buy a print to admire the art.  I like My gently raised Beast but I don't know if I would buy all volumes of it. I think reading it on webtoon is enough for me.  And Remarried Empress... I did like the romance in it but boy did I get bothered by how a certain female character was written and treated in it. The longer I stayed away from the story the more it annoyed me.    My personal favorites in this loose genre are Lady Evony, Fantasie of a Stepmother, Kill the Villainess, Your Throne, and Surviving Romance. It would make me super happy if one of those got a print release someday!

Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.2              What is this?   General of the Three Kingdoms, Kongming, had struggled his whole life, facing countless battles that made him into the accomplished strategist he was. So on his deathbed, he wished only to be reborn into a peaceful world... and was sent straight to modern-day party-central, Tokyo. The brilliant strategist Kongming will have to adapt to the wild beats and even wilder party people of the modern age.    Ya Boy Kongming! is based on Yuto Yotsuba and Ryō Ogawa's manga and streams on HIDIVE on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                For a second, I was tempted to call the premise of this one old hat – yoinking a historic figure from the past and tossing them into the present day has been a go-to premise for comedy movies for ages. But there really haven't been too many of those in anime the last few years, since the current obsession is taking a boring-ass dude from our world and tossing him to a theoretically more interesting setting to get his stank all over that place. So in a way this time transplant comedy has some novelty on its side, but it definitely needed more than that to sell itself. Thankfully, as of this first episode it's more than managed to surprise me.    For one, I'm shocked how little the series relies on the rote jokes that come with this territory. You of course have the requisite scenes of Kongming learning about smartphones and modern culture, but those moments are sped through in under a minute, and seemingly every character just rolls with him either being a time traveler or a weird LARPer without much fuss. Not only does that keep this introduction feeling less predictable, it allows more time for the story to dig into sentiment alongside its goofy time-hopping setup. For all that this is a chance for nerdy history references, they take the time to give both Kongming and Eiko likable personalities and moments of emotional sincerity that seriously gripped me.    I was also surprised at how relatively in-depth the show gets with its central musical hook. I'm used to musical anime being idol shows that rarely dip their toes into the actual mechanics of music or the larger world of genres outside of marketable pop ballads. But Ya Boy Kongming! shows a lot of knowledge about music as a whole, from Eiko having a phone filled with EDM and Hip-Hop to discussing how the club she works at plays tracks with different BPM depending on the time of night and how many people are around. Eiko's music is pretty, if not particularly memorable, but the detail and attention being paid here makes me hopeful that the story can use music as more than just a marketing gimmick.    It's also just really well produced so far. The standout scenes are Eiko's first stage appearance and, later, her practice session in her apartment. Both are short but gorgeous sequences of character acting, and do a lot to sell you on why Kongming would suddenly devote himself to becoming her “tactician” to support her career. Really, the entire premiere just looks rock solid – great use of color, strong character designs that are distinct but all gel together effortlessly, and an altogether pleasant aesthetic to lean on. Put together it makes for a much stronger premiere than you might expect, and I'll definitely be staying for another performance.       Rebeccca Silverman  Rating:                Would I have been as thrilled with this episode if I hadn't already read the source manga? I'd like to think so, because even without the knowledge of where this is heading, Ya Boy Kongming!'s first episode is a delightful combination of pathos and humor. It's also a sort of reverse-isekai – our protagonist is in fact the Kongming from the Three Kingdoms period of Chinese history, and after his death from old age in 234 C. E., he wakes up 1,800 years later, young once again, in what he presumes to be Hell. It's basically Mayaya from Princess Jellyfish's dream anime. But a series needs more than just a good premise and a catchy title to work, and in that respect this episode delivers: rather than going with a plain old fish-out-of-water story, Ya Boy Kongming! instead focuses on Kongming finding a new purpose in his life and embracing his rebirth wholeheartedly, and that's a large part of what sells this premier.    It helps that Kongming's new liege is Eiko, an aspiring singer. Despite a lovely singing voice (provided by 96 Neko), success has been elusive to the point where she very nearly committed suicide at one point. It's Eiko's song that snaps Kongming out of his confusion upon first arriving in “Hell” (Shibuya on Halloween), and when they meet again the next day, he's wholeheartedly ready to back Eiko's career. Does it matter that he doesn't know anything about the 21st century's music scene? Not in the slightest; the episode does a very good job of showing us just how quickly he picks things up without actually stopping to say, “Hey, this guy picks up new skills really fast” in a beautiful display of showing versus telling. (His pride that he's got his own Wiki is pretty funny.) Since he's been brought to the world without war that he wished for, what better use of his prodigious intellect and tactical knowledge than to back the girl who saved him and is in need of a helping hand herself?    There's something really heartwarming about Kongming's and Eiko's relationship, even if she is totally thrown by him roughly every three minutes, and it helps that the episode doesn't skimp on the animation or the music – not counting the ending theme, we hear Eiko sing three separate songs, which is better than most idol shows. There's also nice detail in the art, from Kongming holding his sleeve back as he plays go to the clutter of Eiko's small apartment, and the occasional foray into chibi land doesn't detract from this. Honestly, this was just a really entertaining half-hour, and if it wasn't on your radar, I'd urge you to check it out.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Although the Romance of the Three Kingdoms talk went right over my head, the show clearly lays out the two most important things for us to know about Kongming: 1) he was a master strategist, and 2) his side lost. Therefore, it's possible he sees this gig not only as his second chance at life but also his second chance to win—albeit through philosophy rather than warfare.    One thing I love about this episode is how it addresses the absurdity of its premise. Why is he in Japan in the modern day? Why can he understand Japanese? Why is he young again? Why does he encounter the one person who will not only deal with his apparent eccentricities but even bring him into her home? Why does he meet the one boss who will hire him on the spot? The answer to all of these questions is the same: some divine force willed it to be so. His task is to support Eiko, full stop.    Of course, it helps that the show is willing to use this all for comedy.Whether it is Kongming going from having never seen a computer before to asking Eiko about the blockchain over the course of a few hours, or him becoming a master bartender after just listening to Eiko's instructions once, there are a ton of good laughs as we get all those pesky questions out of the way and set up both the premise and our characters.    The other great thing about the episode is that it understands that the most important thing to have in a show about an up-and-coming singer is the music to match. If the songs don't wow you, you can't believe that the supposedly talented singers will make it big, robbing the show of its drama. Honestly, I'm saddened we didn't spend more time listening to Eiko sing (though with runtime limitations I understand why we didn't). I'll be sure to keep an eye out for the soundtrack if nothing else.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review          1 comment       Hello, Melancholic!

Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.2              What is this?   General of the Three Kingdoms, Kongming, had struggled his whole life, facing countless battles that made him into the accomplished strategist he was. So on his deathbed, he wished only to be reborn into a peaceful world... and was sent straight to modern-day party-central, Tokyo. The brilliant strategist Kongming will have to adapt to the wild beats and even wilder party people of the modern age.    Ya Boy Kongming! is based on Yuto Yotsuba and Ryō Ogawa's manga and streams on HIDIVE on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                For a second, I was tempted to call the premise of this one old hat – yoinking a historic figure from the past and tossing them into the present day has been a go-to premise for comedy movies for ages. But there really haven't been too many of those in anime the last few years, since the current obsession is taking a boring-ass dude from our world and tossing him to a theoretically more interesting setting to get his stank all over that place. So in a way this time transplant comedy has some novelty on its side, but it definitely needed more than that to sell itself. Thankfully, as of this first episode it's more than managed to surprise me.    For one, I'm shocked how little the series relies on the rote jokes that come with this territory. You of course have the requisite scenes of Kongming learning about smartphones and modern culture, but those moments are sped through in under a minute, and seemingly every character just rolls with him either being a time traveler or a weird LARPer without much fuss. Not only does that keep this introduction feeling less predictable, it allows more time for the story to dig into sentiment alongside its goofy time-hopping setup. For all that this is a chance for nerdy history references, they take the time to give both Kongming and Eiko likable personalities and moments of emotional sincerity that seriously gripped me.    I was also surprised at how relatively in-depth the show gets with its central musical hook. I'm used to musical anime being idol shows that rarely dip their toes into the actual mechanics of music or the larger world of genres outside of marketable pop ballads. But Ya Boy Kongming! shows a lot of knowledge about music as a whole, from Eiko having a phone filled with EDM and Hip-Hop to discussing how the club she works at plays tracks with different BPM depending on the time of night and how many people are around. Eiko's music is pretty, if not particularly memorable, but the detail and attention being paid here makes me hopeful that the story can use music as more than just a marketing gimmick.    It's also just really well produced so far. The standout scenes are Eiko's first stage appearance and, later, her practice session in her apartment. Both are short but gorgeous sequences of character acting, and do a lot to sell you on why Kongming would suddenly devote himself to becoming her “tactician” to support her career. Really, the entire premiere just looks rock solid – great use of color, strong character designs that are distinct but all gel together effortlessly, and an altogether pleasant aesthetic to lean on. Put together it makes for a much stronger premiere than you might expect, and I'll definitely be staying for another performance.       Rebeccca Silverman  Rating:                Would I have been as thrilled with this episode if I hadn't already read the source manga? I'd like to think so, because even without the knowledge of where this is heading, Ya Boy Kongming!'s first episode is a delightful combination of pathos and humor. It's also a sort of reverse-isekai – our protagonist is in fact the Kongming from the Three Kingdoms period of Chinese history, and after his death from old age in 234 C. E., he wakes up 1,800 years later, young once again, in what he presumes to be Hell. It's basically Mayaya from Princess Jellyfish's dream anime. But a series needs more than just a good premise and a catchy title to work, and in that respect this episode delivers: rather than going with a plain old fish-out-of-water story, Ya Boy Kongming! instead focuses on Kongming finding a new purpose in his life and embracing his rebirth wholeheartedly, and that's a large part of what sells this premier.    It helps that Kongming's new liege is Eiko, an aspiring singer. Despite a lovely singing voice (provided by 96 Neko), success has been elusive to the point where she very nearly committed suicide at one point. It's Eiko's song that snaps Kongming out of his confusion upon first arriving in “Hell” (Shibuya on Halloween), and when they meet again the next day, he's wholeheartedly ready to back Eiko's career. Does it matter that he doesn't know anything about the 21st century's music scene? Not in the slightest; the episode does a very good job of showing us just how quickly he picks things up without actually stopping to say, “Hey, this guy picks up new skills really fast” in a beautiful display of showing versus telling. (His pride that he's got his own Wiki is pretty funny.) Since he's been brought to the world without war that he wished for, what better use of his prodigious intellect and tactical knowledge than to back the girl who saved him and is in need of a helping hand herself?    There's something really heartwarming about Kongming's and Eiko's relationship, even if she is totally thrown by him roughly every three minutes, and it helps that the episode doesn't skimp on the animation or the music – not counting the ending theme, we hear Eiko sing three separate songs, which is better than most idol shows. There's also nice detail in the art, from Kongming holding his sleeve back as he plays go to the clutter of Eiko's small apartment, and the occasional foray into chibi land doesn't detract from this. Honestly, this was just a really entertaining half-hour, and if it wasn't on your radar, I'd urge you to check it out.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Although the Romance of the Three Kingdoms talk went right over my head, the show clearly lays out the two most important things for us to know about Kongming: 1) he was a master strategist, and 2) his side lost. Therefore, it's possible he sees this gig not only as his second chance at life but also his second chance to win—albeit through philosophy rather than warfare.    One thing I love about this episode is how it addresses the absurdity of its premise. Why is he in Japan in the modern day? Why can he understand Japanese? Why is he young again? Why does he encounter the one person who will not only deal with his apparent eccentricities but even bring him into her home? Why does he meet the one boss who will hire him on the spot? The answer to all of these questions is the same: some divine force willed it to be so. His task is to support Eiko, full stop.    Of course, it helps that the show is willing to use this all for comedy.Whether it is Kongming going from having never seen a computer before to asking Eiko about the blockchain over the course of a few hours, or him becoming a master bartender after just listening to Eiko's instructions once, there are a ton of good laughs as we get all those pesky questions out of the way and set up both the premise and our characters.    The other great thing about the episode is that it understands that the most important thing to have in a show about an up-and-coming singer is the music to match. If the songs don't wow you, you can't believe that the supposedly talented singers will make it big, robbing the show of its drama. Honestly, I'm saddened we didn't spend more time listening to Eiko sing (though with runtime limitations I understand why we didn't). I'll be sure to keep an eye out for the soundtrack if nothing else.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review          1 comment       Hello, Melancholic!

General of the Three Kingdoms, Kongming, had struggled his whole life, facing countless battles that made him into the accomplished strategist he was.

Thankfully, as of this first episode it's more than managed to surprise me.    For one, I'm shocked how little the series relies on the rote jokes that come with this territory. You of course have the requisite scenes of Kongming learning about smartphones and modern culture, but those moments are sped through in under a minute, and seemingly every character just rolls with him either being a time traveler or a weird LARPer without much fuss. Not only does that keep this introduction feeling less predictable, it allows more time for the story to dig into sentiment alongside its goofy time-hopping setup. For all that this is a chance for nerdy history references, they take the time to give both Kongming and Eiko likable personalities and moments of emotional sincerity that seriously gripped me.    I was also surprised at how relatively in-depth the show gets with its central musical hook. I'm used to musical anime being idol shows that rarely dip their toes into the actual mechanics of music or the larger world of genres outside of marketable pop ballads. But Ya Boy Kongming! shows a lot of knowledge about music as a whole, from Eiko having a phone filled with EDM and Hip-Hop to discussing how the club she works at plays tracks with different BPM depending on the time of night and how many people are around. Eiko's music is pretty, if not particularly memorable, but the detail and attention being paid here makes me hopeful that the story can use music as more than just a marketing gimmick.    It's also just really well produced so far. The standout scenes are Eiko's first stage appearance and, later, her practice session in her apartment. Both are short but gorgeous sequences of character acting, and do a lot to sell you on why Kongming would suddenly devote himself to becoming her “tactician” to support her career. Really, the entire premiere just looks rock solid – great use of color, strong character designs that are distinct but all gel together effortlessly, and an altogether pleasant aesthetic to lean on. Put together it makes for a much stronger premiere than you might expect, and I'll definitely be staying for another performance.       Rebeccca Silverman  Rating:                Would I have been as thrilled with this episode if I hadn't already read the source manga? I'd like to think so, because even without the knowledge of where this is heading, Ya Boy Kongming!'s first episode is a delightful combination of pathos and humor. It's also a sort of reverse-isekai – our protagonist is in fact the Kongming from the Three Kingdoms period of Chinese history, and after his death from old age in 234 C. E., he wakes up 1,800 years later, young once again, in what he presumes to be Hell. It's basically Mayaya from Princess Jellyfish's dream anime. But a series needs more than just a good premise and a catchy title to work, and in that respect this episode delivers: rather than going with a plain old fish-out-of-water story, Ya Boy Kongming! instead focuses on Kongming finding a new purpose in his life and embracing his rebirth wholeheartedly, and that's a large part of what sells this premier.    It helps that Kongming's new liege is Eiko, an aspiring singer. Despite a lovely singing voice (provided by 96 Neko), success has been elusive to the point where she very nearly committed suicide at one point. It's Eiko's song that snaps Kongming out of his confusion upon first arriving in “Hell” (Shibuya on Halloween), and when they meet again the next day, he's wholeheartedly ready to back Eiko's career. Does it matter that he doesn't know anything about the 21st century's music scene? Not in the slightest; the episode does a very good job of showing us just how quickly he picks things up without actually stopping to say, “Hey, this guy picks up new skills really fast” in a beautiful display of showing versus telling. (His pride that he's got his own Wiki is pretty funny.) Since he's been brought to the world without war that he wished for, what better use of his prodigious intellect and tactical knowledge than to back the girl who saved him and is in need of a helping hand herself?    There's something really heartwarming about Kongming's and Eiko's relationship, even if she is totally thrown by him roughly every three minutes, and it helps that the episode doesn't skimp on the animation or the music – not counting the ending theme, we hear Eiko sing three separate songs, which is better than most idol shows. There's also nice detail in the art, from Kongming holding his sleeve back as he plays go to the clutter of Eiko's small apartment, and the occasional foray into chibi land doesn't detract from this. Honestly, this was just a really entertaining half-hour, and if it wasn't on your radar, I'd urge you to check it out.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Although the Romance of the Three Kingdoms talk went right over my head, the show clearly lays out the two most important things for us to know about Kongming: 1) he was a master strategist, and 2) his side lost. Therefore, it's possible he sees this gig not only as his second chance at life but also his second chance to win—albeit through philosophy rather than warfare.    One thing I love about this episode is how it addresses the absurdity of its premise. Why is he in Japan in the modern day? Why can he understand Japanese? Why is he young again? Why does he encounter the one person who will not only deal with his apparent eccentricities but even bring him into her home? Why does he meet the one boss who will hire him on the spot? The answer to all of these questions is the same: some divine force willed it to be so. His task is to support Eiko, full stop.    Of course, it helps that the show is willing to use this all for comedy.Whether it is Kongming going from having never seen a computer before to asking Eiko about the blockchain over the course of a few hours, or him becoming a master bartender after just listening to Eiko's instructions once, there are a ton of good laughs as we get all those pesky questions out of the way and set up both the premise and our characters.    The other great thing about the episode is that it understands that the most important thing to have in a show about an up-and-coming singer is the music to match. If the songs don't wow you, you can't believe that the supposedly talented singers will make it big, robbing the show of its drama. Honestly, I'm saddened we didn't spend more time listening to Eiko sing (though with runtime limitations I understand why we didn't). I'll be sure to keep an eye out for the soundtrack if nothing else.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review          1 comment       Hello, Melancholic!

Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.2              What is this?   General of the Three Kingdoms, Kongming, had struggled his whole life, facing countless battles that made him into the accomplished strategist he was. So on his deathbed, he wished only to be reborn into a peaceful world... and was sent straight to modern-day party-central, Tokyo. The brilliant strategist Kongming will have to adapt to the wild beats and even wilder party people of the modern age.    Ya Boy Kongming! is based on Yuto Yotsuba and Ryō Ogawa's manga and streams on HIDIVE on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                For a second, I was tempted to call the premise of this one old hat – yoinking a historic figure from the past and tossing them into the present day has been a go-to premise for comedy movies for ages. But there really haven't been too many of those in anime the last few years, since the current obsession is taking a boring-ass dude from our world and tossing him to a theoretically more interesting setting to get his stank all over that place.

Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.2              What is this?   General of the Three Kingdoms, Kongming, had struggled his whole life, facing countless battles that made him into the accomplished strategist he was. So on his deathbed, he wished only to be reborn into a peaceful world... and was sent straight to modern-day party-central, Tokyo. The brilliant strategist Kongming will have to adapt to the wild beats and even wilder party people of the modern age.    Ya Boy Kongming! is based on Yuto Yotsuba and Ryō Ogawa's manga and streams on HIDIVE on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                For a second, I was tempted to call the premise of this one old hat – yoinking a historic figure from the past and tossing them into the present day has been a go-to premise for comedy movies for ages. But there really haven't been too many of those in anime the last few years, since the current obsession is taking a boring-ass dude from our world and tossing him to a theoretically more interesting setting to get his stank all over that place. So in a way this time transplant comedy has some novelty on its side, but it definitely needed more than that to sell itself. Thankfully, as of this first episode it's more than managed to surprise me.    For one, I'm shocked how little the series relies on the rote jokes that come with this territory. You of course have the requisite scenes of Kongming learning about smartphones and modern culture, but those moments are sped through in under a minute, and seemingly every character just rolls with him either being a time traveler or a weird LARPer without much fuss. Not only does that keep this introduction feeling less predictable, it allows more time for the story to dig into sentiment alongside its goofy time-hopping setup. For all that this is a chance for nerdy history references, they take the time to give both Kongming and Eiko likable personalities and moments of emotional sincerity that seriously gripped me.    I was also surprised at how relatively in-depth the show gets with its central musical hook. I'm used to musical anime being idol shows that rarely dip their toes into the actual mechanics of music or the larger world of genres outside of marketable pop ballads. But Ya Boy Kongming! shows a lot of knowledge about music as a whole, from Eiko having a phone filled with EDM and Hip-Hop to discussing how the club she works at plays tracks with different BPM depending on the time of night and how many people are around. Eiko's music is pretty, if not particularly memorable, but the detail and attention being paid here makes me hopeful that the story can use music as more than just a marketing gimmick.    It's also just really well produced so far. The standout scenes are Eiko's first stage appearance and, later, her practice session in her apartment. Both are short but gorgeous sequences of character acting, and do a lot to sell you on why Kongming would suddenly devote himself to becoming her “tactician” to support her career. Really, the entire premiere just looks rock solid – great use of color, strong character designs that are distinct but all gel together effortlessly, and an altogether pleasant aesthetic to lean on. Put together it makes for a much stronger premiere than you might expect, and I'll definitely be staying for another performance.       Rebeccca Silverman  Rating:                Would I have been as thrilled with this episode if I hadn't already read the source manga? I'd like to think so, because even without the knowledge of where this is heading, Ya Boy Kongming!'s first episode is a delightful combination of pathos and humor. It's also a sort of reverse-isekai – our protagonist is in fact the Kongming from the Three Kingdoms period of Chinese history, and after his death from old age in 234 C. E., he wakes up 1,800 years later, young once again, in what he presumes to be Hell. It's basically Mayaya from Princess Jellyfish's dream anime. But a series needs more than just a good premise and a catchy title to work, and in that respect this episode delivers: rather than going with a plain old fish-out-of-water story, Ya Boy Kongming! instead focuses on Kongming finding a new purpose in his life and embracing his rebirth wholeheartedly, and that's a large part of what sells this premier.    It helps that Kongming's new liege is Eiko, an aspiring singer. Despite a lovely singing voice (provided by 96 Neko), success has been elusive to the point where she very nearly committed suicide at one point. It's Eiko's song that snaps Kongming out of his confusion upon first arriving in “Hell” (Shibuya on Halloween), and when they meet again the next day, he's wholeheartedly ready to back Eiko's career. Does it matter that he doesn't know anything about the 21st century's music scene? Not in the slightest; the episode does a very good job of showing us just how quickly he picks things up without actually stopping to say, “Hey, this guy picks up new skills really fast” in a beautiful display of showing versus telling. (His pride that he's got his own Wiki is pretty funny.) Since he's been brought to the world without war that he wished for, what better use of his prodigious intellect and tactical knowledge than to back the girl who saved him and is in need of a helping hand herself?    There's something really heartwarming about Kongming's and Eiko's relationship, even if she is totally thrown by him roughly every three minutes, and it helps that the episode doesn't skimp on the animation or the music – not counting the ending theme, we hear Eiko sing three separate songs, which is better than most idol shows. There's also nice detail in the art, from Kongming holding his sleeve back as he plays go to the clutter of Eiko's small apartment, and the occasional foray into chibi land doesn't detract from this. Honestly, this was just a really entertaining half-hour, and if it wasn't on your radar, I'd urge you to check it out.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Although the Romance of the Three Kingdoms talk went right over my head, the show clearly lays out the two most important things for us to know about Kongming: 1) he was a master strategist, and 2) his side lost. Therefore, it's possible he sees this gig not only as his second chance at life but also his second chance to win—albeit through philosophy rather than warfare.    One thing I love about this episode is how it addresses the absurdity of its premise. Why is he in Japan in the modern day? Why can he understand Japanese? Why is he young again? Why does he encounter the one person who will not only deal with his apparent eccentricities but even bring him into her home? Why does he meet the one boss who will hire him on the spot? The answer to all of these questions is the same: some divine force willed it to be so. His task is to support Eiko, full stop.    Of course, it helps that the show is willing to use this all for comedy.Whether it is Kongming going from having never seen a computer before to asking Eiko about the blockchain over the course of a few hours, or him becoming a master bartender after just listening to Eiko's instructions once, there are a ton of good laughs as we get all those pesky questions out of the way and set up both the premise and our characters.    The other great thing about the episode is that it understands that the most important thing to have in a show about an up-and-coming singer is the music to match. If the songs don't wow you, you can't believe that the supposedly talented singers will make it big, robbing the show of its drama. Honestly, I'm saddened we didn't spend more time listening to Eiko sing (though with runtime limitations I understand why we didn't). I'll be sure to keep an eye out for the soundtrack if nothing else.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

General of the Three Kingdoms, Kongming, had struggled his whole life, facing countless battles that made him into the accomplished strategist he was.

But there really haven't been too many of those in anime the last few years, since the current obsession is taking a boring-ass dude from our world and tossing him to a theoretically more interesting setting to get his stank all over that place. So in a way this time transplant comedy has some novelty on its side, but it definitely needed more than that to sell itself. Thankfully, as of this first episode it's more than managed to surprise me.    For one, I'm shocked how little the series relies on the rote jokes that come with this territory. You of course have the requisite scenes of Kongming learning about smartphones and modern culture, but those moments are sped through in under a minute, and seemingly every character just rolls with him either being a time traveler or a weird LARPer without much fuss. Not only does that keep this introduction feeling less predictable, it allows more time for the story to dig into sentiment alongside its goofy time-hopping setup. For all that this is a chance for nerdy history references, they take the time to give both Kongming and Eiko likable personalities and moments of emotional sincerity that seriously gripped me.    I was also surprised at how relatively in-depth the show gets with its central musical hook. I'm used to musical anime being idol shows that rarely dip their toes into the actual mechanics of music or the larger world of genres outside of marketable pop ballads. But Ya Boy Kongming! shows a lot of knowledge about music as a whole, from Eiko having a phone filled with EDM and Hip-Hop to discussing how the club she works at plays tracks with different BPM depending on the time of night and how many people are around. Eiko's music is pretty, if not particularly memorable, but the detail and attention being paid here makes me hopeful that the story can use music as more than just a marketing gimmick.    It's also just really well produced so far. The standout scenes are Eiko's first stage appearance and, later, her practice session in her apartment. Both are short but gorgeous sequences of character acting, and do a lot to sell you on why Kongming would suddenly devote himself to becoming her “tactician” to support her career. Really, the entire premiere just looks rock solid – great use of color, strong character designs that are distinct but all gel together effortlessly, and an altogether pleasant aesthetic to lean on. Put together it makes for a much stronger premiere than you might expect, and I'll definitely be staying for another performance.       Rebeccca Silverman  Rating:                Would I have been as thrilled with this episode if I hadn't already read the source manga? I'd like to think so, because even without the knowledge of where this is heading, Ya Boy Kongming!'s first episode is a delightful combination of pathos and humor. It's also a sort of reverse-isekai – our protagonist is in fact the Kongming from the Three Kingdoms period of Chinese history, and after his death from old age in 234 C. E., he wakes up 1,800 years later, young once again, in what he presumes to be Hell. It's basically Mayaya from Princess Jellyfish's dream anime. But a series needs more than just a good premise and a catchy title to work, and in that respect this episode delivers: rather than going with a plain old fish-out-of-water story, Ya Boy Kongming! instead focuses on Kongming finding a new purpose in his life and embracing his rebirth wholeheartedly, and that's a large part of what sells this premier.    It helps that Kongming's new liege is Eiko, an aspiring singer. Despite a lovely singing voice (provided by 96 Neko), success has been elusive to the point where she very nearly committed suicide at one point. It's Eiko's song that snaps Kongming out of his confusion upon first arriving in “Hell” (Shibuya on Halloween), and when they meet again the next day, he's wholeheartedly ready to back Eiko's career. Does it matter that he doesn't know anything about the 21st century's music scene? Not in the slightest; the episode does a very good job of showing us just how quickly he picks things up without actually stopping to say, “Hey, this guy picks up new skills really fast” in a beautiful display of showing versus telling. (His pride that he's got his own Wiki is pretty funny.) Since he's been brought to the world without war that he wished for, what better use of his prodigious intellect and tactical knowledge than to back the girl who saved him and is in need of a helping hand herself?    There's something really heartwarming about Kongming's and Eiko's relationship, even if she is totally thrown by him roughly every three minutes, and it helps that the episode doesn't skimp on the animation or the music – not counting the ending theme, we hear Eiko sing three separate songs, which is better than most idol shows. There's also nice detail in the art, from Kongming holding his sleeve back as he plays go to the clutter of Eiko's small apartment, and the occasional foray into chibi land doesn't detract from this.

Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Although the Romance of the Three Kingdoms talk went right over my head, the show clearly lays out the two most important things for us to know about Kongming: 1) he was a master strategist, and 2) his side lost. Therefore, it's possible he sees this gig not only as his second chance at life but also his second chance to win—albeit through philosophy rather than warfare.    One thing I love about this episode is how it addresses the absurdity of its premise. Why is he in Japan in the modern day? Why can he understand Japanese? Why is he young again? Why does he encounter the one person who will not only deal with his apparent eccentricities but even bring him into her home? Why does he meet the one boss who will hire him on the spot? The answer to all of these questions is the same: some divine force willed it to be so. His task is to support Eiko, full stop.    Of course, it helps that the show is willing to use this all for comedy.Whether it is Kongming going from having never seen a computer before to asking Eiko about the blockchain over the course of a few hours, or him becoming a master bartender after just listening to Eiko's instructions once, there are a ton of good laughs as we get all those pesky questions out of the way and set up both the premise and our characters.    The other great thing about the episode is that it understands that the most important thing to have in a show about an up-and-coming singer is the music to match. If the songs don't wow you, you can't believe that the supposedly talented singers will make it big, robbing the show of its drama.

Not in the slightest; the episode does a very good job of showing us just how quickly he picks things up without actually stopping to say, “Hey, this guy picks up new skills really fast” in a beautiful display of showing versus telling. (His pride that he's got his own Wiki is pretty funny.) Since he's been brought to the world without war that he wished for, what better use of his prodigious intellect and tactical knowledge than to back the girl who saved him and is in need of a helping hand herself?    There's something really heartwarming about Kongming's and Eiko's relationship, even if she is totally thrown by him roughly every three minutes, and it helps that the episode doesn't skimp on the animation or the music – not counting the ending theme, we hear Eiko sing three separate songs, which is better than most idol shows. There's also nice detail in the art, from Kongming holding his sleeve back as he plays go to the clutter of Eiko's small apartment, and the occasional foray into chibi land doesn't detract from this. Honestly, this was just a really entertaining half-hour, and if it wasn't on your radar, I'd urge you to check it out.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Although the Romance of the Three Kingdoms talk went right over my head, the show clearly lays out the two most important things for us to know about Kongming: 1) he was a master strategist, and 2) his side lost. Therefore, it's possible he sees this gig not only as his second chance at life but also his second chance to win—albeit through philosophy rather than warfare.    One thing I love about this episode is how it addresses the absurdity of its premise. Why is he in Japan in the modern day? Why can he understand Japanese? Why is he young again? Why does he encounter the one person who will not only deal with his apparent eccentricities but even bring him into her home? Why does he meet the one boss who will hire him on the spot? The answer to all of these questions is the same: some divine force willed it to be so. His task is to support Eiko, full stop.    Of course, it helps that the show is willing to use this all for comedy.Whether it is Kongming going from having never seen a computer before to asking Eiko about the blockchain over the course of a few hours, or him becoming a master bartender after just listening to Eiko's instructions once, there are a ton of good laughs as we get all those pesky questions out of the way and set up both the premise and our characters.    The other great thing about the episode is that it understands that the most important thing to have in a show about an up-and-coming singer is the music to match. If the songs don't wow you, you can't believe that the supposedly talented singers will make it big, robbing the show of its drama. Honestly, I'm saddened we didn't spend more time listening to Eiko sing (though with runtime limitations I understand why we didn't). I'll be sure to keep an eye out for the soundtrack if nothing else.

19-04-2022,anime,2,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/preview-guide/2022/spring/ya-boy-kongming/.183524,Ya Boy Kongming! - The Spring 2022 Preview Guide - Anime News Network:SEA,"            How would you rate episode 1 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.2              What is this?   General of the Three Kingdoms, Kongming, had struggled his whole life, facing countless battles that made him into the accomplished strategist he was. So on his deathbed, he wished only to be reborn into a peaceful world... and was sent straight to modern-day party-central, Tokyo. The brilliant strategist Kongming will have to adapt to the wild beats and even wilder party people of the modern age.    Ya Boy Kongming! is based on Yuto Yotsuba and Ryō Ogawa's manga and streams on HIDIVE on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                For a second, I was tempted to call the premise of this one old hat – yoinking a historic figure from the past and tossing them into the present day has been a go-to premise for comedy movies for ages. But there really haven't been too many of those in anime the last few years, since the current obsession is taking a boring-ass dude from our world and tossing him to a theoretically more interesting setting to get his stank all over that place. So in a way this time transplant comedy has some novelty on its side, but it definitely needed more than that to sell itself. Thankfully, as of this first episode it's more than managed to surprise me.    For one, I'm shocked how little the series relies on the rote jokes that come with this territory. You of course have the requisite scenes of Kongming learning about smartphones and modern culture, but those moments are sped through in under a minute, and seemingly every character just rolls with him either being a time traveler or a weird LARPer without much fuss. Not only does that keep this introduction feeling less predictable, it allows more time for the story to dig into sentiment alongside its goofy time-hopping setup. For all that this is a chance for nerdy history references, they take the time to give both Kongming and Eiko likable personalities and moments of emotional sincerity that seriously gripped me.    I was also surprised at how relatively in-depth the show gets with its central musical hook. I'm used to musical anime being idol shows that rarely dip their toes into the actual mechanics of music or the larger world of genres outside of marketable pop ballads. But Ya Boy Kongming! shows a lot of knowledge about music as a whole, from Eiko having a phone filled with EDM and Hip-Hop to discussing how the club she works at plays tracks with different BPM depending on the time of night and how many people are around. Eiko's music is pretty, if not particularly memorable, but the detail and attention being paid here makes me hopeful that the story can use music as more than just a marketing gimmick.    It's also just really well produced so far. The standout scenes are Eiko's first stage appearance and, later, her practice session in her apartment. Both are short but gorgeous sequences of character acting, and do a lot to sell you on why Kongming would suddenly devote himself to becoming her “tactician” to support her career. Really, the entire premiere just looks rock solid – great use of color, strong character designs that are distinct but all gel together effortlessly, and an altogether pleasant aesthetic to lean on. Put together it makes for a much stronger premiere than you might expect, and I'll definitely be staying for another performance.       Rebeccca Silverman  Rating:                Would I have been as thrilled with this episode if I hadn't already read the source manga? I'd like to think so, because even without the knowledge of where this is heading, Ya Boy Kongming!'s first episode is a delightful combination of pathos and humor. It's also a sort of reverse-isekai – our protagonist is in fact the Kongming from the Three Kingdoms period of Chinese history, and after his death from old age in 234 C. E., he wakes up 1,800 years later, young once again, in what he presumes to be Hell. It's basically Mayaya from Princess Jellyfish's dream anime. But a series needs more than just a good premise and a catchy title to work, and in that respect this episode delivers: rather than going with a plain old fish-out-of-water story, Ya Boy Kongming! instead focuses on Kongming finding a new purpose in his life and embracing his rebirth wholeheartedly, and that's a large part of what sells this premier.    It helps that Kongming's new liege is Eiko, an aspiring singer. Despite a lovely singing voice (provided by 96 Neko), success has been elusive to the point where she very nearly committed suicide at one point. It's Eiko's song that snaps Kongming out of his confusion upon first arriving in “Hell” (Shibuya on Halloween), and when they meet again the next day, he's wholeheartedly ready to back Eiko's career. Does it matter that he doesn't know anything about the 21st century's music scene? Not in the slightest; the episode does a very good job of showing us just how quickly he picks things up without actually stopping to say, “Hey, this guy picks up new skills really fast” in a beautiful display of showing versus telling. (His pride that he's got his own Wiki is pretty funny.) Since he's been brought to the world without war that he wished for, what better use of his prodigious intellect and tactical knowledge than to back the girl who saved him and is in need of a helping hand herself?    There's something really heartwarming about Kongming's and Eiko's relationship, even if she is totally thrown by him roughly every three minutes, and it helps that the episode doesn't skimp on the animation or the music – not counting the ending theme, we hear Eiko sing three separate songs, which is better than most idol shows. There's also nice detail in the art, from Kongming holding his sleeve back as he plays go to the clutter of Eiko's small apartment, and the occasional foray into chibi land doesn't detract from this.

Visit news.dexclub.com for all the latest news in Thai.                Advertising              Thank you for your interest in advertising on Anime News Network. Founded in 1998, Anime News Network is the world's leading source of up to date news and information on the anime and manga industries. Regular readers of Anime News Network not only include hundreds of thousands of anime fans, but also all of the industry heavy weights. The past several years have witnessed an attrition of English anime news sites on the Internet; as the number of sites shrink, the remaining sites only get better. Consistently growing and improving, Anime News Network is here to stay. The key benefit in advertising on Anime News Network is that our readership fits a particular demographic; mature anime fans. The majority of visitors to Anime News Network are between the ages of 18 and 24 and, needless to say, they're all anime fans, but also have a healthy appetite for other forms of animation, video games, and many other related interests. As long as you are interested in reaching anime fans that make their own purchasing decisions, Anime News Network is the ideal place for you to advertise. Please contact us at [email protected] (advertising at animenewsnetwork.com) for more information regarding advertising opportunities. Self-Serve ANN's minimum buy is $3000, but if your budget is lower than $3000 you can now buy ads directly from our self-serve advertising system. The minimum buy is only $10.   The self serve system is also great for people who know what they want and don't want to waste time.   What are you waiting for? Buy ads right here, right now.  Want to Trade? With the exception of anime conventions and charities, ANN does not trade advertising.  Convention Trades The convention trades are back! We have two trade programs available.    Non Profit Anime and Manga Conventions under 30K attendance: We can trade you for 100% of your advertising on ANN. Provide ANN with up to $5,000 of advertising in your program guide or on site, and we will provide you an equal value on ANN.  Other Anime, manga and geek culture conventions: We provide a 50% trade with no max value. You can pay for half the value of your advertisements on ANN with advertisements in your program guide or on-site. EG: If you give us $5,000 of ads at the convention, you only have to pay us $5,000 for $10,000 worth of advertising on ANN.  For Networks We are not looking for any advertising networks at this time. Agencies and rep firms are welcome to contact us, but no networks/exchanges/rtb platforms. No Bootlegs! No Pirates! Important: Don't waste our time if you sell bootleg/pirate DVDs or host unlicensed content on your website. Not only will we not allow you to advertise with us, but we'll probably report you to the appropriate authorities, licensors and/or licensees. We do not consider gray market imports of otherwise legal goods, or doujinshi, ""bootlegs,"" although we may require potential advertisers to prove that their gray market imports are legal goods.             bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Misc Page homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review          1 comment       Hello, Melancholic!

Visit news.dexclub.com for all the latest news in Thai.                Advertising              Thank you for your interest in advertising on Anime News Network. Founded in 1998, Anime News Network is the world's leading source of up to date news and information on the anime and manga industries. Regular readers of Anime News Network not only include hundreds of thousands of anime fans, but also all of the industry heavy weights. The past several years have witnessed an attrition of English anime news sites on the Internet; as the number of sites shrink, the remaining sites only get better. Consistently growing and improving, Anime News Network is here to stay. The key benefit in advertising on Anime News Network is that our readership fits a particular demographic; mature anime fans. The majority of visitors to Anime News Network are between the ages of 18 and 24 and, needless to say, they're all anime fans, but also have a healthy appetite for other forms of animation, video games, and many other related interests. As long as you are interested in reaching anime fans that make their own purchasing decisions, Anime News Network is the ideal place for you to advertise. Please contact us at [email protected] (advertising at animenewsnetwork.com) for more information regarding advertising opportunities. Self-Serve ANN's minimum buy is $3000, but if your budget is lower than $3000 you can now buy ads directly from our self-serve advertising system. The minimum buy is only $10.   The self serve system is also great for people who know what they want and don't want to waste time.   What are you waiting for? Buy ads right here, right now.  Want to Trade? With the exception of anime conventions and charities, ANN does not trade advertising.  Convention Trades The convention trades are back! We have two trade programs available.    Non Profit Anime and Manga Conventions under 30K attendance: We can trade you for 100% of your advertising on ANN. Provide ANN with up to $5,000 of advertising in your program guide or on site, and we will provide you an equal value on ANN.  Other Anime, manga and geek culture conventions: We provide a 50% trade with no max value. You can pay for half the value of your advertisements on ANN with advertisements in your program guide or on-site. EG: If you give us $5,000 of ads at the convention, you only have to pay us $5,000 for $10,000 worth of advertising on ANN.  For Networks We are not looking for any advertising networks at this time. Agencies and rep firms are welcome to contact us, but no networks/exchanges/rtb platforms. No Bootlegs! No Pirates! Important: Don't waste our time if you sell bootleg/pirate DVDs or host unlicensed content on your website. Not only will we not allow you to advertise with us, but we'll probably report you to the appropriate authorities, licensors and/or licensees. We do not consider gray market imports of otherwise legal goods, or doujinshi, ""bootlegs,"" although we may require potential advertisers to prove that their gray market imports are legal goods.             bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Misc Page homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review          1 comment       Hello, Melancholic!

Founded in 1998, Anime News Network is the world's leading source of up to date news and information on the anime and manga industries. Regular readers of Anime News Network not only include hundreds of thousands of anime fans, but also all of the industry heavy weights. The past several years have witnessed an attrition of English anime news sites on the Internet; as the number of sites shrink, the remaining sites only get better. Consistently growing and improving, Anime News Network is here to stay. The key benefit in advertising on Anime News Network is that our readership fits a particular demographic; mature anime fans. The majority of visitors to Anime News Network are between the ages of 18 and 24 and, needless to say, they're all anime fans, but also have a healthy appetite for other forms of animation, video games, and many other related interests. As long as you are interested in reaching anime fans that make their own purchasing decisions, Anime News Network is the ideal place for you to advertise. Please contact us at [email protected] (advertising at animenewsnetwork.com) for more information regarding advertising opportunities. Self-Serve ANN's minimum buy is $3000, but if your budget is lower than $3000 you can now buy ads directly from our self-serve advertising system. The minimum buy is only $10.   The self serve system is also great for people who know what they want and don't want to waste time.   What are you waiting for? Buy ads right here, right now.  Want to Trade? With the exception of anime conventions and charities, ANN does not trade advertising.  Convention Trades The convention trades are back! We have two trade programs available.    Non Profit Anime and Manga Conventions under 30K attendance: We can trade you for 100% of your advertising on ANN. Provide ANN with up to $5,000 of advertising in your program guide or on site, and we will provide you an equal value on ANN.  Other Anime, manga and geek culture conventions: We provide a 50% trade with no max value. You can pay for half the value of your advertisements on ANN with advertisements in your program guide or on-site. EG: If you give us $5,000 of ads at the convention, you only have to pay us $5,000 for $10,000 worth of advertising on ANN.  For Networks We are not looking for any advertising networks at this time. Agencies and rep firms are welcome to contact us, but no networks/exchanges/rtb platforms. No Bootlegs! No Pirates! Important: Don't waste our time if you sell bootleg/pirate DVDs or host unlicensed content on your website. Not only will we not allow you to advertise with us, but we'll probably report you to the appropriate authorities, licensors and/or licensees. We do not consider gray market imports of otherwise legal goods, or doujinshi, ""bootlegs,"" although we may require potential advertisers to prove that their gray market imports are legal goods.             bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Misc Page homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review          1 comment       Hello, Melancholic!

19-04-2022,anime,7,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/advertising,Advertising - Anime News Network:SEA,"     Thank you for your interest in advertising on Anime News Network. Founded in 1998, Anime News Network is the world's leading source of up to date news and information on the anime and manga industries. Regular readers of Anime News Network not only include hundreds of thousands of anime fans, but also all of the industry heavy weights. The past several years have witnessed an attrition of English anime news sites on the Internet; as the number of sites shrink, the remaining sites only get better. Consistently growing and improving, Anime News Network is here to stay. The key benefit in advertising on Anime News Network is that our readership fits a particular demographic; mature anime fans. The majority of visitors to Anime News Network are between the ages of 18 and 24 and, needless to say, they're all anime fans, but also have a healthy appetite for other forms of animation, video games, and many other related interests. As long as you are interested in reaching anime fans that make their own purchasing decisions, Anime News Network is the ideal place for you to advertise. Please contact us at [email protected] (advertising at animenewsnetwork.com) for more information regarding advertising opportunities. Self-Serve ANN's minimum buy is $3000, but if your budget is lower than $3000 you can now buy ads directly from our self-serve advertising system. The minimum buy is only $10.   The self serve system is also great for people who know what they want and don't want to waste time.   What are you waiting for? Buy ads right here, right now.  Want to Trade? With the exception of anime conventions and charities, ANN does not trade advertising.  Convention Trades The convention trades are back! We have two trade programs available.    Non Profit Anime and Manga Conventions under 30K attendance: We can trade you for 100% of your advertising on ANN. Provide ANN with up to $5,000 of advertising in your program guide or on site, and we will provide you an equal value on ANN.  Other Anime, manga and geek culture conventions: We provide a 50% trade with no max value. You can pay for half the value of your advertisements on ANN with advertisements in your program guide or on-site. EG: If you give us $5,000 of ads at the convention, you only have to pay us $5,000 for $10,000 worth of advertising on ANN.  For Networks We are not looking for any advertising networks at this time. Agencies and rep firms are welcome to contact us, but no networks/exchanges/rtb platforms. No Bootlegs! No Pirates! Important: Don't waste our time if you sell bootleg/pirate DVDs or host unlicensed content on your website. Not only will we not allow you to advertise with us, but we'll probably report you to the appropriate authorities, licensors and/or licensees. We do not consider gray market imports of otherwise legal goods, or doujinshi, ""bootlegs,"" although we may require potential advertisers to prove that their gray market imports are legal goods.

Synopsis:             Minato Asano had one reason for picking her high school: it didn't have a concert band. Despite her life-long love of the trombone, terrible experiences through middle school left her a nervous wreck who's desperate to avoid the hierarchy of competitive music. But it seems no matter where she goes the rhythm will find her, as perky upperclassmen Hibiki Sugawa steamrolls into her life and invites Minato to join her band. Reluctant at first, Minato slowly finds herself drawn back into the world of music – and especially drawn to Hibiki herself.      Review:         Synopsis:        Minato Asano had one reason for picking her high school: it didn't have a concert band. Despite her life-long love of the trombone, terrible experiences through middle school left her a nervous wreck who's desperate to avoid the hierarchy of competitive music. But it seems no matter where she goes the rhythm will find her, as perky upperclassmen Hibiki Sugawa steamrolls into her life and invites Minato to join her band. Reluctant at first, Minato slowly finds herself drawn back into the world of music – and especially drawn to Hibiki herself.     Review:            Stop me if you've heard this one before: a mopey, socially anxious teenager just can't find the courage to make friends. They're kind and friendly at heart, but feel like an outcast from others who make friends much more easily. Then, out of the blue, a quirky girl their age suddenly appears to sweep them off their feet, encourage them to break out of their shell, and experience the thrills of adolescence they never believed were possible. It's about as standard a setup as you can get with this kind of coming-of-age romantic drama, and I'm certainly not going to pretend it's suddenly fresh and new just because the awkward lead in Hello, Melancholic! is also a girl. This is by and large an extremely familiar story – but that doesn't mean it can't be a good one if told well, and through this first volume, this series is a firmly charming riff on the formula.    A lot of that comes from Minato herself, and specifically how the series makes her character feel real and relatable beyond her archetypal traits. Her tall figure, uncombed mop of hair, and stiff body language make her stand out among the clean and casual cast around her, perfectly emphasizing her anxiety over attracting attention. Pretty much any time she's standing up, she's also hunched over, arms hugging into her chest as if to take up as little space as possible – there's even mention of the awkwardly fast walk that seems to be universal among clumsy nerds across the world. The only time she ever stands up straight, unashamed of her full size, is when she's lost in playing her trombone, excellently articulating how music allows her to express herself where words fail. While on a purely technical level Yayoi Ohsawa's art is fairly average, the attention to body language goes a long way in characterizing Minato and her compatriots, and making them feel real to the reader.    Which is good, because this is a comic book about music, which is a pretty challenging thing to get by in a purely visual medium, especially with the frankly eclectic makeup of Hibiki's band – drums, trombone, flute, bass, and a single member pulling triple duty on piano, saxophone, and guitar. It's an odd mix of instruments that I imagine would end up sounding like some kind of jazz fusion, but the series never really gets into the nitty and/or gritty of them composing or practicing music. About the deepest you're really going to get here is the first chapter title being a possible reference to a song by The Pillows, because otherwise music here is strictly a means of building character relationships. Band or music nerds looking for a deep dive into the particulars of high school musicians composing or practicing music should best look elsewhere.    Not that that's a bad thing – it's honestly a pretty good idea for the series, considering the limitations of its own medium. The key theme of this volume is stated outright by Hibiki in her first jam session with Minato: music is a conversation, and more important than talent or skill or precision is the desire to say something with your music. Whether it's to blend in and follow others' sounds, to experiment with your own, or to simply mix yours with others and see what happens, the important thing is that you're playing at all. For Minato, who's spent years trying to blend into the background to avoid judgment, and it's an important reminder of what makes music special to her, and sells the conceit of a band-themed romance better than any minutiae about chord structure ever could.    It's a touching sentiment that builds out into the broader hijinks the characters get into outside of their band, too. Whether they're hanging out at a restaurant, sneaking out of the house for late night band practice, or running from the cops while hauling all their gear, the key is for Minato to put herself out there with them rather than shrinking into the background out of fear. It's a simple and familiar moral, but one delivered with tons of heart and care. There are moments that border on cliché, but nonetheless capture the exuberance of doing something new for the first time, or following an impulse against your better judgment. In those pages, Hello, Melancholic! positively shines.    And while the overall plot in this first volume is sparse, we do thankfully get some insight into Hibiki's personality beyond a bright and inviting girlfriend fantasy. She's grown up with music for just as long as Minato, but her familial history has left her with a bitter distaste for competitive music, alongside a passionate desire to pursue music her own way. She's also stubborn to a fault, playing through a wrist injury that only Minato's sharp ears catch, and having to be strong-armed into laying off practices. The volume ends before we get any resolution on that – or any real development of our central relationship beyond Minato's blushy lovesickness – but it does a great deal to flesh her out as a character, to feel as real and rounded as our lead.    Still, that does leave this volume feeling a bit slight. By the end of a first volume you usually want to feel like there's been at least a little bit of resolution, but very little has changed beyond Minato and Hibiki growing closer, and their first live performance looming closer. But series like these are a marathon, not a sprint, and there's plenty of charm in the small details and vibrant personalities on display here to keep you coming back. That's about all you can ask for an opening act, so here's hoping the main performance is worth the buildup.

Synopsis:             Minato Asano had one reason for picking her high school: it didn't have a concert band. Despite her life-long love of the trombone, terrible experiences through middle school left her a nervous wreck who's desperate to avoid the hierarchy of competitive music. But it seems no matter where she goes the rhythm will find her, as perky upperclassmen Hibiki Sugawa steamrolls into her life and invites Minato to join her band. Reluctant at first, Minato slowly finds herself drawn back into the world of music – and especially drawn to Hibiki herself.      Review:         Synopsis:        Minato Asano had one reason for picking her high school: it didn't have a concert band. Despite her life-long love of the trombone, terrible experiences through middle school left her a nervous wreck who's desperate to avoid the hierarchy of competitive music. But it seems no matter where she goes the rhythm will find her, as perky upperclassmen Hibiki Sugawa steamrolls into her life and invites Minato to join her band. Reluctant at first, Minato slowly finds herself drawn back into the world of music – and especially drawn to Hibiki herself.     Review:            Stop me if you've heard this one before: a mopey, socially anxious teenager just can't find the courage to make friends. They're kind and friendly at heart, but feel like an outcast from others who make friends much more easily. Then, out of the blue, a quirky girl their age suddenly appears to sweep them off their feet, encourage them to break out of their shell, and experience the thrills of adolescence they never believed were possible. It's about as standard a setup as you can get with this kind of coming-of-age romantic drama, and I'm certainly not going to pretend it's suddenly fresh and new just because the awkward lead in Hello, Melancholic! is also a girl. This is by and large an extremely familiar story – but that doesn't mean it can't be a good one if told well, and through this first volume, this series is a firmly charming riff on the formula.    A lot of that comes from Minato herself, and specifically how the series makes her character feel real and relatable beyond her archetypal traits. Her tall figure, uncombed mop of hair, and stiff body language make her stand out among the clean and casual cast around her, perfectly emphasizing her anxiety over attracting attention. Pretty much any time she's standing up, she's also hunched over, arms hugging into her chest as if to take up as little space as possible – there's even mention of the awkwardly fast walk that seems to be universal among clumsy nerds across the world. The only time she ever stands up straight, unashamed of her full size, is when she's lost in playing her trombone, excellently articulating how music allows her to express herself where words fail. While on a purely technical level Yayoi Ohsawa's art is fairly average, the attention to body language goes a long way in characterizing Minato and her compatriots, and making them feel real to the reader.    Which is good, because this is a comic book about music, which is a pretty challenging thing to get by in a purely visual medium, especially with the frankly eclectic makeup of Hibiki's band – drums, trombone, flute, bass, and a single member pulling triple duty on piano, saxophone, and guitar. It's an odd mix of instruments that I imagine would end up sounding like some kind of jazz fusion, but the series never really gets into the nitty and/or gritty of them composing or practicing music. About the deepest you're really going to get here is the first chapter title being a possible reference to a song by The Pillows, because otherwise music here is strictly a means of building character relationships. Band or music nerds looking for a deep dive into the particulars of high school musicians composing or practicing music should best look elsewhere.    Not that that's a bad thing – it's honestly a pretty good idea for the series, considering the limitations of its own medium. The key theme of this volume is stated outright by Hibiki in her first jam session with Minato: music is a conversation, and more important than talent or skill or precision is the desire to say something with your music. Whether it's to blend in and follow others' sounds, to experiment with your own, or to simply mix yours with others and see what happens, the important thing is that you're playing at all. For Minato, who's spent years trying to blend into the background to avoid judgment, and it's an important reminder of what makes music special to her, and sells the conceit of a band-themed romance better than any minutiae about chord structure ever could.    It's a touching sentiment that builds out into the broader hijinks the characters get into outside of their band, too. Whether they're hanging out at a restaurant, sneaking out of the house for late night band practice, or running from the cops while hauling all their gear, the key is for Minato to put herself out there with them rather than shrinking into the background out of fear. It's a simple and familiar moral, but one delivered with tons of heart and care. There are moments that border on cliché, but nonetheless capture the exuberance of doing something new for the first time, or following an impulse against your better judgment. In those pages, Hello, Melancholic! positively shines.    And while the overall plot in this first volume is sparse, we do thankfully get some insight into Hibiki's personality beyond a bright and inviting girlfriend fantasy. She's grown up with music for just as long as Minato, but her familial history has left her with a bitter distaste for competitive music, alongside a passionate desire to pursue music her own way. She's also stubborn to a fault, playing through a wrist injury that only Minato's sharp ears catch, and having to be strong-armed into laying off practices. The volume ends before we get any resolution on that – or any real development of our central relationship beyond Minato's blushy lovesickness – but it does a great deal to flesh her out as a character, to feel as real and rounded as our lead.    Still, that does leave this volume feeling a bit slight. By the end of a first volume you usually want to feel like there's been at least a little bit of resolution, but very little has changed beyond Minato and Hibiki growing closer, and their first live performance looming closer. But series like these are a marathon, not a sprint, and there's plenty of charm in the small details and vibrant personalities on display here to keep you coming back. That's about all you can ask for an opening act, so here's hoping the main performance is worth the buildup.             Grade:      Overall : B Story : B- Art : B  + Strong sense of body language, relatable characters, heartfelt and emotional themes to liven up a familiar romantic setup − Struggles to articulate its musical elements, feels rather anticlimactic for a first volume            discuss this in the forum (1 post) |        bookmark/share with:                  				Add this manga to 				               Production Info:        Story & Art: Yayoi Osawa   Full encyclopedia details aboutHello, Melancholic!

Synopsis:             Minato Asano had one reason for picking her high school: it didn't have a concert band. Despite her life-long love of the trombone, terrible experiences through middle school left her a nervous wreck who's desperate to avoid the hierarchy of competitive music. But it seems no matter where she goes the rhythm will find her, as perky upperclassmen Hibiki Sugawa steamrolls into her life and invites Minato to join her band. Reluctant at first, Minato slowly finds herself drawn back into the world of music – and especially drawn to Hibiki herself.      Review:         Synopsis:        Minato Asano had one reason for picking her high school: it didn't have a concert band. Despite her life-long love of the trombone, terrible experiences through middle school left her a nervous wreck who's desperate to avoid the hierarchy of competitive music. But it seems no matter where she goes the rhythm will find her, as perky upperclassmen Hibiki Sugawa steamrolls into her life and invites Minato to join her band. Reluctant at first, Minato slowly finds herself drawn back into the world of music – and especially drawn to Hibiki herself.     Review:            Stop me if you've heard this one before: a mopey, socially anxious teenager just can't find the courage to make friends. They're kind and friendly at heart, but feel like an outcast from others who make friends much more easily. Then, out of the blue, a quirky girl their age suddenly appears to sweep them off their feet, encourage them to break out of their shell, and experience the thrills of adolescence they never believed were possible. It's about as standard a setup as you can get with this kind of coming-of-age romantic drama, and I'm certainly not going to pretend it's suddenly fresh and new just because the awkward lead in Hello, Melancholic! is also a girl. This is by and large an extremely familiar story – but that doesn't mean it can't be a good one if told well, and through this first volume, this series is a firmly charming riff on the formula.    A lot of that comes from Minato herself, and specifically how the series makes her character feel real and relatable beyond her archetypal traits. Her tall figure, uncombed mop of hair, and stiff body language make her stand out among the clean and casual cast around her, perfectly emphasizing her anxiety over attracting attention. Pretty much any time she's standing up, she's also hunched over, arms hugging into her chest as if to take up as little space as possible – there's even mention of the awkwardly fast walk that seems to be universal among clumsy nerds across the world. The only time she ever stands up straight, unashamed of her full size, is when she's lost in playing her trombone, excellently articulating how music allows her to express herself where words fail. While on a purely technical level Yayoi Ohsawa's art is fairly average, the attention to body language goes a long way in characterizing Minato and her compatriots, and making them feel real to the reader.    Which is good, because this is a comic book about music, which is a pretty challenging thing to get by in a purely visual medium, especially with the frankly eclectic makeup of Hibiki's band – drums, trombone, flute, bass, and a single member pulling triple duty on piano, saxophone, and guitar. It's an odd mix of instruments that I imagine would end up sounding like some kind of jazz fusion, but the series never really gets into the nitty and/or gritty of them composing or practicing music. About the deepest you're really going to get here is the first chapter title being a possible reference to a song by The Pillows, because otherwise music here is strictly a means of building character relationships. Band or music nerds looking for a deep dive into the particulars of high school musicians composing or practicing music should best look elsewhere.    Not that that's a bad thing – it's honestly a pretty good idea for the series, considering the limitations of its own medium. The key theme of this volume is stated outright by Hibiki in her first jam session with Minato: music is a conversation, and more important than talent or skill or precision is the desire to say something with your music. Whether it's to blend in and follow others' sounds, to experiment with your own, or to simply mix yours with others and see what happens, the important thing is that you're playing at all. For Minato, who's spent years trying to blend into the background to avoid judgment, and it's an important reminder of what makes music special to her, and sells the conceit of a band-themed romance better than any minutiae about chord structure ever could.    It's a touching sentiment that builds out into the broader hijinks the characters get into outside of their band, too. Whether they're hanging out at a restaurant, sneaking out of the house for late night band practice, or running from the cops while hauling all their gear, the key is for Minato to put herself out there with them rather than shrinking into the background out of fear. It's a simple and familiar moral, but one delivered with tons of heart and care. There are moments that border on cliché, but nonetheless capture the exuberance of doing something new for the first time, or following an impulse against your better judgment. In those pages, Hello, Melancholic! positively shines.    And while the overall plot in this first volume is sparse, we do thankfully get some insight into Hibiki's personality beyond a bright and inviting girlfriend fantasy. She's grown up with music for just as long as Minato, but her familial history has left her with a bitter distaste for competitive music, alongside a passionate desire to pursue music her own way. She's also stubborn to a fault, playing through a wrist injury that only Minato's sharp ears catch, and having to be strong-armed into laying off practices. The volume ends before we get any resolution on that – or any real development of our central relationship beyond Minato's blushy lovesickness – but it does a great deal to flesh her out as a character, to feel as real and rounded as our lead.    Still, that does leave this volume feeling a bit slight. By the end of a first volume you usually want to feel like there's been at least a little bit of resolution, but very little has changed beyond Minato and Hibiki growing closer, and their first live performance looming closer. But series like these are a marathon, not a sprint, and there's plenty of charm in the small details and vibrant personalities on display here to keep you coming back. That's about all you can ask for an opening act, so here's hoping the main performance is worth the buildup.             Grade:      Overall : B Story : B- Art : B  + Strong sense of body language, relatable characters, heartfelt and emotional themes to liven up a familiar romantic setup − Struggles to articulate its musical elements, feels rather anticlimactic for a first volume            discuss this in the forum (1 post) |        bookmark/share with:                  				Add this manga to 				               Production Info:        Story & Art: Yayoi Osawa   Full encyclopedia details aboutHello, Melancholic!

Synopsis:             Minato Asano had one reason for picking her high school: it didn't have a concert band. Despite her life-long love of the trombone, terrible experiences through middle school left her a nervous wreck who's desperate to avoid the hierarchy of competitive music.

Review:         Synopsis:        Minato Asano had one reason for picking her high school: it didn't have a concert band. Despite her life-long love of the trombone, terrible experiences through middle school left her a nervous wreck who's desperate to avoid the hierarchy of competitive music. But it seems no matter where she goes the rhythm will find her, as perky upperclassmen Hibiki Sugawa steamrolls into her life and invites Minato to join her band. Reluctant at first, Minato slowly finds herself drawn back into the world of music – and especially drawn to Hibiki herself.     Review:            Stop me if you've heard this one before: a mopey, socially anxious teenager just can't find the courage to make friends. They're kind and friendly at heart, but feel like an outcast from others who make friends much more easily. Then, out of the blue, a quirky girl their age suddenly appears to sweep them off their feet, encourage them to break out of their shell, and experience the thrills of adolescence they never believed were possible. It's about as standard a setup as you can get with this kind of coming-of-age romantic drama, and I'm certainly not going to pretend it's suddenly fresh and new just because the awkward lead in Hello, Melancholic! is also a girl. This is by and large an extremely familiar story – but that doesn't mean it can't be a good one if told well, and through this first volume, this series is a firmly charming riff on the formula.    A lot of that comes from Minato herself, and specifically how the series makes her character feel real and relatable beyond her archetypal traits. Her tall figure, uncombed mop of hair, and stiff body language make her stand out among the clean and casual cast around her, perfectly emphasizing her anxiety over attracting attention. Pretty much any time she's standing up, she's also hunched over, arms hugging into her chest as if to take up as little space as possible – there's even mention of the awkwardly fast walk that seems to be universal among clumsy nerds across the world. The only time she ever stands up straight, unashamed of her full size, is when she's lost in playing her trombone, excellently articulating how music allows her to express herself where words fail. While on a purely technical level Yayoi Ohsawa's art is fairly average, the attention to body language goes a long way in characterizing Minato and her compatriots, and making them feel real to the reader.    Which is good, because this is a comic book about music, which is a pretty challenging thing to get by in a purely visual medium, especially with the frankly eclectic makeup of Hibiki's band – drums, trombone, flute, bass, and a single member pulling triple duty on piano, saxophone, and guitar. It's an odd mix of instruments that I imagine would end up sounding like some kind of jazz fusion, but the series never really gets into the nitty and/or gritty of them composing or practicing music. About the deepest you're really going to get here is the first chapter title being a possible reference to a song by The Pillows, because otherwise music here is strictly a means of building character relationships. Band or music nerds looking for a deep dive into the particulars of high school musicians composing or practicing music should best look elsewhere.    Not that that's a bad thing – it's honestly a pretty good idea for the series, considering the limitations of its own medium. The key theme of this volume is stated outright by Hibiki in her first jam session with Minato: music is a conversation, and more important than talent or skill or precision is the desire to say something with your music. Whether it's to blend in and follow others' sounds, to experiment with your own, or to simply mix yours with others and see what happens, the important thing is that you're playing at all. For Minato, who's spent years trying to blend into the background to avoid judgment, and it's an important reminder of what makes music special to her, and sells the conceit of a band-themed romance better than any minutiae about chord structure ever could.    It's a touching sentiment that builds out into the broader hijinks the characters get into outside of their band, too. Whether they're hanging out at a restaurant, sneaking out of the house for late night band practice, or running from the cops while hauling all their gear, the key is for Minato to put herself out there with them rather than shrinking into the background out of fear. It's a simple and familiar moral, but one delivered with tons of heart and care. There are moments that border on cliché, but nonetheless capture the exuberance of doing something new for the first time, or following an impulse against your better judgment. In those pages, Hello, Melancholic! positively shines.    And while the overall plot in this first volume is sparse, we do thankfully get some insight into Hibiki's personality beyond a bright and inviting girlfriend fantasy. She's grown up with music for just as long as Minato, but her familial history has left her with a bitter distaste for competitive music, alongside a passionate desire to pursue music her own way. She's also stubborn to a fault, playing through a wrist injury that only Minato's sharp ears catch, and having to be strong-armed into laying off practices. The volume ends before we get any resolution on that – or any real development of our central relationship beyond Minato's blushy lovesickness – but it does a great deal to flesh her out as a character, to feel as real and rounded as our lead.    Still, that does leave this volume feeling a bit slight. By the end of a first volume you usually want to feel like there's been at least a little bit of resolution, but very little has changed beyond Minato and Hibiki growing closer, and their first live performance looming closer. But series like these are a marathon, not a sprint, and there's plenty of charm in the small details and vibrant personalities on display here to keep you coming back. That's about all you can ask for an opening act, so here's hoping the main performance is worth the buildup.             Grade:      Overall : B Story : B- Art : B  + Strong sense of body language, relatable characters, heartfelt and emotional themes to liven up a familiar romantic setup − Struggles to articulate its musical elements, feels rather anticlimactic for a first volume            discuss this in the forum (1 post) |        bookmark/share with:                  				Add this manga to 				               Production Info:        Story & Art: Yayoi Osawa   Full encyclopedia details aboutHello, Melancholic!
