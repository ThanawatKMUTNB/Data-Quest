The Spring 2022 Preview Guide AMAIM Warrior at the Borderline Part 2   Apr 12th 2022                   How would you rate episode 14 of AMAIM Warrior at the Borderline (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 3.6              What is this?   In 2061, Japan is under a state of occupation by multiple states. The world, including Japan, has been consolidated under the rule of four trade blocs. The entire archipelago is now the frontline of conflict. The Japanese people live under a state of constant occupation and oppression, with humanoid war machines called AMAIM patrolling its streets. A young introverted boy named Amō Shiiba has a chance meeting with the autonomous AI Gai, and his acquisition of the AMAIM Kenbu begins a story that will see him attempting to take back Japan. Gashin Tezuka is a reticent and frank 16-year-old member of the Japanese resistance who pilots the AMAIM Ghost to avenge his father.    AMAIM Warrior at the Borderline is part of Sunrise Beyond (formerly Xebec) and toy/hobby company Bandai Spirits' collaborative project and streams on Crunchyroll.      How was the first episode?  Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               By the time of its unplanned season hiatus, AMAIM had basically become a chore to watch. It wasn't that the show was bad – that honestly would have been preferable. Rather, this Gundam-lite just wasn't anything beyond competent at anything it did, and had no character or personality to speak of. It occasionally gestured toward potentially noxious political rhetoric, but never committed to or executed those ideas with enough energy to be worth analyzing. Which leaves you with a show that was always going through the motions of a typical military mech series with no identity of its own. And to the surprise of nobody, that hasn't changed with its return.    I'll give the show some credit: they did wait almost a whole episode before bringing Amou back from the dead – though they still lose points for plastering him, Gai, and Kenbu all over the new OP. I know there probably wasn't time to produce a fake-out opening without him, but it does lessen the theoretical surprise when he comes riding in to save the day at the end of this episode. Granted Amou's return was about the most predictable thing on the planet for anyone who's watched any TV show ever, so maybe it wouldn't have been worth it. Regardless, his big action scene is a serviceable bit of robot action in an otherwise dull, ad-hoc premiere. When the standout highlight of your season premiere is barely above a C-, it's fair to say you have problems.    There's just not enough personality to these characters to make a slow episode where everyone is sad about Amou's death work, and the larger conflict hasn't changed much in any important ways. Sure, the North American military has gotten stronger robots and is expanding their presence, but they're no different than any of the other military forces our heroes fought in the previous season. The Resistance is on the backfoot now and they don't have their obviously evil war profiteer buddy to ask for help, but they'll doubtlessly find a new source of robot parts and guns soon enough. All that's changed is slightly sillier robot designs for the enemy, and our central teenage heroes look slightly older. Amou has a black overshirt, which probably means he's a brooding anti-hero now or something. But none of that is interesting or engaging when these characters have been dull placeholders through the show's entire run, and show no sign of changing.    AMAIM just isn't a very good show, and considering it only took a break because of looming production crunch, there's little reason to think it would have course-corrected while it was gone. It's just not worth your time unless you're desperate for decently-animated 2D robots, and even then you're probably better off waiting for the new Gundam TV series instead of sitting through the narrative equivalent of watching paint dry.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review          1 comment       Hello, Melancholic!

Gashin Tezuka is a reticent and frank 16-year-old member of the Japanese resistance who pilots the AMAIM Ghost to avenge his father.    AMAIM Warrior at the Borderline is part of Sunrise Beyond (formerly Xebec) and toy/hobby company Bandai Spirits' collaborative project and streams on Crunchyroll.      How was the first episode?  Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               By the time of its unplanned season hiatus, AMAIM had basically become a chore to watch. It wasn't that the show was bad – that honestly would have been preferable. Rather, this Gundam-lite just wasn't anything beyond competent at anything it did, and had no character or personality to speak of. It occasionally gestured toward potentially noxious political rhetoric, but never committed to or executed those ideas with enough energy to be worth analyzing. Which leaves you with a show that was always going through the motions of a typical military mech series with no identity of its own. And to the surprise of nobody, that hasn't changed with its return.    I'll give the show some credit: they did wait almost a whole episode before bringing Amou back from the dead – though they still lose points for plastering him, Gai, and Kenbu all over the new OP. I know there probably wasn't time to produce a fake-out opening without him, but it does lessen the theoretical surprise when he comes riding in to save the day at the end of this episode. Granted Amou's return was about the most predictable thing on the planet for anyone who's watched any TV show ever, so maybe it wouldn't have been worth it. Regardless, his big action scene is a serviceable bit of robot action in an otherwise dull, ad-hoc premiere. When the standout highlight of your season premiere is barely above a C-, it's fair to say you have problems.    There's just not enough personality to these characters to make a slow episode where everyone is sad about Amou's death work, and the larger conflict hasn't changed much in any important ways. Sure, the North American military has gotten stronger robots and is expanding their presence, but they're no different than any of the other military forces our heroes fought in the previous season. The Resistance is on the backfoot now and they don't have their obviously evil war profiteer buddy to ask for help, but they'll doubtlessly find a new source of robot parts and guns soon enough. All that's changed is slightly sillier robot designs for the enemy, and our central teenage heroes look slightly older. Amou has a black overshirt, which probably means he's a brooding anti-hero now or something. But none of that is interesting or engaging when these characters have been dull placeholders through the show's entire run, and show no sign of changing.    AMAIM just isn't a very good show, and considering it only took a break because of looming production crunch, there's little reason to think it would have course-corrected while it was gone. It's just not worth your time unless you're desperate for decently-animated 2D robots, and even then you're probably better off waiting for the new Gundam TV series instead of sitting through the narrative equivalent of watching paint dry.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review          1 comment       Hello, Melancholic!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide AMAIM Warrior at the Borderline Part 2   Apr 12th 2022                   How would you rate episode 14 of AMAIM Warrior at the Borderline (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 3.6              What is this?   In 2061, Japan is under a state of occupation by multiple states. The world, including Japan, has been consolidated under the rule of four trade blocs. The entire archipelago is now the frontline of conflict. The Japanese people live under a state of constant occupation and oppression, with humanoid war machines called AMAIM patrolling its streets. A young introverted boy named Amō Shiiba has a chance meeting with the autonomous AI Gai, and his acquisition of the AMAIM Kenbu begins a story that will see him attempting to take back Japan.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide AMAIM Warrior at the Borderline Part 2   Apr 12th 2022                   How would you rate episode 14 of AMAIM Warrior at the Borderline (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 3.6              What is this?   In 2061, Japan is under a state of occupation by multiple states. The world, including Japan, has been consolidated under the rule of four trade blocs. The entire archipelago is now the frontline of conflict. The Japanese people live under a state of constant occupation and oppression, with humanoid war machines called AMAIM patrolling its streets. A young introverted boy named Amō Shiiba has a chance meeting with the autonomous AI Gai, and his acquisition of the AMAIM Kenbu begins a story that will see him attempting to take back Japan. Gashin Tezuka is a reticent and frank 16-year-old member of the Japanese resistance who pilots the AMAIM Ghost to avenge his father.    AMAIM Warrior at the Borderline is part of Sunrise Beyond (formerly Xebec) and toy/hobby company Bandai Spirits' collaborative project and streams on Crunchyroll.      How was the first episode?  Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               By the time of its unplanned season hiatus, AMAIM had basically become a chore to watch. It wasn't that the show was bad – that honestly would have been preferable. Rather, this Gundam-lite just wasn't anything beyond competent at anything it did, and had no character or personality to speak of. It occasionally gestured toward potentially noxious political rhetoric, but never committed to or executed those ideas with enough energy to be worth analyzing. Which leaves you with a show that was always going through the motions of a typical military mech series with no identity of its own. And to the surprise of nobody, that hasn't changed with its return.    I'll give the show some credit: they did wait almost a whole episode before bringing Amou back from the dead – though they still lose points for plastering him, Gai, and Kenbu all over the new OP. I know there probably wasn't time to produce a fake-out opening without him, but it does lessen the theoretical surprise when he comes riding in to save the day at the end of this episode. Granted Amou's return was about the most predictable thing on the planet for anyone who's watched any TV show ever, so maybe it wouldn't have been worth it. Regardless, his big action scene is a serviceable bit of robot action in an otherwise dull, ad-hoc premiere. When the standout highlight of your season premiere is barely above a C-, it's fair to say you have problems.    There's just not enough personality to these characters to make a slow episode where everyone is sad about Amou's death work, and the larger conflict hasn't changed much in any important ways. Sure, the North American military has gotten stronger robots and is expanding their presence, but they're no different than any of the other military forces our heroes fought in the previous season. The Resistance is on the backfoot now and they don't have their obviously evil war profiteer buddy to ask for help, but they'll doubtlessly find a new source of robot parts and guns soon enough. All that's changed is slightly sillier robot designs for the enemy, and our central teenage heroes look slightly older. Amou has a black overshirt, which probably means he's a brooding anti-hero now or something. But none of that is interesting or engaging when these characters have been dull placeholders through the show's entire run, and show no sign of changing.    AMAIM just isn't a very good show, and considering it only took a break because of looming production crunch, there's little reason to think it would have course-corrected while it was gone. It's just not worth your time unless you're desperate for decently-animated 2D robots, and even then you're probably better off waiting for the new Gundam TV series instead of sitting through the narrative equivalent of watching paint dry.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review          1 comment       Hello, Melancholic!

Community score: 4.0                  How would you rate episode 12 of Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story (TV 3) ?                     Community score: 3.9              What is this?   In exchange for the fulfillment of a wish, Magical Girls keep fighting, unbeknownst to the rest of the world. But Iroha Tamaki can't seem to remember her wish. There is a gaping hole in her life. Something important has been lost. But she continues to fight every day, without even knowing why. Then, a rumor begins to spread among Magical Girls. Magical Girls can be saved if they go to Kamihama City, the city where Magical Girls and Uwasa are gathering.    Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story is based on a spinoff game of the Puella Magi Madoka Magica anime and streams on Crunchyroll and Funimation.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                I'm just going to get the full title out of the way up top, since it tells you everything you need to know about the show. This is Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story Final Season -The Dawn of the Ephemeral Dream-, a four-episode mini-season that is meant to conclude the nearly three-year-long odyssey of this messy but ambitious Madoka Magica spinoff. It seems odd to call this a “preview"" since in just this one episode we're covering a full quarter of this long-awaited conclusion, but thems the breaks, I suppose.    Going into -The Dawn of the Ephemeral Dream-, the main question on everyone's mind, including mine, is going to be whether or not a mere four-episode arc will be enough to draw the story of Magia Record to a satisfying conclusion. The thing about “We Failed” is that it's a flashback episode, devoted entirely to explaining the origins of the antagonist cadre of Magical Girls known as the Wings of Magius, so we don't get much in the way of narrative progression here. The good news is that, so far as infodump episodes go, “We Failed” is a doozy, answering many of the long-standing mysteries that Magia Record has been dangling over its viewers' heads for the past few years.    Granted, none of these answers are necessarily revelatory; given everything we learned about Ui, Nemu, and Touka last season, it was easy enough to figure out the broad strokes of this backstory ahead of time. Still, seeing everything laid out in a more traditional narrative fashion sure is satisfying for longtime viewers of the series, and it helps to contextualize a lot of elements of the series as we head into Magia Record's final act. The full scope of Ui's disappearance from the world is explained, we understand how all three of the Hospital Gang ended up as Magical Girls in the first place, and how Touka became the Uwasa creating villain that she was in the first two seasons of the show. We even finally get an explanation for Baby Kyubey, and it's a lot more reasonable than I was expecting!    The second season of the show was also notable for its extreme highs and lows in production quality. A few of its episodes ranked among the best spectacle that the franchise has ever delivered, and at the same time, the final entries of the season were stretched so thin that you could practically see the bubblegum and duct tape that the artists at Studio Shaft were using to hold the production together. “We Failed” is by no means the prettiest episode of Madoka Magica ever produced, but it looks solid, and my biggest hope for this extra-short final season is that the overall aesthetic of the franchise isn't compromised because of scheduling and production errors. Lord knows that the poor crew deserves one hell of a vacation at this point.    All that said, do I think that Magia Record's final season will end up doing the spinoff justice? It's tough to say. I've always had a mixed relationship with Magia Record; at its best, it feels like a genuine and compelling expansion of the entire Madoka Magica universe, but at its worst, it becomes borderline incomprehensible. I think the good of the series generally outweighs the bad, though, and if you're at all a fan of the Madoka Magica franchise, I believe (and I hope) that you'll have a mostly good time with Magia Record. Just, you know, make sure to watch the other two seasons first if you're new to the series.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               This episode might as well have been called “30 Minutes of Answers.” In one self-contained flashback, it lays out every major remaining mystery in the series and thoroughly unravels them. However, the way it does this feels completely natural through yet another story of Madoka Magica-themed suffering.    As it goes with most of these stories, it begins with Kyubey preying on Iroha's fears for Ui and tricking her into becoming a magical girl. What's interesting here is that Ui, Nemu, and Touka are able to see through Kyubey's half-truths and uncover what is really going on. And like Madoka in the main series, the three sickly girls figure out the bunny-cat's biggest weakness: he has to grant wishes. He literally can't stop himself.    This, of course, kicks off their search for the perfect wish—or rather, set of wishes—to break Kyubey's system and allow the remaining magical girls to live normally even after all witches are exterminated. Their solution is basically to become Kyubey themselves—feeding the collected energy back into the magical girls rather than keeping it for themselves. The problem is that they never considered what would happen to the one taking in all the negative magical girl emotions—i.e., that they'd become a witch in seconds.    Basically, this episode is a tragedy centered around hubris. The three girls think that after a bit of research they can game the system and save the world. But instead, they arguably make things worse, leading to almost all of the tragedy we've seen in the series so far.    What's truly heartbreaking, though, is the effect that comes from isolating Ui's fractured soul inside of Kyubey. Like with Madoka at the end of the main series, this places her outside of reality—as if she never existed in the first place. This drastically changes the personalities of those closest to her (namely, Touka) and makes the previous seasons gain yet another layer of tragedy in retrospect. All in all, it's a fantastic amalgamation of lore and character building that has me pumped to see where things will go in our final three episodes.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review          1 comment       Hello, Melancholic!

Community score: 3.9              What is this?   In exchange for the fulfillment of a wish, Magical Girls keep fighting, unbeknownst to the rest of the world. But Iroha Tamaki can't seem to remember her wish. There is a gaping hole in her life. Something important has been lost. But she continues to fight every day, without even knowing why. Then, a rumor begins to spread among Magical Girls. Magical Girls can be saved if they go to Kamihama City, the city where Magical Girls and Uwasa are gathering.    Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story is based on a spinoff game of the Puella Magi Madoka Magica anime and streams on Crunchyroll and Funimation.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                I'm just going to get the full title out of the way up top, since it tells you everything you need to know about the show. This is Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story Final Season -The Dawn of the Ephemeral Dream-, a four-episode mini-season that is meant to conclude the nearly three-year-long odyssey of this messy but ambitious Madoka Magica spinoff. It seems odd to call this a “preview"" since in just this one episode we're covering a full quarter of this long-awaited conclusion, but thems the breaks, I suppose.    Going into -The Dawn of the Ephemeral Dream-, the main question on everyone's mind, including mine, is going to be whether or not a mere four-episode arc will be enough to draw the story of Magia Record to a satisfying conclusion. The thing about “We Failed” is that it's a flashback episode, devoted entirely to explaining the origins of the antagonist cadre of Magical Girls known as the Wings of Magius, so we don't get much in the way of narrative progression here. The good news is that, so far as infodump episodes go, “We Failed” is a doozy, answering many of the long-standing mysteries that Magia Record has been dangling over its viewers' heads for the past few years.    Granted, none of these answers are necessarily revelatory; given everything we learned about Ui, Nemu, and Touka last season, it was easy enough to figure out the broad strokes of this backstory ahead of time. Still, seeing everything laid out in a more traditional narrative fashion sure is satisfying for longtime viewers of the series, and it helps to contextualize a lot of elements of the series as we head into Magia Record's final act. The full scope of Ui's disappearance from the world is explained, we understand how all three of the Hospital Gang ended up as Magical Girls in the first place, and how Touka became the Uwasa creating villain that she was in the first two seasons of the show. We even finally get an explanation for Baby Kyubey, and it's a lot more reasonable than I was expecting!    The second season of the show was also notable for its extreme highs and lows in production quality. A few of its episodes ranked among the best spectacle that the franchise has ever delivered, and at the same time, the final entries of the season were stretched so thin that you could practically see the bubblegum and duct tape that the artists at Studio Shaft were using to hold the production together. “We Failed” is by no means the prettiest episode of Madoka Magica ever produced, but it looks solid, and my biggest hope for this extra-short final season is that the overall aesthetic of the franchise isn't compromised because of scheduling and production errors. Lord knows that the poor crew deserves one hell of a vacation at this point.    All that said, do I think that Magia Record's final season will end up doing the spinoff justice? It's tough to say. I've always had a mixed relationship with Magia Record; at its best, it feels like a genuine and compelling expansion of the entire Madoka Magica universe, but at its worst, it becomes borderline incomprehensible. I think the good of the series generally outweighs the bad, though, and if you're at all a fan of the Madoka Magica franchise, I believe (and I hope) that you'll have a mostly good time with Magia Record. Just, you know, make sure to watch the other two seasons first if you're new to the series.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               This episode might as well have been called “30 Minutes of Answers.” In one self-contained flashback, it lays out every major remaining mystery in the series and thoroughly unravels them. However, the way it does this feels completely natural through yet another story of Madoka Magica-themed suffering.    As it goes with most of these stories, it begins with Kyubey preying on Iroha's fears for Ui and tricking her into becoming a magical girl. What's interesting here is that Ui, Nemu, and Touka are able to see through Kyubey's half-truths and uncover what is really going on. And like Madoka in the main series, the three sickly girls figure out the bunny-cat's biggest weakness: he has to grant wishes. He literally can't stop himself.    This, of course, kicks off their search for the perfect wish—or rather, set of wishes—to break Kyubey's system and allow the remaining magical girls to live normally even after all witches are exterminated. Their solution is basically to become Kyubey themselves—feeding the collected energy back into the magical girls rather than keeping it for themselves. The problem is that they never considered what would happen to the one taking in all the negative magical girl emotions—i.e., that they'd become a witch in seconds.    Basically, this episode is a tragedy centered around hubris. The three girls think that after a bit of research they can game the system and save the world. But instead, they arguably make things worse, leading to almost all of the tragedy we've seen in the series so far.    What's truly heartbreaking, though, is the effect that comes from isolating Ui's fractured soul inside of Kyubey. Like with Madoka at the end of the main series, this places her outside of reality—as if she never existed in the first place. This drastically changes the personalities of those closest to her (namely, Touka) and makes the previous seasons gain yet another layer of tragedy in retrospect.

Community score: 4.0                  How would you rate episode 12 of Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story (TV 3) ?                     Community score: 3.9              What is this?   In exchange for the fulfillment of a wish, Magical Girls keep fighting, unbeknownst to the rest of the world. But Iroha Tamaki can't seem to remember her wish. There is a gaping hole in her life. Something important has been lost. But she continues to fight every day, without even knowing why. Then, a rumor begins to spread among Magical Girls. Magical Girls can be saved if they go to Kamihama City, the city where Magical Girls and Uwasa are gathering.    Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story is based on a spinoff game of the Puella Magi Madoka Magica anime and streams on Crunchyroll and Funimation.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                I'm just going to get the full title out of the way up top, since it tells you everything you need to know about the show. This is Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story Final Season -The Dawn of the Ephemeral Dream-, a four-episode mini-season that is meant to conclude the nearly three-year-long odyssey of this messy but ambitious Madoka Magica spinoff. It seems odd to call this a “preview"" since in just this one episode we're covering a full quarter of this long-awaited conclusion, but thems the breaks, I suppose.    Going into -The Dawn of the Ephemeral Dream-, the main question on everyone's mind, including mine, is going to be whether or not a mere four-episode arc will be enough to draw the story of Magia Record to a satisfying conclusion. The thing about “We Failed” is that it's a flashback episode, devoted entirely to explaining the origins of the antagonist cadre of Magical Girls known as the Wings of Magius, so we don't get much in the way of narrative progression here. The good news is that, so far as infodump episodes go, “We Failed” is a doozy, answering many of the long-standing mysteries that Magia Record has been dangling over its viewers' heads for the past few years.    Granted, none of these answers are necessarily revelatory; given everything we learned about Ui, Nemu, and Touka last season, it was easy enough to figure out the broad strokes of this backstory ahead of time. Still, seeing everything laid out in a more traditional narrative fashion sure is satisfying for longtime viewers of the series, and it helps to contextualize a lot of elements of the series as we head into Magia Record's final act. The full scope of Ui's disappearance from the world is explained, we understand how all three of the Hospital Gang ended up as Magical Girls in the first place, and how Touka became the Uwasa creating villain that she was in the first two seasons of the show. We even finally get an explanation for Baby Kyubey, and it's a lot more reasonable than I was expecting!    The second season of the show was also notable for its extreme highs and lows in production quality. A few of its episodes ranked among the best spectacle that the franchise has ever delivered, and at the same time, the final entries of the season were stretched so thin that you could practically see the bubblegum and duct tape that the artists at Studio Shaft were using to hold the production together. “We Failed” is by no means the prettiest episode of Madoka Magica ever produced, but it looks solid, and my biggest hope for this extra-short final season is that the overall aesthetic of the franchise isn't compromised because of scheduling and production errors. Lord knows that the poor crew deserves one hell of a vacation at this point.    All that said, do I think that Magia Record's final season will end up doing the spinoff justice? It's tough to say. I've always had a mixed relationship with Magia Record; at its best, it feels like a genuine and compelling expansion of the entire Madoka Magica universe, but at its worst, it becomes borderline incomprehensible. I think the good of the series generally outweighs the bad, though, and if you're at all a fan of the Madoka Magica franchise, I believe (and I hope) that you'll have a mostly good time with Magia Record. Just, you know, make sure to watch the other two seasons first if you're new to the series.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               This episode might as well have been called “30 Minutes of Answers.” In one self-contained flashback, it lays out every major remaining mystery in the series and thoroughly unravels them. However, the way it does this feels completely natural through yet another story of Madoka Magica-themed suffering.    As it goes with most of these stories, it begins with Kyubey preying on Iroha's fears for Ui and tricking her into becoming a magical girl. What's interesting here is that Ui, Nemu, and Touka are able to see through Kyubey's half-truths and uncover what is really going on. And like Madoka in the main series, the three sickly girls figure out the bunny-cat's biggest weakness: he has to grant wishes. He literally can't stop himself.    This, of course, kicks off their search for the perfect wish—or rather, set of wishes—to break Kyubey's system and allow the remaining magical girls to live normally even after all witches are exterminated. Their solution is basically to become Kyubey themselves—feeding the collected energy back into the magical girls rather than keeping it for themselves. The problem is that they never considered what would happen to the one taking in all the negative magical girl emotions—i.e., that they'd become a witch in seconds.    Basically, this episode is a tragedy centered around hubris. The three girls think that after a bit of research they can game the system and save the world. But instead, they arguably make things worse, leading to almost all of the tragedy we've seen in the series so far.    What's truly heartbreaking, though, is the effect that comes from isolating Ui's fractured soul inside of Kyubey. Like with Madoka at the end of the main series, this places her outside of reality—as if she never existed in the first place. This drastically changes the personalities of those closest to her (namely, Touka) and makes the previous seasons gain yet another layer of tragedy in retrospect. All in all, it's a fantastic amalgamation of lore and character building that has me pumped to see where things will go in our final three episodes.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review          1 comment       Hello, Melancholic!

Community score: 3.9              What is this?   In exchange for the fulfillment of a wish, Magical Girls keep fighting, unbeknownst to the rest of the world. But Iroha Tamaki can't seem to remember her wish. There is a gaping hole in her life. Something important has been lost. But she continues to fight every day, without even knowing why. Then, a rumor begins to spread among Magical Girls. Magical Girls can be saved if they go to Kamihama City, the city where Magical Girls and Uwasa are gathering.    Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story is based on a spinoff game of the Puella Magi Madoka Magica anime and streams on Crunchyroll and Funimation.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                I'm just going to get the full title out of the way up top, since it tells you everything you need to know about the show. This is Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story Final Season -The Dawn of the Ephemeral Dream-, a four-episode mini-season that is meant to conclude the nearly three-year-long odyssey of this messy but ambitious Madoka Magica spinoff. It seems odd to call this a “preview"" since in just this one episode we're covering a full quarter of this long-awaited conclusion, but thems the breaks, I suppose.    Going into -The Dawn of the Ephemeral Dream-, the main question on everyone's mind, including mine, is going to be whether or not a mere four-episode arc will be enough to draw the story of Magia Record to a satisfying conclusion. The thing about “We Failed” is that it's a flashback episode, devoted entirely to explaining the origins of the antagonist cadre of Magical Girls known as the Wings of Magius, so we don't get much in the way of narrative progression here. The good news is that, so far as infodump episodes go, “We Failed” is a doozy, answering many of the long-standing mysteries that Magia Record has been dangling over its viewers' heads for the past few years.    Granted, none of these answers are necessarily revelatory; given everything we learned about Ui, Nemu, and Touka last season, it was easy enough to figure out the broad strokes of this backstory ahead of time. Still, seeing everything laid out in a more traditional narrative fashion sure is satisfying for longtime viewers of the series, and it helps to contextualize a lot of elements of the series as we head into Magia Record's final act. The full scope of Ui's disappearance from the world is explained, we understand how all three of the Hospital Gang ended up as Magical Girls in the first place, and how Touka became the Uwasa creating villain that she was in the first two seasons of the show. We even finally get an explanation for Baby Kyubey, and it's a lot more reasonable than I was expecting!    The second season of the show was also notable for its extreme highs and lows in production quality. A few of its episodes ranked among the best spectacle that the franchise has ever delivered, and at the same time, the final entries of the season were stretched so thin that you could practically see the bubblegum and duct tape that the artists at Studio Shaft were using to hold the production together. “We Failed” is by no means the prettiest episode of Madoka Magica ever produced, but it looks solid, and my biggest hope for this extra-short final season is that the overall aesthetic of the franchise isn't compromised because of scheduling and production errors. Lord knows that the poor crew deserves one hell of a vacation at this point.    All that said, do I think that Magia Record's final season will end up doing the spinoff justice? It's tough to say. I've always had a mixed relationship with Magia Record; at its best, it feels like a genuine and compelling expansion of the entire Madoka Magica universe, but at its worst, it becomes borderline incomprehensible. I think the good of the series generally outweighs the bad, though, and if you're at all a fan of the Madoka Magica franchise, I believe (and I hope) that you'll have a mostly good time with Magia Record. Just, you know, make sure to watch the other two seasons first if you're new to the series.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               This episode might as well have been called “30 Minutes of Answers.” In one self-contained flashback, it lays out every major remaining mystery in the series and thoroughly unravels them. However, the way it does this feels completely natural through yet another story of Madoka Magica-themed suffering.    As it goes with most of these stories, it begins with Kyubey preying on Iroha's fears for Ui and tricking her into becoming a magical girl. What's interesting here is that Ui, Nemu, and Touka are able to see through Kyubey's half-truths and uncover what is really going on. And like Madoka in the main series, the three sickly girls figure out the bunny-cat's biggest weakness: he has to grant wishes. He literally can't stop himself.    This, of course, kicks off their search for the perfect wish—or rather, set of wishes—to break Kyubey's system and allow the remaining magical girls to live normally even after all witches are exterminated. Their solution is basically to become Kyubey themselves—feeding the collected energy back into the magical girls rather than keeping it for themselves. The problem is that they never considered what would happen to the one taking in all the negative magical girl emotions—i.e., that they'd become a witch in seconds.    Basically, this episode is a tragedy centered around hubris. The three girls think that after a bit of research they can game the system and save the world. But instead, they arguably make things worse, leading to almost all of the tragedy we've seen in the series so far.    What's truly heartbreaking, though, is the effect that comes from isolating Ui's fractured soul inside of Kyubey. Like with Madoka at the end of the main series, this places her outside of reality—as if she never existed in the first place. This drastically changes the personalities of those closest to her (namely, Touka) and makes the previous seasons gain yet another layer of tragedy in retrospect. All in all, it's a fantastic amalgamation of lore and character building that has me pumped to see where things will go in our final three episodes.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review          1 comment       Hello, Melancholic!

And like Madoka in the main series, the three sickly girls figure out the bunny-cat's biggest weakness: he has to grant wishes. He literally can't stop himself.    This, of course, kicks off their search for the perfect wish—or rather, set of wishes—to break Kyubey's system and allow the remaining magical girls to live normally even after all witches are exterminated. Their solution is basically to become Kyubey themselves—feeding the collected energy back into the magical girls rather than keeping it for themselves. The problem is that they never considered what would happen to the one taking in all the negative magical girl emotions—i.e., that they'd become a witch in seconds.    Basically, this episode is a tragedy centered around hubris. The three girls think that after a bit of research they can game the system and save the world. But instead, they arguably make things worse, leading to almost all of the tragedy we've seen in the series so far.    What's truly heartbreaking, though, is the effect that comes from isolating Ui's fractured soul inside of Kyubey. Like with Madoka at the end of the main series, this places her outside of reality—as if she never existed in the first place. This drastically changes the personalities of those closest to her (namely, Touka) and makes the previous seasons gain yet another layer of tragedy in retrospect. All in all, it's a fantastic amalgamation of lore and character building that has me pumped to see where things will go in our final three episodes.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 3.9              What is this?   In exchange for the fulfillment of a wish, Magical Girls keep fighting, unbeknownst to the rest of the world. But Iroha Tamaki can't seem to remember her wish. There is a gaping hole in her life. Something important has been lost. But she continues to fight every day, without even knowing why. Then, a rumor begins to spread among Magical Girls. Magical Girls can be saved if they go to Kamihama City, the city where Magical Girls and Uwasa are gathering.    Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story is based on a spinoff game of the Puella Magi Madoka Magica anime and streams on Crunchyroll and Funimation.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                I'm just going to get the full title out of the way up top, since it tells you everything you need to know about the show. This is Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story Final Season -The Dawn of the Ephemeral Dream-, a four-episode mini-season that is meant to conclude the nearly three-year-long odyssey of this messy but ambitious Madoka Magica spinoff. It seems odd to call this a “preview"" since in just this one episode we're covering a full quarter of this long-awaited conclusion, but thems the breaks, I suppose.    Going into -The Dawn of the Ephemeral Dream-, the main question on everyone's mind, including mine, is going to be whether or not a mere four-episode arc will be enough to draw the story of Magia Record to a satisfying conclusion. The thing about “We Failed” is that it's a flashback episode, devoted entirely to explaining the origins of the antagonist cadre of Magical Girls known as the Wings of Magius, so we don't get much in the way of narrative progression here. The good news is that, so far as infodump episodes go, “We Failed” is a doozy, answering many of the long-standing mysteries that Magia Record has been dangling over its viewers' heads for the past few years.    Granted, none of these answers are necessarily revelatory; given everything we learned about Ui, Nemu, and Touka last season, it was easy enough to figure out the broad strokes of this backstory ahead of time. Still, seeing everything laid out in a more traditional narrative fashion sure is satisfying for longtime viewers of the series, and it helps to contextualize a lot of elements of the series as we head into Magia Record's final act. The full scope of Ui's disappearance from the world is explained, we understand how all three of the Hospital Gang ended up as Magical Girls in the first place, and how Touka became the Uwasa creating villain that she was in the first two seasons of the show. We even finally get an explanation for Baby Kyubey, and it's a lot more reasonable than I was expecting!    The second season of the show was also notable for its extreme highs and lows in production quality. A few of its episodes ranked among the best spectacle that the franchise has ever delivered, and at the same time, the final entries of the season were stretched so thin that you could practically see the bubblegum and duct tape that the artists at Studio Shaft were using to hold the production together. “We Failed” is by no means the prettiest episode of Madoka Magica ever produced, but it looks solid, and my biggest hope for this extra-short final season is that the overall aesthetic of the franchise isn't compromised because of scheduling and production errors. Lord knows that the poor crew deserves one hell of a vacation at this point.    All that said, do I think that Magia Record's final season will end up doing the spinoff justice? It's tough to say. I've always had a mixed relationship with Magia Record; at its best, it feels like a genuine and compelling expansion of the entire Madoka Magica universe, but at its worst, it becomes borderline incomprehensible. I think the good of the series generally outweighs the bad, though, and if you're at all a fan of the Madoka Magica franchise, I believe (and I hope) that you'll have a mostly good time with Magia Record. Just, you know, make sure to watch the other two seasons first if you're new to the series.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               This episode might as well have been called “30 Minutes of Answers.” In one self-contained flashback, it lays out every major remaining mystery in the series and thoroughly unravels them. However, the way it does this feels completely natural through yet another story of Madoka Magica-themed suffering.    As it goes with most of these stories, it begins with Kyubey preying on Iroha's fears for Ui and tricking her into becoming a magical girl. What's interesting here is that Ui, Nemu, and Touka are able to see through Kyubey's half-truths and uncover what is really going on.

Still, seeing everything laid out in a more traditional narrative fashion sure is satisfying for longtime viewers of the series, and it helps to contextualize a lot of elements of the series as we head into Magia Record's final act. The full scope of Ui's disappearance from the world is explained, we understand how all three of the Hospital Gang ended up as Magical Girls in the first place, and how Touka became the Uwasa creating villain that she was in the first two seasons of the show. We even finally get an explanation for Baby Kyubey, and it's a lot more reasonable than I was expecting!    The second season of the show was also notable for its extreme highs and lows in production quality. A few of its episodes ranked among the best spectacle that the franchise has ever delivered, and at the same time, the final entries of the season were stretched so thin that you could practically see the bubblegum and duct tape that the artists at Studio Shaft were using to hold the production together. “We Failed” is by no means the prettiest episode of Madoka Magica ever produced, but it looks solid, and my biggest hope for this extra-short final season is that the overall aesthetic of the franchise isn't compromised because of scheduling and production errors. Lord knows that the poor crew deserves one hell of a vacation at this point.    All that said, do I think that Magia Record's final season will end up doing the spinoff justice? It's tough to say. I've always had a mixed relationship with Magia Record; at its best, it feels like a genuine and compelling expansion of the entire Madoka Magica universe, but at its worst, it becomes borderline incomprehensible. I think the good of the series generally outweighs the bad, though, and if you're at all a fan of the Madoka Magica franchise, I believe (and I hope) that you'll have a mostly good time with Magia Record. Just, you know, make sure to watch the other two seasons first if you're new to the series.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               This episode might as well have been called “30 Minutes of Answers.” In one self-contained flashback, it lays out every major remaining mystery in the series and thoroughly unravels them. However, the way it does this feels completely natural through yet another story of Madoka Magica-themed suffering.    As it goes with most of these stories, it begins with Kyubey preying on Iroha's fears for Ui and tricking her into becoming a magical girl. What's interesting here is that Ui, Nemu, and Touka are able to see through Kyubey's half-truths and uncover what is really going on. And like Madoka in the main series, the three sickly girls figure out the bunny-cat's biggest weakness: he has to grant wishes. He literally can't stop himself.    This, of course, kicks off their search for the perfect wish—or rather, set of wishes—to break Kyubey's system and allow the remaining magical girls to live normally even after all witches are exterminated. Their solution is basically to become Kyubey themselves—feeding the collected energy back into the magical girls rather than keeping it for themselves. The problem is that they never considered what would happen to the one taking in all the negative magical girl emotions—i.e., that they'd become a witch in seconds.    Basically, this episode is a tragedy centered around hubris. The three girls think that after a bit of research they can game the system and save the world. But instead, they arguably make things worse, leading to almost all of the tragedy we've seen in the series so far.    What's truly heartbreaking, though, is the effect that comes from isolating Ui's fractured soul inside of Kyubey. Like with Madoka at the end of the main series, this places her outside of reality—as if she never existed in the first place. This drastically changes the personalities of those closest to her (namely, Touka) and makes the previous seasons gain yet another layer of tragedy in retrospect. All in all, it's a fantastic amalgamation of lore and character building that has me pumped to see where things will go in our final three episodes.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives    ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

James Beckett  Rating:                I'm just going to get the full title out of the way up top, since it tells you everything you need to know about the show. This is Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story Final Season -The Dawn of the Ephemeral Dream-, a four-episode mini-season that is meant to conclude the nearly three-year-long odyssey of this messy but ambitious Madoka Magica spinoff. It seems odd to call this a “preview"" since in just this one episode we're covering a full quarter of this long-awaited conclusion, but thems the breaks, I suppose.    Going into -The Dawn of the Ephemeral Dream-, the main question on everyone's mind, including mine, is going to be whether or not a mere four-episode arc will be enough to draw the story of Magia Record to a satisfying conclusion. The thing about “We Failed” is that it's a flashback episode, devoted entirely to explaining the origins of the antagonist cadre of Magical Girls known as the Wings of Magius, so we don't get much in the way of narrative progression here.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove it. r=1-sinθ   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove It. r=1-sinθ (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 3.8              What is this?   Yukimura and Himuro are both graduate students working in the same lab and a prospective couple. However, despite feelings that seem obvious to their lab mates, the pair insist on scientifically quantifying ""love"" in order to empirically prove their attraction to one another. Their quest expands beyond their own lab and into their college's natural science department.    Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove it is based on Alifred Yamamoto's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                While this may be a season premiere, it sure doesn't feel like it—though that's not to say our characters haven't changed since we last saw them. The first season ended on an exceedingly high note with our main couple achieving the scientificly perfect romantic kiss. While the data for said kiss may be lost, the emotional effect on Yukimura and Himuro is all too evident. The two are more driven than ever to not only prove their “love formula,” but assert their love for each other through it.    The thing is, the perfect kiss has given the two a bit of an ego—after all, it was the single most romantic moment of their (romantically inexperienced) lives. Up until this point, Yukimura and Himuro have studied the love lives of those they had access to—e.g., Kotsuke's love for his 2D girlfriend and Kanade's unrequited love for her teacher, but the only truly reciprocal relationship they've been able to use as a reference point is their own—which neither are sure is “love” in the first place.    Enter Chris and Suiu. Our newest eccentric pair of scientists are a couple made up of a submissive yet passionate man and an extremely sensual and provocative woman. Not only have they been in a long-term relationship of four years, they are as into each other as Gomez and Morticia Addams. Threatened by a couple so obviously in love, what should be nothing more than a gathering of samples turns into a contest between the couples to determine which is more in love based on oxytocin levels.    While this makes for some of the worst science the two have been involved in, it shows just how desperate Yukimura and Himuro are—and how inexperienced. They completely forget that their goal is to simply prove that they are in love, instead of being the most in love couple in the world. While data from Chris and Suiu is important, it is not the baseline for romantic relationships. They would need to do a similar experiment with much tighter controlled variables and a sample size of hundreds to establish that. However, this doesn't stop Yukimura and Himuro from giving into the irrational fear that  Chris and Suiu might be the baseline. And should they fail to match up to the lovey-dovey pair, then they would be forced to choose between their feelings and the scientific truth to which they have devoted their lives. The whole situation is both good character-building and solid setup for comedic moments. And hopefully, after cooling down a bit, they'll be able to realize this and continue on with their scientific exploration of love.       Lynzee Loveridge  Rating:                It's been about two years since we last saw Ayame Himuro and Shinya Yukimura attempt to quantify their feelings for one another and honestly, I feel a little bad that this show has to compete with a somewhat similarly-themed (but immensely more popular) Kaguya-sama. Like that show, we have a primary couple that has caught the doki-dokis for each other but will not outright admit it. Himuro and Yukimura are dead set on gathering evidence to support their feelings, leading to smooching under the pretense of science.    The show has about one joke in its roster and the animation, both in terms of movement and color design, is a little lackluster. Science Fell in Love instead rides purely on charm and for the most part, I'd say it's successful. Himuro and Yukimura's awkwardness isn't overplayed; it could have easily devolved into ""oh god get on with it already"" but neither party is in denial and despite not putting a label on it, both are also enthusiastic about the relationship's romantic progression. They want to kiss and cuddle and thankfully the story finds ways to let them even if its under the guise of a scientific pretense.    The introduction of Chris and Suiu also helps shake things up. The saliva-obsessed ""courtesan"" and her lovestruck English boyfriend make for a fun counter to the less confident couple. I mean, I could do without the glittering, highly-detailed spit but since this episode centers entirely around the fluid and how to measure different hormones in it, I can let it go. Also glad to see the ""edutainment"" aspect return in order to teach us all how elaborate scientific equipment is used (and how your dryer is just another version of a centrifuge).    Science Fell in Love is a cute show. It's not going to do anything amazing, but there are worse ways to spend your time than with a group of dorks fumbling through their romance.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review          1 comment       Hello, Melancholic!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove it. r=1-sinθ   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove It. r=1-sinθ (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 3.8              What is this?   Yukimura and Himuro are both graduate students working in the same lab and a prospective couple. However, despite feelings that seem obvious to their lab mates, the pair insist on scientifically quantifying ""love"" in order to empirically prove their attraction to one another. Their quest expands beyond their own lab and into their college's natural science department.    Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove it is based on Alifred Yamamoto's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                While this may be a season premiere, it sure doesn't feel like it—though that's not to say our characters haven't changed since we last saw them. The first season ended on an exceedingly high note with our main couple achieving the scientificly perfect romantic kiss. While the data for said kiss may be lost, the emotional effect on Yukimura and Himuro is all too evident. The two are more driven than ever to not only prove their “love formula,” but assert their love for each other through it.    The thing is, the perfect kiss has given the two a bit of an ego—after all, it was the single most romantic moment of their (romantically inexperienced) lives. Up until this point, Yukimura and Himuro have studied the love lives of those they had access to—e.g., Kotsuke's love for his 2D girlfriend and Kanade's unrequited love for her teacher, but the only truly reciprocal relationship they've been able to use as a reference point is their own—which neither are sure is “love” in the first place.    Enter Chris and Suiu. Our newest eccentric pair of scientists are a couple made up of a submissive yet passionate man and an extremely sensual and provocative woman. Not only have they been in a long-term relationship of four years, they are as into each other as Gomez and Morticia Addams. Threatened by a couple so obviously in love, what should be nothing more than a gathering of samples turns into a contest between the couples to determine which is more in love based on oxytocin levels.    While this makes for some of the worst science the two have been involved in, it shows just how desperate Yukimura and Himuro are—and how inexperienced. They completely forget that their goal is to simply prove that they are in love, instead of being the most in love couple in the world. While data from Chris and Suiu is important, it is not the baseline for romantic relationships. They would need to do a similar experiment with much tighter controlled variables and a sample size of hundreds to establish that. However, this doesn't stop Yukimura and Himuro from giving into the irrational fear that  Chris and Suiu might be the baseline. And should they fail to match up to the lovey-dovey pair, then they would be forced to choose between their feelings and the scientific truth to which they have devoted their lives. The whole situation is both good character-building and solid setup for comedic moments. And hopefully, after cooling down a bit, they'll be able to realize this and continue on with their scientific exploration of love.       Lynzee Loveridge  Rating:                It's been about two years since we last saw Ayame Himuro and Shinya Yukimura attempt to quantify their feelings for one another and honestly, I feel a little bad that this show has to compete with a somewhat similarly-themed (but immensely more popular) Kaguya-sama. Like that show, we have a primary couple that has caught the doki-dokis for each other but will not outright admit it. Himuro and Yukimura are dead set on gathering evidence to support their feelings, leading to smooching under the pretense of science.    The show has about one joke in its roster and the animation, both in terms of movement and color design, is a little lackluster. Science Fell in Love instead rides purely on charm and for the most part, I'd say it's successful. Himuro and Yukimura's awkwardness isn't overplayed; it could have easily devolved into ""oh god get on with it already"" but neither party is in denial and despite not putting a label on it, both are also enthusiastic about the relationship's romantic progression. They want to kiss and cuddle and thankfully the story finds ways to let them even if its under the guise of a scientific pretense.    The introduction of Chris and Suiu also helps shake things up. The saliva-obsessed ""courtesan"" and her lovestruck English boyfriend make for a fun counter to the less confident couple. I mean, I could do without the glittering, highly-detailed spit but since this episode centers entirely around the fluid and how to measure different hormones in it, I can let it go. Also glad to see the ""edutainment"" aspect return in order to teach us all how elaborate scientific equipment is used (and how your dryer is just another version of a centrifuge).    Science Fell in Love is a cute show. It's not going to do anything amazing, but there are worse ways to spend your time than with a group of dorks fumbling through their romance.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review          1 comment       Hello, Melancholic!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove it. r=1-sinθ   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove It. r=1-sinθ (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 3.8              What is this?   Yukimura and Himuro are both graduate students working in the same lab and a prospective couple. However, despite feelings that seem obvious to their lab mates, the pair insist on scientifically quantifying ""love"" in order to empirically prove their attraction to one another. Their quest expands beyond their own lab and into their college's natural science department.    Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove it is based on Alifred Yamamoto's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                While this may be a season premiere, it sure doesn't feel like it—though that's not to say our characters haven't changed since we last saw them. The first season ended on an exceedingly high note with our main couple achieving the scientificly perfect romantic kiss. While the data for said kiss may be lost, the emotional effect on Yukimura and Himuro is all too evident. The two are more driven than ever to not only prove their “love formula,” but assert their love for each other through it.    The thing is, the perfect kiss has given the two a bit of an ego—after all, it was the single most romantic moment of their (romantically inexperienced) lives. Up until this point, Yukimura and Himuro have studied the love lives of those they had access to—e.g., Kotsuke's love for his 2D girlfriend and Kanade's unrequited love for her teacher, but the only truly reciprocal relationship they've been able to use as a reference point is their own—which neither are sure is “love” in the first place.    Enter Chris and Suiu. Our newest eccentric pair of scientists are a couple made up of a submissive yet passionate man and an extremely sensual and provocative woman. Not only have they been in a long-term relationship of four years, they are as into each other as Gomez and Morticia Addams. Threatened by a couple so obviously in love, what should be nothing more than a gathering of samples turns into a contest between the couples to determine which is more in love based on oxytocin levels.    While this makes for some of the worst science the two have been involved in, it shows just how desperate Yukimura and Himuro are—and how inexperienced. They completely forget that their goal is to simply prove that they are in love, instead of being the most in love couple in the world. While data from Chris and Suiu is important, it is not the baseline for romantic relationships. They would need to do a similar experiment with much tighter controlled variables and a sample size of hundreds to establish that. However, this doesn't stop Yukimura and Himuro from giving into the irrational fear that  Chris and Suiu might be the baseline. And should they fail to match up to the lovey-dovey pair, then they would be forced to choose between their feelings and the scientific truth to which they have devoted their lives. The whole situation is both good character-building and solid setup for comedic moments. And hopefully, after cooling down a bit, they'll be able to realize this and continue on with their scientific exploration of love.       Lynzee Loveridge  Rating:                It's been about two years since we last saw Ayame Himuro and Shinya Yukimura attempt to quantify their feelings for one another and honestly, I feel a little bad that this show has to compete with a somewhat similarly-themed (but immensely more popular) Kaguya-sama. Like that show, we have a primary couple that has caught the doki-dokis for each other but will not outright admit it. Himuro and Yukimura are dead set on gathering evidence to support their feelings, leading to smooching under the pretense of science.    The show has about one joke in its roster and the animation, both in terms of movement and color design, is a little lackluster. Science Fell in Love instead rides purely on charm and for the most part, I'd say it's successful. Himuro and Yukimura's awkwardness isn't overplayed; it could have easily devolved into ""oh god get on with it already"" but neither party is in denial and despite not putting a label on it, both are also enthusiastic about the relationship's romantic progression. They want to kiss and cuddle and thankfully the story finds ways to let them even if its under the guise of a scientific pretense.    The introduction of Chris and Suiu also helps shake things up. The saliva-obsessed ""courtesan"" and her lovestruck English boyfriend make for a fun counter to the less confident couple. I mean, I could do without the glittering, highly-detailed spit but since this episode centers entirely around the fluid and how to measure different hormones in it, I can let it go. Also glad to see the ""edutainment"" aspect return in order to teach us all how elaborate scientific equipment is used (and how your dryer is just another version of a centrifuge).    Science Fell in Love is a cute show. It's not going to do anything amazing, but there are worse ways to spend your time than with a group of dorks fumbling through their romance.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review          1 comment       Hello, Melancholic!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove it. r=1-sinθ   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove It. r=1-sinθ (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 3.8              What is this?   Yukimura and Himuro are both graduate students working in the same lab and a prospective couple. However, despite feelings that seem obvious to their lab mates, the pair insist on scientifically quantifying ""love"" in order to empirically prove their attraction to one another. Their quest expands beyond their own lab and into their college's natural science department.    Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove it is based on Alifred Yamamoto's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                While this may be a season premiere, it sure doesn't feel like it—though that's not to say our characters haven't changed since we last saw them. The first season ended on an exceedingly high note with our main couple achieving the scientificly perfect romantic kiss. While the data for said kiss may be lost, the emotional effect on Yukimura and Himuro is all too evident. The two are more driven than ever to not only prove their “love formula,” but assert their love for each other through it.    The thing is, the perfect kiss has given the two a bit of an ego—after all, it was the single most romantic moment of their (romantically inexperienced) lives. Up until this point, Yukimura and Himuro have studied the love lives of those they had access to—e.g., Kotsuke's love for his 2D girlfriend and Kanade's unrequited love for her teacher, but the only truly reciprocal relationship they've been able to use as a reference point is their own—which neither are sure is “love” in the first place.    Enter Chris and Suiu. Our newest eccentric pair of scientists are a couple made up of a submissive yet passionate man and an extremely sensual and provocative woman. Not only have they been in a long-term relationship of four years, they are as into each other as Gomez and Morticia Addams. Threatened by a couple so obviously in love, what should be nothing more than a gathering of samples turns into a contest between the couples to determine which is more in love based on oxytocin levels.    While this makes for some of the worst science the two have been involved in, it shows just how desperate Yukimura and Himuro are—and how inexperienced. They completely forget that their goal is to simply prove that they are in love, instead of being the most in love couple in the world. While data from Chris and Suiu is important, it is not the baseline for romantic relationships. They would need to do a similar experiment with much tighter controlled variables and a sample size of hundreds to establish that. However, this doesn't stop Yukimura and Himuro from giving into the irrational fear that  Chris and Suiu might be the baseline. And should they fail to match up to the lovey-dovey pair, then they would be forced to choose between their feelings and the scientific truth to which they have devoted their lives. The whole situation is both good character-building and solid setup for comedic moments. And hopefully, after cooling down a bit, they'll be able to realize this and continue on with their scientific exploration of love.       Lynzee Loveridge  Rating:                It's been about two years since we last saw Ayame Himuro and Shinya Yukimura attempt to quantify their feelings for one another and honestly, I feel a little bad that this show has to compete with a somewhat similarly-themed (but immensely more popular) Kaguya-sama. Like that show, we have a primary couple that has caught the doki-dokis for each other but will not outright admit it. Himuro and Yukimura are dead set on gathering evidence to support their feelings, leading to smooching under the pretense of science.    The show has about one joke in its roster and the animation, both in terms of movement and color design, is a little lackluster. Science Fell in Love instead rides purely on charm and for the most part, I'd say it's successful. Himuro and Yukimura's awkwardness isn't overplayed; it could have easily devolved into ""oh god get on with it already"" but neither party is in denial and despite not putting a label on it, both are also enthusiastic about the relationship's romantic progression. They want to kiss and cuddle and thankfully the story finds ways to let them even if its under the guise of a scientific pretense.    The introduction of Chris and Suiu also helps shake things up. The saliva-obsessed ""courtesan"" and her lovestruck English boyfriend make for a fun counter to the less confident couple. I mean, I could do without the glittering, highly-detailed spit but since this episode centers entirely around the fluid and how to measure different hormones in it, I can let it go. Also glad to see the ""edutainment"" aspect return in order to teach us all how elaborate scientific equipment is used (and how your dryer is just another version of a centrifuge).    Science Fell in Love is a cute show. It's not going to do anything amazing, but there are worse ways to spend your time than with a group of dorks fumbling through their romance.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review          1 comment       Hello, Melancholic!

Which older games have you never found the time to experience? ― It's another one of those slow news weeks, where there's no one story or stories that stand out as particularly huge that I'd need to opine over.

We're finally exiting the doldrums of winter to enjoy the abundant foliage of spring.

How's Elden Ring going? Dying a lot in hilariously painful ways? Yeah, I figured. I'm sure you're aware by now, but there's some awful stuff going on in the world at the moment, and millions of civilians in Ukraine are struggling.

I want to discuss a multi-year gaming console trainwreck that's been impossible to turn away from.

Heidi breaks down what to expect. ― Greetings, everyone! I am quite relieved today, as it was very likely TWIG might not have happened this week. I got the letter in the mail that most every adult dreads: a jury duty summons, set for the exact day I write and submit TWIG. Thankfully, I wasn't needed, which frees me up to both ...                    column          14 comments       This Week in Games - What A Twist   Jan 22, 03:00 14 comments                 games    Good lord.

It feels like forever since we first saw the game revealed. Surprise, surprise – it's suffering from COVID-related development setbacks. ― Here we are, on the final day of 2021. While it wasn't the dumpster fire that 2020 was, I don't think anyone would say it was a particularly amazing year. We did get some darn good games out of it, at least!

It's also...                    column          4 comments       This Week in Games - Punching It Up   Nov 27, 02:08 4 comments                 games    with Christmas just around the corner, most of season's the major new releases have already hit shelves, and now it's simply a matter of finding time to play them all.

Folks, this is the textbook definition of a slow news week.

Unfortunately, most of us couldn't be there even if we wanted to, since it's still a royal pain in the butt to actually get through the country's COVID travel restrictions. Most of the publishers showcasing are announ...                    column          12 comments       This Week in Games - Maidragon Spirit   Sep 25, 00:30 12 comments                 games    Things have just gone from really bad to extremely worse over at the ongoing dumpster fire that is Activision-Blizzard corporate. ― Good day, my lovely ANN audience!

Welcome back to This Week in Games. It's a little bit of a light news week, which is probably for the best because, as you read this, I'll be in the hospital undergoing surgery. Nothing too major, and I should be back home for the weekend, but surgery is still not very fun in general! At least I have a bunch of Switch and PS4 ...                    column          5 comments       This Week in Games - The Abyss Beckons   May  8, 03:30 5 comments                 games    Companies that have dealt with Apple and/or Epic – which is roughly 98% of the game industry – are scrambling to make sure these two firms don't accidentally leak stuff while they engage in their courtroom slapfight.

Well, it's the end of April, and so far, 2021's been a great year for gaming. The release schedule is calming down a bit in May, but I can understand why – most publishers really don't want to compete with Resident Evil Village.

Just a heads-up: This Week in Games is probably going to be a Friday thing from now on. This benefits me because game companies, for whatever reason, just love dumping news on Thursdays, leaving me to either delay the column or look horribly out of date. Hopefully Friday publication solves this issue somewhat.

Heidi discusses what made the game so important in THIS WEEK IN GAMES. ― Hello again!

My man Keanu deserved better. ― Ho ho ho, Merry TWIGmas everyone! A little late, I know, but we're still in the holiday spirit.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Estab-Life: Great Escape   Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Estab-Life: Great Escape ?                     Community score: 2.9                  How would you rate episode 2 of Estab-Life: Great Escape ?                     Community score: 3.0              What is this?   The world population has begun to shrink after reaching its peak. The ""Supernatural Renovation Project"" splits Tokyo with towering walls into several Cluster neighborhoods, each with its own unique genetically modified populations, governed by artificial intelligence. Most people live their lives in their own unique Clusters, blissfully unconcerned with life beyond. However, there are some who seek to escape to the other Clusters. An outfit called Nigashiya helps those who wish to escape.    Estab-Life: Great Escape is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll.      How was the first episode?    Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                You've gotta hand it to Goro Taniguchi. In an industry that always hesitates to release original projects, he's leveraged the success of Code Geass into nearly a decade of making original sci-fi TV series. Granted, none of those creations have managed to be better than “just okay” – a streak that looks to continue with Estab-Life – but you have to respect the hustle. And while I probably won't be watching more of this one, I can at least say I had fun with these introductory episodes.    In a word, Estab-Life is busy. Busy in its aesthetic, with the mishmash of colors and designs that constitute our main characters, the design of the sci-fi world they inhabit, and the occasionally well-executed but largely workmanlike CG animation. Busy in its worldbuilding, as it throws concepts like slime girls and wolf men and “Gun Wizards” at the audience with not a second of exposition to clue you in, while only barely communicating its central conceit of closed-off post-apocalypse cities that our heroes help traffic people in-between. Busy in its tone, as these opening episodes attempt to balance snazzy spy action, goofy comedy, and quiet poignancy in ways that work more than you'd expect, but still not often enough to be effective. There's a lot going on here, and the show is never as graceful about any of it as you'd hope for.    That said, I'm a fan of offbeat sci-fi series, and that's very much the vibe I get from this premiere. The characters are simple archetypes with just enough personality to be likable, and they flit between the high-flying sci-fi action setpieces with just the right amount of energy. That's a good thing to have for what is likely to be an episodic series of missions and character pieces, and if the writing can deliver interesting individual stories it may just be worth keeping up with. I was actually pretty charmed by episode two, with the grizzled yakuza boss who yearns to escape Shinjuku's criminal underbelly and achieve his dream of becoming a magical girl. It's silly and it knows it, but there's an earnest feeling to the comedy that invites you to cheer for him and the other characters rather than trying to laugh at him. There's a central idea that it's ok, important even, to run away when you need to live a better life, and that compassion is a big part of what makes this whole scenario work so far. It's not deep, but it is heartfelt.    All in all this is still a pretty light watch. There's nothing all that compelling, but it has the potential for a fun weekly distraction if nothing else. Its biggest sin is the CG character animation, which isn't terrible but leaves a lot to be desired, especially for any character outside the main cast. I can't decide if the yakuza characters in episode two being identical sunglasses guys in suits is funny on purpose or by accident, but it most definitely saved production resources. But in a time when things like Rusted Armors can come out, I'm not going to complain about largely competent CG. Still, it's enough of a problem that I doubt I'll be sticking around for any more of this.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I feel like Estab-Life is the very definition of “okay.” The plot is contrived and silly, but okay enough to follow, the characters are basically clichés, but okay enough to pay attention to, and the animation isn't EX-ARM levels of bad, but okay enough to watch. It's not quite good enough to be middle-of-the-road, but okay enough to be relatively harmless viewing. The catch is of course that its conceit is on the weirder side of things and that it's animated in the sort of CGI that sends some people running for the hills, especially since “better than EX-ARM and Rusted Armors” isn't exactly a ringing endorsement. Personally, I'm more bothered by Feles' character design; I'd love to take a pair of scissors to that one hunk of hair that hangs over her eye. (Or possibly hedge trimmers; it looks awfully thick.)    While not a lot is explained about the story's world, it is easy enough to put the pieces together, and I do like that we aren't burdened with heavy amounts of exposition. We don't know what happened to break Tokyo up into “clusters,” but it seems to be similar to each ward turning back into its own small town, with the difference being that in the story's dystopian world, moving between them isn't easy and may be outright illegal. That's created the job our heroines do: extracting people from their present lives and moving them into a new one in a different cluster. As a concept, it's neat enough to work, and other bits of world-building thrown in gave it a bit of a fantasy edge from other dystopias, although I'm hoping I'm not the only one who thought of Dragon Half when Martes is revealed to be a slime half. I'm not sure what to make of Ulula the bipedal wolf/furry or some of the other oddball details like the client from the second episode wanting to become a magical girl despite being an old man. Some of them feel like they were just thrown in because they sounded funny to someone rather than having a distinct purpose to fill. (The girls' boss doing low-key dance moves to give them coded messages is another one of those moments.)    I think this may be one of those series that relies on viewer patience for its first third or so before it truly gets moving. The tonal differences between these two episodes, with the first being much more serious than the second, aren't a great sign that it knows what kind of story it wants to tell, and the characters really are pretty cookie-cutter, so if you aren't a fan of their archetypes, that could become an issue. But if you have the patience, I think this may be worth one or two more episodes just to see if it figures out where it's going and what it wants to be – and if the answer to the second question turns out to be something other than “just okay.”       James Beckett  Rating:                A quirk of technology made it so that I accidentally watched the second episode of Estab-Life: Great Escape before the first, and boy howdy, you can probably guess how confused I was when the trio of strange anime girls, their robot, and their anthropomorphic wolf buddy helped an aging yakuza boss shoot himself out of a cannon so he could fulfill his lifelong dream of becoming a magical girl. However, even the actual premiere is very much the kind of episode that is happy to let its audience stew in their confusion for a while as it drip feeds exposition and lore. This isn't a bad thing at all; it just means that even after a double dose of episodes for its premiere, I still don't really know what this show is about. It's pretty fun to watch the weird shenanigans unfold, though.    It also helps that, despite being a fully 3D production, Polygon Pictures has worked hard to ensure that Estab-Life isn't the kind of unholy trash fire that some recent CG anime have been. The facial animations are still plenty awkward, to be sure, and the character animation suffers from a lack of in-betweens to smooth out the transitions between different poses, but it is still a solid effort overall. The direction is efficient and adequately cinematic, and the show's color palette is sufficiently diverse and lush looking. The quality voice acting also livens up the proceedings too; Ekua, Feles, and Martes are all likable and interesting, even if we barely know anything about them yet (except for the fact that Martes is apparently made mostly out of slime, for some reason).    What remains to be seen is if writer Shoji Gatoh's absurd sense of humor is going to mix with the strange sort of pathos that Estab-Life is trying to get from the different clients that the Extractors are helping. Neither the mopey philosophy teacher nor the gung-ho magical girl yakuza boss was terribly interesting, but there's something about the show's nebulous tone that I can't help but find fascinating. I'm definitely willing to give the series another episode or two to see if it can get its hooks into me, but I won't get my hopes up too high, just in case Estab-Life collapses under the weight of its own eccentric ambitions.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                This first episode is a bit of an odd ride. It simply throws us into the middle of things and never really explains itself. And honestly, there is an interesting thought experiment at the center of this: Apparently in the future, Japan is split up into autonomous city-states, each with its own unique laws and varying levels of authoritarianism. In the more controlling states, you can't even decide your own job, much less leave the city-state to join another. Thus, there are “extractors” who illegally help people escape and start new lives elsewhere.    This premise looks primed to be a framework for exploring feelings of entrapment in our daily lives: Sometimes it's in a job we hate. Other times it's in a relationship we know is wrong but just can't seem to leave. Hell, sometimes, it's being trapped in your own skin—feeling the “you” inside doesn't match the outside.    Which is why it's such a shame that Estab-Life fails in every conceivable way to live up to its premise.    For this kind of high-concept story, you need to make the viewer on focus the themes being explored. Bland, one-note, and frankly annoying characters only distract from this. There is no one to really empathize with, not the main characters and not even our disheartened teacher-turned-escapee. (Honestly, if your students aren't taking in your lessons, maybe you need to change how you teach!)    Then there are the visuals. I won't say it looks terrible—we are in the age of EX-ARM and Tesla Note, after all—though they are certainly subpar for what can be done with 3D animation. The real problem is the accidental visual storytelling. Our characters never take cover in gun battles and just stand in the open shooting, implying they are either stupid or invincible. Later we watch a 100 lbs. schoolgirl climb a 10-floor vertical glass face with a 150 lbs. man attached to her back using only her arms. Does she have super strength or is this just bad writing? In the end, it doesn't really matter. What does matter is that it's a distraction from the themes the episode is trying to explore.    To put it as simply as possible: cool ideas, terrible execution.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review          1 comment       Hello, Melancholic!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Estab-Life: Great Escape   Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Estab-Life: Great Escape ?                     Community score: 2.9                  How would you rate episode 2 of Estab-Life: Great Escape ?                     Community score: 3.0              What is this?   The world population has begun to shrink after reaching its peak. The ""Supernatural Renovation Project"" splits Tokyo with towering walls into several Cluster neighborhoods, each with its own unique genetically modified populations, governed by artificial intelligence. Most people live their lives in their own unique Clusters, blissfully unconcerned with life beyond. However, there are some who seek to escape to the other Clusters. An outfit called Nigashiya helps those who wish to escape.    Estab-Life: Great Escape is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll.      How was the first episode?    Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                You've gotta hand it to Goro Taniguchi. In an industry that always hesitates to release original projects, he's leveraged the success of Code Geass into nearly a decade of making original sci-fi TV series. Granted, none of those creations have managed to be better than “just okay” – a streak that looks to continue with Estab-Life – but you have to respect the hustle. And while I probably won't be watching more of this one, I can at least say I had fun with these introductory episodes.    In a word, Estab-Life is busy. Busy in its aesthetic, with the mishmash of colors and designs that constitute our main characters, the design of the sci-fi world they inhabit, and the occasionally well-executed but largely workmanlike CG animation. Busy in its worldbuilding, as it throws concepts like slime girls and wolf men and “Gun Wizards” at the audience with not a second of exposition to clue you in, while only barely communicating its central conceit of closed-off post-apocalypse cities that our heroes help traffic people in-between. Busy in its tone, as these opening episodes attempt to balance snazzy spy action, goofy comedy, and quiet poignancy in ways that work more than you'd expect, but still not often enough to be effective. There's a lot going on here, and the show is never as graceful about any of it as you'd hope for.    That said, I'm a fan of offbeat sci-fi series, and that's very much the vibe I get from this premiere. The characters are simple archetypes with just enough personality to be likable, and they flit between the high-flying sci-fi action setpieces with just the right amount of energy. That's a good thing to have for what is likely to be an episodic series of missions and character pieces, and if the writing can deliver interesting individual stories it may just be worth keeping up with. I was actually pretty charmed by episode two, with the grizzled yakuza boss who yearns to escape Shinjuku's criminal underbelly and achieve his dream of becoming a magical girl. It's silly and it knows it, but there's an earnest feeling to the comedy that invites you to cheer for him and the other characters rather than trying to laugh at him. There's a central idea that it's ok, important even, to run away when you need to live a better life, and that compassion is a big part of what makes this whole scenario work so far. It's not deep, but it is heartfelt.    All in all this is still a pretty light watch. There's nothing all that compelling, but it has the potential for a fun weekly distraction if nothing else. Its biggest sin is the CG character animation, which isn't terrible but leaves a lot to be desired, especially for any character outside the main cast. I can't decide if the yakuza characters in episode two being identical sunglasses guys in suits is funny on purpose or by accident, but it most definitely saved production resources. But in a time when things like Rusted Armors can come out, I'm not going to complain about largely competent CG. Still, it's enough of a problem that I doubt I'll be sticking around for any more of this.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I feel like Estab-Life is the very definition of “okay.” The plot is contrived and silly, but okay enough to follow, the characters are basically clichés, but okay enough to pay attention to, and the animation isn't EX-ARM levels of bad, but okay enough to watch. It's not quite good enough to be middle-of-the-road, but okay enough to be relatively harmless viewing. The catch is of course that its conceit is on the weirder side of things and that it's animated in the sort of CGI that sends some people running for the hills, especially since “better than EX-ARM and Rusted Armors” isn't exactly a ringing endorsement. Personally, I'm more bothered by Feles' character design; I'd love to take a pair of scissors to that one hunk of hair that hangs over her eye. (Or possibly hedge trimmers; it looks awfully thick.)    While not a lot is explained about the story's world, it is easy enough to put the pieces together, and I do like that we aren't burdened with heavy amounts of exposition. We don't know what happened to break Tokyo up into “clusters,” but it seems to be similar to each ward turning back into its own small town, with the difference being that in the story's dystopian world, moving between them isn't easy and may be outright illegal. That's created the job our heroines do: extracting people from their present lives and moving them into a new one in a different cluster. As a concept, it's neat enough to work, and other bits of world-building thrown in gave it a bit of a fantasy edge from other dystopias, although I'm hoping I'm not the only one who thought of Dragon Half when Martes is revealed to be a slime half. I'm not sure what to make of Ulula the bipedal wolf/furry or some of the other oddball details like the client from the second episode wanting to become a magical girl despite being an old man. Some of them feel like they were just thrown in because they sounded funny to someone rather than having a distinct purpose to fill. (The girls' boss doing low-key dance moves to give them coded messages is another one of those moments.)    I think this may be one of those series that relies on viewer patience for its first third or so before it truly gets moving. The tonal differences between these two episodes, with the first being much more serious than the second, aren't a great sign that it knows what kind of story it wants to tell, and the characters really are pretty cookie-cutter, so if you aren't a fan of their archetypes, that could become an issue. But if you have the patience, I think this may be worth one or two more episodes just to see if it figures out where it's going and what it wants to be – and if the answer to the second question turns out to be something other than “just okay.”       James Beckett  Rating:                A quirk of technology made it so that I accidentally watched the second episode of Estab-Life: Great Escape before the first, and boy howdy, you can probably guess how confused I was when the trio of strange anime girls, their robot, and their anthropomorphic wolf buddy helped an aging yakuza boss shoot himself out of a cannon so he could fulfill his lifelong dream of becoming a magical girl. However, even the actual premiere is very much the kind of episode that is happy to let its audience stew in their confusion for a while as it drip feeds exposition and lore. This isn't a bad thing at all; it just means that even after a double dose of episodes for its premiere, I still don't really know what this show is about. It's pretty fun to watch the weird shenanigans unfold, though.    It also helps that, despite being a fully 3D production, Polygon Pictures has worked hard to ensure that Estab-Life isn't the kind of unholy trash fire that some recent CG anime have been. The facial animations are still plenty awkward, to be sure, and the character animation suffers from a lack of in-betweens to smooth out the transitions between different poses, but it is still a solid effort overall. The direction is efficient and adequately cinematic, and the show's color palette is sufficiently diverse and lush looking. The quality voice acting also livens up the proceedings too; Ekua, Feles, and Martes are all likable and interesting, even if we barely know anything about them yet (except for the fact that Martes is apparently made mostly out of slime, for some reason).    What remains to be seen is if writer Shoji Gatoh's absurd sense of humor is going to mix with the strange sort of pathos that Estab-Life is trying to get from the different clients that the Extractors are helping. Neither the mopey philosophy teacher nor the gung-ho magical girl yakuza boss was terribly interesting, but there's something about the show's nebulous tone that I can't help but find fascinating. I'm definitely willing to give the series another episode or two to see if it can get its hooks into me, but I won't get my hopes up too high, just in case Estab-Life collapses under the weight of its own eccentric ambitions.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                This first episode is a bit of an odd ride. It simply throws us into the middle of things and never really explains itself. And honestly, there is an interesting thought experiment at the center of this: Apparently in the future, Japan is split up into autonomous city-states, each with its own unique laws and varying levels of authoritarianism. In the more controlling states, you can't even decide your own job, much less leave the city-state to join another. Thus, there are “extractors” who illegally help people escape and start new lives elsewhere.    This premise looks primed to be a framework for exploring feelings of entrapment in our daily lives: Sometimes it's in a job we hate. Other times it's in a relationship we know is wrong but just can't seem to leave. Hell, sometimes, it's being trapped in your own skin—feeling the “you” inside doesn't match the outside.    Which is why it's such a shame that Estab-Life fails in every conceivable way to live up to its premise.    For this kind of high-concept story, you need to make the viewer on focus the themes being explored. Bland, one-note, and frankly annoying characters only distract from this. There is no one to really empathize with, not the main characters and not even our disheartened teacher-turned-escapee. (Honestly, if your students aren't taking in your lessons, maybe you need to change how you teach!)    Then there are the visuals. I won't say it looks terrible—we are in the age of EX-ARM and Tesla Note, after all—though they are certainly subpar for what can be done with 3D animation. The real problem is the accidental visual storytelling. Our characters never take cover in gun battles and just stand in the open shooting, implying they are either stupid or invincible. Later we watch a 100 lbs. schoolgirl climb a 10-floor vertical glass face with a 150 lbs. man attached to her back using only her arms. Does she have super strength or is this just bad writing? In the end, it doesn't really matter. What does matter is that it's a distraction from the themes the episode is trying to explore.    To put it as simply as possible: cool ideas, terrible execution.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review          1 comment       Hello, Melancholic!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Estab-Life: Great Escape   Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Estab-Life: Great Escape ?                     Community score: 2.9                  How would you rate episode 2 of Estab-Life: Great Escape ?                     Community score: 3.0              What is this?   The world population has begun to shrink after reaching its peak. The ""Supernatural Renovation Project"" splits Tokyo with towering walls into several Cluster neighborhoods, each with its own unique genetically modified populations, governed by artificial intelligence. Most people live their lives in their own unique Clusters, blissfully unconcerned with life beyond. However, there are some who seek to escape to the other Clusters. An outfit called Nigashiya helps those who wish to escape.    Estab-Life: Great Escape is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll.      How was the first episode?    Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                You've gotta hand it to Goro Taniguchi. In an industry that always hesitates to release original projects, he's leveraged the success of Code Geass into nearly a decade of making original sci-fi TV series. Granted, none of those creations have managed to be better than “just okay” – a streak that looks to continue with Estab-Life – but you have to respect the hustle. And while I probably won't be watching more of this one, I can at least say I had fun with these introductory episodes.    In a word, Estab-Life is busy. Busy in its aesthetic, with the mishmash of colors and designs that constitute our main characters, the design of the sci-fi world they inhabit, and the occasionally well-executed but largely workmanlike CG animation. Busy in its worldbuilding, as it throws concepts like slime girls and wolf men and “Gun Wizards” at the audience with not a second of exposition to clue you in, while only barely communicating its central conceit of closed-off post-apocalypse cities that our heroes help traffic people in-between. Busy in its tone, as these opening episodes attempt to balance snazzy spy action, goofy comedy, and quiet poignancy in ways that work more than you'd expect, but still not often enough to be effective. There's a lot going on here, and the show is never as graceful about any of it as you'd hope for.    That said, I'm a fan of offbeat sci-fi series, and that's very much the vibe I get from this premiere. The characters are simple archetypes with just enough personality to be likable, and they flit between the high-flying sci-fi action setpieces with just the right amount of energy. That's a good thing to have for what is likely to be an episodic series of missions and character pieces, and if the writing can deliver interesting individual stories it may just be worth keeping up with. I was actually pretty charmed by episode two, with the grizzled yakuza boss who yearns to escape Shinjuku's criminal underbelly and achieve his dream of becoming a magical girl. It's silly and it knows it, but there's an earnest feeling to the comedy that invites you to cheer for him and the other characters rather than trying to laugh at him. There's a central idea that it's ok, important even, to run away when you need to live a better life, and that compassion is a big part of what makes this whole scenario work so far. It's not deep, but it is heartfelt.    All in all this is still a pretty light watch. There's nothing all that compelling, but it has the potential for a fun weekly distraction if nothing else. Its biggest sin is the CG character animation, which isn't terrible but leaves a lot to be desired, especially for any character outside the main cast. I can't decide if the yakuza characters in episode two being identical sunglasses guys in suits is funny on purpose or by accident, but it most definitely saved production resources. But in a time when things like Rusted Armors can come out, I'm not going to complain about largely competent CG. Still, it's enough of a problem that I doubt I'll be sticking around for any more of this.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I feel like Estab-Life is the very definition of “okay.” The plot is contrived and silly, but okay enough to follow, the characters are basically clichés, but okay enough to pay attention to, and the animation isn't EX-ARM levels of bad, but okay enough to watch. It's not quite good enough to be middle-of-the-road, but okay enough to be relatively harmless viewing. The catch is of course that its conceit is on the weirder side of things and that it's animated in the sort of CGI that sends some people running for the hills, especially since “better than EX-ARM and Rusted Armors” isn't exactly a ringing endorsement. Personally, I'm more bothered by Feles' character design; I'd love to take a pair of scissors to that one hunk of hair that hangs over her eye. (Or possibly hedge trimmers; it looks awfully thick.)    While not a lot is explained about the story's world, it is easy enough to put the pieces together, and I do like that we aren't burdened with heavy amounts of exposition. We don't know what happened to break Tokyo up into “clusters,” but it seems to be similar to each ward turning back into its own small town, with the difference being that in the story's dystopian world, moving between them isn't easy and may be outright illegal. That's created the job our heroines do: extracting people from their present lives and moving them into a new one in a different cluster. As a concept, it's neat enough to work, and other bits of world-building thrown in gave it a bit of a fantasy edge from other dystopias, although I'm hoping I'm not the only one who thought of Dragon Half when Martes is revealed to be a slime half. I'm not sure what to make of Ulula the bipedal wolf/furry or some of the other oddball details like the client from the second episode wanting to become a magical girl despite being an old man. Some of them feel like they were just thrown in because they sounded funny to someone rather than having a distinct purpose to fill. (The girls' boss doing low-key dance moves to give them coded messages is another one of those moments.)    I think this may be one of those series that relies on viewer patience for its first third or so before it truly gets moving. The tonal differences between these two episodes, with the first being much more serious than the second, aren't a great sign that it knows what kind of story it wants to tell, and the characters really are pretty cookie-cutter, so if you aren't a fan of their archetypes, that could become an issue. But if you have the patience, I think this may be worth one or two more episodes just to see if it figures out where it's going and what it wants to be – and if the answer to the second question turns out to be something other than “just okay.”       James Beckett  Rating:                A quirk of technology made it so that I accidentally watched the second episode of Estab-Life: Great Escape before the first, and boy howdy, you can probably guess how confused I was when the trio of strange anime girls, their robot, and their anthropomorphic wolf buddy helped an aging yakuza boss shoot himself out of a cannon so he could fulfill his lifelong dream of becoming a magical girl. However, even the actual premiere is very much the kind of episode that is happy to let its audience stew in their confusion for a while as it drip feeds exposition and lore. This isn't a bad thing at all; it just means that even after a double dose of episodes for its premiere, I still don't really know what this show is about. It's pretty fun to watch the weird shenanigans unfold, though.    It also helps that, despite being a fully 3D production, Polygon Pictures has worked hard to ensure that Estab-Life isn't the kind of unholy trash fire that some recent CG anime have been. The facial animations are still plenty awkward, to be sure, and the character animation suffers from a lack of in-betweens to smooth out the transitions between different poses, but it is still a solid effort overall. The direction is efficient and adequately cinematic, and the show's color palette is sufficiently diverse and lush looking. The quality voice acting also livens up the proceedings too; Ekua, Feles, and Martes are all likable and interesting, even if we barely know anything about them yet (except for the fact that Martes is apparently made mostly out of slime, for some reason).    What remains to be seen is if writer Shoji Gatoh's absurd sense of humor is going to mix with the strange sort of pathos that Estab-Life is trying to get from the different clients that the Extractors are helping. Neither the mopey philosophy teacher nor the gung-ho magical girl yakuza boss was terribly interesting, but there's something about the show's nebulous tone that I can't help but find fascinating. I'm definitely willing to give the series another episode or two to see if it can get its hooks into me, but I won't get my hopes up too high, just in case Estab-Life collapses under the weight of its own eccentric ambitions.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                This first episode is a bit of an odd ride. It simply throws us into the middle of things and never really explains itself. And honestly, there is an interesting thought experiment at the center of this: Apparently in the future, Japan is split up into autonomous city-states, each with its own unique laws and varying levels of authoritarianism. In the more controlling states, you can't even decide your own job, much less leave the city-state to join another. Thus, there are “extractors” who illegally help people escape and start new lives elsewhere.    This premise looks primed to be a framework for exploring feelings of entrapment in our daily lives: Sometimes it's in a job we hate. Other times it's in a relationship we know is wrong but just can't seem to leave. Hell, sometimes, it's being trapped in your own skin—feeling the “you” inside doesn't match the outside.    Which is why it's such a shame that Estab-Life fails in every conceivable way to live up to its premise.    For this kind of high-concept story, you need to make the viewer on focus the themes being explored. Bland, one-note, and frankly annoying characters only distract from this. There is no one to really empathize with, not the main characters and not even our disheartened teacher-turned-escapee. (Honestly, if your students aren't taking in your lessons, maybe you need to change how you teach!)    Then there are the visuals. I won't say it looks terrible—we are in the age of EX-ARM and Tesla Note, after all—though they are certainly subpar for what can be done with 3D animation. The real problem is the accidental visual storytelling. Our characters never take cover in gun battles and just stand in the open shooting, implying they are either stupid or invincible. Later we watch a 100 lbs. schoolgirl climb a 10-floor vertical glass face with a 150 lbs. man attached to her back using only her arms. Does she have super strength or is this just bad writing? In the end, it doesn't really matter. What does matter is that it's a distraction from the themes the episode is trying to explore.    To put it as simply as possible: cool ideas, terrible execution.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review          1 comment       Hello, Melancholic!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Estab-Life: Great Escape   Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Estab-Life: Great Escape ?                     Community score: 2.9                  How would you rate episode 2 of Estab-Life: Great Escape ?                     Community score: 3.0              What is this?   The world population has begun to shrink after reaching its peak. The ""Supernatural Renovation Project"" splits Tokyo with towering walls into several Cluster neighborhoods, each with its own unique genetically modified populations, governed by artificial intelligence. Most people live their lives in their own unique Clusters, blissfully unconcerned with life beyond. However, there are some who seek to escape to the other Clusters. An outfit called Nigashiya helps those who wish to escape.    Estab-Life: Great Escape is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll.      How was the first episode?    Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                You've gotta hand it to Goro Taniguchi. In an industry that always hesitates to release original projects, he's leveraged the success of Code Geass into nearly a decade of making original sci-fi TV series. Granted, none of those creations have managed to be better than “just okay” – a streak that looks to continue with Estab-Life – but you have to respect the hustle. And while I probably won't be watching more of this one, I can at least say I had fun with these introductory episodes.    In a word, Estab-Life is busy. Busy in its aesthetic, with the mishmash of colors and designs that constitute our main characters, the design of the sci-fi world they inhabit, and the occasionally well-executed but largely workmanlike CG animation. Busy in its worldbuilding, as it throws concepts like slime girls and wolf men and “Gun Wizards” at the audience with not a second of exposition to clue you in, while only barely communicating its central conceit of closed-off post-apocalypse cities that our heroes help traffic people in-between. Busy in its tone, as these opening episodes attempt to balance snazzy spy action, goofy comedy, and quiet poignancy in ways that work more than you'd expect, but still not often enough to be effective. There's a lot going on here, and the show is never as graceful about any of it as you'd hope for.    That said, I'm a fan of offbeat sci-fi series, and that's very much the vibe I get from this premiere. The characters are simple archetypes with just enough personality to be likable, and they flit between the high-flying sci-fi action setpieces with just the right amount of energy. That's a good thing to have for what is likely to be an episodic series of missions and character pieces, and if the writing can deliver interesting individual stories it may just be worth keeping up with. I was actually pretty charmed by episode two, with the grizzled yakuza boss who yearns to escape Shinjuku's criminal underbelly and achieve his dream of becoming a magical girl. It's silly and it knows it, but there's an earnest feeling to the comedy that invites you to cheer for him and the other characters rather than trying to laugh at him. There's a central idea that it's ok, important even, to run away when you need to live a better life, and that compassion is a big part of what makes this whole scenario work so far. It's not deep, but it is heartfelt.    All in all this is still a pretty light watch. There's nothing all that compelling, but it has the potential for a fun weekly distraction if nothing else. Its biggest sin is the CG character animation, which isn't terrible but leaves a lot to be desired, especially for any character outside the main cast. I can't decide if the yakuza characters in episode two being identical sunglasses guys in suits is funny on purpose or by accident, but it most definitely saved production resources. But in a time when things like Rusted Armors can come out, I'm not going to complain about largely competent CG. Still, it's enough of a problem that I doubt I'll be sticking around for any more of this.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I feel like Estab-Life is the very definition of “okay.” The plot is contrived and silly, but okay enough to follow, the characters are basically clichés, but okay enough to pay attention to, and the animation isn't EX-ARM levels of bad, but okay enough to watch. It's not quite good enough to be middle-of-the-road, but okay enough to be relatively harmless viewing. The catch is of course that its conceit is on the weirder side of things and that it's animated in the sort of CGI that sends some people running for the hills, especially since “better than EX-ARM and Rusted Armors” isn't exactly a ringing endorsement. Personally, I'm more bothered by Feles' character design; I'd love to take a pair of scissors to that one hunk of hair that hangs over her eye. (Or possibly hedge trimmers; it looks awfully thick.)    While not a lot is explained about the story's world, it is easy enough to put the pieces together, and I do like that we aren't burdened with heavy amounts of exposition. We don't know what happened to break Tokyo up into “clusters,” but it seems to be similar to each ward turning back into its own small town, with the difference being that in the story's dystopian world, moving between them isn't easy and may be outright illegal. That's created the job our heroines do: extracting people from their present lives and moving them into a new one in a different cluster. As a concept, it's neat enough to work, and other bits of world-building thrown in gave it a bit of a fantasy edge from other dystopias, although I'm hoping I'm not the only one who thought of Dragon Half when Martes is revealed to be a slime half. I'm not sure what to make of Ulula the bipedal wolf/furry or some of the other oddball details like the client from the second episode wanting to become a magical girl despite being an old man. Some of them feel like they were just thrown in because they sounded funny to someone rather than having a distinct purpose to fill. (The girls' boss doing low-key dance moves to give them coded messages is another one of those moments.)    I think this may be one of those series that relies on viewer patience for its first third or so before it truly gets moving. The tonal differences between these two episodes, with the first being much more serious than the second, aren't a great sign that it knows what kind of story it wants to tell, and the characters really are pretty cookie-cutter, so if you aren't a fan of their archetypes, that could become an issue. But if you have the patience, I think this may be worth one or two more episodes just to see if it figures out where it's going and what it wants to be – and if the answer to the second question turns out to be something other than “just okay.”       James Beckett  Rating:                A quirk of technology made it so that I accidentally watched the second episode of Estab-Life: Great Escape before the first, and boy howdy, you can probably guess how confused I was when the trio of strange anime girls, their robot, and their anthropomorphic wolf buddy helped an aging yakuza boss shoot himself out of a cannon so he could fulfill his lifelong dream of becoming a magical girl. However, even the actual premiere is very much the kind of episode that is happy to let its audience stew in their confusion for a while as it drip feeds exposition and lore. This isn't a bad thing at all; it just means that even after a double dose of episodes for its premiere, I still don't really know what this show is about. It's pretty fun to watch the weird shenanigans unfold, though.    It also helps that, despite being a fully 3D production, Polygon Pictures has worked hard to ensure that Estab-Life isn't the kind of unholy trash fire that some recent CG anime have been. The facial animations are still plenty awkward, to be sure, and the character animation suffers from a lack of in-betweens to smooth out the transitions between different poses, but it is still a solid effort overall. The direction is efficient and adequately cinematic, and the show's color palette is sufficiently diverse and lush looking. The quality voice acting also livens up the proceedings too; Ekua, Feles, and Martes are all likable and interesting, even if we barely know anything about them yet (except for the fact that Martes is apparently made mostly out of slime, for some reason).    What remains to be seen is if writer Shoji Gatoh's absurd sense of humor is going to mix with the strange sort of pathos that Estab-Life is trying to get from the different clients that the Extractors are helping. Neither the mopey philosophy teacher nor the gung-ho magical girl yakuza boss was terribly interesting, but there's something about the show's nebulous tone that I can't help but find fascinating. I'm definitely willing to give the series another episode or two to see if it can get its hooks into me, but I won't get my hopes up too high, just in case Estab-Life collapses under the weight of its own eccentric ambitions.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                This first episode is a bit of an odd ride. It simply throws us into the middle of things and never really explains itself. And honestly, there is an interesting thought experiment at the center of this: Apparently in the future, Japan is split up into autonomous city-states, each with its own unique laws and varying levels of authoritarianism. In the more controlling states, you can't even decide your own job, much less leave the city-state to join another. Thus, there are “extractors” who illegally help people escape and start new lives elsewhere.    This premise looks primed to be a framework for exploring feelings of entrapment in our daily lives: Sometimes it's in a job we hate. Other times it's in a relationship we know is wrong but just can't seem to leave. Hell, sometimes, it's being trapped in your own skin—feeling the “you” inside doesn't match the outside.    Which is why it's such a shame that Estab-Life fails in every conceivable way to live up to its premise.    For this kind of high-concept story, you need to make the viewer on focus the themes being explored. Bland, one-note, and frankly annoying characters only distract from this. There is no one to really empathize with, not the main characters and not even our disheartened teacher-turned-escapee. (Honestly, if your students aren't taking in your lessons, maybe you need to change how you teach!)    Then there are the visuals. I won't say it looks terrible—we are in the age of EX-ARM and Tesla Note, after all—though they are certainly subpar for what can be done with 3D animation. The real problem is the accidental visual storytelling. Our characters never take cover in gun battles and just stand in the open shooting, implying they are either stupid or invincible. Later we watch a 100 lbs. schoolgirl climb a 10-floor vertical glass face with a 150 lbs. man attached to her back using only her arms. Does she have super strength or is this just bad writing? In the end, it doesn't really matter. What does matter is that it's a distraction from the themes the episode is trying to explore.    To put it as simply as possible: cool ideas, terrible execution.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review          1 comment       Hello, Melancholic!

The tonal differences between these two episodes, with the first being much more serious than the second, aren't a great sign that it knows what kind of story it wants to tell, and the characters really are pretty cookie-cutter, so if you aren't a fan of their archetypes, that could become an issue. But if you have the patience, I think this may be worth one or two more episodes just to see if it figures out where it's going and what it wants to be – and if the answer to the second question turns out to be something other than “just okay.”       James Beckett  Rating:                A quirk of technology made it so that I accidentally watched the second episode of Estab-Life: Great Escape before the first, and boy howdy, you can probably guess how confused I was when the trio of strange anime girls, their robot, and their anthropomorphic wolf buddy helped an aging yakuza boss shoot himself out of a cannon so he could fulfill his lifelong dream of becoming a magical girl. However, even the actual premiere is very much the kind of episode that is happy to let its audience stew in their confusion for a while as it drip feeds exposition and lore. This isn't a bad thing at all; it just means that even after a double dose of episodes for its premiere, I still don't really know what this show is about. It's pretty fun to watch the weird shenanigans unfold, though.    It also helps that, despite being a fully 3D production, Polygon Pictures has worked hard to ensure that Estab-Life isn't the kind of unholy trash fire that some recent CG anime have been. The facial animations are still plenty awkward, to be sure, and the character animation suffers from a lack of in-betweens to smooth out the transitions between different poses, but it is still a solid effort overall. The direction is efficient and adequately cinematic, and the show's color palette is sufficiently diverse and lush looking. The quality voice acting also livens up the proceedings too; Ekua, Feles, and Martes are all likable and interesting, even if we barely know anything about them yet (except for the fact that Martes is apparently made mostly out of slime, for some reason).    What remains to be seen is if writer Shoji Gatoh's absurd sense of humor is going to mix with the strange sort of pathos that Estab-Life is trying to get from the different clients that the Extractors are helping. Neither the mopey philosophy teacher nor the gung-ho magical girl yakuza boss was terribly interesting, but there's something about the show's nebulous tone that I can't help but find fascinating. I'm definitely willing to give the series another episode or two to see if it can get its hooks into me, but I won't get my hopes up too high, just in case Estab-Life collapses under the weight of its own eccentric ambitions.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                This first episode is a bit of an odd ride. It simply throws us into the middle of things and never really explains itself. And honestly, there is an interesting thought experiment at the center of this: Apparently in the future, Japan is split up into autonomous city-states, each with its own unique laws and varying levels of authoritarianism. In the more controlling states, you can't even decide your own job, much less leave the city-state to join another. Thus, there are “extractors” who illegally help people escape and start new lives elsewhere.    This premise looks primed to be a framework for exploring feelings of entrapment in our daily lives: Sometimes it's in a job we hate. Other times it's in a relationship we know is wrong but just can't seem to leave. Hell, sometimes, it's being trapped in your own skin—feeling the “you” inside doesn't match the outside.    Which is why it's such a shame that Estab-Life fails in every conceivable way to live up to its premise.    For this kind of high-concept story, you need to make the viewer on focus the themes being explored. Bland, one-note, and frankly annoying characters only distract from this. There is no one to really empathize with, not the main characters and not even our disheartened teacher-turned-escapee. (Honestly, if your students aren't taking in your lessons, maybe you need to change how you teach!)    Then there are the visuals. I won't say it looks terrible—we are in the age of EX-ARM and Tesla Note, after all—though they are certainly subpar for what can be done with 3D animation. The real problem is the accidental visual storytelling. Our characters never take cover in gun battles and just stand in the open shooting, implying they are either stupid or invincible. Later we watch a 100 lbs. schoolgirl climb a 10-floor vertical glass face with a 150 lbs. man attached to her back using only her arms. Does she have super strength or is this just bad writing? In the end, it doesn't really matter. What does matter is that it's a distraction from the themes the episode is trying to explore.    To put it as simply as possible: cool ideas, terrible execution.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Estab-Life: Great Escape   Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Estab-Life: Great Escape ?                     Community score: 2.9                  How would you rate episode 2 of Estab-Life: Great Escape ?                     Community score: 3.0              What is this?   The world population has begun to shrink after reaching its peak. The ""Supernatural Renovation Project"" splits Tokyo with towering walls into several Cluster neighborhoods, each with its own unique genetically modified populations, governed by artificial intelligence. Most people live their lives in their own unique Clusters, blissfully unconcerned with life beyond. However, there are some who seek to escape to the other Clusters. An outfit called Nigashiya helps those who wish to escape.    Estab-Life: Great Escape is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll.      How was the first episode?    Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                You've gotta hand it to Goro Taniguchi. In an industry that always hesitates to release original projects, he's leveraged the success of Code Geass into nearly a decade of making original sci-fi TV series. Granted, none of those creations have managed to be better than “just okay” – a streak that looks to continue with Estab-Life – but you have to respect the hustle. And while I probably won't be watching more of this one, I can at least say I had fun with these introductory episodes.    In a word, Estab-Life is busy. Busy in its aesthetic, with the mishmash of colors and designs that constitute our main characters, the design of the sci-fi world they inhabit, and the occasionally well-executed but largely workmanlike CG animation. Busy in its worldbuilding, as it throws concepts like slime girls and wolf men and “Gun Wizards” at the audience with not a second of exposition to clue you in, while only barely communicating its central conceit of closed-off post-apocalypse cities that our heroes help traffic people in-between. Busy in its tone, as these opening episodes attempt to balance snazzy spy action, goofy comedy, and quiet poignancy in ways that work more than you'd expect, but still not often enough to be effective. There's a lot going on here, and the show is never as graceful about any of it as you'd hope for.    That said, I'm a fan of offbeat sci-fi series, and that's very much the vibe I get from this premiere. The characters are simple archetypes with just enough personality to be likable, and they flit between the high-flying sci-fi action setpieces with just the right amount of energy. That's a good thing to have for what is likely to be an episodic series of missions and character pieces, and if the writing can deliver interesting individual stories it may just be worth keeping up with. I was actually pretty charmed by episode two, with the grizzled yakuza boss who yearns to escape Shinjuku's criminal underbelly and achieve his dream of becoming a magical girl. It's silly and it knows it, but there's an earnest feeling to the comedy that invites you to cheer for him and the other characters rather than trying to laugh at him. There's a central idea that it's ok, important even, to run away when you need to live a better life, and that compassion is a big part of what makes this whole scenario work so far. It's not deep, but it is heartfelt.    All in all this is still a pretty light watch. There's nothing all that compelling, but it has the potential for a fun weekly distraction if nothing else. Its biggest sin is the CG character animation, which isn't terrible but leaves a lot to be desired, especially for any character outside the main cast. I can't decide if the yakuza characters in episode two being identical sunglasses guys in suits is funny on purpose or by accident, but it most definitely saved production resources. But in a time when things like Rusted Armors can come out, I'm not going to complain about largely competent CG. Still, it's enough of a problem that I doubt I'll be sticking around for any more of this.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I feel like Estab-Life is the very definition of “okay.” The plot is contrived and silly, but okay enough to follow, the characters are basically clichés, but okay enough to pay attention to, and the animation isn't EX-ARM levels of bad, but okay enough to watch. It's not quite good enough to be middle-of-the-road, but okay enough to be relatively harmless viewing. The catch is of course that its conceit is on the weirder side of things and that it's animated in the sort of CGI that sends some people running for the hills, especially since “better than EX-ARM and Rusted Armors” isn't exactly a ringing endorsement. Personally, I'm more bothered by Feles' character design; I'd love to take a pair of scissors to that one hunk of hair that hangs over her eye. (Or possibly hedge trimmers; it looks awfully thick.)    While not a lot is explained about the story's world, it is easy enough to put the pieces together, and I do like that we aren't burdened with heavy amounts of exposition. We don't know what happened to break Tokyo up into “clusters,” but it seems to be similar to each ward turning back into its own small town, with the difference being that in the story's dystopian world, moving between them isn't easy and may be outright illegal. That's created the job our heroines do: extracting people from their present lives and moving them into a new one in a different cluster. As a concept, it's neat enough to work, and other bits of world-building thrown in gave it a bit of a fantasy edge from other dystopias, although I'm hoping I'm not the only one who thought of Dragon Half when Martes is revealed to be a slime half. I'm not sure what to make of Ulula the bipedal wolf/furry or some of the other oddball details like the client from the second episode wanting to become a magical girl despite being an old man. Some of them feel like they were just thrown in because they sounded funny to someone rather than having a distinct purpose to fill. (The girls' boss doing low-key dance moves to give them coded messages is another one of those moments.)    I think this may be one of those series that relies on viewer patience for its first third or so before it truly gets moving. The tonal differences between these two episodes, with the first being much more serious than the second, aren't a great sign that it knows what kind of story it wants to tell, and the characters really are pretty cookie-cutter, so if you aren't a fan of their archetypes, that could become an issue.

Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                You've gotta hand it to Goro Taniguchi. In an industry that always hesitates to release original projects, he's leveraged the success of Code Geass into nearly a decade of making original sci-fi TV series. Granted, none of those creations have managed to be better than “just okay” – a streak that looks to continue with Estab-Life – but you have to respect the hustle. And while I probably won't be watching more of this one, I can at least say I had fun with these introductory episodes.    In a word, Estab-Life is busy. Busy in its aesthetic, with the mishmash of colors and designs that constitute our main characters, the design of the sci-fi world they inhabit, and the occasionally well-executed but largely workmanlike CG animation. Busy in its worldbuilding, as it throws concepts like slime girls and wolf men and “Gun Wizards” at the audience with not a second of exposition to clue you in, while only barely communicating its central conceit of closed-off post-apocalypse cities that our heroes help traffic people in-between. Busy in its tone, as these opening episodes attempt to balance snazzy spy action, goofy comedy, and quiet poignancy in ways that work more than you'd expect, but still not often enough to be effective. There's a lot going on here, and the show is never as graceful about any of it as you'd hope for.    That said, I'm a fan of offbeat sci-fi series, and that's very much the vibe I get from this premiere. The characters are simple archetypes with just enough personality to be likable, and they flit between the high-flying sci-fi action setpieces with just the right amount of energy. That's a good thing to have for what is likely to be an episodic series of missions and character pieces, and if the writing can deliver interesting individual stories it may just be worth keeping up with. I was actually pretty charmed by episode two, with the grizzled yakuza boss who yearns to escape Shinjuku's criminal underbelly and achieve his dream of becoming a magical girl. It's silly and it knows it, but there's an earnest feeling to the comedy that invites you to cheer for him and the other characters rather than trying to laugh at him. There's a central idea that it's ok, important even, to run away when you need to live a better life, and that compassion is a big part of what makes this whole scenario work so far. It's not deep, but it is heartfelt.    All in all this is still a pretty light watch. There's nothing all that compelling, but it has the potential for a fun weekly distraction if nothing else. Its biggest sin is the CG character animation, which isn't terrible but leaves a lot to be desired, especially for any character outside the main cast. I can't decide if the yakuza characters in episode two being identical sunglasses guys in suits is funny on purpose or by accident, but it most definitely saved production resources. But in a time when things like Rusted Armors can come out, I'm not going to complain about largely competent CG. Still, it's enough of a problem that I doubt I'll be sticking around for any more of this.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I feel like Estab-Life is the very definition of “okay.” The plot is contrived and silly, but okay enough to follow, the characters are basically clichés, but okay enough to pay attention to, and the animation isn't EX-ARM levels of bad, but okay enough to watch. It's not quite good enough to be middle-of-the-road, but okay enough to be relatively harmless viewing. The catch is of course that its conceit is on the weirder side of things and that it's animated in the sort of CGI that sends some people running for the hills, especially since “better than EX-ARM and Rusted Armors” isn't exactly a ringing endorsement. Personally, I'm more bothered by Feles' character design; I'd love to take a pair of scissors to that one hunk of hair that hangs over her eye. (Or possibly hedge trimmers; it looks awfully thick.)    While not a lot is explained about the story's world, it is easy enough to put the pieces together, and I do like that we aren't burdened with heavy amounts of exposition. We don't know what happened to break Tokyo up into “clusters,” but it seems to be similar to each ward turning back into its own small town, with the difference being that in the story's dystopian world, moving between them isn't easy and may be outright illegal. That's created the job our heroines do: extracting people from their present lives and moving them into a new one in a different cluster. As a concept, it's neat enough to work, and other bits of world-building thrown in gave it a bit of a fantasy edge from other dystopias, although I'm hoping I'm not the only one who thought of Dragon Half when Martes is revealed to be a slime half. I'm not sure what to make of Ulula the bipedal wolf/furry or some of the other oddball details like the client from the second episode wanting to become a magical girl despite being an old man. Some of them feel like they were just thrown in because they sounded funny to someone rather than having a distinct purpose to fill. (The girls' boss doing low-key dance moves to give them coded messages is another one of those moments.)    I think this may be one of those series that relies on viewer patience for its first third or so before it truly gets moving. The tonal differences between these two episodes, with the first being much more serious than the second, aren't a great sign that it knows what kind of story it wants to tell, and the characters really are pretty cookie-cutter, so if you aren't a fan of their archetypes, that could become an issue. But if you have the patience, I think this may be worth one or two more episodes just to see if it figures out where it's going and what it wants to be – and if the answer to the second question turns out to be something other than “just okay.”       James Beckett  Rating:                A quirk of technology made it so that I accidentally watched the second episode of Estab-Life: Great Escape before the first, and boy howdy, you can probably guess how confused I was when the trio of strange anime girls, their robot, and their anthropomorphic wolf buddy helped an aging yakuza boss shoot himself out of a cannon so he could fulfill his lifelong dream of becoming a magical girl. However, even the actual premiere is very much the kind of episode that is happy to let its audience stew in their confusion for a while as it drip feeds exposition and lore. This isn't a bad thing at all; it just means that even after a double dose of episodes for its premiere, I still don't really know what this show is about. It's pretty fun to watch the weird shenanigans unfold, though.    It also helps that, despite being a fully 3D production, Polygon Pictures has worked hard to ensure that Estab-Life isn't the kind of unholy trash fire that some recent CG anime have been. The facial animations are still plenty awkward, to be sure, and the character animation suffers from a lack of in-betweens to smooth out the transitions between different poses, but it is still a solid effort overall. The direction is efficient and adequately cinematic, and the show's color palette is sufficiently diverse and lush looking. The quality voice acting also livens up the proceedings too; Ekua, Feles, and Martes are all likable and interesting, even if we barely know anything about them yet (except for the fact that Martes is apparently made mostly out of slime, for some reason).    What remains to be seen is if writer Shoji Gatoh's absurd sense of humor is going to mix with the strange sort of pathos that Estab-Life is trying to get from the different clients that the Extractors are helping. Neither the mopey philosophy teacher nor the gung-ho magical girl yakuza boss was terribly interesting, but there's something about the show's nebulous tone that I can't help but find fascinating. I'm definitely willing to give the series another episode or two to see if it can get its hooks into me, but I won't get my hopes up too high, just in case Estab-Life collapses under the weight of its own eccentric ambitions.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                This first episode is a bit of an odd ride. It simply throws us into the middle of things and never really explains itself. And honestly, there is an interesting thought experiment at the center of this: Apparently in the future, Japan is split up into autonomous city-states, each with its own unique laws and varying levels of authoritarianism. In the more controlling states, you can't even decide your own job, much less leave the city-state to join another. Thus, there are “extractors” who illegally help people escape and start new lives elsewhere.    This premise looks primed to be a framework for exploring feelings of entrapment in our daily lives: Sometimes it's in a job we hate. Other times it's in a relationship we know is wrong but just can't seem to leave. Hell, sometimes, it's being trapped in your own skin—feeling the “you” inside doesn't match the outside.    Which is why it's such a shame that Estab-Life fails in every conceivable way to live up to its premise.    For this kind of high-concept story, you need to make the viewer on focus the themes being explored. Bland, one-note, and frankly annoying characters only distract from this. There is no one to really empathize with, not the main characters and not even our disheartened teacher-turned-escapee. (Honestly, if your students aren't taking in your lessons, maybe you need to change how you teach!)    Then there are the visuals. I won't say it looks terrible—we are in the age of EX-ARM and Tesla Note, after all—though they are certainly subpar for what can be done with 3D animation. The real problem is the accidental visual storytelling. Our characters never take cover in gun battles and just stand in the open shooting, implying they are either stupid or invincible. Later we watch a 100 lbs. schoolgirl climb a 10-floor vertical glass face with a 150 lbs. man attached to her back using only her arms. Does she have super strength or is this just bad writing? In the end, it doesn't really matter. What does matter is that it's a distraction from the themes the episode is trying to explore.    To put it as simply as possible: cool ideas, terrible execution.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives     ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                This first episode is a bit of an odd ride. It simply throws us into the middle of things and never really explains itself. And honestly, there is an interesting thought experiment at the center of this: Apparently in the future, Japan is split up into autonomous city-states, each with its own unique laws and varying levels of authoritarianism. In the more controlling states, you can't even decide your own job, much less leave the city-state to join another. Thus, there are “extractors” who illegally help people escape and start new lives elsewhere.    This premise looks primed to be a framework for exploring feelings of entrapment in our daily lives: Sometimes it's in a job we hate. Other times it's in a relationship we know is wrong but just can't seem to leave. Hell, sometimes, it's being trapped in your own skin—feeling the “you” inside doesn't match the outside.    Which is why it's such a shame that Estab-Life fails in every conceivable way to live up to its premise.    For this kind of high-concept story, you need to make the viewer on focus the themes being explored. Bland, one-note, and frankly annoying characters only distract from this. There is no one to really empathize with, not the main characters and not even our disheartened teacher-turned-escapee. (Honestly, if your students aren't taking in your lessons, maybe you need to change how you teach!)    Then there are the visuals. I won't say it looks terrible—we are in the age of EX-ARM and Tesla Note, after all—though they are certainly subpar for what can be done with 3D animation. The real problem is the accidental visual storytelling. Our characters never take cover in gun battles and just stand in the open shooting, implying they are either stupid or invincible. Later we watch a 100 lbs. schoolgirl climb a 10-floor vertical glass face with a 150 lbs. man attached to her back using only her arms. Does she have super strength or is this just bad writing? In the end, it doesn't really matter. What does matter is that it's a distraction from the themes the episode is trying to explore.

Community score: 2.9                  How would you rate episode 2 of Estab-Life: Great Escape ?                     Community score: 3.0              What is this?   The world population has begun to shrink after reaching its peak. The ""Supernatural Renovation Project"" splits Tokyo with towering walls into several Cluster neighborhoods, each with its own unique genetically modified populations, governed by artificial intelligence. Most people live their lives in their own unique Clusters, blissfully unconcerned with life beyond. However, there are some who seek to escape to the other Clusters. An outfit called Nigashiya helps those who wish to escape.    Estab-Life: Great Escape is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll.      How was the first episode?    Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                You've gotta hand it to Goro Taniguchi. In an industry that always hesitates to release original projects, he's leveraged the success of Code Geass into nearly a decade of making original sci-fi TV series. Granted, none of those creations have managed to be better than “just okay” – a streak that looks to continue with Estab-Life – but you have to respect the hustle. And while I probably won't be watching more of this one, I can at least say I had fun with these introductory episodes.    In a word, Estab-Life is busy. Busy in its aesthetic, with the mishmash of colors and designs that constitute our main characters, the design of the sci-fi world they inhabit, and the occasionally well-executed but largely workmanlike CG animation. Busy in its worldbuilding, as it throws concepts like slime girls and wolf men and “Gun Wizards” at the audience with not a second of exposition to clue you in, while only barely communicating its central conceit of closed-off post-apocalypse cities that our heroes help traffic people in-between. Busy in its tone, as these opening episodes attempt to balance snazzy spy action, goofy comedy, and quiet poignancy in ways that work more than you'd expect, but still not often enough to be effective. There's a lot going on here, and the show is never as graceful about any of it as you'd hope for.    That said, I'm a fan of offbeat sci-fi series, and that's very much the vibe I get from this premiere. The characters are simple archetypes with just enough personality to be likable, and they flit between the high-flying sci-fi action setpieces with just the right amount of energy. That's a good thing to have for what is likely to be an episodic series of missions and character pieces, and if the writing can deliver interesting individual stories it may just be worth keeping up with. I was actually pretty charmed by episode two, with the grizzled yakuza boss who yearns to escape Shinjuku's criminal underbelly and achieve his dream of becoming a magical girl. It's silly and it knows it, but there's an earnest feeling to the comedy that invites you to cheer for him and the other characters rather than trying to laugh at him. There's a central idea that it's ok, important even, to run away when you need to live a better life, and that compassion is a big part of what makes this whole scenario work so far. It's not deep, but it is heartfelt.    All in all this is still a pretty light watch. There's nothing all that compelling, but it has the potential for a fun weekly distraction if nothing else. Its biggest sin is the CG character animation, which isn't terrible but leaves a lot to be desired, especially for any character outside the main cast. I can't decide if the yakuza characters in episode two being identical sunglasses guys in suits is funny on purpose or by accident, but it most definitely saved production resources. But in a time when things like Rusted Armors can come out, I'm not going to complain about largely competent CG. Still, it's enough of a problem that I doubt I'll be sticking around for any more of this.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I feel like Estab-Life is the very definition of “okay.” The plot is contrived and silly, but okay enough to follow, the characters are basically clichés, but okay enough to pay attention to, and the animation isn't EX-ARM levels of bad, but okay enough to watch. It's not quite good enough to be middle-of-the-road, but okay enough to be relatively harmless viewing. The catch is of course that its conceit is on the weirder side of things and that it's animated in the sort of CGI that sends some people running for the hills, especially since “better than EX-ARM and Rusted Armors” isn't exactly a ringing endorsement. Personally, I'm more bothered by Feles' character design; I'd love to take a pair of scissors to that one hunk of hair that hangs over her eye. (Or possibly hedge trimmers; it looks awfully thick.)    While not a lot is explained about the story's world, it is easy enough to put the pieces together, and I do like that we aren't burdened with heavy amounts of exposition. We don't know what happened to break Tokyo up into “clusters,” but it seems to be similar to each ward turning back into its own small town, with the difference being that in the story's dystopian world, moving between them isn't easy and may be outright illegal. That's created the job our heroines do: extracting people from their present lives and moving them into a new one in a different cluster. As a concept, it's neat enough to work, and other bits of world-building thrown in gave it a bit of a fantasy edge from other dystopias, although I'm hoping I'm not the only one who thought of Dragon Half when Martes is revealed to be a slime half. I'm not sure what to make of Ulula the bipedal wolf/furry or some of the other oddball details like the client from the second episode wanting to become a magical girl despite being an old man. Some of them feel like they were just thrown in because they sounded funny to someone rather than having a distinct purpose to fill. (The girls' boss doing low-key dance moves to give them coded messages is another one of those moments.)    I think this may be one of those series that relies on viewer patience for its first third or so before it truly gets moving. The tonal differences between these two episodes, with the first being much more serious than the second, aren't a great sign that it knows what kind of story it wants to tell, and the characters really are pretty cookie-cutter, so if you aren't a fan of their archetypes, that could become an issue. But if you have the patience, I think this may be worth one or two more episodes just to see if it figures out where it's going and what it wants to be – and if the answer to the second question turns out to be something other than “just okay.”       James Beckett  Rating:                A quirk of technology made it so that I accidentally watched the second episode of Estab-Life: Great Escape before the first, and boy howdy, you can probably guess how confused I was when the trio of strange anime girls, their robot, and their anthropomorphic wolf buddy helped an aging yakuza boss shoot himself out of a cannon so he could fulfill his lifelong dream of becoming a magical girl. However, even the actual premiere is very much the kind of episode that is happy to let its audience stew in their confusion for a while as it drip feeds exposition and lore. This isn't a bad thing at all; it just means that even after a double dose of episodes for its premiere, I still don't really know what this show is about. It's pretty fun to watch the weird shenanigans unfold, though.    It also helps that, despite being a fully 3D production, Polygon Pictures has worked hard to ensure that Estab-Life isn't the kind of unholy trash fire that some recent CG anime have been. The facial animations are still plenty awkward, to be sure, and the character animation suffers from a lack of in-betweens to smooth out the transitions between different poses, but it is still a solid effort overall. The direction is efficient and adequately cinematic, and the show's color palette is sufficiently diverse and lush looking. The quality voice acting also livens up the proceedings too; Ekua, Feles, and Martes are all likable and interesting, even if we barely know anything about them yet (except for the fact that Martes is apparently made mostly out of slime, for some reason).    What remains to be seen is if writer Shoji Gatoh's absurd sense of humor is going to mix with the strange sort of pathos that Estab-Life is trying to get from the different clients that the Extractors are helping. Neither the mopey philosophy teacher nor the gung-ho magical girl yakuza boss was terribly interesting, but there's something about the show's nebulous tone that I can't help but find fascinating. I'm definitely willing to give the series another episode or two to see if it can get its hooks into me, but I won't get my hopes up too high, just in case Estab-Life collapses under the weight of its own eccentric ambitions.

For me, the price of admission (plus travel clear to another prefecture—this was not a very wide release) was fully justified just for spoiler[Odokawa and Shirakawa's profoundly adorable climactic date, which naturally consists of a drive and a trip to the zoo. Shirakawa manages to get Odokawa to admit that he imagined her as an alpaca because he likes alpacas, which results in some truly glorious teasing. I'm very glad that their interactions work just as well in human form (everyone is in human form after the appropriate point) as they do in animal form.]   I do think that the film provides a little more meat than this review suggests; in addition to critical hints at the ending, there are even a few new mysteries introduced. However, it's completely accurate to say that you shouldn't go in expecting any ""revelations""—just an interesting alternative presentation of an incredible well-written story.

For me, the price of admission (plus travel clear to another prefecture—this was not a very wide release) was fully justified just for spoiler[Odokawa and Shirakawa's profoundly adorable climactic date, which naturally consists of a drive and a trip to the zoo. Shirakawa manages to get Odokawa to admit that he imagined her as an alpaca because he likes alpacas, which results in some truly glorious teasing. I'm very glad that their interactions work just as well in human form (everyone is in human form after the appropriate point) as they do in animal form.]   I do think that the film provides a little more meat than this review suggests; in addition to critical hints at the ending, there are even a few new mysteries introduced. However, it's completely accurate to say that you shouldn't go in expecting any ""revelations""—just an interesting alternative presentation of an incredible well-written story.
