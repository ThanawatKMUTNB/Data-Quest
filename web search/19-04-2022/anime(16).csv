How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom Part 2 Episode 13  by Grant Jones, Apr  5th 2022                   How would you rate episode 13 of How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.3            What a finale! I'm impressed, and I think it's a great note to end the season on regardless of whether or not we will get future entries. I'm curious how well-received this ending is on the whole as I think it addresses a lot of my issues with the series, but departs from prior episodes in so many ways that it feels like something else entirely.    As far as twists go, I think this was a good one. In my opinion, the best twists aren't necessarily about shock value as much as they are about recontextualizing prior events. The revelation that the former queen has a sort of memory-casting ability to allow her and the king's past selves to keep trying until they get things right is a good twist. As long as you don't mind a bit of paradox – and Lord knows I'll take all kinds of paradoxes if it makes for good storytelling – it's a great reveal that manages to convey some of the pain from past failures. This is a good way to attach consequences even though they can keep resetting, so to speak.    I also think it does a lot to alleviate some of my past concerns about the breezy way Souma has taken to politics. Souma's earlier exploits all felt a bit too clean, a bit too perfect, lacking in nuance and friction. That's because the actual realistic approach already happened once and it was a big messy affair that ended in tragedy. That's a good way to lampshade the wish-fulfillment aspects of the story. I also enjoyed that Souma wrestled with this for at least a little bit, wondering if his actions really mattered at all in this light. Even Liscia gets a lot of time to shine; having the king regret not trusting her in a past life and the really tender moment she and Souma had at the end are all great stuff.    Sadly, all these appreciable elements also make the warts stand out that much more. The wrap-up ending with all the other cast-members/wives only serves to highlight how flat and tropey these characters are, and undercuts some of the effectiveness that the rest of the episode had. Will future seasons – should they come to pass – direct the same kind of self-awareness that this episode had towards its harem elements, or will they continue to fall back on the same “omg Souma you're so great” ad nauseum? Only time will tell, but I think the nuance and creativity expressed in this episode is precisely the sort of energy I want to see going forward, and I would actually be excited to review more of the show in the future should it come to pass.

How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom Part 2 Episode 13  by Grant Jones, Apr  5th 2022                   How would you rate episode 13 of How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.3            What a finale! I'm impressed, and I think it's a great note to end the season on regardless of whether or not we will get future entries. I'm curious how well-received this ending is on the whole as I think it addresses a lot of my issues with the series, but departs from prior episodes in so many ways that it feels like something else entirely.    As far as twists go, I think this was a good one. In my opinion, the best twists aren't necessarily about shock value as much as they are about recontextualizing prior events. The revelation that the former queen has a sort of memory-casting ability to allow her and the king's past selves to keep trying until they get things right is a good twist. As long as you don't mind a bit of paradox – and Lord knows I'll take all kinds of paradoxes if it makes for good storytelling – it's a great reveal that manages to convey some of the pain from past failures. This is a good way to attach consequences even though they can keep resetting, so to speak.    I also think it does a lot to alleviate some of my past concerns about the breezy way Souma has taken to politics. Souma's earlier exploits all felt a bit too clean, a bit too perfect, lacking in nuance and friction. That's because the actual realistic approach already happened once and it was a big messy affair that ended in tragedy. That's a good way to lampshade the wish-fulfillment aspects of the story. I also enjoyed that Souma wrestled with this for at least a little bit, wondering if his actions really mattered at all in this light. Even Liscia gets a lot of time to shine; having the king regret not trusting her in a past life and the really tender moment she and Souma had at the end are all great stuff.    Sadly, all these appreciable elements also make the warts stand out that much more. The wrap-up ending with all the other cast-members/wives only serves to highlight how flat and tropey these characters are, and undercuts some of the effectiveness that the rest of the episode had. Will future seasons – should they come to pass – direct the same kind of self-awareness that this episode had towards its harem elements, or will they continue to fall back on the same “omg Souma you're so great” ad nauseum? Only time will tell, but I think the nuance and creativity expressed in this episode is precisely the sort of energy I want to see going forward, and I would actually be excited to review more of the show in the future should it come to pass.

How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom Part 2 Episode 13  by Grant Jones, Apr  5th 2022                   How would you rate episode 13 of How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.3            What a finale! I'm impressed, and I think it's a great note to end the season on regardless of whether or not we will get future entries. I'm curious how well-received this ending is on the whole as I think it addresses a lot of my issues with the series, but departs from prior episodes in so many ways that it feels like something else entirely.    As far as twists go, I think this was a good one. In my opinion, the best twists aren't necessarily about shock value as much as they are about recontextualizing prior events. The revelation that the former queen has a sort of memory-casting ability to allow her and the king's past selves to keep trying until they get things right is a good twist. As long as you don't mind a bit of paradox – and Lord knows I'll take all kinds of paradoxes if it makes for good storytelling – it's a great reveal that manages to convey some of the pain from past failures. This is a good way to attach consequences even though they can keep resetting, so to speak.    I also think it does a lot to alleviate some of my past concerns about the breezy way Souma has taken to politics. Souma's earlier exploits all felt a bit too clean, a bit too perfect, lacking in nuance and friction. That's because the actual realistic approach already happened once and it was a big messy affair that ended in tragedy. That's a good way to lampshade the wish-fulfillment aspects of the story. I also enjoyed that Souma wrestled with this for at least a little bit, wondering if his actions really mattered at all in this light. Even Liscia gets a lot of time to shine; having the king regret not trusting her in a past life and the really tender moment she and Souma had at the end are all great stuff.    Sadly, all these appreciable elements also make the warts stand out that much more. The wrap-up ending with all the other cast-members/wives only serves to highlight how flat and tropey these characters are, and undercuts some of the effectiveness that the rest of the episode had. Will future seasons – should they come to pass – direct the same kind of self-awareness that this episode had towards its harem elements, or will they continue to fall back on the same “omg Souma you're so great” ad nauseum? Only time will tell, but I think the nuance and creativity expressed in this episode is precisely the sort of energy I want to see going forward, and I would actually be excited to review more of the show in the future should it come to pass.

News Crunchyroll to Stream Yurei Deco, Classroom of the Elite II, Harem in the Labyrinth of Another World Anime   posted on 2022-04-17 03:01 UTC-8 by Crystalyn Hodgkins          Yurei Deco, Harem in the Labyrinth of Another World to debut on Crunchyroll this summer    Crunchyroll announced at its panel at the Sakura Con event on Saturday that it will stream the Yurei Deco, Classroom of the Elite II, and Harem in the Labyrinth of Another World anime.      Crunchyroll will stream Yurei Deco this summer, and it describes the series:   From Science SARU comes an original story based on The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. The story begins when Berry, an average girl from an average home, meets Hack, a girl who looks like a boy. Charmed by Hack, Berry meets up with the team Hack leads, the Ghost Detectives Club. Members of this club are “socially dead,” working invisibly within the digitally controlled society of Tom Sawyer. As she works with the group, Berry learns about Zero, a mysterious figure who lurks within Tom Sawyer's underground. She and Hack decide to chase down this figure, and in time, the truth behind the city is revealed…   Science SARU's Yurei Deco television anime will premiere in Japan in July.    Tomohisa Shimoyama (Super Shiro) is directing the anime, and Dai Sato (Eureka Seven script supervisor, 10 Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex episodes, three Cowboy Bebop episodes) is in charge of series scripts.    The musical artists contributing to the anime are mito from the group Clammbon, Kōtarō Saitō, and Yebisu303. Clammbon has performed theme songs for such anime as Isekai Izakaya: Japanese Food From Another World, Polar Bear's Café, and She and Her Cat -Everything Flows-. mito has composed anime soundtracks for such anime as Flip Flappers, and Alice & Zoroku under the alias TO-MAS.     Crunchyroll did not give a release window for Classroom of the Elite II, but it describes the story of the anime's first season:   Kiyotaka Ayanokoji has just enrolled at Tokyo Koudo Ikusei Senior High School, where it's said that 100% of students go on to college or find employment. But he ends up in Class 1-D, which is full of all the school's problem children. What's more, every month, the school awards students points with a cash value of 100,000 yen, and the classes employ a laissez-faire policy in which talking, sleeping, and even sabotage are permitted during class. One month later, Ayanokoji, Horikita, and the students of Class D learn the truth of the system in place within their school…   The first television anime  of Syougo Kinugasa's Classroom of the Elite (Yōkoso Jitsuryoku Shijō Shugi no Kyōshitsu e) light novel series premiered in July 2017. Crunchyroll streamed the series, and Funimation streamed an English dub. The anime is getting two more seasons in July 2022 and sometime in 2023 with a returning cast. The sequel anime will adapt the original story's complete first-year-student arc.    The first season's directors Seiji Kishi and Hiroyuki Hashimoto are returning as chief directors, with Yoshihito Nishōji (first season's opening sequence, Maji de Otaku na English! Ribbon-chan: Eigo de Tatakau Mahō Shōjo, Seven Senses of the Re'Union) as the credited director at Lerche. Hayato Kazano (first season's episode scripts, Killing Bites, Rumble Garanndoll) is now overseeing the series scripts, and Kazuaki Morita is back to design the characters. Masaru Yokoyama is now composing the music, joined by Kana Hashiguchi (A3! Season Autumn & Winter, A3! Season Spring & Summer, Black Fox).  Singer ZAQ is returning from the first season to perform the new opening theme song. Mai Fuchigami is singing the new ending theme song.    Crunchyroll will stream Harem in the Labyrinth of Another World in July, and it describes the story:   Struggling with life and society, high school student Michio Kaga wanders about the Internet and lands on an odd website. The website, featuring a number of questions and a point based system, allows one to create skills and abilities for a character. Upon completing his character, Kaga was transported to a game-like fantasy world and reborn as a strong man who can claim idol-level girls. Thus begins the cheat and harem legend of a reborn man!   The television anime adapts Shachi Sogano's Isekai Meikyū de Harem o light novel series. The anime will star Taku Yashiro as Michio Kaga and Shiori Mikami as Roxanne.    Naoyuki Tatsuwa (Katteni Kaizō, Nisekoi, The Island of Giant Insects) is directing the anime at Passione. Kurasumi Sunayama (Bakuon!!, Minami Kamakura High School Girls Cycling Club, Yowamushi Pedal New Generation) is in charge of the series scripts. Makoto Uno (Love Hina, Gravion, High School DxD Hero) is designing the characters.

News Crunchyroll to Stream Yurei Deco, Classroom of the Elite II, Harem in the Labyrinth of Another World Anime   posted on 2022-04-17 03:01 UTC-8 by Crystalyn Hodgkins          Yurei Deco, Harem in the Labyrinth of Another World to debut on Crunchyroll this summer    Crunchyroll announced at its panel at the Sakura Con event on Saturday that it will stream the Yurei Deco, Classroom of the Elite II, and Harem in the Labyrinth of Another World anime.      Crunchyroll will stream Yurei Deco this summer, and it describes the series:   From Science SARU comes an original story based on The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. The story begins when Berry, an average girl from an average home, meets Hack, a girl who looks like a boy. Charmed by Hack, Berry meets up with the team Hack leads, the Ghost Detectives Club. Members of this club are “socially dead,” working invisibly within the digitally controlled society of Tom Sawyer. As she works with the group, Berry learns about Zero, a mysterious figure who lurks within Tom Sawyer's underground. She and Hack decide to chase down this figure, and in time, the truth behind the city is revealed…   Science SARU's Yurei Deco television anime will premiere in Japan in July.    Tomohisa Shimoyama (Super Shiro) is directing the anime, and Dai Sato (Eureka Seven script supervisor, 10 Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex episodes, three Cowboy Bebop episodes) is in charge of series scripts.    The musical artists contributing to the anime are mito from the group Clammbon, Kōtarō Saitō, and Yebisu303. Clammbon has performed theme songs for such anime as Isekai Izakaya: Japanese Food From Another World, Polar Bear's Café, and She and Her Cat -Everything Flows-. mito has composed anime soundtracks for such anime as Flip Flappers, and Alice & Zoroku under the alias TO-MAS.     Crunchyroll did not give a release window for Classroom of the Elite II, but it describes the story of the anime's first season:   Kiyotaka Ayanokoji has just enrolled at Tokyo Koudo Ikusei Senior High School, where it's said that 100% of students go on to college or find employment. But he ends up in Class 1-D, which is full of all the school's problem children. What's more, every month, the school awards students points with a cash value of 100,000 yen, and the classes employ a laissez-faire policy in which talking, sleeping, and even sabotage are permitted during class. One month later, Ayanokoji, Horikita, and the students of Class D learn the truth of the system in place within their school…   The first television anime  of Syougo Kinugasa's Classroom of the Elite (Yōkoso Jitsuryoku Shijō Shugi no Kyōshitsu e) light novel series premiered in July 2017. Crunchyroll streamed the series, and Funimation streamed an English dub. The anime is getting two more seasons in July 2022 and sometime in 2023 with a returning cast. The sequel anime will adapt the original story's complete first-year-student arc.    The first season's directors Seiji Kishi and Hiroyuki Hashimoto are returning as chief directors, with Yoshihito Nishōji (first season's opening sequence, Maji de Otaku na English! Ribbon-chan: Eigo de Tatakau Mahō Shōjo, Seven Senses of the Re'Union) as the credited director at Lerche. Hayato Kazano (first season's episode scripts, Killing Bites, Rumble Garanndoll) is now overseeing the series scripts, and Kazuaki Morita is back to design the characters. Masaru Yokoyama is now composing the music, joined by Kana Hashiguchi (A3! Season Autumn & Winter, A3! Season Spring & Summer, Black Fox).  Singer ZAQ is returning from the first season to perform the new opening theme song. Mai Fuchigami is singing the new ending theme song.    Crunchyroll will stream Harem in the Labyrinth of Another World in July, and it describes the story:   Struggling with life and society, high school student Michio Kaga wanders about the Internet and lands on an odd website. The website, featuring a number of questions and a point based system, allows one to create skills and abilities for a character. Upon completing his character, Kaga was transported to a game-like fantasy world and reborn as a strong man who can claim idol-level girls. Thus begins the cheat and harem legend of a reborn man!   The television anime adapts Shachi Sogano's Isekai Meikyū de Harem o light novel series. The anime will star Taku Yashiro as Michio Kaga and Shiori Mikami as Roxanne.    Naoyuki Tatsuwa (Katteni Kaizō, Nisekoi, The Island of Giant Insects) is directing the anime at Passione. Kurasumi Sunayama (Bakuon!!, Minami Kamakura High School Girls Cycling Club, Yowamushi Pedal New Generation) is in charge of the series scripts. Makoto Uno (Love Hina, Gravion, High School DxD Hero) is designing the characters.

News Crunchyroll to Stream Yurei Deco, Classroom of the Elite II, Harem in the Labyrinth of Another World Anime   posted on 2022-04-17 03:01 UTC-8 by Crystalyn Hodgkins          Yurei Deco, Harem in the Labyrinth of Another World to debut on Crunchyroll this summer    Crunchyroll announced at its panel at the Sakura Con event on Saturday that it will stream the Yurei Deco, Classroom of the Elite II, and Harem in the Labyrinth of Another World anime.      Crunchyroll will stream Yurei Deco this summer, and it describes the series:   From Science SARU comes an original story based on The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. The story begins when Berry, an average girl from an average home, meets Hack, a girl who looks like a boy. Charmed by Hack, Berry meets up with the team Hack leads, the Ghost Detectives Club. Members of this club are “socially dead,” working invisibly within the digitally controlled society of Tom Sawyer. As she works with the group, Berry learns about Zero, a mysterious figure who lurks within Tom Sawyer's underground. She and Hack decide to chase down this figure, and in time, the truth behind the city is revealed…   Science SARU's Yurei Deco television anime will premiere in Japan in July.    Tomohisa Shimoyama (Super Shiro) is directing the anime, and Dai Sato (Eureka Seven script supervisor, 10 Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex episodes, three Cowboy Bebop episodes) is in charge of series scripts.    The musical artists contributing to the anime are mito from the group Clammbon, Kōtarō Saitō, and Yebisu303. Clammbon has performed theme songs for such anime as Isekai Izakaya: Japanese Food From Another World, Polar Bear's Café, and She and Her Cat -Everything Flows-. mito has composed anime soundtracks for such anime as Flip Flappers, and Alice & Zoroku under the alias TO-MAS.     Crunchyroll did not give a release window for Classroom of the Elite II, but it describes the story of the anime's first season:   Kiyotaka Ayanokoji has just enrolled at Tokyo Koudo Ikusei Senior High School, where it's said that 100% of students go on to college or find employment. But he ends up in Class 1-D, which is full of all the school's problem children. What's more, every month, the school awards students points with a cash value of 100,000 yen, and the classes employ a laissez-faire policy in which talking, sleeping, and even sabotage are permitted during class. One month later, Ayanokoji, Horikita, and the students of Class D learn the truth of the system in place within their school…   The first television anime  of Syougo Kinugasa's Classroom of the Elite (Yōkoso Jitsuryoku Shijō Shugi no Kyōshitsu e) light novel series premiered in July 2017. Crunchyroll streamed the series, and Funimation streamed an English dub. The anime is getting two more seasons in July 2022 and sometime in 2023 with a returning cast. The sequel anime will adapt the original story's complete first-year-student arc.    The first season's directors Seiji Kishi and Hiroyuki Hashimoto are returning as chief directors, with Yoshihito Nishōji (first season's opening sequence, Maji de Otaku na English! Ribbon-chan: Eigo de Tatakau Mahō Shōjo, Seven Senses of the Re'Union) as the credited director at Lerche. Hayato Kazano (first season's episode scripts, Killing Bites, Rumble Garanndoll) is now overseeing the series scripts, and Kazuaki Morita is back to design the characters. Masaru Yokoyama is now composing the music, joined by Kana Hashiguchi (A3! Season Autumn & Winter, A3! Season Spring & Summer, Black Fox).  Singer ZAQ is returning from the first season to perform the new opening theme song. Mai Fuchigami is singing the new ending theme song.    Crunchyroll will stream Harem in the Labyrinth of Another World in July, and it describes the story:   Struggling with life and society, high school student Michio Kaga wanders about the Internet and lands on an odd website. The website, featuring a number of questions and a point based system, allows one to create skills and abilities for a character. Upon completing his character, Kaga was transported to a game-like fantasy world and reborn as a strong man who can claim idol-level girls. Thus begins the cheat and harem legend of a reborn man!   The television anime adapts Shachi Sogano's Isekai Meikyū de Harem o light novel series. The anime will star Taku Yashiro as Michio Kaga and Shiori Mikami as Roxanne.    Naoyuki Tatsuwa (Katteni Kaizō, Nisekoi, The Island of Giant Insects) is directing the anime at Passione. Kurasumi Sunayama (Bakuon!!, Minami Kamakura High School Girls Cycling Club, Yowamushi Pedal New Generation) is in charge of the series scripts. Makoto Uno (Love Hina, Gravion, High School DxD Hero) is designing the characters.

Crunchyroll did not give a release window for Classroom of the Elite II, but it describes the story of the anime's first season:   Kiyotaka Ayanokoji has just enrolled at Tokyo Koudo Ikusei Senior High School, where it's said that 100% of students go on to college or find employment. But he ends up in Class 1-D, which is full of all the school's problem children. What's more, every month, the school awards students points with a cash value of 100,000 yen, and the classes employ a laissez-faire policy in which talking, sleeping, and even sabotage are permitted during class. One month later, Ayanokoji, Horikita, and the students of Class D learn the truth of the system in place within their school…   The first television anime  of Syougo Kinugasa's Classroom of the Elite (Yōkoso Jitsuryoku Shijō Shugi no Kyōshitsu e) light novel series premiered in July 2017.

Tokyo 24th Ward Episode 12  by Christopher Farris, Apr  8th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Tokyo 24th Ward ?                     Community score: 3.1            I definitely had my concerns going into the finale of Tokyo 24th Ward, not so much with whether it would achieve any measurable quality after all this time on the downtrend, but more on how much it would ask of me, evaluation-wise. I don't think I've made any secret of how exhausting I've come to find this show as its weeks wore on, the series repeatedly detailing its views on a bifurcated political system and me having to regularly re-explain why I thought those articulations were stupid. So here at the end of this excruciating thought exercise, would the series throw out some complex domino-arrangement of a solution to its social struggles that I would then have to extend similar effort in knocking down? The answer turns out to be 'no', thankfully, though I suppose I probably never should have expected so much from this series in the first place.    It's kind of a wonder to watch Tokyo 24th Ward sprint so quickly from its own ambitions at this point that you almost forget it ever had any. Perhaps that was the reason for such an order of operations. As the RGB boys close in on her, Asumi expresses shock, disbelief, that they could seek a third path, a compromise between the binary choices of the trolley problem they'd been presented with. That might ring as a properly true surprise had a teamwork-based fix-everything solution not been shown off for the very first problem she issued to them. Since then the one-or-the-other failures have come about as a result of more complicated plot factors as well as disagreements between the boys themselves, so it only makes sense that the show is able to articulate the possibility of things working out so long as conditions are perfect and people are able to work together. That all sets up for the show's final lesson, by the way, and it really is all we get.    Instead, so much of the episode's time is filled, perhaps appropriately for a big series finale, with spectacle of the more conventional variety. There's a high-speed van race to get the kids to the system so they can have their chat with Asumi. There's a ticking clock in the form of the intensifying protests that Mayor Gori can't quell as 0th hangs outside his office and yells ""Debate me, coward!"". Some of the vehicular CGI in all this action looks a bit skippy, and the character models (especially for faces or any crowd characters who aren't protagonists) are as loose and unchecked as things have been since the beginning of this show. But there are still some fluid segments of stunt-based action, and as long as this show has basically stopped thinking about any of its concepts at this point, I'll respect it for having the graciousness to instead occupy us by showing Shu using rocket-rollerblades to Rider Kick a big rig. Plus I just think it's funny that after all the potential doomsaying about this show's production melting down that was bandied about throughout its run (something I'm as guilty of as anyone else) it's seemingly held together as well as possible here to the end, and it was the writing of this dang thing that ended up being the massive let-down. You never know, I guess.    But the trio does need to get to Asumi eventually, and while the VR cyberscape they occupy for their conversation looks as nice as any of the other nicer parts of this show, the actual content is almost shockingly thin conceptually. Say what you will about the execution of Tokyo 24th Ward's idea, at least it seemed to have ambition, and a smattering of socio-political vocabulary with which to express it. But as with the bleating beat-down the boys gave each other at the climax of last week's episode, the writing has now decided to also cap off the climaxes of its plot in simpler, character-based terms rather than any grand, detailed reform suggestions. Most of what's detailed here is the boys understanding the efforts that Asumi suffered through as proxy for the choices that should be made by humans, and thus resolving to…allow humans to make those choices. Yes, the big compromising solution at the heart of ""KANAE System 2.0"" turns out to be…voting! Regular old democratic voting. They don't even spend any time talking about what kind of systemic overhaul this represents for the people of the 24th Ward, instead resolving with some light platitudes about making sure people choose what's best, then waving goodbye to Asumi's ghost-in-the-machine as they confirm how she was basically the most awesome person ever and they all loved her. Seriously, that's the big triumphant moment of this climax, as all the people around the Ward watching the livestream of RGB hashing things out with the Minority Report Vtuber unilaterally declare how much they love her, and that love is the unifying factor that makes them all abandon those hasty violent reform options in favor of going back to good old voting. Or something.    And that's it! All the wrap-ups that follow are embarrassingly basic, from the show flashing forward to the real-world date it ended on of April 6th, 2022, because that's how clever it thinks it is, to Shantytown getting torn down anyway, but it's okay because in this case it was because of seismic resistance issues. After all its build-up and Big Questions presented by the recurring trolley problem format, the series seems uninterested in provoking answers even from the audience, settling on ""Things aren't perfect, but they'll probably be ok if you just let people figure it out"". It's bizarrely flippant and optimistic for a story that clearly had some understanding of the complex societal factors that led to so many of the ills it was illustrating in the first place. But then, as I said, I almost respect the show more for realizing right at the finish line that it had neither the concept nor ability to waste our time with more complicated, ill-fated illustrative solutions. So that's where it lands: A show that weeks ago was able to make the salient point that crime rates in lower-income areas are an inflated result of various baked-in socioeconomic prejudices, now declares all societal issues solved when we see Shu head-butt a mugger and hand a kid some bread. I guess the only thing that stops a bad guy with a knife is a good guy with a bun.    Rating:                 Tokyo 24th Ward is currently streaming on Crunchyroll and Funimation.

Tokyo 24th Ward Episode 12  by Christopher Farris, Apr  8th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Tokyo 24th Ward ?                     Community score: 3.1            I definitely had my concerns going into the finale of Tokyo 24th Ward, not so much with whether it would achieve any measurable quality after all this time on the downtrend, but more on how much it would ask of me, evaluation-wise. I don't think I've made any secret of how exhausting I've come to find this show as its weeks wore on, the series repeatedly detailing its views on a bifurcated political system and me having to regularly re-explain why I thought those articulations were stupid. So here at the end of this excruciating thought exercise, would the series throw out some complex domino-arrangement of a solution to its social struggles that I would then have to extend similar effort in knocking down? The answer turns out to be 'no', thankfully, though I suppose I probably never should have expected so much from this series in the first place.    It's kind of a wonder to watch Tokyo 24th Ward sprint so quickly from its own ambitions at this point that you almost forget it ever had any. Perhaps that was the reason for such an order of operations. As the RGB boys close in on her, Asumi expresses shock, disbelief, that they could seek a third path, a compromise between the binary choices of the trolley problem they'd been presented with. That might ring as a properly true surprise had a teamwork-based fix-everything solution not been shown off for the very first problem she issued to them. Since then the one-or-the-other failures have come about as a result of more complicated plot factors as well as disagreements between the boys themselves, so it only makes sense that the show is able to articulate the possibility of things working out so long as conditions are perfect and people are able to work together. That all sets up for the show's final lesson, by the way, and it really is all we get.    Instead, so much of the episode's time is filled, perhaps appropriately for a big series finale, with spectacle of the more conventional variety. There's a high-speed van race to get the kids to the system so they can have their chat with Asumi. There's a ticking clock in the form of the intensifying protests that Mayor Gori can't quell as 0th hangs outside his office and yells ""Debate me, coward!"". Some of the vehicular CGI in all this action looks a bit skippy, and the character models (especially for faces or any crowd characters who aren't protagonists) are as loose and unchecked as things have been since the beginning of this show. But there are still some fluid segments of stunt-based action, and as long as this show has basically stopped thinking about any of its concepts at this point, I'll respect it for having the graciousness to instead occupy us by showing Shu using rocket-rollerblades to Rider Kick a big rig. Plus I just think it's funny that after all the potential doomsaying about this show's production melting down that was bandied about throughout its run (something I'm as guilty of as anyone else) it's seemingly held together as well as possible here to the end, and it was the writing of this dang thing that ended up being the massive let-down. You never know, I guess.    But the trio does need to get to Asumi eventually, and while the VR cyberscape they occupy for their conversation looks as nice as any of the other nicer parts of this show, the actual content is almost shockingly thin conceptually. Say what you will about the execution of Tokyo 24th Ward's idea, at least it seemed to have ambition, and a smattering of socio-political vocabulary with which to express it. But as with the bleating beat-down the boys gave each other at the climax of last week's episode, the writing has now decided to also cap off the climaxes of its plot in simpler, character-based terms rather than any grand, detailed reform suggestions. Most of what's detailed here is the boys understanding the efforts that Asumi suffered through as proxy for the choices that should be made by humans, and thus resolving to…allow humans to make those choices. Yes, the big compromising solution at the heart of ""KANAE System 2.0"" turns out to be…voting! Regular old democratic voting. They don't even spend any time talking about what kind of systemic overhaul this represents for the people of the 24th Ward, instead resolving with some light platitudes about making sure people choose what's best, then waving goodbye to Asumi's ghost-in-the-machine as they confirm how she was basically the most awesome person ever and they all loved her. Seriously, that's the big triumphant moment of this climax, as all the people around the Ward watching the livestream of RGB hashing things out with the Minority Report Vtuber unilaterally declare how much they love her, and that love is the unifying factor that makes them all abandon those hasty violent reform options in favor of going back to good old voting. Or something.    And that's it! All the wrap-ups that follow are embarrassingly basic, from the show flashing forward to the real-world date it ended on of April 6th, 2022, because that's how clever it thinks it is, to Shantytown getting torn down anyway, but it's okay because in this case it was because of seismic resistance issues. After all its build-up and Big Questions presented by the recurring trolley problem format, the series seems uninterested in provoking answers even from the audience, settling on ""Things aren't perfect, but they'll probably be ok if you just let people figure it out"".

So that's where it lands: A show that weeks ago was able to make the salient point that crime rates in lower-income areas are an inflated result of various baked-in socioeconomic prejudices, now declares all societal issues solved when we see Shu head-butt a mugger and hand a kid some bread. I guess the only thing that stops a bad guy with a knife is a good guy with a bun.    Rating:                 Tokyo 24th Ward is currently streaming on Crunchyroll and Funimation.

Tokyo 24th Ward Episode 12  by Christopher Farris, Apr  8th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Tokyo 24th Ward ?                     Community score: 3.1            I definitely had my concerns going into the finale of Tokyo 24th Ward, not so much with whether it would achieve any measurable quality after all this time on the downtrend, but more on how much it would ask of me, evaluation-wise. I don't think I've made any secret of how exhausting I've come to find this show as its weeks wore on, the series repeatedly detailing its views on a bifurcated political system and me having to regularly re-explain why I thought those articulations were stupid. So here at the end of this excruciating thought exercise, would the series throw out some complex domino-arrangement of a solution to its social struggles that I would then have to extend similar effort in knocking down? The answer turns out to be 'no', thankfully, though I suppose I probably never should have expected so much from this series in the first place.    It's kind of a wonder to watch Tokyo 24th Ward sprint so quickly from its own ambitions at this point that you almost forget it ever had any. Perhaps that was the reason for such an order of operations. As the RGB boys close in on her, Asumi expresses shock, disbelief, that they could seek a third path, a compromise between the binary choices of the trolley problem they'd been presented with. That might ring as a properly true surprise had a teamwork-based fix-everything solution not been shown off for the very first problem she issued to them. Since then the one-or-the-other failures have come about as a result of more complicated plot factors as well as disagreements between the boys themselves, so it only makes sense that the show is able to articulate the possibility of things working out so long as conditions are perfect and people are able to work together. That all sets up for the show's final lesson, by the way, and it really is all we get.    Instead, so much of the episode's time is filled, perhaps appropriately for a big series finale, with spectacle of the more conventional variety. There's a high-speed van race to get the kids to the system so they can have their chat with Asumi. There's a ticking clock in the form of the intensifying protests that Mayor Gori can't quell as 0th hangs outside his office and yells ""Debate me, coward!"". Some of the vehicular CGI in all this action looks a bit skippy, and the character models (especially for faces or any crowd characters who aren't protagonists) are as loose and unchecked as things have been since the beginning of this show. But there are still some fluid segments of stunt-based action, and as long as this show has basically stopped thinking about any of its concepts at this point, I'll respect it for having the graciousness to instead occupy us by showing Shu using rocket-rollerblades to Rider Kick a big rig. Plus I just think it's funny that after all the potential doomsaying about this show's production melting down that was bandied about throughout its run (something I'm as guilty of as anyone else) it's seemingly held together as well as possible here to the end, and it was the writing of this dang thing that ended up being the massive let-down. You never know, I guess.    But the trio does need to get to Asumi eventually, and while the VR cyberscape they occupy for their conversation looks as nice as any of the other nicer parts of this show, the actual content is almost shockingly thin conceptually. Say what you will about the execution of Tokyo 24th Ward's idea, at least it seemed to have ambition, and a smattering of socio-political vocabulary with which to express it. But as with the bleating beat-down the boys gave each other at the climax of last week's episode, the writing has now decided to also cap off the climaxes of its plot in simpler, character-based terms rather than any grand, detailed reform suggestions. Most of what's detailed here is the boys understanding the efforts that Asumi suffered through as proxy for the choices that should be made by humans, and thus resolving to…allow humans to make those choices. Yes, the big compromising solution at the heart of ""KANAE System 2.0"" turns out to be…voting! Regular old democratic voting. They don't even spend any time talking about what kind of systemic overhaul this represents for the people of the 24th Ward, instead resolving with some light platitudes about making sure people choose what's best, then waving goodbye to Asumi's ghost-in-the-machine as they confirm how she was basically the most awesome person ever and they all loved her. Seriously, that's the big triumphant moment of this climax, as all the people around the Ward watching the livestream of RGB hashing things out with the Minority Report Vtuber unilaterally declare how much they love her, and that love is the unifying factor that makes them all abandon those hasty violent reform options in favor of going back to good old voting. Or something.    And that's it! All the wrap-ups that follow are embarrassingly basic, from the show flashing forward to the real-world date it ended on of April 6th, 2022, because that's how clever it thinks it is, to Shantytown getting torn down anyway, but it's okay because in this case it was because of seismic resistance issues. After all its build-up and Big Questions presented by the recurring trolley problem format, the series seems uninterested in provoking answers even from the audience, settling on ""Things aren't perfect, but they'll probably be ok if you just let people figure it out"". It's bizarrely flippant and optimistic for a story that clearly had some understanding of the complex societal factors that led to so many of the ills it was illustrating in the first place. But then, as I said, I almost respect the show more for realizing right at the finish line that it had neither the concept nor ability to waste our time with more complicated, ill-fated illustrative solutions. So that's where it lands: A show that weeks ago was able to make the salient point that crime rates in lower-income areas are an inflated result of various baked-in socioeconomic prejudices, now declares all societal issues solved when we see Shu head-butt a mugger and hand a kid some bread. I guess the only thing that stops a bad guy with a knife is a good guy with a bun.    Rating:                 Tokyo 24th Ward is currently streaming on Crunchyroll and Funimation.

Tokyo 24th Ward Episode 12  by Christopher Farris, Apr  8th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Tokyo 24th Ward ?                     Community score: 3.1            I definitely had my concerns going into the finale of Tokyo 24th Ward, not so much with whether it would achieve any measurable quality after all this time on the downtrend, but more on how much it would ask of me, evaluation-wise. I don't think I've made any secret of how exhausting I've come to find this show as its weeks wore on, the series repeatedly detailing its views on a bifurcated political system and me having to regularly re-explain why I thought those articulations were stupid. So here at the end of this excruciating thought exercise, would the series throw out some complex domino-arrangement of a solution to its social struggles that I would then have to extend similar effort in knocking down? The answer turns out to be 'no', thankfully, though I suppose I probably never should have expected so much from this series in the first place.    It's kind of a wonder to watch Tokyo 24th Ward sprint so quickly from its own ambitions at this point that you almost forget it ever had any. Perhaps that was the reason for such an order of operations. As the RGB boys close in on her, Asumi expresses shock, disbelief, that they could seek a third path, a compromise between the binary choices of the trolley problem they'd been presented with. That might ring as a properly true surprise had a teamwork-based fix-everything solution not been shown off for the very first problem she issued to them. Since then the one-or-the-other failures have come about as a result of more complicated plot factors as well as disagreements between the boys themselves, so it only makes sense that the show is able to articulate the possibility of things working out so long as conditions are perfect and people are able to work together. That all sets up for the show's final lesson, by the way, and it really is all we get.    Instead, so much of the episode's time is filled, perhaps appropriately for a big series finale, with spectacle of the more conventional variety. There's a high-speed van race to get the kids to the system so they can have their chat with Asumi. There's a ticking clock in the form of the intensifying protests that Mayor Gori can't quell as 0th hangs outside his office and yells ""Debate me, coward!"". Some of the vehicular CGI in all this action looks a bit skippy, and the character models (especially for faces or any crowd characters who aren't protagonists) are as loose and unchecked as things have been since the beginning of this show. But there are still some fluid segments of stunt-based action, and as long as this show has basically stopped thinking about any of its concepts at this point, I'll respect it for having the graciousness to instead occupy us by showing Shu using rocket-rollerblades to Rider Kick a big rig. Plus I just think it's funny that after all the potential doomsaying about this show's production melting down that was bandied about throughout its run (something I'm as guilty of as anyone else) it's seemingly held together as well as possible here to the end, and it was the writing of this dang thing that ended up being the massive let-down. You never know, I guess.    But the trio does need to get to Asumi eventually, and while the VR cyberscape they occupy for their conversation looks as nice as any of the other nicer parts of this show, the actual content is almost shockingly thin conceptually. Say what you will about the execution of Tokyo 24th Ward's idea, at least it seemed to have ambition, and a smattering of socio-political vocabulary with which to express it. But as with the bleating beat-down the boys gave each other at the climax of last week's episode, the writing has now decided to also cap off the climaxes of its plot in simpler, character-based terms rather than any grand, detailed reform suggestions. Most of what's detailed here is the boys understanding the efforts that Asumi suffered through as proxy for the choices that should be made by humans, and thus resolving to…allow humans to make those choices. Yes, the big compromising solution at the heart of ""KANAE System 2.0"" turns out to be…voting! Regular old democratic voting. They don't even spend any time talking about what kind of systemic overhaul this represents for the people of the 24th Ward, instead resolving with some light platitudes about making sure people choose what's best, then waving goodbye to Asumi's ghost-in-the-machine as they confirm how she was basically the most awesome person ever and they all loved her. Seriously, that's the big triumphant moment of this climax, as all the people around the Ward watching the livestream of RGB hashing things out with the Minority Report Vtuber unilaterally declare how much they love her, and that love is the unifying factor that makes them all abandon those hasty violent reform options in favor of going back to good old voting. Or something.    And that's it! All the wrap-ups that follow are embarrassingly basic, from the show flashing forward to the real-world date it ended on of April 6th, 2022, because that's how clever it thinks it is, to Shantytown getting torn down anyway, but it's okay because in this case it was because of seismic resistance issues. After all its build-up and Big Questions presented by the recurring trolley problem format, the series seems uninterested in provoking answers even from the audience, settling on ""Things aren't perfect, but they'll probably be ok if you just let people figure it out"". It's bizarrely flippant and optimistic for a story that clearly had some understanding of the complex societal factors that led to so many of the ills it was illustrating in the first place. But then, as I said, I almost respect the show more for realizing right at the finish line that it had neither the concept nor ability to waste our time with more complicated, ill-fated illustrative solutions. So that's where it lands: A show that weeks ago was able to make the salient point that crime rates in lower-income areas are an inflated result of various baked-in socioeconomic prejudices, now declares all societal issues solved when we see Shu head-butt a mugger and hand a kid some bread. I guess the only thing that stops a bad guy with a knife is a good guy with a bun.    Rating:                 Tokyo 24th Ward is currently streaming on Crunchyroll and Funimation.

I Want to Hold Aono-kun So Badly I Could Die Live-Action Star Shori Sato   by Rebecca Silverman, Apr 18th 2022           I Want to Hold Aono-kun So Badly I Could Die isn't Shori Sato's first role in a live-action adaptation of a pop culture work. A member of the boy band Sexy Zone, Sato played Haruta in the film version of HaruChika in 2017. His role as the eponymous Aono-kun in the 2022 TV series adaptation of the manga by Umi Shiina is something a little different, though: Aono-kun spends most of the series as a ghost, stuck in the world of the living for reasons he doesn't entirely understand. Playing a dead boy, especially one in an adaptation of a manga series, comes with its own set of unique challenges. We were able to ask Sato about some of those challenges and his relationship with the source material, as well as his take on ghosts, ahead of the release of the TV show.    Your character in I Want to Hold Aono-kun So Badly I Could Die is, in fact, dead. Was there anything special or different about the way you approached playing a ghost as opposed to a living person?    Shori Sato: With normal acting, it would be easy to act as if I'm plainly visible, but since I'm a ghost, I'm less conscious of my own acting and more conscious of doing things in a way that makes it easier for the other person to act.    Are there any challenges with playing a ghost? How did you prepare for the role?   Shori Sato: Unlike a regular role, it was a difficult role where I couldn't touch the other person even though I could talk in front of her. Fortunately, the staff created an environment that was very easy to work in, so the acting went smoothly.    How do you feel about Aono and Yuri's relationship?    Shori Sato: You can't normally have a romantic relationship with a ghost, so it was difficult to play, but I felt it was very interesting.    How did you approach playing “Dark Aono” as opposed to his regular appearance? Does his dark form have different motivations than his normal self?    Shori Sato: When I was “Dark Aono,” I didn't express emotions with my eyes. The regular Aono might be dead, but he expresses his feelings like a normal person.    In the west, ghost stories are often only scary or sad, but this one tries to combine both of those feelings. Do you think that's typical of Japanese ghost stories? What do you think makes the plot of Aono-kun special?   Shori Sato: Having grown up only in Japan I guess I'm not aware enough of Western ghost stories to assess specific differences, but in terms of how I applied myself to being a Japanese ghost as Aono-kun, I tried to make myself aware of how he would attempt to express emotions like a normal human. Free from the rigidity of Japanese society, he would be able to see that the most important thing is how you live the life you normally take for granted, which I think makes the plot special for most viewers.    Do you believe in ghosts? Would you want to be able to see and talk to them, like Yuri?   Shori Sato: I don't believe in ghosts. If I could speak to them, I would like to try it.    Have you read the manga that Aono-kun is based on? What did you think of it?   Shori Sato: I always read the original story before I get involved in a work, and this time was no exception. At first glance, it might seem like a shojo love story manga, but when I gave it a chance, I realized that it draws out the horror in human relationships very well. It's a great manga.    Is there a book (or manga or light novel) that you'd like to see get a film or TV adaptation so you could be in it? What kinds of stories are you drawn to?   Shori Sato: I'd like to try playing a heinous criminal. Actors hope that their own experiences can be useful in their roles, but I think that a role that the actor has absolutely no personal experience in would be a worthwhile challenge. As for stories, I like realistic ones. True stories resonate with me.    The manga for Aono-kun is currently ongoing. If you could decide on the way it will end, what would you want to happen?   Shori Sato: The story in the manga comes first, but I think it would be neat if Aono-kun comes back to life.    What do you hope viewers will take away from the TV series?   Shori Sato: I hope that you can treasure the important people who are in front of you right now. You don't know what will happen in the future, so I hope you can treasure each day as it comes.    The manga for Aono-kun is translated into English; would you like to see the TV series also be translated and broadcast for foreign audiences?    Shori Sato: I Want to Hold Aono-kun So Badly I Could Die has its sad moments and sweet moments; it's a story where the tone fluctuates a lot. I hope you can watch it and experience a rollercoaster of emotions!     discuss this in the forum |        bookmark/share with:               Interview homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review          1 comment       Hello, Melancholic!

I Want to Hold Aono-kun So Badly I Could Die Live-Action Star Shori Sato   by Rebecca Silverman, Apr 18th 2022           I Want to Hold Aono-kun So Badly I Could Die isn't Shori Sato's first role in a live-action adaptation of a pop culture work. A member of the boy band Sexy Zone, Sato played Haruta in the film version of HaruChika in 2017. His role as the eponymous Aono-kun in the 2022 TV series adaptation of the manga by Umi Shiina is something a little different, though: Aono-kun spends most of the series as a ghost, stuck in the world of the living for reasons he doesn't entirely understand. Playing a dead boy, especially one in an adaptation of a manga series, comes with its own set of unique challenges. We were able to ask Sato about some of those challenges and his relationship with the source material, as well as his take on ghosts, ahead of the release of the TV show.    Your character in I Want to Hold Aono-kun So Badly I Could Die is, in fact, dead. Was there anything special or different about the way you approached playing a ghost as opposed to a living person?    Shori Sato: With normal acting, it would be easy to act as if I'm plainly visible, but since I'm a ghost, I'm less conscious of my own acting and more conscious of doing things in a way that makes it easier for the other person to act.    Are there any challenges with playing a ghost? How did you prepare for the role?   Shori Sato: Unlike a regular role, it was a difficult role where I couldn't touch the other person even though I could talk in front of her. Fortunately, the staff created an environment that was very easy to work in, so the acting went smoothly.    How do you feel about Aono and Yuri's relationship?    Shori Sato: You can't normally have a romantic relationship with a ghost, so it was difficult to play, but I felt it was very interesting.    How did you approach playing “Dark Aono” as opposed to his regular appearance? Does his dark form have different motivations than his normal self?    Shori Sato: When I was “Dark Aono,” I didn't express emotions with my eyes. The regular Aono might be dead, but he expresses his feelings like a normal person.    In the west, ghost stories are often only scary or sad, but this one tries to combine both of those feelings. Do you think that's typical of Japanese ghost stories? What do you think makes the plot of Aono-kun special?   Shori Sato: Having grown up only in Japan I guess I'm not aware enough of Western ghost stories to assess specific differences, but in terms of how I applied myself to being a Japanese ghost as Aono-kun, I tried to make myself aware of how he would attempt to express emotions like a normal human. Free from the rigidity of Japanese society, he would be able to see that the most important thing is how you live the life you normally take for granted, which I think makes the plot special for most viewers.    Do you believe in ghosts? Would you want to be able to see and talk to them, like Yuri?   Shori Sato: I don't believe in ghosts. If I could speak to them, I would like to try it.    Have you read the manga that Aono-kun is based on? What did you think of it?   Shori Sato: I always read the original story before I get involved in a work, and this time was no exception. At first glance, it might seem like a shojo love story manga, but when I gave it a chance, I realized that it draws out the horror in human relationships very well. It's a great manga.    Is there a book (or manga or light novel) that you'd like to see get a film or TV adaptation so you could be in it? What kinds of stories are you drawn to?   Shori Sato: I'd like to try playing a heinous criminal. Actors hope that their own experiences can be useful in their roles, but I think that a role that the actor has absolutely no personal experience in would be a worthwhile challenge. As for stories, I like realistic ones. True stories resonate with me.    The manga for Aono-kun is currently ongoing. If you could decide on the way it will end, what would you want to happen?   Shori Sato: The story in the manga comes first, but I think it would be neat if Aono-kun comes back to life.    What do you hope viewers will take away from the TV series?   Shori Sato: I hope that you can treasure the important people who are in front of you right now. You don't know what will happen in the future, so I hope you can treasure each day as it comes.    The manga for Aono-kun is translated into English; would you like to see the TV series also be translated and broadcast for foreign audiences?    Shori Sato: I Want to Hold Aono-kun So Badly I Could Die has its sad moments and sweet moments; it's a story where the tone fluctuates a lot. I hope you can watch it and experience a rollercoaster of emotions!     discuss this in the forum |        bookmark/share with:               Interview homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review          1 comment       Hello, Melancholic!

I Want to Hold Aono-kun So Badly I Could Die Live-Action Star Shori Sato   by Rebecca Silverman, Apr 18th 2022           I Want to Hold Aono-kun So Badly I Could Die isn't Shori Sato's first role in a live-action adaptation of a pop culture work. A member of the boy band Sexy Zone, Sato played Haruta in the film version of HaruChika in 2017. His role as the eponymous Aono-kun in the 2022 TV series adaptation of the manga by Umi Shiina is something a little different, though: Aono-kun spends most of the series as a ghost, stuck in the world of the living for reasons he doesn't entirely understand. Playing a dead boy, especially one in an adaptation of a manga series, comes with its own set of unique challenges. We were able to ask Sato about some of those challenges and his relationship with the source material, as well as his take on ghosts, ahead of the release of the TV show.    Your character in I Want to Hold Aono-kun So Badly I Could Die is, in fact, dead. Was there anything special or different about the way you approached playing a ghost as opposed to a living person?    Shori Sato: With normal acting, it would be easy to act as if I'm plainly visible, but since I'm a ghost, I'm less conscious of my own acting and more conscious of doing things in a way that makes it easier for the other person to act.    Are there any challenges with playing a ghost? How did you prepare for the role?   Shori Sato: Unlike a regular role, it was a difficult role where I couldn't touch the other person even though I could talk in front of her. Fortunately, the staff created an environment that was very easy to work in, so the acting went smoothly.    How do you feel about Aono and Yuri's relationship?    Shori Sato: You can't normally have a romantic relationship with a ghost, so it was difficult to play, but I felt it was very interesting.    How did you approach playing “Dark Aono” as opposed to his regular appearance? Does his dark form have different motivations than his normal self?    Shori Sato: When I was “Dark Aono,” I didn't express emotions with my eyes. The regular Aono might be dead, but he expresses his feelings like a normal person.    In the west, ghost stories are often only scary or sad, but this one tries to combine both of those feelings. Do you think that's typical of Japanese ghost stories? What do you think makes the plot of Aono-kun special?   Shori Sato: Having grown up only in Japan I guess I'm not aware enough of Western ghost stories to assess specific differences, but in terms of how I applied myself to being a Japanese ghost as Aono-kun, I tried to make myself aware of how he would attempt to express emotions like a normal human. Free from the rigidity of Japanese society, he would be able to see that the most important thing is how you live the life you normally take for granted, which I think makes the plot special for most viewers.    Do you believe in ghosts? Would you want to be able to see and talk to them, like Yuri?   Shori Sato: I don't believe in ghosts. If I could speak to them, I would like to try it.    Have you read the manga that Aono-kun is based on? What did you think of it?   Shori Sato: I always read the original story before I get involved in a work, and this time was no exception. At first glance, it might seem like a shojo love story manga, but when I gave it a chance, I realized that it draws out the horror in human relationships very well. It's a great manga.    Is there a book (or manga or light novel) that you'd like to see get a film or TV adaptation so you could be in it? What kinds of stories are you drawn to?   Shori Sato: I'd like to try playing a heinous criminal. Actors hope that their own experiences can be useful in their roles, but I think that a role that the actor has absolutely no personal experience in would be a worthwhile challenge. As for stories, I like realistic ones. True stories resonate with me.    The manga for Aono-kun is currently ongoing. If you could decide on the way it will end, what would you want to happen?   Shori Sato: The story in the manga comes first, but I think it would be neat if Aono-kun comes back to life.    What do you hope viewers will take away from the TV series?   Shori Sato: I hope that you can treasure the important people who are in front of you right now. You don't know what will happen in the future, so I hope you can treasure each day as it comes.    The manga for Aono-kun is translated into English; would you like to see the TV series also be translated and broadcast for foreign audiences?    Shori Sato: I Want to Hold Aono-kun So Badly I Could Die has its sad moments and sweet moments; it's a story where the tone fluctuates a lot. I hope you can watch it and experience a rollercoaster of emotions!     discuss this in the forum |        bookmark/share with:               Interview homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review          1 comment       Hello, Melancholic!
