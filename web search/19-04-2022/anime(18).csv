The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Summer Time Rendering   Apr 15th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Summer Time Rendering ?                     Community score: 4.2              What is this?   Upon hearing of Ushio's death, Shinpei returns to his hometown of Wakayama City on Hitogashima and reunites with his childhood friend's family. The funeral goes smoothly, but under the surface something strange is brewing on the island. (from manga)   Summer Time Rendering is based on Yasuki Tanaka's suspense manga and streams on Disney+ in Japan on Wednesdays.    Note: The series still isn't available for streaming worldwide. Richard Eisenbeis lives in Japan and was able to watch the first episode there, albeit without subtitles.     How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                To tell the truth, before today, I had never even heard of Summer Time Rendering. I went into it totally blind—and that is absolutely the way it should be experienced. In fact, if you're already planning to watch it whenever Disney+ decides to set it free in your corner of the world, you should stop reading this review. Just take my word that it's a fantastic 24 minutes and you won't regret keeping yourself in the dark.    As for the rest of you, whether it be those who have already read the manga or those who need to know more before setting aside your time, let's get into it. This first episode of Summer Time Rendering is a master class at playing with tone, making you question what you are watching. At the start it could be any genre of show: we have a kid, Shinpei, going back to his hometown after several years away for the funeral of one of his closest friends, Ushio. But no sooner has he set foot on the island than things seem subtly off: he has strange dreams, there are a ton of well-dressed tourists all about, and his sister Mio seems more excited about his return than sad over the death of her sister. Then things swerve into the suspenseful, as we learn that there are signs Ushio was murdered, before it goes straight into horror when we start hearing about doppelgangers—and how people who have seen them soon disappear without a trace. And then comes the out-of-left-field cliffhanger where things suddenly go full sci-fi.    As all this is going on, there are a ton of things in the background hinting to what is truly going on. Some of these come across in random conversations. Others are visual, brought to life by the show's beautiful animation and its focus on intricate detail. It's a show that you'll want to rewatch even as the credits roll.    All in all, this first episode of Summer Time Rendering is an absolute roller-coaster. It's the best kind of premiere: one that makes it impossible to not want to come back for more. If you enjoy anime like Steins;Gate, ERASED, Sakurada Reset, or Re:Zero, you'll definitely be intrigued. And as for anyone else, well, you should definitely give it a chance.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review          1 comment       Hello, Melancholic!

And then comes the out-of-left-field cliffhanger where things suddenly go full sci-fi.    As all this is going on, there are a ton of things in the background hinting to what is truly going on. Some of these come across in random conversations. Others are visual, brought to life by the show's beautiful animation and its focus on intricate detail. It's a show that you'll want to rewatch even as the credits roll.    All in all, this first episode of Summer Time Rendering is an absolute roller-coaster. It's the best kind of premiere: one that makes it impossible to not want to come back for more. If you enjoy anime like Steins;Gate, ERASED, Sakurada Reset, or Re:Zero, you'll definitely be intrigued. And as for anyone else, well, you should definitely give it a chance.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review          1 comment       Hello, Melancholic!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Summer Time Rendering   Apr 15th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Summer Time Rendering ?                     Community score: 4.2              What is this?   Upon hearing of Ushio's death, Shinpei returns to his hometown of Wakayama City on Hitogashima and reunites with his childhood friend's family. The funeral goes smoothly, but under the surface something strange is brewing on the island. (from manga)   Summer Time Rendering is based on Yasuki Tanaka's suspense manga and streams on Disney+ in Japan on Wednesdays.    Note: The series still isn't available for streaming worldwide. Richard Eisenbeis lives in Japan and was able to watch the first episode there, albeit without subtitles.     How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                To tell the truth, before today, I had never even heard of Summer Time Rendering. I went into it totally blind—and that is absolutely the way it should be experienced. In fact, if you're already planning to watch it whenever Disney+ decides to set it free in your corner of the world, you should stop reading this review. Just take my word that it's a fantastic 24 minutes and you won't regret keeping yourself in the dark.    As for the rest of you, whether it be those who have already read the manga or those who need to know more before setting aside your time, let's get into it. This first episode of Summer Time Rendering is a master class at playing with tone, making you question what you are watching. At the start it could be any genre of show: we have a kid, Shinpei, going back to his hometown after several years away for the funeral of one of his closest friends, Ushio. But no sooner has he set foot on the island than things seem subtly off: he has strange dreams, there are a ton of well-dressed tourists all about, and his sister Mio seems more excited about his return than sad over the death of her sister. Then things swerve into the suspenseful, as we learn that there are signs Ushio was murdered, before it goes straight into horror when we start hearing about doppelgangers—and how people who have seen them soon disappear without a trace. And then comes the out-of-left-field cliffhanger where things suddenly go full sci-fi.    As all this is going on, there are a ton of things in the background hinting to what is truly going on. Some of these come across in random conversations. Others are visual, brought to life by the show's beautiful animation and its focus on intricate detail. It's a show that you'll want to rewatch even as the credits roll.    All in all, this first episode of Summer Time Rendering is an absolute roller-coaster. It's the best kind of premiere: one that makes it impossible to not want to come back for more. If you enjoy anime like Steins;Gate, ERASED, Sakurada Reset, or Re:Zero, you'll definitely be intrigued. And as for anyone else, well, you should definitely give it a chance.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review          1 comment       Hello, Melancholic!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Summer Time Rendering   Apr 15th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Summer Time Rendering ?                     Community score: 4.2              What is this?   Upon hearing of Ushio's death, Shinpei returns to his hometown of Wakayama City on Hitogashima and reunites with his childhood friend's family. The funeral goes smoothly, but under the surface something strange is brewing on the island. (from manga)   Summer Time Rendering is based on Yasuki Tanaka's suspense manga and streams on Disney+ in Japan on Wednesdays.    Note: The series still isn't available for streaming worldwide. Richard Eisenbeis lives in Japan and was able to watch the first episode there, albeit without subtitles.     How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                To tell the truth, before today, I had never even heard of Summer Time Rendering. I went into it totally blind—and that is absolutely the way it should be experienced. In fact, if you're already planning to watch it whenever Disney+ decides to set it free in your corner of the world, you should stop reading this review. Just take my word that it's a fantastic 24 minutes and you won't regret keeping yourself in the dark.    As for the rest of you, whether it be those who have already read the manga or those who need to know more before setting aside your time, let's get into it. This first episode of Summer Time Rendering is a master class at playing with tone, making you question what you are watching. At the start it could be any genre of show: we have a kid, Shinpei, going back to his hometown after several years away for the funeral of one of his closest friends, Ushio. But no sooner has he set foot on the island than things seem subtly off: he has strange dreams, there are a ton of well-dressed tourists all about, and his sister Mio seems more excited about his return than sad over the death of her sister. Then things swerve into the suspenseful, as we learn that there are signs Ushio was murdered, before it goes straight into horror when we start hearing about doppelgangers—and how people who have seen them soon disappear without a trace. And then comes the out-of-left-field cliffhanger where things suddenly go full sci-fi.    As all this is going on, there are a ton of things in the background hinting to what is truly going on. Some of these come across in random conversations. Others are visual, brought to life by the show's beautiful animation and its focus on intricate detail. It's a show that you'll want to rewatch even as the credits roll.    All in all, this first episode of Summer Time Rendering is an absolute roller-coaster. It's the best kind of premiere: one that makes it impossible to not want to come back for more. If you enjoy anime like Steins;Gate, ERASED, Sakurada Reset, or Re:Zero, you'll definitely be intrigued. And as for anyone else, well, you should definitely give it a chance.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review          1 comment       Hello, Melancholic!

Then things swerve into the suspenseful, as we learn that there are signs Ushio was murdered, before it goes straight into horror when we start hearing about doppelgangers—and how people who have seen them soon disappear without a trace. And then comes the out-of-left-field cliffhanger where things suddenly go full sci-fi.    As all this is going on, there are a ton of things in the background hinting to what is truly going on. Some of these come across in random conversations. Others are visual, brought to life by the show's beautiful animation and its focus on intricate detail. It's a show that you'll want to rewatch even as the credits roll.    All in all, this first episode of Summer Time Rendering is an absolute roller-coaster. It's the best kind of premiere: one that makes it impossible to not want to come back for more.

The anime's English release may yet uphold the established naming, or not. We'll see lol.

The anime's English release may yet uphold the established naming, or not. We'll see lol.

Community score: 3.9              What is this?   No sooner has Naofumi settled into his role as the new ruler of Raphtalia's village, that they're beset by an attack from a horde of bat monsters! The timer for the Waves is mysteriously stalled, and a meeting with the other Cardinal Heroes and the Queen reveals the rising of a new threat: The 'Spirit Tortoise' is bringing potential ruin with it, and with the other Heroes opting out of doing anything about it, things naturally fall to Naofumi to take care of things. With new ally (and new slave) Rishia in tow, the Shield Hero's party heads for the Spirit Tortoise Kingdom in order to save the world once again.    The Rising of The Shield Hero Season 2 is based on Aneko Yusagi's novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Wednesdays.      How was the first episode?  Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               When last we left off, Naofumi and the others were struggling with the revelation that they were involved in a battle between worlds rather than a simple monster invasion. However, all this is put to the side as a new threat arises, the Spirit Tortoise, whose arrival mysteriously puts a stop to the Waves for the time being.    When it comes down to it, this episode is really only concerned with one thing: exposition. Though we do get two quick action scenes, the thrust of the episode is about establishing the status quo for the arc—i.e., the threat of the turtle—while reminding us of important plot points from the previous season.    Luckily, this is done largely through character building. We see that Naofumi is far from the aggrieved man he was for much of the first season. Becoming the lord of Raphtalia's hometown has tied him irrevocably to the kingdom. While the other heroes still see the fantasy world as a game, to Naofumi it has become his true life filled with things he is driven to protect.    We also spend a lot of time developing Rishia, the newest member of Naofumi's party. She's a young woman in turmoil—in love with a man who has rejected her even though she is dying to be useful to him. But in her, there is potential, though Naofumi and his friends are unsure how to bring it out and what form it will ultimately take. She is an inherently tragic character but through Naofumi's party, it looks like she will be able to become the person she was meant to be. If nothing else, her earnestness makes her easy to root for.    All in all, while this is one of the weaker episodes, it does its job setting up the next arc well enough and gives us some solid character development to boot. Hopefully, things will pick up a bit next episode.      How was the first episode?  Christopher Farris  Rating:               There's the possibility that kicking off a second season of The Rising of the Shield Hero could be a boon for the series. There's a clean break to all the consternation and baggage that fueled the original outing: most of the foundation built on Naofumi's persecution  has cleared up. However, not content with just the one demihuman slave, he now gets to be the ruler of a whole village of demihumans. The world is still besieged by regular monster attacks, which is also now subject to hero-assassination attempts from other worlds. So of course, some new issue inevitably gets foisted into the plot for Naofumi and crew.    There's definitely the sense of a plot-necessity swerve in the development of this premiere episode. The driving force of the entire story of the first season, the Waves, quite literally gets put on pause so the Queen can impart the new issue of a 'Spirit Tortoise' that we haven't heard of before but we're assured is every bit as much a major disaster. It certainly means the episode gets going quickly; we hardly have any time for the sort of reestablishing elements with Naofumi in the demihuman village before suddenly they're beset by random bat monsters brought by the ascension of the evil Turtle Pope. But it also means that parts of the story get back to too-perfunctory Business As Usual for Shield Hero. The other Cardinal Heroes, apparently having learned nothing from the climax of the previous adventure, are still acting like callous jerks to Naofumi and friends, and shrugging off needing to actually do anything about the Spirit Tortoise under the auspices that it's not their job.    So even though Naofumi has more predisposition to help with the situation, the storytelling still oddly proceeds with that sense of begrudgement we're just supposed to expect around him in this story. It's almost unintentionally hilarious, the way both the Queen and later Fitoria act like they need to convince Naofumi to take care of the Spirit Tortoise under duress, despite him immediately agreeing to do so. I know that this sort of disagreeable tone is part-and-parcel to the darker, nihilistic angle of appeal Shield Hero is trying to present in its fantasy world, but it just comes off needlessly enforced when its main character character has no reason to act like the world's against him anymore .    That said, the slack of the struggle in Shield-land is instead picked up in this premiere by Rishia, who ends up with what could be considered the emotional core of this episode. Her persecution by her former party with the Bow Hero definitely reflects Naofumi's own story, to where you can almost hear the author going ""See, I can write a woman who gets put upon and mistreated for unfair reasons too! It's equality!"" Of course the major difference is that when Naofumi was at his lowest point, he was forced to buy a slave, while as Rishia finds herself struggling she is convinced to become a slave and aaaaaawwwwww Christ.    Look, I don't need to get into the weeds on this, we had half a year of slavery discourse with the first Shield Hero season. But it must be said that it comes off as downright undermining that the show ever portrayed the slave trade as this dark, seedy element its hero could turn to out of desperation, when at this point it's mostly just an odd mechanic characters can submit themselves to for in-story power-up convenience and lip service to a fetish that isn't even portrayed half as entertainingly as in other series like How NOT to Summon a Demon Lord. That is to say, Rishia agreeing to become Naofumi's slave for a time doesn't prompt aghast reactions of offense, it simply comes off as eyeroll-worthy.    Regardless, Shield Hero's second season has at least started with plenty of momentum to it, even if some of the new story elements come off like ham-fisted hard-turns. But this is a show that worked better the more it expanded its world-building anyway, so maybe figuring out what the deal with this Spirit Tortoise actually is or seeing how Rishia's development along the way plays out will be to its benefit. The fights we get in this episode featuring our heroes slaughtering their way through Countries both Bat and Donkey Kong are decent, concentrated bursts of action (there's a little bit of shaky CGI, but you know I always love seeing Filo fight in her big, puffy, bird form), and you know Kevin Penkin's score is still pulling its weight. It's the beginning of a second season that seems to be justifying its existence, with all the caveats from however you felt about the original's existence in the first place.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review          1 comment       Hello, Melancholic!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Rising of The Shield Hero Season 2   Apr  7th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Rising of The Shield Hero Season 2 ?                     Community score: 3.9              What is this?   No sooner has Naofumi settled into his role as the new ruler of Raphtalia's village, that they're beset by an attack from a horde of bat monsters! The timer for the Waves is mysteriously stalled, and a meeting with the other Cardinal Heroes and the Queen reveals the rising of a new threat: The 'Spirit Tortoise' is bringing potential ruin with it, and with the other Heroes opting out of doing anything about it, things naturally fall to Naofumi to take care of things. With new ally (and new slave) Rishia in tow, the Shield Hero's party heads for the Spirit Tortoise Kingdom in order to save the world once again.    The Rising of The Shield Hero Season 2 is based on Aneko Yusagi's novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Wednesdays.      How was the first episode?  Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               When last we left off, Naofumi and the others were struggling with the revelation that they were involved in a battle between worlds rather than a simple monster invasion.

Becoming the lord of Raphtalia's hometown has tied him irrevocably to the kingdom. While the other heroes still see the fantasy world as a game, to Naofumi it has become his true life filled with things he is driven to protect.    We also spend a lot of time developing Rishia, the newest member of Naofumi's party. She's a young woman in turmoil—in love with a man who has rejected her even though she is dying to be useful to him. But in her, there is potential, though Naofumi and his friends are unsure how to bring it out and what form it will ultimately take. She is an inherently tragic character but through Naofumi's party, it looks like she will be able to become the person she was meant to be. If nothing else, her earnestness makes her easy to root for.    All in all, while this is one of the weaker episodes, it does its job setting up the next arc well enough and gives us some solid character development to boot. Hopefully, things will pick up a bit next episode.      How was the first episode?  Christopher Farris  Rating:               There's the possibility that kicking off a second season of The Rising of the Shield Hero could be a boon for the series. There's a clean break to all the consternation and baggage that fueled the original outing: most of the foundation built on Naofumi's persecution  has cleared up. However, not content with just the one demihuman slave, he now gets to be the ruler of a whole village of demihumans. The world is still besieged by regular monster attacks, which is also now subject to hero-assassination attempts from other worlds. So of course, some new issue inevitably gets foisted into the plot for Naofumi and crew.    There's definitely the sense of a plot-necessity swerve in the development of this premiere episode. The driving force of the entire story of the first season, the Waves, quite literally gets put on pause so the Queen can impart the new issue of a 'Spirit Tortoise' that we haven't heard of before but we're assured is every bit as much a major disaster. It certainly means the episode gets going quickly; we hardly have any time for the sort of reestablishing elements with Naofumi in the demihuman village before suddenly they're beset by random bat monsters brought by the ascension of the evil Turtle Pope. But it also means that parts of the story get back to too-perfunctory Business As Usual for Shield Hero. The other Cardinal Heroes, apparently having learned nothing from the climax of the previous adventure, are still acting like callous jerks to Naofumi and friends, and shrugging off needing to actually do anything about the Spirit Tortoise under the auspices that it's not their job.    So even though Naofumi has more predisposition to help with the situation, the storytelling still oddly proceeds with that sense of begrudgement we're just supposed to expect around him in this story. It's almost unintentionally hilarious, the way both the Queen and later Fitoria act like they need to convince Naofumi to take care of the Spirit Tortoise under duress, despite him immediately agreeing to do so. I know that this sort of disagreeable tone is part-and-parcel to the darker, nihilistic angle of appeal Shield Hero is trying to present in its fantasy world, but it just comes off needlessly enforced when its main character character has no reason to act like the world's against him anymore .    That said, the slack of the struggle in Shield-land is instead picked up in this premiere by Rishia, who ends up with what could be considered the emotional core of this episode. Her persecution by her former party with the Bow Hero definitely reflects Naofumi's own story, to where you can almost hear the author going ""See, I can write a woman who gets put upon and mistreated for unfair reasons too! It's equality!"" Of course the major difference is that when Naofumi was at his lowest point, he was forced to buy a slave, while as Rishia finds herself struggling she is convinced to become a slave and aaaaaawwwwww Christ.    Look, I don't need to get into the weeds on this, we had half a year of slavery discourse with the first Shield Hero season. But it must be said that it comes off as downright undermining that the show ever portrayed the slave trade as this dark, seedy element its hero could turn to out of desperation, when at this point it's mostly just an odd mechanic characters can submit themselves to for in-story power-up convenience and lip service to a fetish that isn't even portrayed half as entertainingly as in other series like How NOT to Summon a Demon Lord. That is to say, Rishia agreeing to become Naofumi's slave for a time doesn't prompt aghast reactions of offense, it simply comes off as eyeroll-worthy.    Regardless, Shield Hero's second season has at least started with plenty of momentum to it, even if some of the new story elements come off like ham-fisted hard-turns. But this is a show that worked better the more it expanded its world-building anyway, so maybe figuring out what the deal with this Spirit Tortoise actually is or seeing how Rishia's development along the way plays out will be to its benefit. The fights we get in this episode featuring our heroes slaughtering their way through Countries both Bat and Donkey Kong are decent, concentrated bursts of action (there's a little bit of shaky CGI, but you know I always love seeing Filo fight in her big, puffy, bird form), and you know Kevin Penkin's score is still pulling its weight. It's the beginning of a second season that seems to be justifying its existence, with all the caveats from however you felt about the original's existence in the first place.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review          1 comment       Hello, Melancholic!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Rising of The Shield Hero Season 2   Apr  7th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Rising of The Shield Hero Season 2 ?                     Community score: 3.9              What is this?   No sooner has Naofumi settled into his role as the new ruler of Raphtalia's village, that they're beset by an attack from a horde of bat monsters! The timer for the Waves is mysteriously stalled, and a meeting with the other Cardinal Heroes and the Queen reveals the rising of a new threat: The 'Spirit Tortoise' is bringing potential ruin with it, and with the other Heroes opting out of doing anything about it, things naturally fall to Naofumi to take care of things. With new ally (and new slave) Rishia in tow, the Shield Hero's party heads for the Spirit Tortoise Kingdom in order to save the world once again.    The Rising of The Shield Hero Season 2 is based on Aneko Yusagi's novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Wednesdays.      How was the first episode?  Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               When last we left off, Naofumi and the others were struggling with the revelation that they were involved in a battle between worlds rather than a simple monster invasion. However, all this is put to the side as a new threat arises, the Spirit Tortoise, whose arrival mysteriously puts a stop to the Waves for the time being.    When it comes down to it, this episode is really only concerned with one thing: exposition. Though we do get two quick action scenes, the thrust of the episode is about establishing the status quo for the arc—i.e., the threat of the turtle—while reminding us of important plot points from the previous season.    Luckily, this is done largely through character building. We see that Naofumi is far from the aggrieved man he was for much of the first season. Becoming the lord of Raphtalia's hometown has tied him irrevocably to the kingdom. While the other heroes still see the fantasy world as a game, to Naofumi it has become his true life filled with things he is driven to protect.    We also spend a lot of time developing Rishia, the newest member of Naofumi's party. She's a young woman in turmoil—in love with a man who has rejected her even though she is dying to be useful to him. But in her, there is potential, though Naofumi and his friends are unsure how to bring it out and what form it will ultimately take. She is an inherently tragic character but through Naofumi's party, it looks like she will be able to become the person she was meant to be. If nothing else, her earnestness makes her easy to root for.    All in all, while this is one of the weaker episodes, it does its job setting up the next arc well enough and gives us some solid character development to boot. Hopefully, things will pick up a bit next episode.      How was the first episode?  Christopher Farris  Rating:               There's the possibility that kicking off a second season of The Rising of the Shield Hero could be a boon for the series. There's a clean break to all the consternation and baggage that fueled the original outing: most of the foundation built on Naofumi's persecution  has cleared up. However, not content with just the one demihuman slave, he now gets to be the ruler of a whole village of demihumans. The world is still besieged by regular monster attacks, which is also now subject to hero-assassination attempts from other worlds. So of course, some new issue inevitably gets foisted into the plot for Naofumi and crew.    There's definitely the sense of a plot-necessity swerve in the development of this premiere episode. The driving force of the entire story of the first season, the Waves, quite literally gets put on pause so the Queen can impart the new issue of a 'Spirit Tortoise' that we haven't heard of before but we're assured is every bit as much a major disaster. It certainly means the episode gets going quickly; we hardly have any time for the sort of reestablishing elements with Naofumi in the demihuman village before suddenly they're beset by random bat monsters brought by the ascension of the evil Turtle Pope. But it also means that parts of the story get back to too-perfunctory Business As Usual for Shield Hero. The other Cardinal Heroes, apparently having learned nothing from the climax of the previous adventure, are still acting like callous jerks to Naofumi and friends, and shrugging off needing to actually do anything about the Spirit Tortoise under the auspices that it's not their job.    So even though Naofumi has more predisposition to help with the situation, the storytelling still oddly proceeds with that sense of begrudgement we're just supposed to expect around him in this story. It's almost unintentionally hilarious, the way both the Queen and later Fitoria act like they need to convince Naofumi to take care of the Spirit Tortoise under duress, despite him immediately agreeing to do so. I know that this sort of disagreeable tone is part-and-parcel to the darker, nihilistic angle of appeal Shield Hero is trying to present in its fantasy world, but it just comes off needlessly enforced when its main character character has no reason to act like the world's against him anymore .    That said, the slack of the struggle in Shield-land is instead picked up in this premiere by Rishia, who ends up with what could be considered the emotional core of this episode. Her persecution by her former party with the Bow Hero definitely reflects Naofumi's own story, to where you can almost hear the author going ""See, I can write a woman who gets put upon and mistreated for unfair reasons too! It's equality!"" Of course the major difference is that when Naofumi was at his lowest point, he was forced to buy a slave, while as Rishia finds herself struggling she is convinced to become a slave and aaaaaawwwwww Christ.    Look, I don't need to get into the weeds on this, we had half a year of slavery discourse with the first Shield Hero season. But it must be said that it comes off as downright undermining that the show ever portrayed the slave trade as this dark, seedy element its hero could turn to out of desperation, when at this point it's mostly just an odd mechanic characters can submit themselves to for in-story power-up convenience and lip service to a fetish that isn't even portrayed half as entertainingly as in other series like How NOT to Summon a Demon Lord. That is to say, Rishia agreeing to become Naofumi's slave for a time doesn't prompt aghast reactions of offense, it simply comes off as eyeroll-worthy.    Regardless, Shield Hero's second season has at least started with plenty of momentum to it, even if some of the new story elements come off like ham-fisted hard-turns. But this is a show that worked better the more it expanded its world-building anyway, so maybe figuring out what the deal with this Spirit Tortoise actually is or seeing how Rishia's development along the way plays out will be to its benefit. The fights we get in this episode featuring our heroes slaughtering their way through Countries both Bat and Donkey Kong are decent, concentrated bursts of action (there's a little bit of shaky CGI, but you know I always love seeing Filo fight in her big, puffy, bird form), and you know Kevin Penkin's score is still pulling its weight. It's the beginning of a second season that seems to be justifying its existence, with all the caveats from however you felt about the original's existence in the first place.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review          1 comment       Hello, Melancholic!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Rising of The Shield Hero Season 2   Apr  7th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Rising of The Shield Hero Season 2 ?                     Community score: 3.9              What is this?   No sooner has Naofumi settled into his role as the new ruler of Raphtalia's village, that they're beset by an attack from a horde of bat monsters! The timer for the Waves is mysteriously stalled, and a meeting with the other Cardinal Heroes and the Queen reveals the rising of a new threat: The 'Spirit Tortoise' is bringing potential ruin with it, and with the other Heroes opting out of doing anything about it, things naturally fall to Naofumi to take care of things. With new ally (and new slave) Rishia in tow, the Shield Hero's party heads for the Spirit Tortoise Kingdom in order to save the world once again.    The Rising of The Shield Hero Season 2 is based on Aneko Yusagi's novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Wednesdays.      How was the first episode?  Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               When last we left off, Naofumi and the others were struggling with the revelation that they were involved in a battle between worlds rather than a simple monster invasion. However, all this is put to the side as a new threat arises, the Spirit Tortoise, whose arrival mysteriously puts a stop to the Waves for the time being.    When it comes down to it, this episode is really only concerned with one thing: exposition. Though we do get two quick action scenes, the thrust of the episode is about establishing the status quo for the arc—i.e., the threat of the turtle—while reminding us of important plot points from the previous season.    Luckily, this is done largely through character building. We see that Naofumi is far from the aggrieved man he was for much of the first season. Becoming the lord of Raphtalia's hometown has tied him irrevocably to the kingdom. While the other heroes still see the fantasy world as a game, to Naofumi it has become his true life filled with things he is driven to protect.    We also spend a lot of time developing Rishia, the newest member of Naofumi's party. She's a young woman in turmoil—in love with a man who has rejected her even though she is dying to be useful to him. But in her, there is potential, though Naofumi and his friends are unsure how to bring it out and what form it will ultimately take. She is an inherently tragic character but through Naofumi's party, it looks like she will be able to become the person she was meant to be. If nothing else, her earnestness makes her easy to root for.    All in all, while this is one of the weaker episodes, it does its job setting up the next arc well enough and gives us some solid character development to boot. Hopefully, things will pick up a bit next episode.      How was the first episode?  Christopher Farris  Rating:               There's the possibility that kicking off a second season of The Rising of the Shield Hero could be a boon for the series. There's a clean break to all the consternation and baggage that fueled the original outing: most of the foundation built on Naofumi's persecution  has cleared up. However, not content with just the one demihuman slave, he now gets to be the ruler of a whole village of demihumans. The world is still besieged by regular monster attacks, which is also now subject to hero-assassination attempts from other worlds. So of course, some new issue inevitably gets foisted into the plot for Naofumi and crew.    There's definitely the sense of a plot-necessity swerve in the development of this premiere episode. The driving force of the entire story of the first season, the Waves, quite literally gets put on pause so the Queen can impart the new issue of a 'Spirit Tortoise' that we haven't heard of before but we're assured is every bit as much a major disaster. It certainly means the episode gets going quickly; we hardly have any time for the sort of reestablishing elements with Naofumi in the demihuman village before suddenly they're beset by random bat monsters brought by the ascension of the evil Turtle Pope. But it also means that parts of the story get back to too-perfunctory Business As Usual for Shield Hero. The other Cardinal Heroes, apparently having learned nothing from the climax of the previous adventure, are still acting like callous jerks to Naofumi and friends, and shrugging off needing to actually do anything about the Spirit Tortoise under the auspices that it's not their job.    So even though Naofumi has more predisposition to help with the situation, the storytelling still oddly proceeds with that sense of begrudgement we're just supposed to expect around him in this story. It's almost unintentionally hilarious, the way both the Queen and later Fitoria act like they need to convince Naofumi to take care of the Spirit Tortoise under duress, despite him immediately agreeing to do so. I know that this sort of disagreeable tone is part-and-parcel to the darker, nihilistic angle of appeal Shield Hero is trying to present in its fantasy world, but it just comes off needlessly enforced when its main character character has no reason to act like the world's against him anymore .    That said, the slack of the struggle in Shield-land is instead picked up in this premiere by Rishia, who ends up with what could be considered the emotional core of this episode. Her persecution by her former party with the Bow Hero definitely reflects Naofumi's own story, to where you can almost hear the author going ""See, I can write a woman who gets put upon and mistreated for unfair reasons too! It's equality!"" Of course the major difference is that when Naofumi was at his lowest point, he was forced to buy a slave, while as Rishia finds herself struggling she is convinced to become a slave and aaaaaawwwwww Christ.    Look, I don't need to get into the weeds on this, we had half a year of slavery discourse with the first Shield Hero season. But it must be said that it comes off as downright undermining that the show ever portrayed the slave trade as this dark, seedy element its hero could turn to out of desperation, when at this point it's mostly just an odd mechanic characters can submit themselves to for in-story power-up convenience and lip service to a fetish that isn't even portrayed half as entertainingly as in other series like How NOT to Summon a Demon Lord. That is to say, Rishia agreeing to become Naofumi's slave for a time doesn't prompt aghast reactions of offense, it simply comes off as eyeroll-worthy.    Regardless, Shield Hero's second season has at least started with plenty of momentum to it, even if some of the new story elements come off like ham-fisted hard-turns. But this is a show that worked better the more it expanded its world-building anyway, so maybe figuring out what the deal with this Spirit Tortoise actually is or seeing how Rishia's development along the way plays out will be to its benefit. The fights we get in this episode featuring our heroes slaughtering their way through Countries both Bat and Donkey Kong are decent, concentrated bursts of action (there's a little bit of shaky CGI, but you know I always love seeing Filo fight in her big, puffy, bird form), and you know Kevin Penkin's score is still pulling its weight.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Tomodachi Game   Apr  6th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Tomodachi Game ?                     Community score: 2.9              What is this?   Yūichi Katagiri, a young man with a perfect student life who has four friends with difficult lives. His peaceful daily life comes to an end when 2 million yen (about US$20,000) in school trip fees goes missing. Riddles unfold as Yūichi gets caught up in a mysterious game for money and must decide whether friendship or money matters more.    Tomodachi Game is based on Yuki Sato's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                Any time a survival game anime pops up during Preview Guide, I get a little anxious. Not because I dislike the genre or anything—Danganronpa is one of my favorite franchises, as it so happens. The problem is that, for every smash hit like Danganronpa, it feels like there are a dozen would-be imitators that keep trying (and failing) to find new and fresh ways to mess with murder/betrayal/escape-room formula. To put it bluntly, a lot of survival game anime kind of suck. Tomodachi Game doesn't exactly suck, and there are even elements of this premiere that I find fairly interesting, but the overall package is just so wrapped up in tired clichés and mediocre presentation that it's hard to muster up enough energy to care one way or the other.    I'll give it this, though: It's nice that Yuichi and all of the other contestants of this weird game were all friends first. There's no amnesia, no cadre of bizarrely coifed and cartoonishly rendered strangers who all have to monologue about their backstories one after the other. The angle that Tomodachi Game is exploring is a tried and true one, but it's effective nonetheless. It asks, “How well do you really know your best friends? And how much pressure would it take, financial or otherwise, before the masks come off and even the closest of companions turn on each other?”    It's just a shame the game being used to exploit this premise is so ludicrously overcomplicated, not to mention heavy-handed as all hell. You know what makes an interesting thriller premise like the one above a lot less interesting? When a cast of vaguely defined characters are forced to participate in an inane game-show that is designed to have every single element of their experience literally scream, over and over, “CAN YOU TRUST YOUR FRIENDS? HUH? I BETCHA CAN'T!!” It kind of ruins the experience.    Don't get me started on the knockoff Monokuma, either. I get that all of these survival game anime feel obligated to include a “wacky"" mascot character, but they really shouldn't try so goddamned hard just because Danganronpa and Assassination Classroom made bank on the concept. And no, I don't even care that Manabu-kun is actually voiced by the actress who played actual Danganronpa protagonist Hajime Hinata. I hate the little creep. He's goofy-looking and obnoxious, and the show does a terrible job of blending the interactions of the CG character model with his 2D counterparts. Every time Manabu was onscreen, I wanted to see someone toss him straight out of a window and into oncoming traffic.    Worst of all, I feel like I'm going to see most of the “shocking"" and “edgy"" twists of this story coming well in advance, so, unless something positively wild and unheard of is yet to come in this story, I'm happy to give Tomodachi Game a pass. There have been other, better riffs on this formula over the years, and I'd rather revisit those than stick it out with a mediocre-seeming also-ran like this one. I'm going to call it right now, though, with absolutely no prior knowledge of the series or anything: It was the meek girl that got all of the friends roped into the game. I bet she's also secretly a psycho yandere. Hit me up in a few weeks if it turns out that I'm right.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               In general, I enjoy anime that focus on high-stakes, psychological games—be they death games or more gambling-focused ones. However, Tomodachi Game didn't excite me at all. When watching an anime set in a well-established genre, there is one question always at the back of my mind: What sets this show apart?  In the case of Tomodachi Game, the answer is ""nothing."" It's totally bland.    The characters, at this point, are surface layer clichés. We have the uptight beauty, the cute girl, the serious one, and the frivolous playboy. Even the main character is little more than ""the poor kid."" The result is Kakegurui without a Yumeko—a show with drama but no one for the audience to care about on a personal level.    Yet, even that drama is lackluster. Not only does the show reveal the masterminds behind the curtain way too easily, but their lackluster commentary in no way replaces the tension that comes from having no idea what is going on behind the scenes. Then there are the constant blink-and-you'll-miss-it text dumps on screen that require you to pause to read. This effectively hamstrings the show's pacing. But even worse, it obliterates the audience's sense of immersion. You can't just sit back and lose yourself in the world Tomodachi Game is trying to create: you've got to be ready to hit pause and read exposition at a moment's notice or miss out on vital information—like the literal rules of the game they are playing!    All that and the episode doesn't even manage to stick the landing. While the game itself is easy enough to understand, the lack of resolution within the first episode is a hindrance. After all, a cliffhanger only works if you care enough about the characters or story to want to come back next week. I don't.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Ah, emotional manipulation. Such a charming premise for any show, so why not make it even more lovely by throwing in a couple of random evil high school girls running a death game for groups of, specifically, five friends? Bonus points if it turns out that the entire thing was set up to point out the shoddy, self-serving nature of friendship, but it's the girls running the game who learn a little something about true friendship along the way instead!    Despite that opening paragraph, my main issue with Tomodachi Game really isn't its premise. Survival games have been a staple of fiction since at LEAST The Most Dangerous Game, and very likely before then if I could be bothered to remember any. Likewise the idea of how trustworthy your so-called friends are is one of the founding principles of certain YA subgenres, so the show is on fairly solid ground with its group of five pals who are tased into a strange white space that turns out to be someone's twisted playground. Starting things off with stolen money for a field trip also works decently well, even if one of the group was the one who's most likely to suffer for the loss and two others are among those most likely to have taken it in the first place. (In reality, I suspect that the girls running the game are responsible.) Where things falter is in the execution of the story, which seems to be a bit of a theme for today's episodes. The main problem is that we barely know these kids and no effort is expended to remedy that situation. In fact, a card with their names and their basic stereotypes is displayed at one point, letting us know precisely which genre trope everyone fits into. (That I then spent the rest of the episode being disturbed that baby-voiced, utterly helpless Kokorogi was labeled “the sexy one” is an entirely different issue.) This makes the matter of who survives and who dies not all that compelling of an issue, because not only do we not like any of them, we don't KNOW any of them. At this point I'm voting for Tenoji to go first because his hair looks like someone took a bite out of it and that annoys me unreasonably.    The survival game genre isn't impossible to do well. It's perhaps not even particularly difficult to do well. But Tomodachi Game seems hellbent on getting in its own way as much as possible with its paltry introductions, explanations that go between “too much” and “not enough,” and some very lackluster visuals. Unless you love the genre and will consume all forms of it, maybe give this a pass.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               I give isekai shows a lot of guff for being simultaneously ubiquitous and dull, but if there's one genre that can eclipse even that otherworldly monolith in pure tedium, it's death games. One of my biggest worries is the massive success of Squid Game bringing this already over-saturated story idea to the big stage. And while this show isn't strictly a death game – all that's currently at stake is money – it's just as much of a slog to get through as every other hackney edgelord parade that tries to come up with a new spin on the prisoner's dilemma.    The biggest reason for that is just how undercooked the “Tomodachi” part of its title is. This is meant to be a dark and gritty look at how five dear and loving friends can be pushed to betray each other for money, but the central friendships of the group are basically nonexistent. We get all of one scene of the five characters talking before they're thrown into this low-rent Kakegurui ripoff, so watching their tenuous friendship fall apart while they play the most obviously rigged game on the planet just isn't dramatic. These are people we've gotten to know mainly through a single screen of text explaining their personalities to us, and none of them have strong enough personalities to overcome that and make this whole ordeal interesting. When they start betraying each other it doesn't mean anything because none of them are real characters, so the entire tension of this game falls flat.    I'm also just so, so tired of every one of these having to bark up the same tree. Every single one of these things thinks they need their own Monokuma, but once you've seen a couple creepy-cute mascot characters who are secretly ~evil~ it loses its impact. As such, all the CG anime mascot character amounts to is a squeaky-voiced exposition machine with zero impact. Add in the random overseer girls who have to comment on everything from their surveillance room, smugly laughing about how their totally devious mind games will ruin another friendship and you have a story that's so insufferably impressed with its cut-rate edginess that finishing the episode is a feat of endurance.    The one and only bright spot of this premiere is in the very final moments, where it seems like our hapless protagonist has come up with some kind of plan to outsmart the Kokkuri-san game that his friends have all purposefully bought into. That, at least, could be a novel twist to this whole setup – our hero having to 4D-Chess his way into making his friends all play fair so they can clear their debts together, forcing a happy ending in the face of obvious psychological manipulation.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Tomodachi Game   Apr  6th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Tomodachi Game ?                     Community score: 2.9              What is this?   Yūichi Katagiri, a young man with a perfect student life who has four friends with difficult lives. His peaceful daily life comes to an end when 2 million yen (about US$20,000) in school trip fees goes missing. Riddles unfold as Yūichi gets caught up in a mysterious game for money and must decide whether friendship or money matters more.    Tomodachi Game is based on Yuki Sato's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                Any time a survival game anime pops up during Preview Guide, I get a little anxious. Not because I dislike the genre or anything—Danganronpa is one of my favorite franchises, as it so happens. The problem is that, for every smash hit like Danganronpa, it feels like there are a dozen would-be imitators that keep trying (and failing) to find new and fresh ways to mess with murder/betrayal/escape-room formula. To put it bluntly, a lot of survival game anime kind of suck. Tomodachi Game doesn't exactly suck, and there are even elements of this premiere that I find fairly interesting, but the overall package is just so wrapped up in tired clichés and mediocre presentation that it's hard to muster up enough energy to care one way or the other.    I'll give it this, though: It's nice that Yuichi and all of the other contestants of this weird game were all friends first. There's no amnesia, no cadre of bizarrely coifed and cartoonishly rendered strangers who all have to monologue about their backstories one after the other. The angle that Tomodachi Game is exploring is a tried and true one, but it's effective nonetheless. It asks, “How well do you really know your best friends? And how much pressure would it take, financial or otherwise, before the masks come off and even the closest of companions turn on each other?”    It's just a shame the game being used to exploit this premise is so ludicrously overcomplicated, not to mention heavy-handed as all hell. You know what makes an interesting thriller premise like the one above a lot less interesting? When a cast of vaguely defined characters are forced to participate in an inane game-show that is designed to have every single element of their experience literally scream, over and over, “CAN YOU TRUST YOUR FRIENDS? HUH? I BETCHA CAN'T!!” It kind of ruins the experience.    Don't get me started on the knockoff Monokuma, either. I get that all of these survival game anime feel obligated to include a “wacky"" mascot character, but they really shouldn't try so goddamned hard just because Danganronpa and Assassination Classroom made bank on the concept. And no, I don't even care that Manabu-kun is actually voiced by the actress who played actual Danganronpa protagonist Hajime Hinata. I hate the little creep. He's goofy-looking and obnoxious, and the show does a terrible job of blending the interactions of the CG character model with his 2D counterparts. Every time Manabu was onscreen, I wanted to see someone toss him straight out of a window and into oncoming traffic.    Worst of all, I feel like I'm going to see most of the “shocking"" and “edgy"" twists of this story coming well in advance, so, unless something positively wild and unheard of is yet to come in this story, I'm happy to give Tomodachi Game a pass. There have been other, better riffs on this formula over the years, and I'd rather revisit those than stick it out with a mediocre-seeming also-ran like this one. I'm going to call it right now, though, with absolutely no prior knowledge of the series or anything: It was the meek girl that got all of the friends roped into the game. I bet she's also secretly a psycho yandere. Hit me up in a few weeks if it turns out that I'm right.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               In general, I enjoy anime that focus on high-stakes, psychological games—be they death games or more gambling-focused ones. However, Tomodachi Game didn't excite me at all. When watching an anime set in a well-established genre, there is one question always at the back of my mind: What sets this show apart?  In the case of Tomodachi Game, the answer is ""nothing."" It's totally bland.    The characters, at this point, are surface layer clichés. We have the uptight beauty, the cute girl, the serious one, and the frivolous playboy. Even the main character is little more than ""the poor kid."" The result is Kakegurui without a Yumeko—a show with drama but no one for the audience to care about on a personal level.    Yet, even that drama is lackluster. Not only does the show reveal the masterminds behind the curtain way too easily, but their lackluster commentary in no way replaces the tension that comes from having no idea what is going on behind the scenes. Then there are the constant blink-and-you'll-miss-it text dumps on screen that require you to pause to read. This effectively hamstrings the show's pacing. But even worse, it obliterates the audience's sense of immersion. You can't just sit back and lose yourself in the world Tomodachi Game is trying to create: you've got to be ready to hit pause and read exposition at a moment's notice or miss out on vital information—like the literal rules of the game they are playing!    All that and the episode doesn't even manage to stick the landing. While the game itself is easy enough to understand, the lack of resolution within the first episode is a hindrance. After all, a cliffhanger only works if you care enough about the characters or story to want to come back next week. I don't.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Ah, emotional manipulation. Such a charming premise for any show, so why not make it even more lovely by throwing in a couple of random evil high school girls running a death game for groups of, specifically, five friends? Bonus points if it turns out that the entire thing was set up to point out the shoddy, self-serving nature of friendship, but it's the girls running the game who learn a little something about true friendship along the way instead!    Despite that opening paragraph, my main issue with Tomodachi Game really isn't its premise. Survival games have been a staple of fiction since at LEAST The Most Dangerous Game, and very likely before then if I could be bothered to remember any. Likewise the idea of how trustworthy your so-called friends are is one of the founding principles of certain YA subgenres, so the show is on fairly solid ground with its group of five pals who are tased into a strange white space that turns out to be someone's twisted playground. Starting things off with stolen money for a field trip also works decently well, even if one of the group was the one who's most likely to suffer for the loss and two others are among those most likely to have taken it in the first place. (In reality, I suspect that the girls running the game are responsible.) Where things falter is in the execution of the story, which seems to be a bit of a theme for today's episodes. The main problem is that we barely know these kids and no effort is expended to remedy that situation. In fact, a card with their names and their basic stereotypes is displayed at one point, letting us know precisely which genre trope everyone fits into. (That I then spent the rest of the episode being disturbed that baby-voiced, utterly helpless Kokorogi was labeled “the sexy one” is an entirely different issue.) This makes the matter of who survives and who dies not all that compelling of an issue, because not only do we not like any of them, we don't KNOW any of them. At this point I'm voting for Tenoji to go first because his hair looks like someone took a bite out of it and that annoys me unreasonably.    The survival game genre isn't impossible to do well. It's perhaps not even particularly difficult to do well. But Tomodachi Game seems hellbent on getting in its own way as much as possible with its paltry introductions, explanations that go between “too much” and “not enough,” and some very lackluster visuals. Unless you love the genre and will consume all forms of it, maybe give this a pass.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               I give isekai shows a lot of guff for being simultaneously ubiquitous and dull, but if there's one genre that can eclipse even that otherworldly monolith in pure tedium, it's death games. One of my biggest worries is the massive success of Squid Game bringing this already over-saturated story idea to the big stage. And while this show isn't strictly a death game – all that's currently at stake is money – it's just as much of a slog to get through as every other hackney edgelord parade that tries to come up with a new spin on the prisoner's dilemma.    The biggest reason for that is just how undercooked the “Tomodachi” part of its title is. This is meant to be a dark and gritty look at how five dear and loving friends can be pushed to betray each other for money, but the central friendships of the group are basically nonexistent. We get all of one scene of the five characters talking before they're thrown into this low-rent Kakegurui ripoff, so watching their tenuous friendship fall apart while they play the most obviously rigged game on the planet just isn't dramatic. These are people we've gotten to know mainly through a single screen of text explaining their personalities to us, and none of them have strong enough personalities to overcome that and make this whole ordeal interesting. When they start betraying each other it doesn't mean anything because none of them are real characters, so the entire tension of this game falls flat.    I'm also just so, so tired of every one of these having to bark up the same tree. Every single one of these things thinks they need their own Monokuma, but once you've seen a couple creepy-cute mascot characters who are secretly ~evil~ it loses its impact. As such, all the CG anime mascot character amounts to is a squeaky-voiced exposition machine with zero impact. Add in the random overseer girls who have to comment on everything from their surveillance room, smugly laughing about how their totally devious mind games will ruin another friendship and you have a story that's so insufferably impressed with its cut-rate edginess that finishing the episode is a feat of endurance.    The one and only bright spot of this premiere is in the very final moments, where it seems like our hapless protagonist has come up with some kind of plan to outsmart the Kokkuri-san game that his friends have all purposefully bought into. That, at least, could be a novel twist to this whole setup – our hero having to 4D-Chess his way into making his friends all play fair so they can clear their debts together, forcing a happy ending in the face of obvious psychological manipulation. I have very little faith that's where the show will actually go, but it would at least be a spin on this scenario that I haven't seen done a million times.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Tomodachi Game   Apr  6th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Tomodachi Game ?                     Community score: 2.9              What is this?   Yūichi Katagiri, a young man with a perfect student life who has four friends with difficult lives. His peaceful daily life comes to an end when 2 million yen (about US$20,000) in school trip fees goes missing. Riddles unfold as Yūichi gets caught up in a mysterious game for money and must decide whether friendship or money matters more.    Tomodachi Game is based on Yuki Sato's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                Any time a survival game anime pops up during Preview Guide, I get a little anxious. Not because I dislike the genre or anything—Danganronpa is one of my favorite franchises, as it so happens. The problem is that, for every smash hit like Danganronpa, it feels like there are a dozen would-be imitators that keep trying (and failing) to find new and fresh ways to mess with murder/betrayal/escape-room formula. To put it bluntly, a lot of survival game anime kind of suck. Tomodachi Game doesn't exactly suck, and there are even elements of this premiere that I find fairly interesting, but the overall package is just so wrapped up in tired clichés and mediocre presentation that it's hard to muster up enough energy to care one way or the other.    I'll give it this, though: It's nice that Yuichi and all of the other contestants of this weird game were all friends first. There's no amnesia, no cadre of bizarrely coifed and cartoonishly rendered strangers who all have to monologue about their backstories one after the other. The angle that Tomodachi Game is exploring is a tried and true one, but it's effective nonetheless. It asks, “How well do you really know your best friends? And how much pressure would it take, financial or otherwise, before the masks come off and even the closest of companions turn on each other?”    It's just a shame the game being used to exploit this premise is so ludicrously overcomplicated, not to mention heavy-handed as all hell. You know what makes an interesting thriller premise like the one above a lot less interesting? When a cast of vaguely defined characters are forced to participate in an inane game-show that is designed to have every single element of their experience literally scream, over and over, “CAN YOU TRUST YOUR FRIENDS? HUH? I BETCHA CAN'T!!” It kind of ruins the experience.    Don't get me started on the knockoff Monokuma, either. I get that all of these survival game anime feel obligated to include a “wacky"" mascot character, but they really shouldn't try so goddamned hard just because Danganronpa and Assassination Classroom made bank on the concept. And no, I don't even care that Manabu-kun is actually voiced by the actress who played actual Danganronpa protagonist Hajime Hinata. I hate the little creep. He's goofy-looking and obnoxious, and the show does a terrible job of blending the interactions of the CG character model with his 2D counterparts. Every time Manabu was onscreen, I wanted to see someone toss him straight out of a window and into oncoming traffic.    Worst of all, I feel like I'm going to see most of the “shocking"" and “edgy"" twists of this story coming well in advance, so, unless something positively wild and unheard of is yet to come in this story, I'm happy to give Tomodachi Game a pass. There have been other, better riffs on this formula over the years, and I'd rather revisit those than stick it out with a mediocre-seeming also-ran like this one. I'm going to call it right now, though, with absolutely no prior knowledge of the series or anything: It was the meek girl that got all of the friends roped into the game. I bet she's also secretly a psycho yandere. Hit me up in a few weeks if it turns out that I'm right.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               In general, I enjoy anime that focus on high-stakes, psychological games—be they death games or more gambling-focused ones. However, Tomodachi Game didn't excite me at all. When watching an anime set in a well-established genre, there is one question always at the back of my mind: What sets this show apart?  In the case of Tomodachi Game, the answer is ""nothing."" It's totally bland.    The characters, at this point, are surface layer clichés. We have the uptight beauty, the cute girl, the serious one, and the frivolous playboy. Even the main character is little more than ""the poor kid."" The result is Kakegurui without a Yumeko—a show with drama but no one for the audience to care about on a personal level.    Yet, even that drama is lackluster. Not only does the show reveal the masterminds behind the curtain way too easily, but their lackluster commentary in no way replaces the tension that comes from having no idea what is going on behind the scenes. Then there are the constant blink-and-you'll-miss-it text dumps on screen that require you to pause to read. This effectively hamstrings the show's pacing. But even worse, it obliterates the audience's sense of immersion. You can't just sit back and lose yourself in the world Tomodachi Game is trying to create: you've got to be ready to hit pause and read exposition at a moment's notice or miss out on vital information—like the literal rules of the game they are playing!    All that and the episode doesn't even manage to stick the landing. While the game itself is easy enough to understand, the lack of resolution within the first episode is a hindrance. After all, a cliffhanger only works if you care enough about the characters or story to want to come back next week. I don't.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Ah, emotional manipulation. Such a charming premise for any show, so why not make it even more lovely by throwing in a couple of random evil high school girls running a death game for groups of, specifically, five friends? Bonus points if it turns out that the entire thing was set up to point out the shoddy, self-serving nature of friendship, but it's the girls running the game who learn a little something about true friendship along the way instead!    Despite that opening paragraph, my main issue with Tomodachi Game really isn't its premise. Survival games have been a staple of fiction since at LEAST The Most Dangerous Game, and very likely before then if I could be bothered to remember any. Likewise the idea of how trustworthy your so-called friends are is one of the founding principles of certain YA subgenres, so the show is on fairly solid ground with its group of five pals who are tased into a strange white space that turns out to be someone's twisted playground. Starting things off with stolen money for a field trip also works decently well, even if one of the group was the one who's most likely to suffer for the loss and two others are among those most likely to have taken it in the first place. (In reality, I suspect that the girls running the game are responsible.) Where things falter is in the execution of the story, which seems to be a bit of a theme for today's episodes. The main problem is that we barely know these kids and no effort is expended to remedy that situation. In fact, a card with their names and their basic stereotypes is displayed at one point, letting us know precisely which genre trope everyone fits into. (That I then spent the rest of the episode being disturbed that baby-voiced, utterly helpless Kokorogi was labeled “the sexy one” is an entirely different issue.) This makes the matter of who survives and who dies not all that compelling of an issue, because not only do we not like any of them, we don't KNOW any of them. At this point I'm voting for Tenoji to go first because his hair looks like someone took a bite out of it and that annoys me unreasonably.    The survival game genre isn't impossible to do well. It's perhaps not even particularly difficult to do well. But Tomodachi Game seems hellbent on getting in its own way as much as possible with its paltry introductions, explanations that go between “too much” and “not enough,” and some very lackluster visuals. Unless you love the genre and will consume all forms of it, maybe give this a pass.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               I give isekai shows a lot of guff for being simultaneously ubiquitous and dull, but if there's one genre that can eclipse even that otherworldly monolith in pure tedium, it's death games. One of my biggest worries is the massive success of Squid Game bringing this already over-saturated story idea to the big stage. And while this show isn't strictly a death game – all that's currently at stake is money – it's just as much of a slog to get through as every other hackney edgelord parade that tries to come up with a new spin on the prisoner's dilemma.    The biggest reason for that is just how undercooked the “Tomodachi” part of its title is. This is meant to be a dark and gritty look at how five dear and loving friends can be pushed to betray each other for money, but the central friendships of the group are basically nonexistent. We get all of one scene of the five characters talking before they're thrown into this low-rent Kakegurui ripoff, so watching their tenuous friendship fall apart while they play the most obviously rigged game on the planet just isn't dramatic. These are people we've gotten to know mainly through a single screen of text explaining their personalities to us, and none of them have strong enough personalities to overcome that and make this whole ordeal interesting. When they start betraying each other it doesn't mean anything because none of them are real characters, so the entire tension of this game falls flat.    I'm also just so, so tired of every one of these having to bark up the same tree. Every single one of these things thinks they need their own Monokuma, but once you've seen a couple creepy-cute mascot characters who are secretly ~evil~ it loses its impact. As such, all the CG anime mascot character amounts to is a squeaky-voiced exposition machine with zero impact. Add in the random overseer girls who have to comment on everything from their surveillance room, smugly laughing about how their totally devious mind games will ruin another friendship and you have a story that's so insufferably impressed with its cut-rate edginess that finishing the episode is a feat of endurance.    The one and only bright spot of this premiere is in the very final moments, where it seems like our hapless protagonist has come up with some kind of plan to outsmart the Kokkuri-san game that his friends have all purposefully bought into.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Tomodachi Game   Apr  6th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Tomodachi Game ?                     Community score: 2.9              What is this?   Yūichi Katagiri, a young man with a perfect student life who has four friends with difficult lives. His peaceful daily life comes to an end when 2 million yen (about US$20,000) in school trip fees goes missing. Riddles unfold as Yūichi gets caught up in a mysterious game for money and must decide whether friendship or money matters more.    Tomodachi Game is based on Yuki Sato's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                Any time a survival game anime pops up during Preview Guide, I get a little anxious. Not because I dislike the genre or anything—Danganronpa is one of my favorite franchises, as it so happens. The problem is that, for every smash hit like Danganronpa, it feels like there are a dozen would-be imitators that keep trying (and failing) to find new and fresh ways to mess with murder/betrayal/escape-room formula. To put it bluntly, a lot of survival game anime kind of suck. Tomodachi Game doesn't exactly suck, and there are even elements of this premiere that I find fairly interesting, but the overall package is just so wrapped up in tired clichés and mediocre presentation that it's hard to muster up enough energy to care one way or the other.    I'll give it this, though: It's nice that Yuichi and all of the other contestants of this weird game were all friends first. There's no amnesia, no cadre of bizarrely coifed and cartoonishly rendered strangers who all have to monologue about their backstories one after the other. The angle that Tomodachi Game is exploring is a tried and true one, but it's effective nonetheless. It asks, “How well do you really know your best friends? And how much pressure would it take, financial or otherwise, before the masks come off and even the closest of companions turn on each other?”    It's just a shame the game being used to exploit this premise is so ludicrously overcomplicated, not to mention heavy-handed as all hell. You know what makes an interesting thriller premise like the one above a lot less interesting? When a cast of vaguely defined characters are forced to participate in an inane game-show that is designed to have every single element of their experience literally scream, over and over, “CAN YOU TRUST YOUR FRIENDS? HUH? I BETCHA CAN'T!!” It kind of ruins the experience.    Don't get me started on the knockoff Monokuma, either. I get that all of these survival game anime feel obligated to include a “wacky"" mascot character, but they really shouldn't try so goddamned hard just because Danganronpa and Assassination Classroom made bank on the concept. And no, I don't even care that Manabu-kun is actually voiced by the actress who played actual Danganronpa protagonist Hajime Hinata. I hate the little creep. He's goofy-looking and obnoxious, and the show does a terrible job of blending the interactions of the CG character model with his 2D counterparts. Every time Manabu was onscreen, I wanted to see someone toss him straight out of a window and into oncoming traffic.    Worst of all, I feel like I'm going to see most of the “shocking"" and “edgy"" twists of this story coming well in advance, so, unless something positively wild and unheard of is yet to come in this story, I'm happy to give Tomodachi Game a pass. There have been other, better riffs on this formula over the years, and I'd rather revisit those than stick it out with a mediocre-seeming also-ran like this one. I'm going to call it right now, though, with absolutely no prior knowledge of the series or anything: It was the meek girl that got all of the friends roped into the game. I bet she's also secretly a psycho yandere. Hit me up in a few weeks if it turns out that I'm right.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               In general, I enjoy anime that focus on high-stakes, psychological games—be they death games or more gambling-focused ones. However, Tomodachi Game didn't excite me at all. When watching an anime set in a well-established genre, there is one question always at the back of my mind: What sets this show apart?  In the case of Tomodachi Game, the answer is ""nothing."" It's totally bland.    The characters, at this point, are surface layer clichés. We have the uptight beauty, the cute girl, the serious one, and the frivolous playboy. Even the main character is little more than ""the poor kid."" The result is Kakegurui without a Yumeko—a show with drama but no one for the audience to care about on a personal level.    Yet, even that drama is lackluster. Not only does the show reveal the masterminds behind the curtain way too easily, but their lackluster commentary in no way replaces the tension that comes from having no idea what is going on behind the scenes. Then there are the constant blink-and-you'll-miss-it text dumps on screen that require you to pause to read. This effectively hamstrings the show's pacing. But even worse, it obliterates the audience's sense of immersion. You can't just sit back and lose yourself in the world Tomodachi Game is trying to create: you've got to be ready to hit pause and read exposition at a moment's notice or miss out on vital information—like the literal rules of the game they are playing!    All that and the episode doesn't even manage to stick the landing. While the game itself is easy enough to understand, the lack of resolution within the first episode is a hindrance. After all, a cliffhanger only works if you care enough about the characters or story to want to come back next week. I don't.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Ah, emotional manipulation. Such a charming premise for any show, so why not make it even more lovely by throwing in a couple of random evil high school girls running a death game for groups of, specifically, five friends? Bonus points if it turns out that the entire thing was set up to point out the shoddy, self-serving nature of friendship, but it's the girls running the game who learn a little something about true friendship along the way instead!    Despite that opening paragraph, my main issue with Tomodachi Game really isn't its premise. Survival games have been a staple of fiction since at LEAST The Most Dangerous Game, and very likely before then if I could be bothered to remember any. Likewise the idea of how trustworthy your so-called friends are is one of the founding principles of certain YA subgenres, so the show is on fairly solid ground with its group of five pals who are tased into a strange white space that turns out to be someone's twisted playground. Starting things off with stolen money for a field trip also works decently well, even if one of the group was the one who's most likely to suffer for the loss and two others are among those most likely to have taken it in the first place. (In reality, I suspect that the girls running the game are responsible.) Where things falter is in the execution of the story, which seems to be a bit of a theme for today's episodes. The main problem is that we barely know these kids and no effort is expended to remedy that situation. In fact, a card with their names and their basic stereotypes is displayed at one point, letting us know precisely which genre trope everyone fits into. (That I then spent the rest of the episode being disturbed that baby-voiced, utterly helpless Kokorogi was labeled “the sexy one” is an entirely different issue.) This makes the matter of who survives and who dies not all that compelling of an issue, because not only do we not like any of them, we don't KNOW any of them. At this point I'm voting for Tenoji to go first because his hair looks like someone took a bite out of it and that annoys me unreasonably.    The survival game genre isn't impossible to do well. It's perhaps not even particularly difficult to do well. But Tomodachi Game seems hellbent on getting in its own way as much as possible with its paltry introductions, explanations that go between “too much” and “not enough,” and some very lackluster visuals. Unless you love the genre and will consume all forms of it, maybe give this a pass.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               I give isekai shows a lot of guff for being simultaneously ubiquitous and dull, but if there's one genre that can eclipse even that otherworldly monolith in pure tedium, it's death games. One of my biggest worries is the massive success of Squid Game bringing this already over-saturated story idea to the big stage. And while this show isn't strictly a death game – all that's currently at stake is money – it's just as much of a slog to get through as every other hackney edgelord parade that tries to come up with a new spin on the prisoner's dilemma.    The biggest reason for that is just how undercooked the “Tomodachi” part of its title is. This is meant to be a dark and gritty look at how five dear and loving friends can be pushed to betray each other for money, but the central friendships of the group are basically nonexistent. We get all of one scene of the five characters talking before they're thrown into this low-rent Kakegurui ripoff, so watching their tenuous friendship fall apart while they play the most obviously rigged game on the planet just isn't dramatic. These are people we've gotten to know mainly through a single screen of text explaining their personalities to us, and none of them have strong enough personalities to overcome that and make this whole ordeal interesting. When they start betraying each other it doesn't mean anything because none of them are real characters, so the entire tension of this game falls flat.    I'm also just so, so tired of every one of these having to bark up the same tree. Every single one of these things thinks they need their own Monokuma, but once you've seen a couple creepy-cute mascot characters who are secretly ~evil~ it loses its impact. As such, all the CG anime mascot character amounts to is a squeaky-voiced exposition machine with zero impact. Add in the random overseer girls who have to comment on everything from their surveillance room, smugly laughing about how their totally devious mind games will ruin another friendship and you have a story that's so insufferably impressed with its cut-rate edginess that finishing the episode is a feat of endurance.    The one and only bright spot of this premiere is in the very final moments, where it seems like our hapless protagonist has come up with some kind of plan to outsmart the Kokkuri-san game that his friends have all purposefully bought into. That, at least, could be a novel twist to this whole setup – our hero having to 4D-Chess his way into making his friends all play fair so they can clear their debts together, forcing a happy ending in the face of obvious psychological manipulation. I have very little faith that's where the show will actually go, but it would at least be a spin on this scenario that I haven't seen done a million times.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Tomodachi Game   Apr  6th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Tomodachi Game ?                     Community score: 2.9              What is this?   Yūichi Katagiri, a young man with a perfect student life who has four friends with difficult lives. His peaceful daily life comes to an end when 2 million yen (about US$20,000) in school trip fees goes missing. Riddles unfold as Yūichi gets caught up in a mysterious game for money and must decide whether friendship or money matters more.    Tomodachi Game is based on Yuki Sato's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                Any time a survival game anime pops up during Preview Guide, I get a little anxious. Not because I dislike the genre or anything—Danganronpa is one of my favorite franchises, as it so happens. The problem is that, for every smash hit like Danganronpa, it feels like there are a dozen would-be imitators that keep trying (and failing) to find new and fresh ways to mess with murder/betrayal/escape-room formula. To put it bluntly, a lot of survival game anime kind of suck. Tomodachi Game doesn't exactly suck, and there are even elements of this premiere that I find fairly interesting, but the overall package is just so wrapped up in tired clichés and mediocre presentation that it's hard to muster up enough energy to care one way or the other.    I'll give it this, though: It's nice that Yuichi and all of the other contestants of this weird game were all friends first. There's no amnesia, no cadre of bizarrely coifed and cartoonishly rendered strangers who all have to monologue about their backstories one after the other. The angle that Tomodachi Game is exploring is a tried and true one, but it's effective nonetheless. It asks, “How well do you really know your best friends? And how much pressure would it take, financial or otherwise, before the masks come off and even the closest of companions turn on each other?”    It's just a shame the game being used to exploit this premise is so ludicrously overcomplicated, not to mention heavy-handed as all hell. You know what makes an interesting thriller premise like the one above a lot less interesting? When a cast of vaguely defined characters are forced to participate in an inane game-show that is designed to have every single element of their experience literally scream, over and over, “CAN YOU TRUST YOUR FRIENDS? HUH? I BETCHA CAN'T!!” It kind of ruins the experience.    Don't get me started on the knockoff Monokuma, either. I get that all of these survival game anime feel obligated to include a “wacky"" mascot character, but they really shouldn't try so goddamned hard just because Danganronpa and Assassination Classroom made bank on the concept. And no, I don't even care that Manabu-kun is actually voiced by the actress who played actual Danganronpa protagonist Hajime Hinata. I hate the little creep. He's goofy-looking and obnoxious, and the show does a terrible job of blending the interactions of the CG character model with his 2D counterparts. Every time Manabu was onscreen, I wanted to see someone toss him straight out of a window and into oncoming traffic.    Worst of all, I feel like I'm going to see most of the “shocking"" and “edgy"" twists of this story coming well in advance, so, unless something positively wild and unheard of is yet to come in this story, I'm happy to give Tomodachi Game a pass. There have been other, better riffs on this formula over the years, and I'd rather revisit those than stick it out with a mediocre-seeming also-ran like this one. I'm going to call it right now, though, with absolutely no prior knowledge of the series or anything: It was the meek girl that got all of the friends roped into the game. I bet she's also secretly a psycho yandere. Hit me up in a few weeks if it turns out that I'm right.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               In general, I enjoy anime that focus on high-stakes, psychological games—be they death games or more gambling-focused ones. However, Tomodachi Game didn't excite me at all. When watching an anime set in a well-established genre, there is one question always at the back of my mind: What sets this show apart?  In the case of Tomodachi Game, the answer is ""nothing."" It's totally bland.    The characters, at this point, are surface layer clichés. We have the uptight beauty, the cute girl, the serious one, and the frivolous playboy. Even the main character is little more than ""the poor kid."" The result is Kakegurui without a Yumeko—a show with drama but no one for the audience to care about on a personal level.    Yet, even that drama is lackluster. Not only does the show reveal the masterminds behind the curtain way too easily, but their lackluster commentary in no way replaces the tension that comes from having no idea what is going on behind the scenes. Then there are the constant blink-and-you'll-miss-it text dumps on screen that require you to pause to read. This effectively hamstrings the show's pacing. But even worse, it obliterates the audience's sense of immersion. You can't just sit back and lose yourself in the world Tomodachi Game is trying to create: you've got to be ready to hit pause and read exposition at a moment's notice or miss out on vital information—like the literal rules of the game they are playing!    All that and the episode doesn't even manage to stick the landing. While the game itself is easy enough to understand, the lack of resolution within the first episode is a hindrance. After all, a cliffhanger only works if you care enough about the characters or story to want to come back next week. I don't.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Ah, emotional manipulation. Such a charming premise for any show, so why not make it even more lovely by throwing in a couple of random evil high school girls running a death game for groups of, specifically, five friends? Bonus points if it turns out that the entire thing was set up to point out the shoddy, self-serving nature of friendship, but it's the girls running the game who learn a little something about true friendship along the way instead!    Despite that opening paragraph, my main issue with Tomodachi Game really isn't its premise. Survival games have been a staple of fiction since at LEAST The Most Dangerous Game, and very likely before then if I could be bothered to remember any. Likewise the idea of how trustworthy your so-called friends are is one of the founding principles of certain YA subgenres, so the show is on fairly solid ground with its group of five pals who are tased into a strange white space that turns out to be someone's twisted playground. Starting things off with stolen money for a field trip also works decently well, even if one of the group was the one who's most likely to suffer for the loss and two others are among those most likely to have taken it in the first place. (In reality, I suspect that the girls running the game are responsible.) Where things falter is in the execution of the story, which seems to be a bit of a theme for today's episodes. The main problem is that we barely know these kids and no effort is expended to remedy that situation. In fact, a card with their names and their basic stereotypes is displayed at one point, letting us know precisely which genre trope everyone fits into. (That I then spent the rest of the episode being disturbed that baby-voiced, utterly helpless Kokorogi was labeled “the sexy one” is an entirely different issue.) This makes the matter of who survives and who dies not all that compelling of an issue, because not only do we not like any of them, we don't KNOW any of them. At this point I'm voting for Tenoji to go first because his hair looks like someone took a bite out of it and that annoys me unreasonably.    The survival game genre isn't impossible to do well. It's perhaps not even particularly difficult to do well. But Tomodachi Game seems hellbent on getting in its own way as much as possible with its paltry introductions, explanations that go between “too much” and “not enough,” and some very lackluster visuals. Unless you love the genre and will consume all forms of it, maybe give this a pass.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               I give isekai shows a lot of guff for being simultaneously ubiquitous and dull, but if there's one genre that can eclipse even that otherworldly monolith in pure tedium, it's death games. One of my biggest worries is the massive success of Squid Game bringing this already over-saturated story idea to the big stage. And while this show isn't strictly a death game – all that's currently at stake is money – it's just as much of a slog to get through as every other hackney edgelord parade that tries to come up with a new spin on the prisoner's dilemma.    The biggest reason for that is just how undercooked the “Tomodachi” part of its title is. This is meant to be a dark and gritty look at how five dear and loving friends can be pushed to betray each other for money, but the central friendships of the group are basically nonexistent. We get all of one scene of the five characters talking before they're thrown into this low-rent Kakegurui ripoff, so watching their tenuous friendship fall apart while they play the most obviously rigged game on the planet just isn't dramatic. These are people we've gotten to know mainly through a single screen of text explaining their personalities to us, and none of them have strong enough personalities to overcome that and make this whole ordeal interesting. When they start betraying each other it doesn't mean anything because none of them are real characters, so the entire tension of this game falls flat.    I'm also just so, so tired of every one of these having to bark up the same tree. Every single one of these things thinks they need their own Monokuma, but once you've seen a couple creepy-cute mascot characters who are secretly ~evil~ it loses its impact. As such, all the CG anime mascot character amounts to is a squeaky-voiced exposition machine with zero impact. Add in the random overseer girls who have to comment on everything from their surveillance room, smugly laughing about how their totally devious mind games will ruin another friendship and you have a story that's so insufferably impressed with its cut-rate edginess that finishing the episode is a feat of endurance.    The one and only bright spot of this premiere is in the very final moments, where it seems like our hapless protagonist has come up with some kind of plan to outsmart the Kokkuri-san game that his friends have all purposefully bought into. That, at least, could be a novel twist to this whole setup – our hero having to 4D-Chess his way into making his friends all play fair so they can clear their debts together, forcing a happy ending in the face of obvious psychological manipulation. I have very little faith that's where the show will actually go, but it would at least be a spin on this scenario that I haven't seen done a million times. It's still not enough to make watch more of this charmless bore, but it's something, I guess.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Such a charming premise for any show, so why not make it even more lovely by throwing in a couple of random evil high school girls running a death game for groups of, specifically, five friends? Bonus points if it turns out that the entire thing was set up to point out the shoddy, self-serving nature of friendship, but it's the girls running the game who learn a little something about true friendship along the way instead!    Despite that opening paragraph, my main issue with Tomodachi Game really isn't its premise. Survival games have been a staple of fiction since at LEAST The Most Dangerous Game, and very likely before then if I could be bothered to remember any. Likewise the idea of how trustworthy your so-called friends are is one of the founding principles of certain YA subgenres, so the show is on fairly solid ground with its group of five pals who are tased into a strange white space that turns out to be someone's twisted playground. Starting things off with stolen money for a field trip also works decently well, even if one of the group was the one who's most likely to suffer for the loss and two others are among those most likely to have taken it in the first place. (In reality, I suspect that the girls running the game are responsible.) Where things falter is in the execution of the story, which seems to be a bit of a theme for today's episodes. The main problem is that we barely know these kids and no effort is expended to remedy that situation. In fact, a card with their names and their basic stereotypes is displayed at one point, letting us know precisely which genre trope everyone fits into. (That I then spent the rest of the episode being disturbed that baby-voiced, utterly helpless Kokorogi was labeled “the sexy one” is an entirely different issue.) This makes the matter of who survives and who dies not all that compelling of an issue, because not only do we not like any of them, we don't KNOW any of them. At this point I'm voting for Tenoji to go first because his hair looks like someone took a bite out of it and that annoys me unreasonably.    The survival game genre isn't impossible to do well. It's perhaps not even particularly difficult to do well. But Tomodachi Game seems hellbent on getting in its own way as much as possible with its paltry introductions, explanations that go between “too much” and “not enough,” and some very lackluster visuals. Unless you love the genre and will consume all forms of it, maybe give this a pass.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               I give isekai shows a lot of guff for being simultaneously ubiquitous and dull, but if there's one genre that can eclipse even that otherworldly monolith in pure tedium, it's death games. One of my biggest worries is the massive success of Squid Game bringing this already over-saturated story idea to the big stage. And while this show isn't strictly a death game – all that's currently at stake is money – it's just as much of a slog to get through as every other hackney edgelord parade that tries to come up with a new spin on the prisoner's dilemma.    The biggest reason for that is just how undercooked the “Tomodachi” part of its title is. This is meant to be a dark and gritty look at how five dear and loving friends can be pushed to betray each other for money, but the central friendships of the group are basically nonexistent. We get all of one scene of the five characters talking before they're thrown into this low-rent Kakegurui ripoff, so watching their tenuous friendship fall apart while they play the most obviously rigged game on the planet just isn't dramatic. These are people we've gotten to know mainly through a single screen of text explaining their personalities to us, and none of them have strong enough personalities to overcome that and make this whole ordeal interesting. When they start betraying each other it doesn't mean anything because none of them are real characters, so the entire tension of this game falls flat.    I'm also just so, so tired of every one of these having to bark up the same tree. Every single one of these things thinks they need their own Monokuma, but once you've seen a couple creepy-cute mascot characters who are secretly ~evil~ it loses its impact. As such, all the CG anime mascot character amounts to is a squeaky-voiced exposition machine with zero impact. Add in the random overseer girls who have to comment on everything from their surveillance room, smugly laughing about how their totally devious mind games will ruin another friendship and you have a story that's so insufferably impressed with its cut-rate edginess that finishing the episode is a feat of endurance.    The one and only bright spot of this premiere is in the very final moments, where it seems like our hapless protagonist has come up with some kind of plan to outsmart the Kokkuri-san game that his friends have all purposefully bought into. That, at least, could be a novel twist to this whole setup – our hero having to 4D-Chess his way into making his friends all play fair so they can clear their debts together, forcing a happy ending in the face of obvious psychological manipulation. I have very little faith that's where the show will actually go, but it would at least be a spin on this scenario that I haven't seen done a million times. It's still not enough to make watch more of this charmless bore, but it's something, I guess.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives      ",negative,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 2.9              What is this?   Yūichi Katagiri, a young man with a perfect student life who has four friends with difficult lives. His peaceful daily life comes to an end when 2 million yen (about US$20,000) in school trip fees goes missing. Riddles unfold as Yūichi gets caught up in a mysterious game for money and must decide whether friendship or money matters more.    Tomodachi Game is based on Yuki Sato's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                Any time a survival game anime pops up during Preview Guide, I get a little anxious. Not because I dislike the genre or anything—Danganronpa is one of my favorite franchises, as it so happens. The problem is that, for every smash hit like Danganronpa, it feels like there are a dozen would-be imitators that keep trying (and failing) to find new and fresh ways to mess with murder/betrayal/escape-room formula. To put it bluntly, a lot of survival game anime kind of suck. Tomodachi Game doesn't exactly suck, and there are even elements of this premiere that I find fairly interesting, but the overall package is just so wrapped up in tired clichés and mediocre presentation that it's hard to muster up enough energy to care one way or the other.    I'll give it this, though: It's nice that Yuichi and all of the other contestants of this weird game were all friends first. There's no amnesia, no cadre of bizarrely coifed and cartoonishly rendered strangers who all have to monologue about their backstories one after the other. The angle that Tomodachi Game is exploring is a tried and true one, but it's effective nonetheless. It asks, “How well do you really know your best friends? And how much pressure would it take, financial or otherwise, before the masks come off and even the closest of companions turn on each other?”    It's just a shame the game being used to exploit this premise is so ludicrously overcomplicated, not to mention heavy-handed as all hell. You know what makes an interesting thriller premise like the one above a lot less interesting? When a cast of vaguely defined characters are forced to participate in an inane game-show that is designed to have every single element of their experience literally scream, over and over, “CAN YOU TRUST YOUR FRIENDS? HUH? I BETCHA CAN'T!!” It kind of ruins the experience.    Don't get me started on the knockoff Monokuma, either. I get that all of these survival game anime feel obligated to include a “wacky"" mascot character, but they really shouldn't try so goddamned hard just because Danganronpa and Assassination Classroom made bank on the concept. And no, I don't even care that Manabu-kun is actually voiced by the actress who played actual Danganronpa protagonist Hajime Hinata. I hate the little creep. He's goofy-looking and obnoxious, and the show does a terrible job of blending the interactions of the CG character model with his 2D counterparts. Every time Manabu was onscreen, I wanted to see someone toss him straight out of a window and into oncoming traffic.    Worst of all, I feel like I'm going to see most of the “shocking"" and “edgy"" twists of this story coming well in advance, so, unless something positively wild and unheard of is yet to come in this story, I'm happy to give Tomodachi Game a pass. There have been other, better riffs on this formula over the years, and I'd rather revisit those than stick it out with a mediocre-seeming also-ran like this one. I'm going to call it right now, though, with absolutely no prior knowledge of the series or anything: It was the meek girl that got all of the friends roped into the game. I bet she's also secretly a psycho yandere. Hit me up in a few weeks if it turns out that I'm right.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               In general, I enjoy anime that focus on high-stakes, psychological games—be they death games or more gambling-focused ones. However, Tomodachi Game didn't excite me at all. When watching an anime set in a well-established genre, there is one question always at the back of my mind: What sets this show apart?  In the case of Tomodachi Game, the answer is ""nothing."" It's totally bland.    The characters, at this point, are surface layer clichés. We have the uptight beauty, the cute girl, the serious one, and the frivolous playboy. Even the main character is little more than ""the poor kid."" The result is Kakegurui without a Yumeko—a show with drama but no one for the audience to care about on a personal level.    Yet, even that drama is lackluster. Not only does the show reveal the masterminds behind the curtain way too easily, but their lackluster commentary in no way replaces the tension that comes from having no idea what is going on behind the scenes. Then there are the constant blink-and-you'll-miss-it text dumps on screen that require you to pause to read. This effectively hamstrings the show's pacing. But even worse, it obliterates the audience's sense of immersion. You can't just sit back and lose yourself in the world Tomodachi Game is trying to create: you've got to be ready to hit pause and read exposition at a moment's notice or miss out on vital information—like the literal rules of the game they are playing!    All that and the episode doesn't even manage to stick the landing. While the game itself is easy enough to understand, the lack of resolution within the first episode is a hindrance. After all, a cliffhanger only works if you care enough about the characters or story to want to come back next week. I don't.

You know what makes an interesting thriller premise like the one above a lot less interesting? When a cast of vaguely defined characters are forced to participate in an inane game-show that is designed to have every single element of their experience literally scream, over and over, “CAN YOU TRUST YOUR FRIENDS? HUH? I BETCHA CAN'T!!” It kind of ruins the experience.    Don't get me started on the knockoff Monokuma, either. I get that all of these survival game anime feel obligated to include a “wacky"" mascot character, but they really shouldn't try so goddamned hard just because Danganronpa and Assassination Classroom made bank on the concept. And no, I don't even care that Manabu-kun is actually voiced by the actress who played actual Danganronpa protagonist Hajime Hinata. I hate the little creep. He's goofy-looking and obnoxious, and the show does a terrible job of blending the interactions of the CG character model with his 2D counterparts. Every time Manabu was onscreen, I wanted to see someone toss him straight out of a window and into oncoming traffic.    Worst of all, I feel like I'm going to see most of the “shocking"" and “edgy"" twists of this story coming well in advance, so, unless something positively wild and unheard of is yet to come in this story, I'm happy to give Tomodachi Game a pass. There have been other, better riffs on this formula over the years, and I'd rather revisit those than stick it out with a mediocre-seeming also-ran like this one. I'm going to call it right now, though, with absolutely no prior knowledge of the series or anything: It was the meek girl that got all of the friends roped into the game. I bet she's also secretly a psycho yandere. Hit me up in a few weeks if it turns out that I'm right.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               In general, I enjoy anime that focus on high-stakes, psychological games—be they death games or more gambling-focused ones. However, Tomodachi Game didn't excite me at all. When watching an anime set in a well-established genre, there is one question always at the back of my mind: What sets this show apart?  In the case of Tomodachi Game, the answer is ""nothing."" It's totally bland.    The characters, at this point, are surface layer clichés. We have the uptight beauty, the cute girl, the serious one, and the frivolous playboy. Even the main character is little more than ""the poor kid."" The result is Kakegurui without a Yumeko—a show with drama but no one for the audience to care about on a personal level.    Yet, even that drama is lackluster. Not only does the show reveal the masterminds behind the curtain way too easily, but their lackluster commentary in no way replaces the tension that comes from having no idea what is going on behind the scenes. Then there are the constant blink-and-you'll-miss-it text dumps on screen that require you to pause to read. This effectively hamstrings the show's pacing. But even worse, it obliterates the audience's sense of immersion. You can't just sit back and lose yourself in the world Tomodachi Game is trying to create: you've got to be ready to hit pause and read exposition at a moment's notice or miss out on vital information—like the literal rules of the game they are playing!    All that and the episode doesn't even manage to stick the landing. While the game itself is easy enough to understand, the lack of resolution within the first episode is a hindrance. After all, a cliffhanger only works if you care enough about the characters or story to want to come back next week. I don't.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Ah, emotional manipulation. Such a charming premise for any show, so why not make it even more lovely by throwing in a couple of random evil high school girls running a death game for groups of, specifically, five friends? Bonus points if it turns out that the entire thing was set up to point out the shoddy, self-serving nature of friendship, but it's the girls running the game who learn a little something about true friendship along the way instead!    Despite that opening paragraph, my main issue with Tomodachi Game really isn't its premise. Survival games have been a staple of fiction since at LEAST The Most Dangerous Game, and very likely before then if I could be bothered to remember any. Likewise the idea of how trustworthy your so-called friends are is one of the founding principles of certain YA subgenres, so the show is on fairly solid ground with its group of five pals who are tased into a strange white space that turns out to be someone's twisted playground. Starting things off with stolen money for a field trip also works decently well, even if one of the group was the one who's most likely to suffer for the loss and two others are among those most likely to have taken it in the first place. (In reality, I suspect that the girls running the game are responsible.) Where things falter is in the execution of the story, which seems to be a bit of a theme for today's episodes. The main problem is that we barely know these kids and no effort is expended to remedy that situation. In fact, a card with their names and their basic stereotypes is displayed at one point, letting us know precisely which genre trope everyone fits into. (That I then spent the rest of the episode being disturbed that baby-voiced, utterly helpless Kokorogi was labeled “the sexy one” is an entirely different issue.) This makes the matter of who survives and who dies not all that compelling of an issue, because not only do we not like any of them, we don't KNOW any of them. At this point I'm voting for Tenoji to go first because his hair looks like someone took a bite out of it and that annoys me unreasonably.    The survival game genre isn't impossible to do well. It's perhaps not even particularly difficult to do well. But Tomodachi Game seems hellbent on getting in its own way as much as possible with its paltry introductions, explanations that go between “too much” and “not enough,” and some very lackluster visuals. Unless you love the genre and will consume all forms of it, maybe give this a pass.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               I give isekai shows a lot of guff for being simultaneously ubiquitous and dull, but if there's one genre that can eclipse even that otherworldly monolith in pure tedium, it's death games. One of my biggest worries is the massive success of Squid Game bringing this already over-saturated story idea to the big stage. And while this show isn't strictly a death game – all that's currently at stake is money – it's just as much of a slog to get through as every other hackney edgelord parade that tries to come up with a new spin on the prisoner's dilemma.    The biggest reason for that is just how undercooked the “Tomodachi” part of its title is. This is meant to be a dark and gritty look at how five dear and loving friends can be pushed to betray each other for money, but the central friendships of the group are basically nonexistent. We get all of one scene of the five characters talking before they're thrown into this low-rent Kakegurui ripoff, so watching their tenuous friendship fall apart while they play the most obviously rigged game on the planet just isn't dramatic. These are people we've gotten to know mainly through a single screen of text explaining their personalities to us, and none of them have strong enough personalities to overcome that and make this whole ordeal interesting. When they start betraying each other it doesn't mean anything because none of them are real characters, so the entire tension of this game falls flat.    I'm also just so, so tired of every one of these having to bark up the same tree. Every single one of these things thinks they need their own Monokuma, but once you've seen a couple creepy-cute mascot characters who are secretly ~evil~ it loses its impact. As such, all the CG anime mascot character amounts to is a squeaky-voiced exposition machine with zero impact. Add in the random overseer girls who have to comment on everything from their surveillance room, smugly laughing about how their totally devious mind games will ruin another friendship and you have a story that's so insufferably impressed with its cut-rate edginess that finishing the episode is a feat of endurance.    The one and only bright spot of this premiere is in the very final moments, where it seems like our hapless protagonist has come up with some kind of plan to outsmart the Kokkuri-san game that his friends have all purposefully bought into. That, at least, could be a novel twist to this whole setup – our hero having to 4D-Chess his way into making his friends all play fair so they can clear their debts together, forcing a happy ending in the face of obvious psychological manipulation. I have very little faith that's where the show will actually go, but it would at least be a spin on this scenario that I haven't seen done a million times. It's still not enough to make watch more of this charmless bore, but it's something, I guess.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives   ",negative,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 2.9              What is this?   Yūichi Katagiri, a young man with a perfect student life who has four friends with difficult lives. His peaceful daily life comes to an end when 2 million yen (about US$20,000) in school trip fees goes missing. Riddles unfold as Yūichi gets caught up in a mysterious game for money and must decide whether friendship or money matters more.    Tomodachi Game is based on Yuki Sato's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                Any time a survival game anime pops up during Preview Guide, I get a little anxious. Not because I dislike the genre or anything—Danganronpa is one of my favorite franchises, as it so happens. The problem is that, for every smash hit like Danganronpa, it feels like there are a dozen would-be imitators that keep trying (and failing) to find new and fresh ways to mess with murder/betrayal/escape-room formula. To put it bluntly, a lot of survival game anime kind of suck. Tomodachi Game doesn't exactly suck, and there are even elements of this premiere that I find fairly interesting, but the overall package is just so wrapped up in tired clichés and mediocre presentation that it's hard to muster up enough energy to care one way or the other.    I'll give it this, though: It's nice that Yuichi and all of the other contestants of this weird game were all friends first. There's no amnesia, no cadre of bizarrely coifed and cartoonishly rendered strangers who all have to monologue about their backstories one after the other. The angle that Tomodachi Game is exploring is a tried and true one, but it's effective nonetheless. It asks, “How well do you really know your best friends?

The manga is still ongoing so I'm kind of curious how they'll conclude it. Obviously the final boss is anime Zetton, but will Leo and Astra show up?      Back to top                  TranceLimit174    Joined: 21 Jul 2004 		    Posts: 923       Posted: Mon Apr 18, 2022 10:15 am            I imagine S2 will be covered on TWIA, so I'll save the bulk of my comments for that...   But in relation to this teaser, it definitely feels like production plans for this anime got cut / cancelled. As a result, we are gonna get an anime original ending. But at least NetFlix is giving the series a proper ending rather than just getting rid of it unceremoniously like they do many other shows.   Doubt we will see the Leo Brothers. Their whole storyline involves being hired to assassinate Adad, and I simply don't see it happening since we seem to be rushing towards a finale.

The manga is still ongoing so I'm kind of curious how they'll conclude it. Obviously the final boss is anime Zetton, but will Leo and Astra show up?

But in relation to this teaser, it definitely feels like production plans for this anime got cut / cancelled. As a result, we are gonna get an anime original ending. But at least NetFlix is giving the series a proper ending rather than just getting rid of it unceremoniously like they do many other shows.   Doubt we will see the Leo Brothers. Their whole storyline involves being hired to assassinate Adad, and I simply don't see it happening since we seem to be rushing towards a finale.

But at least NetFlix is giving the series a proper ending rather than just getting rid of it unceremoniously like they do many other shows.   Doubt we will see the Leo Brothers.

Not amazing, but not bad either.  If Arc's look in the game was due to spoiler[a skin instead of a race choice], then maybe that's why he can do things like eat and be hungry? (not sure if that's a spoiler...)     Quote:    I'm a simple man: Ponta running laps across Arc's enormous pauldrons got a solid laugh out of me.

Things got pretty explicit in the first episode but I'm glad nothing happened to Maca and her family and it was a fairly wholesome second episode.   Tomoaki Maeno is really selling Arc's character. He has a laugh that would do Skeletor proud.    Ponta is adorable.

Aside the the dumb rape plot device that was clearly thrown in just to get shock value, not to mention the horrible way the chose to handle it, much of the rest of the first episode goes through the paces of table setting over the course of 20+ minutes that many other isekai have more recently seen fit to relegate to brief mention via monologue or narration, or at least more artfully sprinkle throughout a number of episodes.    Episode 2 is better, but still feels like it's ""uneven"". I think, however, that unevenness is deliberate and a consequence of the MC's personality. He still isn't adjusted to the fact that he's OP in this world right now, so he still acts super cautious and slow, seeming in fact to lack common sense. He isn't the typical pervy or lazy or power mad MCs we get w/ these isekais. He knows he's been isekai'd but not how. He didn't hate his past world, but doesn't seem to miss it either. So for the moment he seems more like a fantasy character lacking a background story just enjoying being a freshly minted adventurer learning everything.    Personally, as isekai MCs go, he's probably one of my favorites so far since they story isn't going out of its way to make him an absolute moron or some dark chuuni edgelord. They seem to want him to be a decent character you'll like, not force reasons for you to feel he's greasy and terrible and you gotta spend every other scene explaining away why ""he's not that bad"".

They were faithful to the light novel.  The prologue to the light novel is from the POV of the young ladies.  While the first chapter was Arc's arrival on the world and his POV from there.   Can't wait to get to the meat of the first arc, and see what everyone thinks.

It comes down to how its presented and its purpose, if its just for shock value or even worse titillation then that's annoying and even gross. It really did feel unnecessary. I think there are other ways to convey that this world can be dark and has its dangers.    The second episode was ok-ish? I'm willing to give the show another episode, because first episode complaints aside it seems like it may have the potential to be fun. However, its going to have to kick it into gear and find that funny bone some more if its going to hold my attention.

But he did do everything in his power to prevent it.  He stopped them before they could rape her, and he sliced them in half so they aren't going to be able to try that again.  How much more preventing can you ask for exactly?

It sounds like a fun show but I do not want to watch rape. Especially if it is not mitigated by the character doing everything he can to prevent it.            The rape scene is disappointing. It's longer than it needs to be, shown in unnecessary detail, with more dialog than is required. And shown twice on top of that. It's tonally out of step with the rest of the show. It could have been 5 seconds long. Some screams and the backs of a bunch of goons from a distance before Arc shows up and stops things. Even better, it could have been something else entirely - a highway robbery is still a serious enough crime to get across all the points being made (which I think are primarily ""Arc is a good but cautious guy not yet aware of his strength"")   It just speaks to the studio and the writers not treating rape as the incredibly serious and sensitive issue that is is. It's just an inconsequential shorthand for ""bad guys doing a bad thing"" and so we're not particularly conflicted when Arc straight up cleaves them in two. Which, admittedly and unfortunately, is pretty much a standard trope in anime.    But.. to loop back around to ""it's tonally out of step with the rest of the show"". It really is. The rest of the two episodes are ""Arc is a likeable doof who is pretty pleased to be a super-powered skeleton but is naturally cautious and is working hard to fit in"".   I'd suggest making full use of the +10s button to skip right though. You'll really not be missing out on anything worthwhile.

But thanks for your take on it, reading about how detailed and into the scene the show is is rather off putting.    As for your question @SilverTalon Well basicly the review descriptions and other like Thesarum have state how talked about how the scene was depicted (twice) with much detail and the reviews also talk about how the MC was struggling with risking himself to help them. I find rape abhorrent, among the most destructive acts that can be visited on a person. A hero trying to protect people from it can make it slightly less worse but hearing his hesitation takes that away just leaving the scene. I dont begrudge his desire to protect himself over others but it does nothing to help the conflictedness I experience. Horrible moments vs a fun time. What a bad mix.   I dont suppose you could provide time stamps to avoid the content? That would be cool.

That would be cool.            Honestly, you shouldn't bother picking this up for your own good. While not every arc in this series (*groan*) has scenes like the first episode, there will be at least two more instances of characters being threatened with rape. There will also be a worse scene where spoiler[Arc and company free pregnant slaves who were implied to have been raped repeatedly over a period of months, if not longer.]   Despite how jovial and even wholesome Arc can be, the actual world is much darker than his perspective usually suggests.   It is actually worse than Goblin Slayer in that it doesn't end at a singular event to set the tone, or imply it without description as in that series's LNs. It happens less as Skeletal Knight goes on, but I can't imagine how taxing it would be to watch while constantly wondering when the other shoe will drop.   It's a shame because while it is a fun story often enough, it's impossible to recommend without a list of trigger warnings.

I don't think the two are contradictory at all.  If he had run out there recklessly and gotten killed, the two would have been guaranteed to be raped.  Intervening and failing isn't just a risk to Arc.  It is a risk to the two women as well because nobody else is there to help.  As other have said, there is, for at least the episodes we have right now, an ongoing theme of Arc not knowing how strong he is.   In hindsight from our pov, Arc's plan didn't matter.  He could have just walked up and killed them all.  However, he didn't know that so he instead came up with the plan to take the rapists by surprise.  Again, Arc getting killed trying to help doesn't help anyone and guarantees that the two women he prevented from getting raped would have been raped.  You're penalizing Arc as a character for coming up with a higher success rate approach that does in fact prevent the rape.

It's a shame because while it is a fun story often enough, it's impossible to recommend without a list of trigger warnings.            If that's true, it's a shame. I don't understand why some writers feel the need to beat audiences over the head with the most viscerally repugnant content they can imagine, especially when they know they're not going to address it in any meaningful way, let alone give it the treatment it deserves. And before someone tries to go there, yes, this applies to gore as well. Spending time to detail the process of someone getting bisected or dismembered or beheaded adds nothing to the story, demonstrates nothing, and shines no light on anything in any sense other than trying to out-shock the last shocking event you think people saw. Generally it seems like over the last 10-15 years you have a number of series saying, ""well, we can't think of any more shockingly graphic death scenes, I guess we'll shock people with sexual assaults instead.""    I'll stop ranting now. I might keep going with the series a while to see how things play out. I assumed the Ep1 situation was a one and done deal, but my hopes for the series have been diminished.

But just because the world has lots of evil in it, doesn't mean the people that live within it must disallow happiness from their lives to maintain a 'tone'.   Are we really saying that Arc and company are not allowed to lead happy and enjoyable lives, despite the evil they fight in their lives.   I can see maintaining a tone in children's entertainment, but this is anime.   I have no problem with anyone complaining about the rape scene.  We all watch anime for different reasons, and some scenes are too much for some.  Personally, I think the mix of darker and lighter scenes is more realistic to real life.  One day you can be partying with friends, the next day one of them dies from a DUI.   And yes. there is even more evil and nastier stuff going on. spoiler[nothing is implied, it simply exists.  the elves and demi-humans are being enslaved for labor, sexual slavery, and breeding children for magic ability.  For the last two items, that is through rape. ]  The anime has been faithful to the light novel considering these scenes.  Which bodes well for those of us that want a faithful adaptation.  But if the current content bothers you, I don't recommend watching anymore.  Future scenes could be just as bad, and you will know exactly what is going on.

On the whole, you will get way more of Arc being Arc than scenes of rape or gore. Just know there will be more of that unless they decided to tone things down in adaptation. (Doesn't seem like it. :p)   Skeletal Knight does avoid some of the usual isekai pitfalls and has more of an old school fantasy vibe if you can ignore the shlock. That said, it doesn't hold a candle to the likes of The Executioner and Her Way of Life or Ascendance of a Bookworm.

Sexual violence exists in the world, and it's absolutely legitimate to talk about it in fiction. But it should never be casually thrown around like it's some sort of narrative spice that can be sprinkled on to lend your story some ""darkness"" with a side order of titillation. I've not read the LN, so I've no idea how well it'll be handled here, but I'm not hugely optimistic. Either way, it's not really what I was looking for from this show.

Not amazing, but not bad either.  If Arc's look in the game was due to spoiler[a skin instead of a race choice], then maybe that's why he can do things like eat and be hungry? (not sure if that's a spoiler...)     Quote:    I'm a simple man: Ponta running laps across Arc's enormous pauldrons got a solid laugh out of me.            Yeah, Ponta using those absurdly large video game pauldrons to ride on is a great use of them lol      Back to top                  MFrontier    Joined: 13 Apr 2014 		    Posts: 3905       Posted: Fri Apr 15, 2022 4:38 pm            This seems like it's setting up to be a fairly fun and enjoyable RPG Isekai romp, though I feel like it'll really settle into its own once we properly meet the female lead.   Things got pretty explicit in the first episode but I'm glad nothing happened to Maca and her family and it was a fairly wholesome second episode.   Tomoaki Maeno is really selling Arc's character. He has a laugh that would do Skeletor proud.    Ponta is adorable.

Aside the the dumb rape plot device that was clearly thrown in just to get shock value, not to mention the horrible way the chose to handle it, much of the rest of the first episode goes through the paces of table setting over the course of 20+ minutes that many other isekai have more recently seen fit to relegate to brief mention via monologue or narration, or at least more artfully sprinkle throughout a number of episodes.    Episode 2 is better, but still feels like it's ""uneven"". I think, however, that unevenness is deliberate and a consequence of the MC's personality. He still isn't adjusted to the fact that he's OP in this world right now, so he still acts super cautious and slow, seeming in fact to lack common sense. He isn't the typical pervy or lazy or power mad MCs we get w/ these isekais. He knows he's been isekai'd but not how. He didn't hate his past world, but doesn't seem to miss it either. So for the moment he seems more like a fantasy character lacking a background story just enjoying being a freshly minted adventurer learning everything.    Personally, as isekai MCs go, he's probably one of my favorites so far since they story isn't going out of its way to make him an absolute moron or some dark chuuni edgelord. They seem to want him to be a decent character you'll like, not force reasons for you to feel he's greasy and terrible and you gotta spend every other scene explaining away why ""he's not that bad"".

They were faithful to the light novel.  The prologue to the light novel is from the POV of the young ladies.  While the first chapter was Arc's arrival on the world and his POV from there.   Can't wait to get to the meat of the first arc, and see what everyone thinks.

It comes down to how its presented and its purpose, if its just for shock value or even worse titillation then that's annoying and even gross. It really did feel unnecessary. I think there are other ways to convey that this world can be dark and has its dangers.    The second episode was ok-ish? I'm willing to give the show another episode, because first episode complaints aside it seems like it may have the potential to be fun. However, its going to have to kick it into gear and find that funny bone some more if its going to hold my attention.

But he did do everything in his power to prevent it.  He stopped them before they could rape her, and he sliced them in half so they aren't going to be able to try that again.  How much more preventing can you ask for exactly?

It sounds like a fun show but I do not want to watch rape. Especially if it is not mitigated by the character doing everything he can to prevent it.            The rape scene is disappointing. It's longer than it needs to be, shown in unnecessary detail, with more dialog than is required. And shown twice on top of that. It's tonally out of step with the rest of the show. It could have been 5 seconds long. Some screams and the backs of a bunch of goons from a distance before Arc shows up and stops things. Even better, it could have been something else entirely - a highway robbery is still a serious enough crime to get across all the points being made (which I think are primarily ""Arc is a good but cautious guy not yet aware of his strength"")   It just speaks to the studio and the writers not treating rape as the incredibly serious and sensitive issue that is is. It's just an inconsequential shorthand for ""bad guys doing a bad thing"" and so we're not particularly conflicted when Arc straight up cleaves them in two. Which, admittedly and unfortunately, is pretty much a standard trope in anime.    But.. to loop back around to ""it's tonally out of step with the rest of the show"". It really is. The rest of the two episodes are ""Arc is a likeable doof who is pretty pleased to be a super-powered skeleton but is naturally cautious and is working hard to fit in"".   I'd suggest making full use of the +10s button to skip right though. You'll really not be missing out on anything worthwhile.

But thanks for your take on it, reading about how detailed and into the scene the show is is rather off putting.    As for your question @SilverTalon Well basicly the review descriptions and other like Thesarum have state how talked about how the scene was depicted (twice) with much detail and the reviews also talk about how the MC was struggling with risking himself to help them. I find rape abhorrent, among the most destructive acts that can be visited on a person. A hero trying to protect people from it can make it slightly less worse but hearing his hesitation takes that away just leaving the scene. I dont begrudge his desire to protect himself over others but it does nothing to help the conflictedness I experience. Horrible moments vs a fun time. What a bad mix.   I dont suppose you could provide time stamps to avoid the content? That would be cool.

That would be cool.            Honestly, you shouldn't bother picking this up for your own good. While not every arc in this series (*groan*) has scenes like the first episode, there will be at least two more instances of characters being threatened with rape. There will also be a worse scene where spoiler[Arc and company free pregnant slaves who were implied to have been raped repeatedly over a period of months, if not longer.]   Despite how jovial and even wholesome Arc can be, the actual world is much darker than his perspective usually suggests.   It is actually worse than Goblin Slayer in that it doesn't end at a singular event to set the tone, or imply it without description as in that series's LNs. It happens less as Skeletal Knight goes on, but I can't imagine how taxing it would be to watch while constantly wondering when the other shoe will drop.   It's a shame because while it is a fun story often enough, it's impossible to recommend without a list of trigger warnings.

I don't think the two are contradictory at all.  If he had run out there recklessly and gotten killed, the two would have been guaranteed to be raped.  Intervening and failing isn't just a risk to Arc.  It is a risk to the two women as well because nobody else is there to help.  As other have said, there is, for at least the episodes we have right now, an ongoing theme of Arc not knowing how strong he is.   In hindsight from our pov, Arc's plan didn't matter.  He could have just walked up and killed them all.  However, he didn't know that so he instead came up with the plan to take the rapists by surprise.  Again, Arc getting killed trying to help doesn't help anyone and guarantees that the two women he prevented from getting raped would have been raped.  You're penalizing Arc as a character for coming up with a higher success rate approach that does in fact prevent the rape.

It's a shame because while it is a fun story often enough, it's impossible to recommend without a list of trigger warnings.            If that's true, it's a shame. I don't understand why some writers feel the need to beat audiences over the head with the most viscerally repugnant content they can imagine, especially when they know they're not going to address it in any meaningful way, let alone give it the treatment it deserves. And before someone tries to go there, yes, this applies to gore as well. Spending time to detail the process of someone getting bisected or dismembered or beheaded adds nothing to the story, demonstrates nothing, and shines no light on anything in any sense other than trying to out-shock the last shocking event you think people saw. Generally it seems like over the last 10-15 years you have a number of series saying, ""well, we can't think of any more shockingly graphic death scenes, I guess we'll shock people with sexual assaults instead.""    I'll stop ranting now. I might keep going with the series a while to see how things play out. I assumed the Ep1 situation was a one and done deal, but my hopes for the series have been diminished.

But just because the world has lots of evil in it, doesn't mean the people that live within it must disallow happiness from their lives to maintain a 'tone'.   Are we really saying that Arc and company are not allowed to lead happy and enjoyable lives, despite the evil they fight in their lives.   I can see maintaining a tone in children's entertainment, but this is anime.   I have no problem with anyone complaining about the rape scene.  We all watch anime for different reasons, and some scenes are too much for some.  Personally, I think the mix of darker and lighter scenes is more realistic to real life.  One day you can be partying with friends, the next day one of them dies from a DUI.   And yes. there is even more evil and nastier stuff going on. spoiler[nothing is implied, it simply exists.  the elves and demi-humans are being enslaved for labor, sexual slavery, and breeding children for magic ability.  For the last two items, that is through rape. ]  The anime has been faithful to the light novel considering these scenes.  Which bodes well for those of us that want a faithful adaptation.  But if the current content bothers you, I don't recommend watching anymore.  Future scenes could be just as bad, and you will know exactly what is going on.

On the whole, you will get way more of Arc being Arc than scenes of rape or gore. Just know there will be more of that unless they decided to tone things down in adaptation. (Doesn't seem like it. :p)   Skeletal Knight does avoid some of the usual isekai pitfalls and has more of an old school fantasy vibe if you can ignore the shlock.

Sexual violence exists in the world, and it's absolutely legitimate to talk about it in fiction. But it should never be casually thrown around like it's some sort of narrative spice that can be sprinkled on to lend your story some ""darkness"" with a side order of titillation. I've not read the LN, so I've no idea how well it'll be handled here, but I'm not hugely optimistic. Either way, it's not really what I was looking for from this show.

Not amazing, but not bad either.  If Arc's look in the game was due to spoiler[a skin instead of a race choice], then maybe that's why he can do things like eat and be hungry? (not sure if that's a spoiler...)     Quote:    I'm a simple man: Ponta running laps across Arc's enormous pauldrons got a solid laugh out of me.

Things got pretty explicit in the first episode but I'm glad nothing happened to Maca and her family and it was a fairly wholesome second episode.   Tomoaki Maeno is really selling Arc's character. He has a laugh that would do Skeletor proud.    Ponta is adorable.

Aside the the dumb rape plot device that was clearly thrown in just to get shock value, not to mention the horrible way the chose to handle it, much of the rest of the first episode goes through the paces of table setting over the course of 20+ minutes that many other isekai have more recently seen fit to relegate to brief mention via monologue or narration, or at least more artfully sprinkle throughout a number of episodes.    Episode 2 is better, but still feels like it's ""uneven"". I think, however, that unevenness is deliberate and a consequence of the MC's personality. He still isn't adjusted to the fact that he's OP in this world right now, so he still acts super cautious and slow, seeming in fact to lack common sense. He isn't the typical pervy or lazy or power mad MCs we get w/ these isekais. He knows he's been isekai'd but not how. He didn't hate his past world, but doesn't seem to miss it either. So for the moment he seems more like a fantasy character lacking a background story just enjoying being a freshly minted adventurer learning everything.    Personally, as isekai MCs go, he's probably one of my favorites so far since they story isn't going out of its way to make him an absolute moron or some dark chuuni edgelord. They seem to want him to be a decent character you'll like, not force reasons for you to feel he's greasy and terrible and you gotta spend every other scene explaining away why ""he's not that bad"".

Aside the the dumb rape plot device that was clearly thrown in just to get shock value, not to mention the horrible way the chose to handle it,             That is not solely the anime's fault.  They were faithful to the light novel.  The prologue to the light novel is from the POV of the young ladies.  While the first chapter was Arc's arrival on the world and his POV from there.   Can't wait to get to the meat of the first arc, and see what everyone thinks.

It comes down to how its presented and its purpose, if its just for shock value or even worse titillation then that's annoying and even gross. It really did feel unnecessary. I think there are other ways to convey that this world can be dark and has its dangers.    The second episode was ok-ish? I'm willing to give the show another episode, because first episode complaints aside it seems like it may have the potential to be fun. However, its going to have to kick it into gear and find that funny bone some more if its going to hold my attention.

But he did do everything in his power to prevent it.  He stopped them before they could rape her, and he sliced them in half so they aren't going to be able to try that again.  How much more preventing can you ask for exactly?

It sounds like a fun show but I do not want to watch rape. Especially if it is not mitigated by the character doing everything he can to prevent it.            The rape scene is disappointing. It's longer than it needs to be, shown in unnecessary detail, with more dialog than is required. And shown twice on top of that. It's tonally out of step with the rest of the show. It could have been 5 seconds long. Some screams and the backs of a bunch of goons from a distance before Arc shows up and stops things. Even better, it could have been something else entirely - a highway robbery is still a serious enough crime to get across all the points being made (which I think are primarily ""Arc is a good but cautious guy not yet aware of his strength"")   It just speaks to the studio and the writers not treating rape as the incredibly serious and sensitive issue that is is. It's just an inconsequential shorthand for ""bad guys doing a bad thing"" and so we're not particularly conflicted when Arc straight up cleaves them in two. Which, admittedly and unfortunately, is pretty much a standard trope in anime.    But.. to loop back around to ""it's tonally out of step with the rest of the show"". It really is. The rest of the two episodes are ""Arc is a likeable doof who is pretty pleased to be a super-powered skeleton but is naturally cautious and is working hard to fit in"".   I'd suggest making full use of the +10s button to skip right though. You'll really not be missing out on anything worthwhile.

But thanks for your take on it, reading about how detailed and into the scene the show is is rather off putting.    As for your question @SilverTalon Well basicly the review descriptions and other like Thesarum have state how talked about how the scene was depicted (twice) with much detail and the reviews also talk about how the MC was struggling with risking himself to help them. I find rape abhorrent, among the most destructive acts that can be visited on a person. A hero trying to protect people from it can make it slightly less worse but hearing his hesitation takes that away just leaving the scene. I dont begrudge his desire to protect himself over others but it does nothing to help the conflictedness I experience. Horrible moments vs a fun time. What a bad mix.   I dont suppose you could provide time stamps to avoid the content? That would be cool.

That would be cool.            Honestly, you shouldn't bother picking this up for your own good. While not every arc in this series (*groan*) has scenes like the first episode, there will be at least two more instances of characters being threatened with rape. There will also be a worse scene where spoiler[Arc and company free pregnant slaves who were implied to have been raped repeatedly over a period of months, if not longer.]   Despite how jovial and even wholesome Arc can be, the actual world is much darker than his perspective usually suggests.   It is actually worse than Goblin Slayer in that it doesn't end at a singular event to set the tone, or imply it without description as in that series's LNs. It happens less as Skeletal Knight goes on, but I can't imagine how taxing it would be to watch while constantly wondering when the other shoe will drop.   It's a shame because while it is a fun story often enough, it's impossible to recommend without a list of trigger warnings.

I don't think the two are contradictory at all.  If he had run out there recklessly and gotten killed, the two would have been guaranteed to be raped.  Intervening and failing isn't just a risk to Arc.  It is a risk to the two women as well because nobody else is there to help.  As other have said, there is, for at least the episodes we have right now, an ongoing theme of Arc not knowing how strong he is.   In hindsight from our pov, Arc's plan didn't matter.  He could have just walked up and killed them all.  However, he didn't know that so he instead came up with the plan to take the rapists by surprise.  Again, Arc getting killed trying to help doesn't help anyone and guarantees that the two women he prevented from getting raped would have been raped.  You're penalizing Arc as a character for coming up with a higher success rate approach that does in fact prevent the rape.

It's a shame because while it is a fun story often enough, it's impossible to recommend without a list of trigger warnings.            If that's true, it's a shame. I don't understand why some writers feel the need to beat audiences over the head with the most viscerally repugnant content they can imagine, especially when they know they're not going to address it in any meaningful way, let alone give it the treatment it deserves. And before someone tries to go there, yes, this applies to gore as well. Spending time to detail the process of someone getting bisected or dismembered or beheaded adds nothing to the story, demonstrates nothing, and shines no light on anything in any sense other than trying to out-shock the last shocking event you think people saw. Generally it seems like over the last 10-15 years you have a number of series saying, ""well, we can't think of any more shockingly graphic death scenes, I guess we'll shock people with sexual assaults instead.""    I'll stop ranting now. I might keep going with the series a while to see how things play out. I assumed the Ep1 situation was a one and done deal, but my hopes for the series have been diminished.

But just because the world has lots of evil in it, doesn't mean the people that live within it must disallow happiness from their lives to maintain a 'tone'.   Are we really saying that Arc and company are not allowed to lead happy and enjoyable lives, despite the evil they fight in their lives.   I can see maintaining a tone in children's entertainment, but this is anime.   I have no problem with anyone complaining about the rape scene.  We all watch anime for different reasons, and some scenes are too much for some.  Personally, I think the mix of darker and lighter scenes is more realistic to real life.  One day you can be partying with friends, the next day one of them dies from a DUI.   And yes. there is even more evil and nastier stuff going on. spoiler[nothing is implied, it simply exists.  the elves and demi-humans are being enslaved for labor, sexual slavery, and breeding children for magic ability.  For the last two items, that is through rape. ]  The anime has been faithful to the light novel considering these scenes.  Which bodes well for those of us that want a faithful adaptation.  But if the current content bothers you, I don't recommend watching anymore.  Future scenes could be just as bad, and you will know exactly what is going on.

On the whole, you will get way more of Arc being Arc than scenes of rape or gore. Just know there will be more of that unless they decided to tone things down in adaptation. (Doesn't seem like it. :p)   Skeletal Knight does avoid some of the usual isekai pitfalls and has more of an old school fantasy vibe if you can ignore the shlock. That said, it doesn't hold a candle to the likes of The Executioner and Her Way of Life or Ascendance of a Bookworm.

Sexual violence exists in the world, and it's absolutely legitimate to talk about it in fiction. But it should never be casually thrown around like it's some sort of narrative spice that can be sprinkled on to lend your story some ""darkness"" with a side order of titillation. I've not read the LN, so I've no idea how well it'll be handled here, but I'm not hugely optimistic. Either way, it's not really what I was looking for from this show.

Not amazing, but not bad either.  If Arc's look in the game was due to spoiler[a skin instead of a race choice], then maybe that's why he can do things like eat and be hungry?

Things got pretty explicit in the first episode but I'm glad nothing happened to Maca and her family and it was a fairly wholesome second episode.   Tomoaki Maeno is really selling Arc's character.

Aside the the dumb rape plot device that was clearly thrown in just to get shock value, not to mention the horrible way the chose to handle it, much of the rest of the first episode goes through the paces of table setting over the course of 20+ minutes that many other isekai have more recently seen fit to relegate to brief mention via monologue or narration, or at least more artfully sprinkle throughout a number of episodes.    Episode 2 is better, but still feels like it's ""uneven"". I think, however, that unevenness is deliberate and a consequence of the MC's personality. He still isn't adjusted to the fact that he's OP in this world right now, so he still acts super cautious and slow, seeming in fact to lack common sense. He isn't the typical pervy or lazy or power mad MCs we get w/ these isekais. He knows he's been isekai'd but not how. He didn't hate his past world, but doesn't seem to miss it either. So for the moment he seems more like a fantasy character lacking a background story just enjoying being a freshly minted adventurer learning everything.    Personally, as isekai MCs go, he's probably one of my favorites so far since they story isn't going out of its way to make him an absolute moron or some dark chuuni edgelord. They seem to want him to be a decent character you'll like, not force reasons for you to feel he's greasy and terrible and you gotta spend every other scene explaining away why ""he's not that bad"".

They were faithful to the light novel.  The prologue to the light novel is from the POV of the young ladies.  While the first chapter was Arc's arrival on the world and his POV from there.   Can't wait to get to the meat of the first arc, and see what everyone thinks.

It comes down to how its presented and its purpose, if its just for shock value or even worse titillation then that's annoying and even gross. It really did feel unnecessary. I think there are other ways to convey that this world can be dark and has its dangers.    The second episode was ok-ish? I'm willing to give the show another episode, because first episode complaints aside it seems like it may have the potential to be fun. However, its going to have to kick it into gear and find that funny bone some more if its going to hold my attention.

It sounds like a fun show but I do not want to watch rape. Especially if it is not mitigated by the character doing everything he can to prevent it.            The rape scene is disappointing. It's longer than it needs to be, shown in unnecessary detail, with more dialog than is required. And shown twice on top of that. It's tonally out of step with the rest of the show. It could have been 5 seconds long. Some screams and the backs of a bunch of goons from a distance before Arc shows up and stops things. Even better, it could have been something else entirely - a highway robbery is still a serious enough crime to get across all the points being made (which I think are primarily ""Arc is a good but cautious guy not yet aware of his strength"")   It just speaks to the studio and the writers not treating rape as the incredibly serious and sensitive issue that is is. It's just an inconsequential shorthand for ""bad guys doing a bad thing"" and so we're not particularly conflicted when Arc straight up cleaves them in two. Which, admittedly and unfortunately, is pretty much a standard trope in anime.    But.. to loop back around to ""it's tonally out of step with the rest of the show"". It really is. The rest of the two episodes are ""Arc is a likeable doof who is pretty pleased to be a super-powered skeleton but is naturally cautious and is working hard to fit in"".   I'd suggest making full use of the +10s button to skip right though. You'll really not be missing out on anything worthwhile.

But thanks for your take on it, reading about how detailed and into the scene the show is is rather off putting.    As for your question @SilverTalon Well basicly the review descriptions and other like Thesarum have state how talked about how the scene was depicted (twice) with much detail and the reviews also talk about how the MC was struggling with risking himself to help them. I find rape abhorrent, among the most destructive acts that can be visited on a person. A hero trying to protect people from it can make it slightly less worse but hearing his hesitation takes that away just leaving the scene.

While not every arc in this series (*groan*) has scenes like the first episode, there will be at least two more instances of characters being threatened with rape. There will also be a worse scene where spoiler[Arc and company free pregnant slaves who were implied to have been raped repeatedly over a period of months, if not longer.]   Despite how jovial and even wholesome Arc can be, the actual world is much darker than his perspective usually suggests.   It is actually worse than Goblin Slayer in that it doesn't end at a singular event to set the tone, or imply it without description as in that series's LNs. It happens less as Skeletal Knight goes on, but I can't imagine how taxing it would be to watch while constantly wondering when the other shoe will drop.   It's a shame because while it is a fun story often enough, it's impossible to recommend without a list of trigger warnings.

I find rape abhorrent, among the most destructive acts that can be visited on a person. A hero trying to protect people from it can make it slightly less worse but hearing his hesitation takes that away just leaving the scene. I dont begrudge his desire to protect himself over others but it does nothing to help the conflictedness I experience. Horrible moments vs a fun time. What a bad mix.            I don't think the two are contradictory at all.  If he had run out there recklessly and gotten killed, the two would have been guaranteed to be raped.  Intervening and failing isn't just a risk to Arc.  It is a risk to the two women as well because nobody else is there to help.  As other have said, there is, for at least the episodes we have right now, an ongoing theme of Arc not knowing how strong he is.   In hindsight from our pov, Arc's plan didn't matter.  He could have just walked up and killed them all.  However, he didn't know that so he instead came up with the plan to take the rapists by surprise.  Again, Arc getting killed trying to help doesn't help anyone and guarantees that the two women he prevented from getting raped would have been raped.  You're penalizing Arc as a character for coming up with a higher success rate approach that does in fact prevent the rape.

It's a shame because while it is a fun story often enough, it's impossible to recommend without a list of trigger warnings.            If that's true, it's a shame. I don't understand why some writers feel the need to beat audiences over the head with the most viscerally repugnant content they can imagine, especially when they know they're not going to address it in any meaningful way, let alone give it the treatment it deserves. And before someone tries to go there, yes, this applies to gore as well. Spending time to detail the process of someone getting bisected or dismembered or beheaded adds nothing to the story, demonstrates nothing, and shines no light on anything in any sense other than trying to out-shock the last shocking event you think people saw. Generally it seems like over the last 10-15 years you have a number of series saying, ""well, we can't think of any more shockingly graphic death scenes, I guess we'll shock people with sexual assaults instead.""    I'll stop ranting now. I might keep going with the series a while to see how things play out. I assumed the Ep1 situation was a one and done deal, but my hopes for the series have been diminished.

But just because the world has lots of evil in it, doesn't mean the people that live within it must disallow happiness from their lives to maintain a 'tone'.   Are we really saying that Arc and company are not allowed to lead happy and enjoyable lives, despite the evil they fight in their lives.   I can see maintaining a tone in children's entertainment, but this is anime.   I have no problem with anyone complaining about the rape scene.  We all watch anime for different reasons, and some scenes are too much for some.  Personally, I think the mix of darker and lighter scenes is more realistic to real life.  One day you can be partying with friends, the next day one of them dies from a DUI.   And yes. there is even more evil and nastier stuff going on. spoiler[nothing is implied, it simply exists.  the elves and demi-humans are being enslaved for labor, sexual slavery, and breeding children for magic ability.  For the last two items, that is through rape. ]  The anime has been faithful to the light novel considering these scenes.  Which bodes well for those of us that want a faithful adaptation.  But if the current content bothers you, I don't recommend watching anymore.  Future scenes could be just as bad, and you will know exactly what is going on.

On the whole, you will get way more of Arc being Arc than scenes of rape or gore. Just know there will be more of that unless they decided to tone things down in adaptation. (Doesn't seem like it. :p)   Skeletal Knight does avoid some of the usual isekai pitfalls and has more of an old school fantasy vibe if you can ignore the shlock. That said, it doesn't hold a candle to the likes of The Executioner and Her Way of Life or Ascendance of a Bookworm.

Sexual violence exists in the world, and it's absolutely legitimate to talk about it in fiction. But it should never be casually thrown around like it's some sort of narrative spice that can be sprinkled on to lend your story some ""darkness"" with a side order of titillation. I've not read the LN, so I've no idea how well it'll be handled here, but I'm not hugely optimistic. Either way, it's not really what I was looking for from this show.

Things got pretty explicit in the first episode but I'm glad nothing happened to Maca and her family and it was a fairly wholesome second episode.   Tomoaki Maeno is really selling Arc's character.

Aside the the dumb rape plot device that was clearly thrown in just to get shock value, not to mention the horrible way the chose to handle it, much of the rest of the first episode goes through the paces of table setting over the course of 20+ minutes that many other isekai have more recently seen fit to relegate to brief mention via monologue or narration, or at least more artfully sprinkle throughout a number of episodes.    Episode 2 is better, but still feels like it's ""uneven"". I think, however, that unevenness is deliberate and a consequence of the MC's personality. He still isn't adjusted to the fact that he's OP in this world right now, so he still acts super cautious and slow, seeming in fact to lack common sense. He isn't the typical pervy or lazy or power mad MCs we get w/ these isekais. He knows he's been isekai'd but not how. He didn't hate his past world, but doesn't seem to miss it either. So for the moment he seems more like a fantasy character lacking a background story just enjoying being a freshly minted adventurer learning everything.    Personally, as isekai MCs go, he's probably one of my favorites so far since they story isn't going out of its way to make him an absolute moron or some dark chuuni edgelord. They seem to want him to be a decent character you'll like, not force reasons for you to feel he's greasy and terrible and you gotta spend every other scene explaining away why ""he's not that bad"".

They were faithful to the light novel.  The prologue to the light novel is from the POV of the young ladies.  While the first chapter was Arc's arrival on the world and his POV from there.   Can't wait to get to the meat of the first arc, and see what everyone thinks.

It comes down to how its presented and its purpose, if its just for shock value or even worse titillation then that's annoying and even gross. It really did feel unnecessary. I think there are other ways to convey that this world can be dark and has its dangers.    The second episode was ok-ish? I'm willing to give the show another episode, because first episode complaints aside it seems like it may have the potential to be fun. However, its going to have to kick it into gear and find that funny bone some more if its going to hold my attention.

It sounds like a fun show but I do not want to watch rape. Especially if it is not mitigated by the character doing everything he can to prevent it.            The rape scene is disappointing. It's longer than it needs to be, shown in unnecessary detail, with more dialog than is required. And shown twice on top of that. It's tonally out of step with the rest of the show. It could have been 5 seconds long. Some screams and the backs of a bunch of goons from a distance before Arc shows up and stops things. Even better, it could have been something else entirely - a highway robbery is still a serious enough crime to get across all the points being made (which I think are primarily ""Arc is a good but cautious guy not yet aware of his strength"")   It just speaks to the studio and the writers not treating rape as the incredibly serious and sensitive issue that is is. It's just an inconsequential shorthand for ""bad guys doing a bad thing"" and so we're not particularly conflicted when Arc straight up cleaves them in two. Which, admittedly and unfortunately, is pretty much a standard trope in anime.    But.. to loop back around to ""it's tonally out of step with the rest of the show"". It really is. The rest of the two episodes are ""Arc is a likeable doof who is pretty pleased to be a super-powered skeleton but is naturally cautious and is working hard to fit in"".   I'd suggest making full use of the +10s button to skip right though. You'll really not be missing out on anything worthwhile.

But thanks for your take on it, reading about how detailed and into the scene the show is is rather off putting.    As for your question @SilverTalon Well basicly the review descriptions and other like Thesarum have state how talked about how the scene was depicted (twice) with much detail and the reviews also talk about how the MC was struggling with risking himself to help them. I find rape abhorrent, among the most destructive acts that can be visited on a person. A hero trying to protect people from it can make it slightly less worse but hearing his hesitation takes that away just leaving the scene. I dont begrudge his desire to protect himself over others but it does nothing to help the conflictedness I experience. Horrible moments vs a fun time. What a bad mix.   I dont suppose you could provide time stamps to avoid the content? That would be cool.

It is actually worse than Goblin Slayer in that it doesn't end at a singular event to set the tone, or imply it without description as in that series's LNs. It happens less as Skeletal Knight goes on, but I can't imagine how taxing it would be to watch while constantly wondering when the other shoe will drop.   It's a shame because while it is a fun story often enough, it's impossible to recommend without a list of trigger warnings.

I find rape abhorrent, among the most destructive acts that can be visited on a person. A hero trying to protect people from it can make it slightly less worse but hearing his hesitation takes that away just leaving the scene. I dont begrudge his desire to protect himself over others but it does nothing to help the conflictedness I experience. Horrible moments vs a fun time. What a bad mix.            I don't think the two are contradictory at all.  If he had run out there recklessly and gotten killed, the two would have been guaranteed to be raped.  Intervening and failing isn't just a risk to Arc.  It is a risk to the two women as well because nobody else is there to help.  As other have said, there is, for at least the episodes we have right now, an ongoing theme of Arc not knowing how strong he is.   In hindsight from our pov, Arc's plan didn't matter.  He could have just walked up and killed them all.  However, he didn't know that so he instead came up with the plan to take the rapists by surprise.  Again, Arc getting killed trying to help doesn't help anyone and guarantees that the two women he prevented from getting raped would have been raped.  You're penalizing Arc as a character for coming up with a higher success rate approach that does in fact prevent the rape.

I don't understand why some writers feel the need to beat audiences over the head with the most viscerally repugnant content they can imagine, especially when they know they're not going to address it in any meaningful way, let alone give it the treatment it deserves. And before someone tries to go there, yes, this applies to gore as well. Spending time to detail the process of someone getting bisected or dismembered or beheaded adds nothing to the story, demonstrates nothing, and shines no light on anything in any sense other than trying to out-shock the last shocking event you think people saw. Generally it seems like over the last 10-15 years you have a number of series saying, ""well, we can't think of any more shockingly graphic death scenes, I guess we'll shock people with sexual assaults instead.""    I'll stop ranting now. I might keep going with the series a while to see how things play out. I assumed the Ep1 situation was a one and done deal, but my hopes for the series have been diminished.

But just because the world has lots of evil in it, doesn't mean the people that live within it must disallow happiness from their lives to maintain a 'tone'.   Are we really saying that Arc and company are not allowed to lead happy and enjoyable lives, despite the evil they fight in their lives.   I can see maintaining a tone in children's entertainment, but this is anime.   I have no problem with anyone complaining about the rape scene.  We all watch anime for different reasons, and some scenes are too much for some.  Personally, I think the mix of darker and lighter scenes is more realistic to real life.  One day you can be partying with friends, the next day one of them dies from a DUI.   And yes. there is even more evil and nastier stuff going on. spoiler[nothing is implied, it simply exists.  the elves and demi-humans are being enslaved for labor, sexual slavery, and breeding children for magic ability.  For the last two items, that is through rape. ]  The anime has been faithful to the light novel considering these scenes.  Which bodes well for those of us that want a faithful adaptation.  But if the current content bothers you, I don't recommend watching anymore.  Future scenes could be just as bad, and you will know exactly what is going on.

Things got pretty explicit in the first episode but I'm glad nothing happened to Maca and her family and it was a fairly wholesome second episode.   Tomoaki Maeno is really selling Arc's character. He has a laugh that would do Skeletor proud.    Ponta is adorable.

Aside the the dumb rape plot device that was clearly thrown in just to get shock value, not to mention the horrible way the chose to handle it, much of the rest of the first episode goes through the paces of table setting over the course of 20+ minutes that many other isekai have more recently seen fit to relegate to brief mention via monologue or narration, or at least more artfully sprinkle throughout a number of episodes.    Episode 2 is better, but still feels like it's ""uneven"". I think, however, that unevenness is deliberate and a consequence of the MC's personality. He still isn't adjusted to the fact that he's OP in this world right now, so he still acts super cautious and slow, seeming in fact to lack common sense. He isn't the typical pervy or lazy or power mad MCs we get w/ these isekais. He knows he's been isekai'd but not how. He didn't hate his past world, but doesn't seem to miss it either. So for the moment he seems more like a fantasy character lacking a background story just enjoying being a freshly minted adventurer learning everything.    Personally, as isekai MCs go, he's probably one of my favorites so far since they story isn't going out of its way to make him an absolute moron or some dark chuuni edgelord. They seem to want him to be a decent character you'll like, not force reasons for you to feel he's greasy and terrible and you gotta spend every other scene explaining away why ""he's not that bad"".

They were faithful to the light novel.  The prologue to the light novel is from the POV of the young ladies.  While the first chapter was Arc's arrival on the world and his POV from there.   Can't wait to get to the meat of the first arc, and see what everyone thinks.

It comes down to how its presented and its purpose, if its just for shock value or even worse titillation then that's annoying and even gross. It really did feel unnecessary. I think there are other ways to convey that this world can be dark and has its dangers.    The second episode was ok-ish? I'm willing to give the show another episode, because first episode complaints aside it seems like it may have the potential to be fun. However, its going to have to kick it into gear and find that funny bone some more if its going to hold my attention.

But he did do everything in his power to prevent it.  He stopped them before they could rape her, and he sliced them in half so they aren't going to be able to try that again.  How much more preventing can you ask for exactly?

It sounds like a fun show but I do not want to watch rape. Especially if it is not mitigated by the character doing everything he can to prevent it.            The rape scene is disappointing. It's longer than it needs to be, shown in unnecessary detail, with more dialog than is required. And shown twice on top of that. It's tonally out of step with the rest of the show. It could have been 5 seconds long. Some screams and the backs of a bunch of goons from a distance before Arc shows up and stops things. Even better, it could have been something else entirely - a highway robbery is still a serious enough crime to get across all the points being made (which I think are primarily ""Arc is a good but cautious guy not yet aware of his strength"")   It just speaks to the studio and the writers not treating rape as the incredibly serious and sensitive issue that is is. It's just an inconsequential shorthand for ""bad guys doing a bad thing"" and so we're not particularly conflicted when Arc straight up cleaves them in two. Which, admittedly and unfortunately, is pretty much a standard trope in anime.    But.. to loop back around to ""it's tonally out of step with the rest of the show"". It really is. The rest of the two episodes are ""Arc is a likeable doof who is pretty pleased to be a super-powered skeleton but is naturally cautious and is working hard to fit in"".   I'd suggest making full use of the +10s button to skip right though. You'll really not be missing out on anything worthwhile.

But thanks for your take on it, reading about how detailed and into the scene the show is is rather off putting.    As for your question @SilverTalon Well basicly the review descriptions and other like Thesarum have state how talked about how the scene was depicted (twice) with much detail and the reviews also talk about how the MC was struggling with risking himself to help them.

Aside the the dumb rape plot device that was clearly thrown in just to get shock value, not to mention the horrible way the chose to handle it, much of the rest of the first episode goes through the paces of table setting over the course of 20+ minutes that many other isekai have more recently seen fit to relegate to brief mention via monologue or narration, or at least more artfully sprinkle throughout a number of episodes.    Episode 2 is better, but still feels like it's ""uneven"". I think, however, that unevenness is deliberate and a consequence of the MC's personality. He still isn't adjusted to the fact that he's OP in this world right now, so he still acts super cautious and slow, seeming in fact to lack common sense. He isn't the typical pervy or lazy or power mad MCs we get w/ these isekais. He knows he's been isekai'd but not how. He didn't hate his past world, but doesn't seem to miss it either. So for the moment he seems more like a fantasy character lacking a background story just enjoying being a freshly minted adventurer learning everything.    Personally, as isekai MCs go, he's probably one of my favorites so far since they story isn't going out of its way to make him an absolute moron or some dark chuuni edgelord. They seem to want him to be a decent character you'll like, not force reasons for you to feel he's greasy and terrible and you gotta spend every other scene explaining away why ""he's not that bad"".

I don't think the two are contradictory at all.  If he had run out there recklessly and gotten killed, the two would have been guaranteed to be raped.  Intervening and failing isn't just a risk to Arc.  It is a risk to the two women as well because nobody else is there to help.  As other have said, there is, for at least the episodes we have right now, an ongoing theme of Arc not knowing how strong he is.   In hindsight from our pov, Arc's plan didn't matter.  He could have just walked up and killed them all.  However, he didn't know that so he instead came up with the plan to take the rapists by surprise.  Again, Arc getting killed trying to help doesn't help anyone and guarantees that the two women he prevented from getting raped would have been raped.  You're penalizing Arc as a character for coming up with a higher success rate approach that does in fact prevent the rape.

It's a shame because while it is a fun story often enough, it's impossible to recommend without a list of trigger warnings.            If that's true, it's a shame. I don't understand why some writers feel the need to beat audiences over the head with the most viscerally repugnant content they can imagine, especially when they know they're not going to address it in any meaningful way, let alone give it the treatment it deserves. And before someone tries to go there, yes, this applies to gore as well. Spending time to detail the process of someone getting bisected or dismembered or beheaded adds nothing to the story, demonstrates nothing, and shines no light on anything in any sense other than trying to out-shock the last shocking event you think people saw. Generally it seems like over the last 10-15 years you have a number of series saying, ""well, we can't think of any more shockingly graphic death scenes, I guess we'll shock people with sexual assaults instead.""    I'll stop ranting now. I might keep going with the series a while to see how things play out. I assumed the Ep1 situation was a one and done deal, but my hopes for the series have been diminished.

But just because the world has lots of evil in it, doesn't mean the people that live within it must disallow happiness from their lives to maintain a 'tone'.   Are we really saying that Arc and company are not allowed to lead happy and enjoyable lives, despite the evil they fight in their lives.   I can see maintaining a tone in children's entertainment, but this is anime.   I have no problem with anyone complaining about the rape scene.  We all watch anime for different reasons, and some scenes are too much for some.  Personally, I think the mix of darker and lighter scenes is more realistic to real life.  One day you can be partying with friends, the next day one of them dies from a DUI.   And yes. there is even more evil and nastier stuff going on. spoiler[nothing is implied, it simply exists.  the elves and demi-humans are being enslaved for labor, sexual slavery, and breeding children for magic ability.  For the last two items, that is through rape. ]  The anime has been faithful to the light novel considering these scenes.  Which bodes well for those of us that want a faithful adaptation.  But if the current content bothers you, I don't recommend watching anymore.  Future scenes could be just as bad, and you will know exactly what is going on.

On the whole, you will get way more of Arc being Arc than scenes of rape or gore. Just know there will be more of that unless they decided to tone things down in adaptation. (Doesn't seem like it. :p)   Skeletal Knight does avoid some of the usual isekai pitfalls and has more of an old school fantasy vibe if you can ignore the shlock. That said, it doesn't hold a candle to the likes of The Executioner and Her Way of Life or Ascendance of a Bookworm.

Sexual violence exists in the world, and it's absolutely legitimate to talk about it in fiction. But it should never be casually thrown around like it's some sort of narrative spice that can be sprinkled on to lend your story some ""darkness"" with a side order of titillation. I've not read the LN, so I've no idea how well it'll be handled here, but I'm not hugely optimistic. Either way, it's not really what I was looking for from this show.

I find rape abhorrent, among the most destructive acts that can be visited on a person. A hero trying to protect people from it can make it slightly less worse but hearing his hesitation takes that away just leaving the scene. I dont begrudge his desire to protect himself over others but it does nothing to help the conflictedness I experience. Horrible moments vs a fun time. What a bad mix.            I don't think the two are contradictory at all.  If he had run out there recklessly and gotten killed, the two would have been guaranteed to be raped.  Intervening and failing isn't just a risk to Arc.  It is a risk to the two women as well because nobody else is there to help.  As other have said, there is, for at least the episodes we have right now, an ongoing theme of Arc not knowing how strong he is.   In hindsight from our pov, Arc's plan didn't matter.  He could have just walked up and killed them all.  However, he didn't know that so he instead came up with the plan to take the rapists by surprise.  Again, Arc getting killed trying to help doesn't help anyone and guarantees that the two women he prevented from getting raped would have been raped.  You're penalizing Arc as a character for coming up with a higher success rate approach that does in fact prevent the rape.

I don't understand why some writers feel the need to beat audiences over the head with the most viscerally repugnant content they can imagine, especially when they know they're not going to address it in any meaningful way, let alone give it the treatment it deserves. And before someone tries to go there, yes, this applies to gore as well. Spending time to detail the process of someone getting bisected or dismembered or beheaded adds nothing to the story, demonstrates nothing, and shines no light on anything in any sense other than trying to out-shock the last shocking event you think people saw. Generally it seems like over the last 10-15 years you have a number of series saying, ""well, we can't think of any more shockingly graphic death scenes, I guess we'll shock people with sexual assaults instead.""    I'll stop ranting now. I might keep going with the series a while to see how things play out. I assumed the Ep1 situation was a one and done deal, but my hopes for the series have been diminished.

But just because the world has lots of evil in it, doesn't mean the people that live within it must disallow happiness from their lives to maintain a 'tone'.   Are we really saying that Arc and company are not allowed to lead happy and enjoyable lives, despite the evil they fight in their lives.   I can see maintaining a tone in children's entertainment, but this is anime.   I have no problem with anyone complaining about the rape scene.  We all watch anime for different reasons, and some scenes are too much for some.  Personally, I think the mix of darker and lighter scenes is more realistic to real life.  One day you can be partying with friends, the next day one of them dies from a DUI.   And yes. there is even more evil and nastier stuff going on. spoiler[nothing is implied, it simply exists.  the elves and demi-humans are being enslaved for labor, sexual slavery, and breeding children for magic ability.  For the last two items, that is through rape. ]  The anime has been faithful to the light novel considering these scenes.  Which bodes well for those of us that want a faithful adaptation.  But if the current content bothers you, I don't recommend watching anymore.  Future scenes could be just as bad, and you will know exactly what is going on.

Things got pretty explicit in the first episode but I'm glad nothing happened to Maca and her family and it was a fairly wholesome second episode.   Tomoaki Maeno is really selling Arc's character.

Aside the the dumb rape plot device that was clearly thrown in just to get shock value, not to mention the horrible way the chose to handle it, much of the rest of the first episode goes through the paces of table setting over the course of 20+ minutes that many other isekai have more recently seen fit to relegate to brief mention via monologue or narration, or at least more artfully sprinkle throughout a number of episodes.    Episode 2 is better, but still feels like it's ""uneven"". I think, however, that unevenness is deliberate and a consequence of the MC's personality. He still isn't adjusted to the fact that he's OP in this world right now, so he still acts super cautious and slow, seeming in fact to lack common sense. He isn't the typical pervy or lazy or power mad MCs we get w/ these isekais. He knows he's been isekai'd but not how. He didn't hate his past world, but doesn't seem to miss it either. So for the moment he seems more like a fantasy character lacking a background story just enjoying being a freshly minted adventurer learning everything.    Personally, as isekai MCs go, he's probably one of my favorites so far since they story isn't going out of its way to make him an absolute moron or some dark chuuni edgelord. They seem to want him to be a decent character you'll like, not force reasons for you to feel he's greasy and terrible and you gotta spend every other scene explaining away why ""he's not that bad"".

They were faithful to the light novel.  The prologue to the light novel is from the POV of the young ladies.  While the first chapter was Arc's arrival on the world and his POV from there.   Can't wait to get to the meat of the first arc, and see what everyone thinks.

It comes down to how its presented and its purpose, if its just for shock value or even worse titillation then that's annoying and even gross. It really did feel unnecessary. I think there are other ways to convey that this world can be dark and has its dangers.    The second episode was ok-ish? I'm willing to give the show another episode, because first episode complaints aside it seems like it may have the potential to be fun. However, its going to have to kick it into gear and find that funny bone some more if its going to hold my attention.

But he did do everything in his power to prevent it.  He stopped them before they could rape her, and he sliced them in half so they aren't going to be able to try that again.  How much more preventing can you ask for exactly?

It sounds like a fun show but I do not want to watch rape. Especially if it is not mitigated by the character doing everything he can to prevent it.            The rape scene is disappointing. It's longer than it needs to be, shown in unnecessary detail, with more dialog than is required. And shown twice on top of that. It's tonally out of step with the rest of the show. It could have been 5 seconds long. Some screams and the backs of a bunch of goons from a distance before Arc shows up and stops things. Even better, it could have been something else entirely - a highway robbery is still a serious enough crime to get across all the points being made (which I think are primarily ""Arc is a good but cautious guy not yet aware of his strength"")   It just speaks to the studio and the writers not treating rape as the incredibly serious and sensitive issue that is is. It's just an inconsequential shorthand for ""bad guys doing a bad thing"" and so we're not particularly conflicted when Arc straight up cleaves them in two. Which, admittedly and unfortunately, is pretty much a standard trope in anime.    But.. to loop back around to ""it's tonally out of step with the rest of the show"". It really is. The rest of the two episodes are ""Arc is a likeable doof who is pretty pleased to be a super-powered skeleton but is naturally cautious and is working hard to fit in"".   I'd suggest making full use of the +10s button to skip right though. You'll really not be missing out on anything worthwhile.

But thanks for your take on it, reading about how detailed and into the scene the show is is rather off putting.    As for your question @SilverTalon Well basicly the review descriptions and other like Thesarum have state how talked about how the scene was depicted (twice) with much detail and the reviews also talk about how the MC was struggling with risking himself to help them. I find rape abhorrent, among the most destructive acts that can be visited on a person. A hero trying to protect people from it can make it slightly less worse but hearing his hesitation takes that away just leaving the scene. I dont begrudge his desire to protect himself over others but it does nothing to help the conflictedness I experience. Horrible moments vs a fun time. What a bad mix.   I dont suppose you could provide time stamps to avoid the content? That would be cool.

That would be cool.            Honestly, you shouldn't bother picking this up for your own good. While not every arc in this series (*groan*) has scenes like the first episode, there will be at least two more instances of characters being threatened with rape. There will also be a worse scene where spoiler[Arc and company free pregnant slaves who were implied to have been raped repeatedly over a period of months, if not longer.]   Despite how jovial and even wholesome Arc can be, the actual world is much darker than his perspective usually suggests.   It is actually worse than Goblin Slayer in that it doesn't end at a singular event to set the tone, or imply it without description as in that series's LNs. It happens less as Skeletal Knight goes on, but I can't imagine how taxing it would be to watch while constantly wondering when the other shoe will drop.   It's a shame because while it is a fun story often enough, it's impossible to recommend without a list of trigger warnings.

Aside the the dumb rape plot device that was clearly thrown in just to get shock value, not to mention the horrible way the chose to handle it, much of the rest of the first episode goes through the paces of table setting over the course of 20+ minutes that many other isekai have more recently seen fit to relegate to brief mention via monologue or narration, or at least more artfully sprinkle throughout a number of episodes.    Episode 2 is better, but still feels like it's ""uneven"". I think, however, that unevenness is deliberate and a consequence of the MC's personality. He still isn't adjusted to the fact that he's OP in this world right now, so he still acts super cautious and slow, seeming in fact to lack common sense. He isn't the typical pervy or lazy or power mad MCs we get w/ these isekais. He knows he's been isekai'd but not how. He didn't hate his past world, but doesn't seem to miss it either. So for the moment he seems more like a fantasy character lacking a background story just enjoying being a freshly minted adventurer learning everything.    Personally, as isekai MCs go, he's probably one of my favorites so far since they story isn't going out of its way to make him an absolute moron or some dark chuuni edgelord. They seem to want him to be a decent character you'll like, not force reasons for you to feel he's greasy and terrible and you gotta spend every other scene explaining away why ""he's not that bad"".

They were faithful to the light novel.  The prologue to the light novel is from the POV of the young ladies.  While the first chapter was Arc's arrival on the world and his POV from there.   Can't wait to get to the meat of the first arc, and see what everyone thinks.

It comes down to how its presented and its purpose, if its just for shock value or even worse titillation then that's annoying and even gross. It really did feel unnecessary. I think there are other ways to convey that this world can be dark and has its dangers.    The second episode was ok-ish? I'm willing to give the show another episode, because first episode complaints aside it seems like it may have the potential to be fun. However, its going to have to kick it into gear and find that funny bone some more if its going to hold my attention.

It sounds like a fun show but I do not want to watch rape. Especially if it is not mitigated by the character doing everything he can to prevent it.            The rape scene is disappointing. It's longer than it needs to be, shown in unnecessary detail, with more dialog than is required. And shown twice on top of that. It's tonally out of step with the rest of the show. It could have been 5 seconds long. Some screams and the backs of a bunch of goons from a distance before Arc shows up and stops things. Even better, it could have been something else entirely - a highway robbery is still a serious enough crime to get across all the points being made (which I think are primarily ""Arc is a good but cautious guy not yet aware of his strength"")   It just speaks to the studio and the writers not treating rape as the incredibly serious and sensitive issue that is is. It's just an inconsequential shorthand for ""bad guys doing a bad thing"" and so we're not particularly conflicted when Arc straight up cleaves them in two. Which, admittedly and unfortunately, is pretty much a standard trope in anime.    But.. to loop back around to ""it's tonally out of step with the rest of the show"". It really is. The rest of the two episodes are ""Arc is a likeable doof who is pretty pleased to be a super-powered skeleton but is naturally cautious and is working hard to fit in"".   I'd suggest making full use of the +10s button to skip right though. You'll really not be missing out on anything worthwhile.

But thanks for your take on it, reading about how detailed and into the scene the show is is rather off putting.    As for your question @SilverTalon Well basicly the review descriptions and other like Thesarum have state how talked about how the scene was depicted (twice) with much detail and the reviews also talk about how the MC was struggling with risking himself to help them. I find rape abhorrent, among the most destructive acts that can be visited on a person. A hero trying to protect people from it can make it slightly less worse but hearing his hesitation takes that away just leaving the scene. I dont begrudge his desire to protect himself over others but it does nothing to help the conflictedness I experience. Horrible moments vs a fun time. What a bad mix.   I dont suppose you could provide time stamps to avoid the content? That would be cool.

That would be cool.            Honestly, you shouldn't bother picking this up for your own good. While not every arc in this series (*groan*) has scenes like the first episode, there will be at least two more instances of characters being threatened with rape. There will also be a worse scene where spoiler[Arc and company free pregnant slaves who were implied to have been raped repeatedly over a period of months, if not longer.]   Despite how jovial and even wholesome Arc can be, the actual world is much darker than his perspective usually suggests.   It is actually worse than Goblin Slayer in that it doesn't end at a singular event to set the tone, or imply it without description as in that series's LNs. It happens less as Skeletal Knight goes on, but I can't imagine how taxing it would be to watch while constantly wondering when the other shoe will drop.   It's a shame because while it is a fun story often enough, it's impossible to recommend without a list of trigger warnings.

I don't think the two are contradictory at all.  If he had run out there recklessly and gotten killed, the two would have been guaranteed to be raped.  Intervening and failing isn't just a risk to Arc.  It is a risk to the two women as well because nobody else is there to help.  As other have said, there is, for at least the episodes we have right now, an ongoing theme of Arc not knowing how strong he is.   In hindsight from our pov, Arc's plan didn't matter.  He could have just walked up and killed them all.  However, he didn't know that so he instead came up with the plan to take the rapists by surprise.  Again, Arc getting killed trying to help doesn't help anyone and guarantees that the two women he prevented from getting raped would have been raped.  You're penalizing Arc as a character for coming up with a higher success rate approach that does in fact prevent the rape.

It's a shame because while it is a fun story often enough, it's impossible to recommend without a list of trigger warnings.            If that's true, it's a shame. I don't understand why some writers feel the need to beat audiences over the head with the most viscerally repugnant content they can imagine, especially when they know they're not going to address it in any meaningful way, let alone give it the treatment it deserves. And before someone tries to go there, yes, this applies to gore as well. Spending time to detail the process of someone getting bisected or dismembered or beheaded adds nothing to the story, demonstrates nothing, and shines no light on anything in any sense other than trying to out-shock the last shocking event you think people saw. Generally it seems like over the last 10-15 years you have a number of series saying, ""well, we can't think of any more shockingly graphic death scenes, I guess we'll shock people with sexual assaults instead.""    I'll stop ranting now. I might keep going with the series a while to see how things play out. I assumed the Ep1 situation was a one and done deal, but my hopes for the series have been diminished.

On the whole, you will get way more of Arc being Arc than scenes of rape or gore. Just know there will be more of that unless they decided to tone things down in adaptation. (Doesn't seem like it. :p)   Skeletal Knight does avoid some of the usual isekai pitfalls and has more of an old school fantasy vibe if you can ignore the shlock. That said, it doesn't hold a candle to the likes of The Executioner and Her Way of Life or Ascendance of a Bookworm.

Sexual violence exists in the world, and it's absolutely legitimate to talk about it in fiction. But it should never be casually thrown around like it's some sort of narrative spice that can be sprinkled on to lend your story some ""darkness"" with a side order of titillation. I've not read the LN, so I've no idea how well it'll be handled here, but I'm not hugely optimistic. Either way, it's not really what I was looking for from this show.

Are you wondering why it's so low or so high?  Both are related to the fact it airs right before Conan. This week aired a remaster of an ep from a decade ago so not as many people tuned in I'm guessing.  This week's might be a bit higher.

It was fastpaced and well executed. Several famous series nowadays are often just said that are popular cos of the animation but Spy's animation isn't that exaggerated like what Mappa and Ufotable have.   Also, talking about Mappa, I kinda wonder if the second season of Jujutsu Kaisen might have better ratings similar to what happened with Kimetsu no Yaiba during its second season.

I never said it wasn't popular anymore. What I said is that it dropped a little after how season 3 was handled and my opinion is based on comments I've read on both legal and pirate sites. Season 4 is an improvement but there isn't as much excitement as there used to be.

Madoka franchise, Toaru, Danmachi, DxD, Fate series once you exit the main series. SAO lost a significant market share towards newer series like Tensura, and progressive made a lot less than Ordinal Scale, Bleach Thousand year blood war arc being a big 3 anime and have more copies than My Hero has less people interested on MAL than My Hero despite more Bleach manga in circulation. Two of the highest grossing anime movies of all time Mugen Train, JJK0, are literally brand new series. Gundam.   But key thing is they have stood the test of time as people flock to newer shows. Tsunako has some of the best character designs in the industry, and that has helped it loads outside oricon sales.

Are you wondering why it's so low or so high?  Both are related to the fact it airs right before Conan. This week aired a remaster of an ep from a decade ago so not as many people tuned in I'm guessing.  This week's might be a bit higher.

It was fastpaced and well executed. Several famous series nowadays are often just said that are popular cos of the animation but Spy's animation isn't that exaggerated like what Mappa and Ufotable have.   Also, talking about Mappa, I kinda wonder if the second season of Jujutsu Kaisen might have better ratings similar to what happened with Kimetsu no Yaiba during its second season.

Madoka franchise, Toaru, Danmachi, DxD, Fate series once you exit the main series. SAO lost a significant market share towards newer series like Tensura, and progressive made a lot less than Ordinal Scale, Bleach Thousand year blood war arc being a big 3 anime and have more copies than My Hero has less people interested on MAL than My Hero despite more Bleach manga in circulation. Two of the highest grossing anime movies of all time Mugen Train, JJK0, are literally brand new series. Gundam.   But key thing is they have stood the test of time as people flock to newer shows. Tsunako has some of the best character designs in the industry, and that has helped it loads outside oricon sales.

Are you wondering why it's so low or so high?  Both are related to the fact it airs right before Conan. This week aired a remaster of an ep from a decade ago so not as many people tuned in I'm guessing.  This week's might be a bit higher.

It was fastpaced and well executed. Several famous series nowadays are often just said that are popular cos of the animation but Spy's animation isn't that exaggerated like what Mappa and Ufotable have.   Also, talking about Mappa, I kinda wonder if the second season of Jujutsu Kaisen might have better ratings similar to what happened with Kimetsu no Yaiba during its second season.

Madoka franchise, Toaru, Danmachi, DxD, Fate series once you exit the main series. SAO lost a significant market share towards newer series like Tensura, and progressive made a lot less than Ordinal Scale, Bleach Thousand year blood war arc being a big 3 anime and have more copies than My Hero has less people interested on MAL than My Hero despite more Bleach manga in circulation. Two of the highest grossing anime movies of all time Mugen Train, JJK0, are literally brand new series. Gundam.   But key thing is they have stood the test of time as people flock to newer shows. Tsunako has some of the best character designs in the industry, and that has helped it loads outside oricon sales.

Are you wondering why it's so low or so high?  Both are related to the fact it airs right before Conan. This week aired a remaster of an ep from a decade ago so not as many people tuned in I'm guessing.  This week's might be a bit higher.

It was fastpaced and well executed. Several famous series nowadays are often just said that are popular cos of the animation but Spy's animation isn't that exaggerated like what Mappa and Ufotable have.   Also, talking about Mappa, I kinda wonder if the second season of Jujutsu Kaisen might have better ratings similar to what happened with Kimetsu no Yaiba during its second season.

SAO lost a significant market share towards newer series like Tensura, and progressive made a lot less than Ordinal Scale, Bleach Thousand year blood war arc being a big 3 anime and have more copies than My Hero has less people interested on MAL than My Hero despite more Bleach manga in circulation. Two of the highest grossing anime movies of all time Mugen Train, JJK0, are literally brand new series. Gundam.   But key thing is they have stood the test of time as people flock to newer shows. Tsunako has some of the best character designs in the industry, and that has helped it loads outside oricon sales.

Are you wondering why it's so low or so high?  Both are related to the fact it airs right before Conan. This week aired a remaster of an ep from a decade ago so not as many people tuned in I'm guessing.  This week's might be a bit higher.

It was fastpaced and well executed. Several famous series nowadays are often just said that are popular cos of the animation but Spy's animation isn't that exaggerated like what Mappa and Ufotable have.   Also, talking about Mappa, I kinda wonder if the second season of Jujutsu Kaisen might have better ratings similar to what happened with Kimetsu no Yaiba during its second season.

What will you do with your time in Rigbarth? ― It's a little hard to talk about the Story of Seasons games (and their Rune Factory spin-offs). Not because of the complicated legal snarl involving the Story of Seasons and Harvest Moon branding, but because on the merits that most games woul...                    game review          2 comments       Chocobo GP   Mar 18, 00:00 2 comments                 games    Chocobo GP is a big improvement and an even greater risk. It's sharper, tighter, more enjoyable...and now competing directly with the latest Mario Kart on Nintendo's home turf. ― The original Chocobo Racing was not an astounding game, but it was a cleverly-positioned one. It offered the PlayStation owners of 1999 an answer to the Nintendo 64's Mario Kart while dusting itself with Final Fantasy refere...                           game review          8 comments       Persona 4 Arena Ultimax Review   Mar 11, 01:21 8 comments                 games    Now that Persona 4 Arena Ultimax is out on modern platforms with a massive adoption rate, the question is how much is in here for a single-playing Persona? The answer is an inspiring ""Quite a bit!"" ― The rerelease of 2014's Persona 4 Arena Ultimax finds itself in an odd situation for such a thing. The fighting game scene has ballooned into an even bigger, better place in the eight years since, so put...                    game review          1 comment       Jujutsu Kaisen: Escape From the Cursed Spirit of the Abandoned School   Feb 26, 01:00 1 comment                 games    Gojo assigns you to a mission to help the first-year students investigate a creepy abandoned school. Can you and the others use your techniques -- and your smarts -- to exorcise the cursed spirit before it's too late? ― When you think of an anime world you would want to live in, Jujutsu Kaisen probably isn't at the top of your list, if it is even on the list. But it's possible you've dreamed of going...                    game review          1 comment       Atelier Sophie 2: Alchemist of the Mysterious Dream   Feb 24, 22:00 1 comment                 games    The Nintendo Switch struggles to handle this new entry in the Atelier franchise, but beyond its technical issues the world of Erde Wiege introduces players to characters that quickly come to feel like longtime friends. ― There are three things I've come to expect from the Atelier series: cozy atmosphere, charming character writing, and breezy combat. The series is content to dwell within that realm, ...                    game review          6 comments       The King of Fighters XV   Feb 24, 01:00 6 comments                 games    The King of Fighters XV doesn't find the series at its prettiest, boldest, or most densely populated and varied in characters. Yet this might be the most accessible it's ever been. ― If anyone ever asks you how many The King of Fighters games there are, resist the temptation to say fifteen. That may be the number on this latest flagship entry, but this is a vast and complicated series with many, many...                    game review          25 comments       REVIEW: Pokémon Legends: Arceus   Feb 20, 01:00 25 comments                 games    While the plot left much to be desired, Pokémon Legends: Arceus brings new energy and possibilities to the franchise. ― For years, it seems the big ask of Pokémon fans has been that the franchise innovate itself in a meaningful way. Pokémon Legends: Arceus seems to be Game Freak's response to that request, and I'd go out on a limb to say that it's exactly the sort of thing we've been waiting for. It ...                    game review          21 comments       Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl   Jan 18, 01:20 21 comments                 games    As a fan, it pains me to see an entry to one of my favorite franchises fall to such low lows. But what exactly are the decisions that got us here? ― Unlike animation, video games are in large part a disposable medium. Games once hailed as era-defining breakthrough titles upon their release often become antiquated and awkward within a little less than a decade. And so we see a plethora of remakes and ...                    game review          3 comments       Clockwork Aquario   Dec 17, 04:00 3 comments                 games    The arcade game Clockwork Aquario finally arrives on modern systems after disappearing twenty-eight years ago. Is it a mere relic or a true deep-cut gem? ― Some games are delayed. Others are canceled. And then there's the unique and bizarre journey of Clockwork Aquario. Westone, creators of the Wonder Boy and Monster World games, tested this colorful side-scroller in arcades several times back in 199...                    game review          3 comments       Metallic Child   Dec 14, 01:00 3 comments                 games    Metallic Child's narrative is instantly compelling and the dialogue that accompanies its characters is entertaining to boot. ― I initially wasn't expecting much from this quietly released indie “rouge-lite” game, but found myself sad to see it go by the time I reached its ending. The greatest appeal of Metallic Child comes from the way it applies the aesthetics of the Japanese Action-RPGs without hol...                    game review          8 comments       Cupid Parasite   Dec  7, 01:00 8 comments                 games    A game with this many strengths is easy to recommend, which is why it's unfortunate that the current game is ridden with typos, ill-fitting text, and the telltale signs of a hastily edited machine translation. ― Cupid Parasite opens with some of the trashiest male love interests you could possibly imagine. One guy is exclusively interested in meeting women who are already ""taken."" Another literally c...                    game review          7 comments       Danganronpa Decadence   Nov 30, 02:00 7 comments                 games    Danganronpa Decadence offers a bit of new content, gameplay, and interactions between cast members, but this little something extra hardly feels decadent. ― Over ten years ago, the first Danganronpa game came out on the PlayStation Portable. Even back then, Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc was a standout of the visual novel genre, combining detective work and dating sim elements in a way that weirdly...                    game review          16 comments       Shin Megami Tensei V   Nov  5, 01:00 16 comments                 games    While SMT fans have no doubt chomped at the bit in anticipation of a new numbered entry arriving on consoles, some might still want to cling to the memory of Nocturne. Is this new, untested Shin Megami Tensei worth the plunge? ― Shin Megami Tensei V has one glaring problem it has to contend with: Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne HD Remaster was released just this past May. While SMT fans have no doub...                    game review          11 comments       Metroid Dread   Oct 28, 00:00 11 comments                 games    The gameplay of Dread is similarly spectacular. A lot of the DNA from Samus Returns – Mercury Steam's first Metroid project – is present here, albeit with the fat shaved off the bones. ― Before diving into the meat of this review, I feel it's important to mention that it is coming from a newcomer to the series, and that I ran some short stints into Metroid: Zero Mission and Fusion in order to lend so...                    game review          2 comments       Demon Slayer: The Hinokami Chronicles   Oct 14, 00:04 2 comments                 games    Being one of the most acclaimed anime of the past few years partially due to its stellar animation and fight scenes, a Demon Slayer fighting game felt like it was only a matter of time. ― Being one of the most acclaimed anime of the past few years partially due to its stellar animation and fight scenes, a Demon Slayer fighting game felt like it was only a matter of time.

Its aesthetically varied character designs, lewd but narratively significant fanservice (think Darling in the Franxx), and twistedly i...                    game review          3 comments       Samurai Warriors 5   Aug 12, 03:00 3 comments                 games    The most creatively bankrupt aspect of Samurai Warriors 5 is by and large its combat. ― While I've called Dynasty Warrior's gameplay recipe outdated before, the franchise has gone out of its way to prove me wrong recently, with games like Age of Calamity and Persona 5 Strikers exceeding my expectations. These games have their own unique mechanics that add some much-needed depth to Warrior's combat wh...                    game review          4 comments       Shadowverse: Champion's Battle   Aug 10, 21:00 4 comments                 games    Take on the role of Hiro Ryugasaki as you engage in card duels to save your school club! ― Coming straight from Cygames, Shadowverse: Champion's Battle is a story-based adaptation of the collectible card game app. You play as a youth who meets up with Hiro Ryugasaki, protagonist of the Shadowverse anime, and joins Tensei Academy's Shadowverse club. It seems the club is suffering from a lack of member...                    game review          10 comments       Fuga: Melodies of Steel   Aug  4, 00:00 10 comments                 games    It's a challenge to take on a brutal World War II retelling with imagery and characters cute enough to populate Maple Town, but CyberConnect2 sticks with it, and it's paid off. ― Cyberconnect2 is best known as the developer of gorgeous anime-to-game adaptations stretching from Naruto and .hack to JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. In their heart of hearts, however, company president/CEO Hiroshi Matsuyama and ...                    game review          4 comments       NEO: The World Ends With You   Jul 27, 01:00 4 comments                 games    Well, it took fourteen years, but NEO: The World Ends with You is finally here, and it's every bit as stylish, engrossing, and outright fun as its predecessor. ― When the original The World Ends with You launched all the way back in 2007 on the Nintendo DS, it won attention and praise for its unorthodox storytelling and gameplay. It used many of the features of the Nintendo DS in experimental ways an...                    game review          4 comments       Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin   Jul 25, 00:00 4 comments                 games    It's easy to say that Monster Hunter Stories 2 provided the most enjoyable gameplay experience I've had within the genre in recent years. ― The monster-collecting genre might be one of the most criminally under-represented in gaming. Aside from the Pokémon games and the steady trickle of indie projects inspired by that franchise, it's practically barren. It is my hope that Monster Hunter Stories 2 wi...                    game review          4 comments       Akiba's Trip: Hellbound & Debriefed   Jul 21, 00:00 4 comments                 games    Akiba's Trip: Hellbound and Debriefed is a cheeky romp through anime fandom mecca with plenty of fun references. But sadly, it's also just shy of the mark to make it a must-have. ― Akiba's Trip: Hellbound and Debriefed is a lot of things. It's a remaster of a 10-year-old PlayStation Portable game. It's a cheeky romp through anime fandom mecca with plenty of fun references. But sadly, it's also just s...                    game review                MARS RED Edge of the Nightmare   Jul 13, 00:00                 games    If you enjoyed the show, the story acts as a nice companion to the events of the anime, and several familiar characters from the Code Zero crew like Takeuchi, Suwa, and Kurusu all play key roles. ― Whenever a major new anime hits the scene, there's a mobile game to accompany it, like clockwork. Many of these games remain Japanese exclusives, with only a handful releasing globally. Additionally, many ...                    game review          9 comments       Death end re;Quest   Jul  6, 03:00 9 comments                 games    Death end proves me dead wrong: it demonstrates not only Idea Factory's ability to put out quality titles, but that they can also be trusted to take real creative risks and create unique games – something all too rare in today's market. ― I wasn't expecting much from Death end re;Quest when I first picked it up. It's a product of Compile Heart, which is itself a subsidiary of Idea Factory – a studio ...                    game review          5 comments       No More Heroes 1 & 2   Jun 30, 00:00 5 comments                 games    The No More Heroes franchise is first and foremost a celebration of video games. ― The No More Heroes franchise is first and foremost a celebration of video games.

Grant Jones revisits the franchise to see if the games still hold up to their legacy. ― The Ninja Gaiden Master Collection is hard to talk about in isolation.

The one that has everything we could possibly want (okay, except for Waluigi)....                    game review          26 comments       Pokémon: Let's Go!   2018 Nov 21, 02:15 26 comments                 games    Pokémon fans can explore the Kanto region like never before in this high-def remake of the classic Yellow Version, but has Generation 1 aged gracefully? Branden Johnson finds out. ― I missed the Pokemon train entirely the first time around. It's strange; I love JRPGs, and I was the perfect age when Pokemon Red and Blue hit the Gameboy in the 90s. Whatever the reasons, I haven't played a single Pokemo...                    game review          2 comments       SNK 40th Anniversary Collection   2018 Nov 16, 02:22 2 comments                 games    SNK delivers a history lesson with an anthology of early arcade and NES titles. Todd finds out how well these games have held up in this new game for the Switch. ― What made SNK a cult favorite game company? Was it the Neo Geo, which delivered arcade-perfect games at home for just two hundred dollars per cartridge? Was it the Neo Geo Pocket Color, a well-made and vastly underappreciated handheld syst...                    game review          7 comments       My Hero: One's Justice (PlayStation 4)   2018 Oct 24, 23:43 7 comments                 games    My Hero One’s Justice captures the essence of its source material, and offers a fine experience for anyone looking to cross blows as their My Hero Academia favorites. ― The anime franchise tie-in brawler is a venerable gaming institution, with Bandai Namco having published similar efforts for franchises like Naruto and Dragon Ball in the past. On the other hand, One's Justice developer Byking are rel...                    game review          2 comments       Fist of the North Star: Paradise Lost   2018 Oct 12, 00:00 2 comments                 games    The classic head-exploding action of Fist of the North Star is poured into the Yakuza gameplay mold, but do these two great tastes taste great together? Daryl Surat scours the wasteland to find out. ― The last few years have marked a surge in popularity among English-language fans of both Sega's long-running Yakuza series of videogames as well as—to a lesser extent—the formative trope-establishing Sh...                    game review          7 comments       Mega Man 11   2018 Oct  2, 23:36 7 comments                 anime    It's Mega Man's big chance for a comeback, and it's not what some fans might expect. We dig into a video-game icon's return! ― Don't let the number fool you. This may be the eleventh or twelfth central Mega Man title. It may be backed by several spin-off series. Yet it's been nearly a decade since the last full-blown game in the series. Even then, Mega Man 9 and 10 were deliberate throwbacks, built t...                    game review          4 comments       Capcom Beat 'Em Up Bundle   2018 Sep 24, 23:00 4 comments                 games    Capcom resurrects a bunch of their classic arcade brawlers with a seven-game collection. Do they still put up a fight? ― Brawlers. Beat 'Em Ups. Belt-Scrollers. Double Dragon Clones. Punk Punching Parades. Those Arcade Games That Mom And Dad Always Said Were Too Violent For You Back in 1988. Whatever you call them, they never quite got their moment on top. True, they were staples of arcades in the la...                    game review          7 comments       Import Review: My Hero One's Justice   2018 Sep 18, 23:00 7 comments                 games    My Hero Academia arrives on consoles and PC as a fully-featured arena brawler bursting with everyone's favorite heroes, but does it go PLUS ULTRA?

Branden Johnson gets lost in the world of Monster Hunter. ― I've long aspired to be the sort of person who is into Monster Hunter. It's a real “gamer” series: brutal difficulty, complex systems, a strong community. Being a fan of Dark Souls and Bloodborne, I figured I would get into Monster Hunter, if I could...                    game review          9 comments       Review: Fate/Grand Order Arcade   2018 Aug 22, 01:14 9 comments                 games    The smash hit Fate smartphone game gets an extra-fancy new arcade edition in Japan that actually prints out physical cards for you to take home - but it doesn't come cheap! Richard Eisenbeis took the plunge, here's his report. ―  The Fate franchise is massive and sprawling. There are numerous games, TV anime, movies, novels, drama CDs, and manga. But while the franchise originally became popular duri...                    game review          2 comments       Persona 3: Dancing Moon Night & Persona 5: Dancing Star Night   2018 Aug  8, 22:00 2 comments                 games    In the wake of Persona 4's successful rhythm game, its siblings are getting in on the action!

Richard Eisenbeis has the answers in our full review. ― Following in the footsteps of 2015's Persona 4: Dancing All Night, Persona 3: Dancing Moon Night and Persona 5: Dancing Star Night are a pair of rhythm/music games that showcase the awesome soundtracks of Pe...                    game review          19 comments       Valkyria Chronicles 4   2018 Aug  6, 22:00 19 comments                 anime    Whether you're a longtime fan of the series or a newcomer, Valkyria Chronicles 4 doesn't disappoint. Richard Eisenbeis delivers his full review of the newest entry in this TRPG saga. ― The Valkyria Chronicles series is a piece of historical fiction set in a world much like our own. However, instead of coal or oil, it is the mysterious mineral ragnite—which can do anything from cure wounds to power a ...                    game review          2 comments       Sushi Striker: The Way of Sushido   2018 Jul 22, 22:00 2 comments                 games    This quirky puzzle game for the Nintendo Switch and 3DS is sure to win over fans of absurd humor and fast-paced strategy. Branden Johnson elaborates. ― Nailing absurdist humor is tricky. If you wink too much at the audience, it can be eye roll-inducing, and if you aren't polished enough in your presentation, you run the risk of your audience laughing at you, not with you. But Nintendo has pulled it o...                    game review          2 comments       Review: Little Witch Academia: Chamber of Time   2018 May 23, 22:00 2 comments                 games    This dungeon-crawling action RPG boasts all the style of Studio Trigger's hit series, but not so much the substance. Todd Ciolek digs into this magical adventure. ― It's neither original nor unkind to say that Little Witch Academia stood out on appearances. The series is a charming tale of a misfit at a magical academy, a fantasy staple since well before Harry Potter, but it might not have leapt from...                    game review          3 comments       REVIEW: Sword Art Online: Fatal Bullet   2018 Mar 24, 23:49 3 comments                 games    This run-and-gun RPG for the PS4 allows SAO fans to interact with all their favorite characters in a brand-new story. But is it fun to play? Branden Johnson finds out. ― Unpopular opinion time: my least favorite arc in Sword Art Online was Gun Gale Online. Not that it was bad, just that it felt lacking compared to the two storylines that preceded it. So my expectations going into Sword Art Online: Fa...                    game review          6 comments       Ni no Kuni II:Revenant Kingdom   2018 Mar 21, 22:45 6 comments                 games    It took 8 years for a Ni no Kuni sequel to finally surface, and now that it's here, there's both good news and bad for this lavish Studio Ghibli-esque action RPG. ― Ni no Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch was a bit too traditional for me. As a lover of RPGs and the films of Hayao Miyazaki, I figured it would be right up my alley. An RPG that looks and sounds like a real Studio Ghibli film is basically a...                    game review          4 comments       GAME REVIEW: Attack on Titan 2   2018 Mar 16, 22:00 4 comments                 games    This sequel to the first action game in the franchise from KOEI-TECMO and Omega Force makes significant improvements on its predecessor, but is it worth a purchase? Heidi Kemps has the answers. ― Omega Force's record with anime and manga adaptations is a bit spotty. We've had disappointments like Fist of the North Star: Ken's Rage and Berserk and the Band of the Hawk, but we've also had some real win...                    game review          3 comments       REVIEW: Dragon Ball FighterZ   2018 Jan 29, 23:00 3 comments                 games    Dustin Bailey has the full rundown on the most hotly anticipated DBZ fighting game of all time.

Heidi breaks down how this game stacks up against its predecessors for prior fans and newcomers alike. ― For being such a long-running game franchise, the Kunio-kun series of beat-em-ups is quite a confusing mess. It's a beat-em-up series about a bunch of high school delinquents fighting for turf and showing who's the toug...                    game review          3 comments       Resident Evil Revelations Collection   2017 Nov 28, 22:00 3 comments                 games    Both RE: Revelations games have arrived in a special re-release for the Nintendo Switch, but is there anything new in this edition worth picking up?

Todd Ciolek finds out. ― Etrian Odyssey games ask a lot. They require you to pace around dungeon grids full of nasty enemies. They require you to map out levels in the tradition of the hardest RPGs of 1986. They require you to try again and again, even after a sudden and vicious encounter wipes out yo...                    game review          7 comments       Cyberdimension Neptunia: 4 Goddesses Online   2017 Oct 11, 22:15 7 comments                 games    Is this super-meta RPG worth playing for more than its jokes and fanservice? Todd Ciolek finds out. ― Neptunia is a series of inexhaustible potential. The central RPGs feature anime heroines who represent various game consoles and companies, and that makes for rampant and excusable genre parody. Put the characters in a pop-idol simulation or a strategy-RPG and you're not just cynically exploiting a m...                    game review          21 comments       Super NES Classic Edition   2017 Oct  5, 22:00 21 comments                 games    With heaps of 16-bit classics to choose from including the never-before-released Star Fox 2, the Super NES Classic is a retro gamer's dream.

But what exactly are the decisions that got us here? ― Unlike animation, video games are in large part a disposable medium. Games once hailed as era-defining breakthrough titles upon their release often become antiquated and awkward within a little less than a decade.

It's a beat-em-up series about a bunch of high school delinquents fighting for turf and showing who's the toug...                    game review          3 comments       Resident Evil Revelations Collection   2017 Nov 28, 22:00 3 comments                 games    Both RE: Revelations games have arrived in a special re-release for the Nintendo Switch, but is there anything new in this edition worth picking up? Dave Riley finds out. ― With the release of a new console, the Switch, comes the expected glut of HD ports, and Resident Evil Revelations, which has been ported to on average a console and a half per year since its original release on the 3DS in 2012, is...                    game review          10 comments       Etrian Odyssey V: Beyond the Myth   2017 Oct 21, 22:00 10 comments                 games    Does the newest entry in this difficult RPG series still hurt good enough to be worth the challenge? Todd Ciolek finds out. ― Etrian Odyssey games ask a lot. They require you to pace around dungeon grids full of nasty enemies. They require you to map out levels in the tradition of the hardest RPGs of 1986. They require you to try again and again, even after a sudden and vicious encounter wipes out yo...                    game review          7 comments       Cyberdimension Neptunia: 4 Goddesses Online   2017 Oct 11, 22:15 7 comments                 games    Is this super-meta RPG worth playing for more than its jokes and fanservice? Todd Ciolek finds out. ― Neptunia is a series of inexhaustible potential. The central RPGs feature anime heroines who represent various game consoles and companies, and that makes for rampant and excusable genre parody. Put the characters in a pop-idol simulation or a strategy-RPG and you're not just cynically exploiting a m...                    game review          21 comments       Super NES Classic Edition   2017 Oct  5, 22:00 21 comments                 games    With heaps of 16-bit classics to choose from including the never-before-released Star Fox 2, the Super NES Classic is a retro gamer's dream.

What will you do with your time in Rigbarth? ― It's a little hard to talk about the Story of Seasons games (and their Rune Factory spin-offs). Not because of the complicated legal snarl involving the Story of Seasons and Harvest Moon branding, but because on the merits that most games woul...                    game review          2 comments       Chocobo GP   Mar 18, 00:00 2 comments                 games    Chocobo GP is a big improvement and an even greater risk. It's sharper, tighter, more enjoyable...and now competing directly with the latest Mario Kart on Nintendo's home turf. ― The original Chocobo Racing was not an astounding game, but it was a cleverly-positioned one. It offered the PlayStation owners of 1999 an answer to the Nintendo 64's Mario Kart while dusting itself with Final Fantasy refere...                           game review          8 comments       Persona 4 Arena Ultimax Review   Mar 11, 01:21 8 comments                 games    Now that Persona 4 Arena Ultimax is out on modern platforms with a massive adoption rate, the question is how much is in here for a single-playing Persona? The answer is an inspiring ""Quite a bit!"" ― The rerelease of 2014's Persona 4 Arena Ultimax finds itself in an odd situation for such a thing. The fighting game scene has ballooned into an even bigger, better place in the eight years since, so put...                    game review          1 comment       Jujutsu Kaisen: Escape From the Cursed Spirit of the Abandoned School   Feb 26, 01:00 1 comment                 games    Gojo assigns you to a mission to help the first-year students investigate a creepy abandoned school. Can you and the others use your techniques -- and your smarts -- to exorcise the cursed spirit before it's too late? ― When you think of an anime world you would want to live in, Jujutsu Kaisen probably isn't at the top of your list, if it is even on the list. But it's possible you've dreamed of going...                    game review          1 comment       Atelier Sophie 2: Alchemist of the Mysterious Dream   Feb 24, 22:00 1 comment                 games    The Nintendo Switch struggles to handle this new entry in the Atelier franchise, but beyond its technical issues the world of Erde Wiege introduces players to characters that quickly come to feel like longtime friends. ― There are three things I've come to expect from the Atelier series: cozy atmosphere, charming character writing, and breezy combat.

Yet this might be the most accessible it's ever been. ― If anyone ever asks you how many The King of Fighters games there are, resist the temptation to say fifteen. That may be the number on this latest flagship entry, but this is a vast and complicated series with many, many...                    game review          25 comments       REVIEW: Pokémon Legends: Arceus   Feb 20, 01:00 25 comments                 games    While the plot left much to be desired, Pokémon Legends: Arceus brings new energy and possibilities to the franchise. ― For years, it seems the big ask of Pokémon fans has been that the franchise innovate itself in a meaningful way. Pokémon Legends: Arceus seems to be Game Freak's response to that request, and I'd go out on a limb to say that it's exactly the sort of thing we've been waiting for.

But what exactly are the decisions that got us here? ― Unlike animation, video games are in large part a disposable medium. Games once hailed as era-defining breakthrough titles upon their release often become antiquated and awkward within a little less than a decade. And so we see a plethora of remakes and ...                    game review          3 comments       Clockwork Aquario   Dec 17, 04:00 3 comments                 games    The arcade game Clockwork Aquario finally arrives on modern systems after disappearing twenty-eight years ago. Is it a mere relic or a true deep-cut gem? ― Some games are delayed. Others are canceled. And then there's the unique and bizarre journey of Clockwork Aquario. Westone, creators of the Wonder Boy and Monster World games, tested this colorful side-scroller in arcades several times back in 199...                    game review          3 comments       Metallic Child   Dec 14, 01:00 3 comments                 games    Metallic Child's narrative is instantly compelling and the dialogue that accompanies its characters is entertaining to boot. ― I initially wasn't expecting much from this quietly released indie “rouge-lite” game, but found myself sad to see it go by the time I reached its ending. The greatest appeal of Metallic Child comes from the way it applies the aesthetics of the Japanese Action-RPGs without hol...                    game review          8 comments       Cupid Parasite   Dec  7, 01:00 8 comments                 games    A game with this many strengths is easy to recommend, which is why it's unfortunate that the current game is ridden with typos, ill-fitting text, and the telltale signs of a hastily edited machine translation. ― Cupid Parasite opens with some of the trashiest male love interests you could possibly imagine. One guy is exclusively interested in meeting women who are already ""taken.""

Even back then, Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc was a standout of the visual novel genre, combining detective work and dating sim elements in a way that weirdly...                    game review          16 comments       Shin Megami Tensei V   Nov  5, 01:00 16 comments                 games    While SMT fans have no doubt chomped at the bit in anticipation of a new numbered entry arriving on consoles, some might still want to cling to the memory of Nocturne. Is this new, untested Shin Megami Tensei worth the plunge? ― Shin Megami Tensei V has one glaring problem it has to contend with: Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne HD Remaster was released just this past May. While SMT fans have no doub...                    game review          11 comments       Metroid Dread   Oct 28, 00:00 11 comments                 games    The gameplay of Dread is similarly spectacular. A lot of the DNA from Samus Returns – Mercury Steam's first Metroid project – is present here, albeit with the fat shaved off the bones. ― Before diving into the meat of this review, I feel it's important to mention that it is coming from a newcomer to the series, and that I ran some short stints into Metroid: Zero Mission and Fusion in order to lend so...                    game review          2 comments       Demon Slayer: The Hinokami Chronicles   Oct 14, 00:04 2 comments                 games    Being one of the most acclaimed anime of the past few years partially due to its stellar animation and fight scenes, a Demon Slayer fighting game felt like it was only a matter of time. ― Being one of the most acclaimed anime of the past few years partially due to its stellar animation and fight scenes, a Demon Slayer fighting game felt like it was only a matter of time.

Its aesthetically varied character designs, lewd but narratively significant fanservice (think Darling in the Franxx), and twistedly i...                    game review          3 comments       Samurai Warriors 5   Aug 12, 03:00 3 comments                 games    The most creatively bankrupt aspect of Samurai Warriors 5 is by and large its combat. ― While I've called Dynasty Warrior's gameplay recipe outdated before, the franchise has gone out of its way to prove me wrong recently, with games like Age of Calamity and Persona 5 Strikers exceeding my expectations. These games have their own unique mechanics that add some much-needed depth to Warrior's combat wh...                    game review          4 comments       Shadowverse: Champion's Battle   Aug 10, 21:00 4 comments                 games    Take on the role of Hiro Ryugasaki as you engage in card duels to save your school club! ― Coming straight from Cygames, Shadowverse: Champion's Battle is a story-based adaptation of the collectible card game app. You play as a youth who meets up with Hiro Ryugasaki, protagonist of the Shadowverse anime, and joins Tensei Academy's Shadowverse club. It seems the club is suffering from a lack of member...                    game review          10 comments       Fuga: Melodies of Steel   Aug  4, 00:00 10 comments                 games    It's a challenge to take on a brutal World War II retelling with imagery and characters cute enough to populate Maple Town, but CyberConnect2 sticks with it, and it's paid off. ― Cyberconnect2 is best known as the developer of gorgeous anime-to-game adaptations stretching from Naruto and .hack to JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. In their heart of hearts, however, company president/CEO Hiroshi Matsuyama and ...                    game review          4 comments       NEO: The World Ends With You   Jul 27, 01:00 4 comments                 games    Well, it took fourteen years, but NEO: The World Ends with You is finally here, and it's every bit as stylish, engrossing, and outright fun as its predecessor. ― When the original The World Ends with You launched all the way back in 2007 on the Nintendo DS, it won attention and praise for its unorthodox storytelling and gameplay. It used many of the features of the Nintendo DS in experimental ways an...                    game review          4 comments       Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin   Jul 25, 00:00 4 comments                 games    It's easy to say that Monster Hunter Stories 2 provided the most enjoyable gameplay experience I've had within the genre in recent years. ― The monster-collecting genre might be one of the most criminally under-represented in gaming. Aside from the Pokémon games and the steady trickle of indie projects inspired by that franchise, it's practically barren. It is my hope that Monster Hunter Stories 2 wi...                    game review          4 comments       Akiba's Trip: Hellbound & Debriefed   Jul 21, 00:00 4 comments                 games    Akiba's Trip: Hellbound and Debriefed is a cheeky romp through anime fandom mecca with plenty of fun references. But sadly, it's also just shy of the mark to make it a must-have. ― Akiba's Trip: Hellbound and Debriefed is a lot of things. It's a remaster of a 10-year-old PlayStation Portable game. It's a cheeky romp through anime fandom mecca with plenty of fun references. But sadly, it's also just s...                    game review                MARS RED Edge of the Nightmare   Jul 13, 00:00                 games    If you enjoyed the show, the story acts as a nice companion to the events of the anime, and several familiar characters from the Code Zero crew like Takeuchi, Suwa, and Kurusu all play key roles. ― Whenever a major new anime hits the scene, there's a mobile game to accompany it, like clockwork.

Sam Leach finds out if the result is fun enough to be worth a look for casual or experienced players. ― I'm hesitant to use the word “ambitious” to describe One Piece: World Seeker, because if we're comparing it to anything beyond licensed anime games, it looks like a half-baked cookie-cutter rendition of a...                    game review          1 comment       Fate/Extella Link (Switch)   2019 Mar 24, 02:00 1 comment                 games    The sequel to the Dynasty Warriors-style Fate game Fate/Extella is here, loaded with new characters and costumes - but is it a step up from the last one, or just more of the same? ― Fate/Extella Link is set in the same general continuity as the past games in the Fate/Extra series--Fate/Extra, Fate/Extra CCC, and Fate Extella.

We dig into a video-game icon's return! ― Don't let the number fool you. This may be the eleventh or twelfth central Mega Man title. It may be backed by several spin-off series. Yet it's been nearly a decade since the last full-blown game in the series. Even then, Mega Man 9 and 10 were deliberate throwbacks, built t...                    game review          4 comments       Capcom Beat 'Em Up Bundle   2018 Sep 24, 23:00 4 comments                 games    Capcom resurrects a bunch of their classic arcade brawlers with a seven-game collection.

Branden Johnson elaborates. ― Nailing absurdist humor is tricky.

But Nintendo has pulled it o...                    game review          2 comments       Review: Little Witch Academia: Chamber of Time   2018 May 23, 22:00 2 comments                 games    This dungeon-crawling action RPG boasts all the style of Studio Trigger's hit series, but not so much the substance. Todd Ciolek digs into this magical adventure. ― It's neither original nor unkind to say that Little Witch Academia stood out on appearances. The series is a charming tale of a misfit at a magical academy, a fantasy staple since well before Harry Potter, but it might not have leapt from...                    game review          3 comments       REVIEW: Sword Art Online: Fatal Bullet   2018 Mar 24, 23:49 3 comments                 games    This run-and-gun RPG for the PS4 allows SAO fans to interact with all their favorite characters in a brand-new story.

Todd Ciolek finds out. ― Etrian Odyssey games ask a lot. They require you to pace around dungeon grids full of nasty enemies. They require you to map out levels in the tradition of the hardest RPGs of 1986. They require you to try again and again, even after a sudden and vicious encounter wipes out yo...                    game review          7 comments       Cyberdimension Neptunia: 4 Goddesses Online   2017 Oct 11, 22:15 7 comments                 games    Is this super-meta RPG worth playing for more than its jokes and fanservice? Todd Ciolek finds out. ― Neptunia is a series of inexhaustible potential. The central RPGs feature anime heroines who represent various game consoles and companies, and that makes for rampant and excusable genre parody. Put the characters in a pop-idol simulation or a strategy-RPG and you're not just cynically exploiting a m...                    game review          21 comments       Super NES Classic Edition   2017 Oct  5, 22:00 21 comments                 games    With heaps of 16-bit classics to choose from including the never-before-released Star Fox 2, the Super NES Classic is a retro gamer's dream.

Not because of the complicated legal snarl involving the Story of Seasons and Harvest Moon branding, but because on the merits that most games woul...                    game review          2 comments       Chocobo GP   Mar 18, 00:00 2 comments                 games    Chocobo GP is a big improvement and an even greater risk. It's sharper, tighter, more enjoyable...and now competing directly with the latest Mario Kart on Nintendo's home turf. ― The original Chocobo Racing was not an astounding game, but it was a cleverly-positioned one. It offered the PlayStation owners of 1999 an answer to the Nintendo 64's Mario Kart while dusting itself with Final Fantasy refere...                           game review          8 comments       Persona 4 Arena Ultimax Review   Mar 11, 01:21 8 comments                 games    Now that Persona 4 Arena Ultimax is out on modern platforms with a massive adoption rate, the question is how much is in here for a single-playing Persona? The answer is an inspiring ""Quite a bit!"" ― The rerelease of 2014's Persona 4 Arena Ultimax finds itself in an odd situation for such a thing. The fighting game scene has ballooned into an even bigger, better place in the eight years since, so put...                    game review          1 comment       Jujutsu Kaisen: Escape From the Cursed Spirit of the Abandoned School   Feb 26, 01:00 1 comment                 games    Gojo assigns you to a mission to help the first-year students investigate a creepy abandoned school. Can you and the others use your techniques -- and your smarts -- to exorcise the cursed spirit before it's too late? ― When you think of an anime world you would want to live in, Jujutsu Kaisen probably isn't at the top of your list, if it is even on the list. But it's possible you've dreamed of going...                    game review          1 comment       Atelier Sophie 2: Alchemist of the Mysterious Dream   Feb 24, 22:00 1 comment                 games    The Nintendo Switch struggles to handle this new entry in the Atelier franchise, but beyond its technical issues the world of Erde Wiege introduces players to characters that quickly come to feel like longtime friends. ― There are three things I've come to expect from the Atelier series: cozy atmosphere, charming character writing, and breezy combat. The series is content to dwell within that realm, ...                    game review          6 comments       The King of Fighters XV   Feb 24, 01:00 6 comments                 games    The King of Fighters XV doesn't find the series at its prettiest, boldest, or most densely populated and varied in characters. Yet this might be the most accessible it's ever been. ― If anyone ever asks you how many The King of Fighters games there are, resist the temptation to say fifteen. That may be the number on this latest flagship entry, but this is a vast and complicated series with many, many...                    game review          25 comments       REVIEW: Pokémon Legends: Arceus   Feb 20, 01:00 25 comments                 games    While the plot left much to be desired, Pokémon Legends: Arceus brings new energy and possibilities to the franchise. ― For years, it seems the big ask of Pokémon fans has been that the franchise innovate itself in a meaningful way. Pokémon Legends: Arceus seems to be Game Freak's response to that request, and I'd go out on a limb to say that it's exactly the sort of thing we've been waiting for. It ...                    game review          21 comments       Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl   Jan 18, 01:20 21 comments                 games    As a fan, it pains me to see an entry to one of my favorite franchises fall to such low lows. But what exactly are the decisions that got us here? ― Unlike animation, video games are in large part a disposable medium. Games once hailed as era-defining breakthrough titles upon their release often become antiquated and awkward within a little less than a decade. And so we see a plethora of remakes and ...                    game review          3 comments       Clockwork Aquario   Dec 17, 04:00 3 comments                 games    The arcade game Clockwork Aquario finally arrives on modern systems after disappearing twenty-eight years ago. Is it a mere relic or a true deep-cut gem? ― Some games are delayed. Others are canceled. And then there's the unique and bizarre journey of Clockwork Aquario. Westone, creators of the Wonder Boy and Monster World games, tested this colorful side-scroller in arcades several times back in 199...                    game review          3 comments       Metallic Child   Dec 14, 01:00 3 comments                 games    Metallic Child's narrative is instantly compelling and the dialogue that accompanies its characters is entertaining to boot. ― I initially wasn't expecting much from this quietly released indie “rouge-lite” game, but found myself sad to see it go by the time I reached its ending. The greatest appeal of Metallic Child comes from the way it applies the aesthetics of the Japanese Action-RPGs without hol...                    game review          8 comments       Cupid Parasite   Dec  7, 01:00 8 comments                 games    A game with this many strengths is easy to recommend, which is why it's unfortunate that the current game is ridden with typos, ill-fitting text, and the telltale signs of a hastily edited machine translation. ― Cupid Parasite opens with some of the trashiest male love interests you could possibly imagine. One guy is exclusively interested in meeting women who are already ""taken."" Another literally c...                    game review          7 comments       Danganronpa Decadence   Nov 30, 02:00 7 comments                 games    Danganronpa Decadence offers a bit of new content, gameplay, and interactions between cast members, but this little something extra hardly feels decadent. ― Over ten years ago, the first Danganronpa game came out on the PlayStation Portable. Even back then, Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc was a standout of the visual novel genre, combining detective work and dating sim elements in a way that weirdly...                    game review          16 comments       Shin Megami Tensei V   Nov  5, 01:00 16 comments                 games    While SMT fans have no doubt chomped at the bit in anticipation of a new numbered entry arriving on consoles, some might still want to cling to the memory of Nocturne. Is this new, untested Shin Megami Tensei worth the plunge? ― Shin Megami Tensei V has one glaring problem it has to contend with: Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne HD Remaster was released just this past May. While SMT fans have no doub...                    game review          11 comments       Metroid Dread   Oct 28, 00:00 11 comments                 games    The gameplay of Dread is similarly spectacular. A lot of the DNA from Samus Returns – Mercury Steam's first Metroid project – is present here, albeit with the fat shaved off the bones. ― Before diving into the meat of this review, I feel it's important to mention that it is coming from a newcomer to the series, and that I ran some short stints into Metroid: Zero Mission and Fusion in order to lend so...                    game review          2 comments       Demon Slayer: The Hinokami Chronicles   Oct 14, 00:04 2 comments                 games    Being one of the most acclaimed anime of the past few years partially due to its stellar animation and fight scenes, a Demon Slayer fighting game felt like it was only a matter of time. ― Being one of the most acclaimed anime of the past few years partially due to its stellar animation and fight scenes, a Demon Slayer fighting game felt like it was only a matter of time.

Its aesthetically varied character designs, lewd but narratively significant fanservice (think Darling in the Franxx), and twistedly i...                    game review          3 comments       Samurai Warriors 5   Aug 12, 03:00 3 comments                 games    The most creatively bankrupt aspect of Samurai Warriors 5 is by and large its combat. ― While I've called Dynasty Warrior's gameplay recipe outdated before, the franchise has gone out of its way to prove me wrong recently, with games like Age of Calamity and Persona 5 Strikers exceeding my expectations. These games have their own unique mechanics that add some much-needed depth to Warrior's combat wh...                    game review          4 comments       Shadowverse: Champion's Battle   Aug 10, 21:00 4 comments                 games    Take on the role of Hiro Ryugasaki as you engage in card duels to save your school club! ― Coming straight from Cygames, Shadowverse: Champion's Battle is a story-based adaptation of the collectible card game app. You play as a youth who meets up with Hiro Ryugasaki, protagonist of the Shadowverse anime, and joins Tensei Academy's Shadowverse club. It seems the club is suffering from a lack of member...                    game review          10 comments       Fuga: Melodies of Steel   Aug  4, 00:00 10 comments                 games    It's a challenge to take on a brutal World War II retelling with imagery and characters cute enough to populate Maple Town, but CyberConnect2 sticks with it, and it's paid off. ― Cyberconnect2 is best known as the developer of gorgeous anime-to-game adaptations stretching from Naruto and .hack to JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. In their heart of hearts, however, company president/CEO Hiroshi Matsuyama and ...                    game review          4 comments       NEO: The World Ends With You   Jul 27, 01:00 4 comments                 games    Well, it took fourteen years, but NEO: The World Ends with You is finally here, and it's every bit as stylish, engrossing, and outright fun as its predecessor. ― When the original The World Ends with You launched all the way back in 2007 on the Nintendo DS, it won attention and praise for its unorthodox storytelling and gameplay. It used many of the features of the Nintendo DS in experimental ways an...                    game review          4 comments       Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin   Jul 25, 00:00 4 comments                 games    It's easy to say that Monster Hunter Stories 2 provided the most enjoyable gameplay experience I've had within the genre in recent years. ― The monster-collecting genre might be one of the most criminally under-represented in gaming. Aside from the Pokémon games and the steady trickle of indie projects inspired by that franchise, it's practically barren. It is my hope that Monster Hunter Stories 2 wi...                    game review          4 comments       Akiba's Trip: Hellbound & Debriefed   Jul 21, 00:00 4 comments                 games    Akiba's Trip: Hellbound and Debriefed is a cheeky romp through anime fandom mecca with plenty of fun references. But sadly, it's also just shy of the mark to make it a must-have. ― Akiba's Trip: Hellbound and Debriefed is a lot of things. It's a remaster of a 10-year-old PlayStation Portable game. It's a cheeky romp through anime fandom mecca with plenty of fun references. But sadly, it's also just s...                    game review                MARS RED Edge of the Nightmare   Jul 13, 00:00                 games    If you enjoyed the show, the story acts as a nice companion to the events of the anime, and several familiar characters from the Code Zero crew like Takeuchi, Suwa, and Kurusu all play key roles. ― Whenever a major new anime hits the scene, there's a mobile game to accompany it, like clockwork. Many of these games remain Japanese exclusives, with only a handful releasing globally. Additionally, many ...                    game review          9 comments       Death end re;Quest   Jul  6, 03:00 9 comments                 games    Death end proves me dead wrong: it demonstrates not only Idea Factory's ability to put out quality titles, but that they can also be trusted to take real creative risks and create unique games – something all too rare in today's market. ― I wasn't expecting much from Death end re;Quest when I first picked it up. It's a product of Compile Heart, which is itself a subsidiary of Idea Factory – a studio ...                    game review          5 comments       No More Heroes 1 & 2   Jun 30, 00:00 5 comments                 games    The No More Heroes franchise is first and foremost a celebration of video games. ― The No More Heroes franchise is first and foremost a celebration of video games.

Grant Jones revisits the franchise to see if the games still hold up to their legacy. ― The Ninja Gaiden Master Collection is hard to talk about in isolation. In many ways, you need a dramatic, long-winded cut scene to get the context for the release. So if you'll indulge me, I'll try to spin the tale as bes...                    game review          15 comments       Capcom Arcade Stadium   Jun  7, 00:00 15 comments                 games    Video game archives and collections of this nature are all about making sure these newer generations of gamers get a chance to experience those which laid the groundwork for the stuff that we have today in an easy-to-digest package. ― Judging collections like this is always a bit tricky because we're not reviewing a brand new game made specifically for the current generation; rather, we're technicall...                    game review          1 comment       Famicom Detective Club: The Two-Case Collection   Jun  5, 00:00 1 comment                 games    Both stories have some arbitrary info blocks like this, but even with my sus sense tingling, neither case went exactly where I expected it to go. ― This visual novel double-pack was released for English-speaking audiences for the first time on May 14, offering a shiny remake of Satoru Okada and Yoshio Sakamoto's adventure games for Nintendo.

If you've played many of the Yakuza titles and are interested in seeing how it all comes together, I can't recommend this game enough. ― Most Japanese RPGs are wildly fantastical and cartoonish in their setting, but attempt to stay grounded through relatable character writing and conflict.

Despite its missteps, this game managed to capture a spark of inspiration that kept me interested the entire time. ― Atelier Ryza 2 is somehow both one of the most belligerently boring and uniquely compelling games that I have ever played.

We've had disappointments like Fist of the North Star: Ken's Rage and Berserk and the Band of the Hawk, but we've also had some real win...                    game review          3 comments       REVIEW: Dragon Ball FighterZ   2018 Jan 29, 23:00 3 comments                 games    Dustin Bailey has the full rundown on the most hotly anticipated DBZ fighting game of all time. Find out if FighterZ lives up to all the hype! ― Dragon Ball FighterZ isn't just a good game for fans of Dragon Ball—it's a great game period, a best-in-class fighter that looks great and is fun to play at any level. That it's crafted with loving reverence to one of the most popular anime on the planet is ...                    game review          4 comments       River City: Rival Showdown   2017 Dec 20, 23:03 4 comments                 games    The open-world gameplay of this breezy beat-em-up returns on the Nintendo 3DS. Heidi breaks down how this game stacks up against its predecessors for prior fans and newcomers alike. ― For being such a long-running game franchise, the Kunio-kun series of beat-em-ups is quite a confusing mess. It's a beat-em-up series about a bunch of high school delinquents fighting for turf and showing who's the toug...                    game review          3 comments       Resident Evil Revelations Collection   2017 Nov 28, 22:00 3 comments                 games    Both RE: Revelations games have arrived in a special re-release for the Nintendo Switch, but is there anything new in this edition worth picking up?

Todd Ciolek finds out. ― Etrian Odyssey games ask a lot. They require you to pace around dungeon grids full of nasty enemies. They require you to map out levels in the tradition of the hardest RPGs of 1986. They require you to try again and again, even after a sudden and vicious encounter wipes out yo...                    game review          7 comments       Cyberdimension Neptunia: 4 Goddesses Online   2017 Oct 11, 22:15 7 comments                 games    Is this super-meta RPG worth playing for more than its jokes and fanservice? Todd Ciolek finds out. ― Neptunia is a series of inexhaustible potential. The central RPGs feature anime heroines who represent various game consoles and companies, and that makes for rampant and excusable genre parody. Put the characters in a pop-idol simulation or a strategy-RPG and you're not just cynically exploiting a m...                    game review          21 comments       Super NES Classic Edition   2017 Oct  5, 22:00 21 comments                 games    With heaps of 16-bit classics to choose from including the never-before-released Star Fox 2, the Super NES Classic is a retro gamer's dream.

What will you do with your time in Rigbarth? ― It's a little hard to talk about the Story of Seasons games (and their Rune Factory spin-offs). Not because of the complicated legal snarl involving the Story of Seasons and Harvest Moon branding, but because on the merits that most games woul...                    game review          2 comments       Chocobo GP   Mar 18, 00:00 2 comments                 games    Chocobo GP is a big improvement and an even greater risk. It's sharper, tighter, more enjoyable...and now competing directly with the latest Mario Kart on Nintendo's home turf. ― The original Chocobo Racing was not an astounding game, but it was a cleverly-positioned one. It offered the PlayStation owners of 1999 an answer to the Nintendo 64's Mario Kart while dusting itself with Final Fantasy refere...                           game review          8 comments       Persona 4 Arena Ultimax Review   Mar 11, 01:21 8 comments                 games    Now that Persona 4 Arena Ultimax is out on modern platforms with a massive adoption rate, the question is how much is in here for a single-playing Persona? The answer is an inspiring ""Quite a bit!"" ― The rerelease of 2014's Persona 4 Arena Ultimax finds itself in an odd situation for such a thing. The fighting game scene has ballooned into an even bigger, better place in the eight years since, so put...                    game review          1 comment       Jujutsu Kaisen: Escape From the Cursed Spirit of the Abandoned School   Feb 26, 01:00 1 comment                 games    Gojo assigns you to a mission to help the first-year students investigate a creepy abandoned school. Can you and the others use your techniques -- and your smarts -- to exorcise the cursed spirit before it's too late? ― When you think of an anime world you would want to live in, Jujutsu Kaisen probably isn't at the top of your list, if it is even on the list. But it's possible you've dreamed of going...                    game review          1 comment       Atelier Sophie 2: Alchemist of the Mysterious Dream   Feb 24, 22:00 1 comment                 games    The Nintendo Switch struggles to handle this new entry in the Atelier franchise, but beyond its technical issues the world of Erde Wiege introduces players to characters that quickly come to feel like longtime friends. ― There are three things I've come to expect from the Atelier series: cozy atmosphere, charming character writing, and breezy combat.

That may be the number on this latest flagship entry, but this is a vast and complicated series with many, many...                    game review          25 comments       REVIEW: Pokémon Legends: Arceus   Feb 20, 01:00 25 comments                 games    While the plot left much to be desired, Pokémon Legends: Arceus brings new energy and possibilities to the franchise. ― For years, it seems the big ask of Pokémon fans has been that the franchise innovate itself in a meaningful way. Pokémon Legends: Arceus seems to be Game Freak's response to that request, and I'd go out on a limb to say that it's exactly the sort of thing we've been waiting for.

But what exactly are the decisions that got us here? ― Unlike animation, video games are in large part a disposable medium. Games once hailed as era-defining breakthrough titles upon their release often become antiquated and awkward within a little less than a decade. And so we see a plethora of remakes and ...                    game review          3 comments       Clockwork Aquario   Dec 17, 04:00 3 comments                 games    The arcade game Clockwork Aquario finally arrives on modern systems after disappearing twenty-eight years ago. Is it a mere relic or a true deep-cut gem? ― Some games are delayed. Others are canceled. And then there's the unique and bizarre journey of Clockwork Aquario. Westone, creators of the Wonder Boy and Monster World games, tested this colorful side-scroller in arcades several times back in 199...                    game review          3 comments       Metallic Child   Dec 14, 01:00 3 comments                 games    Metallic Child's narrative is instantly compelling and the dialogue that accompanies its characters is entertaining to boot. ― I initially wasn't expecting much from this quietly released indie “rouge-lite” game, but found myself sad to see it go by the time I reached its ending. The greatest appeal of Metallic Child comes from the way it applies the aesthetics of the Japanese Action-RPGs without hol...                    game review          8 comments       Cupid Parasite   Dec  7, 01:00 8 comments                 games    A game with this many strengths is easy to recommend, which is why it's unfortunate that the current game is ridden with typos, ill-fitting text, and the telltale signs of a hastily edited machine translation. ― Cupid Parasite opens with some of the trashiest male love interests you could possibly imagine. One guy is exclusively interested in meeting women who are already ""taken.""

Even back then, Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc was a standout of the visual novel genre, combining detective work and dating sim elements in a way that weirdly...                    game review          16 comments       Shin Megami Tensei V   Nov  5, 01:00 16 comments                 games    While SMT fans have no doubt chomped at the bit in anticipation of a new numbered entry arriving on consoles, some might still want to cling to the memory of Nocturne. Is this new, untested Shin Megami Tensei worth the plunge? ― Shin Megami Tensei V has one glaring problem it has to contend with: Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne HD Remaster was released just this past May. While SMT fans have no doub...                    game review          11 comments       Metroid Dread   Oct 28, 00:00 11 comments                 games    The gameplay of Dread is similarly spectacular. A lot of the DNA from Samus Returns – Mercury Steam's first Metroid project – is present here, albeit with the fat shaved off the bones. ― Before diving into the meat of this review, I feel it's important to mention that it is coming from a newcomer to the series, and that I ran some short stints into Metroid: Zero Mission and Fusion in order to lend so...                    game review          2 comments       Demon Slayer: The Hinokami Chronicles   Oct 14, 00:04 2 comments                 games    Being one of the most acclaimed anime of the past few years partially due to its stellar animation and fight scenes, a Demon Slayer fighting game felt like it was only a matter of time. ― Being one of the most acclaimed anime of the past few years partially due to its stellar animation and fight scenes, a Demon Slayer fighting game felt like it was only a matter of time.

Its aesthetically varied character designs, lewd but narratively significant fanservice (think Darling in the Franxx), and twistedly i...                    game review          3 comments       Samurai Warriors 5   Aug 12, 03:00 3 comments                 games    The most creatively bankrupt aspect of Samurai Warriors 5 is by and large its combat. ― While I've called Dynasty Warrior's gameplay recipe outdated before, the franchise has gone out of its way to prove me wrong recently, with games like Age of Calamity and Persona 5 Strikers exceeding my expectations. These games have their own unique mechanics that add some much-needed depth to Warrior's combat wh...                    game review          4 comments       Shadowverse: Champion's Battle   Aug 10, 21:00 4 comments                 games    Take on the role of Hiro Ryugasaki as you engage in card duels to save your school club! ― Coming straight from Cygames, Shadowverse: Champion's Battle is a story-based adaptation of the collectible card game app. You play as a youth who meets up with Hiro Ryugasaki, protagonist of the Shadowverse anime, and joins Tensei Academy's Shadowverse club.

In their heart of hearts, however, company president/CEO Hiroshi Matsuyama and ...                    game review          4 comments       NEO: The World Ends With You   Jul 27, 01:00 4 comments                 games    Well, it took fourteen years, but NEO: The World Ends with You is finally here, and it's every bit as stylish, engrossing, and outright fun as its predecessor. ― When the original The World Ends with You launched all the way back in 2007 on the Nintendo DS, it won attention and praise for its unorthodox storytelling and gameplay. It used many of the features of the Nintendo DS in experimental ways an...                    game review          4 comments       Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin   Jul 25, 00:00 4 comments                 games    It's easy to say that Monster Hunter Stories 2 provided the most enjoyable gameplay experience I've had within the genre in recent years. ― The monster-collecting genre might be one of the most criminally under-represented in gaming. Aside from the Pokémon games and the steady trickle of indie projects inspired by that franchise, it's practically barren. It is my hope that Monster Hunter Stories 2 wi...                    game review          4 comments       Akiba's Trip: Hellbound & Debriefed   Jul 21, 00:00 4 comments                 games    Akiba's Trip: Hellbound and Debriefed is a cheeky romp through anime fandom mecca with plenty of fun references.

Grant Jones revisits the franchise to see if the games still hold up to their legacy. ― The Ninja Gaiden Master Collection is hard to talk about in isolation.

Branden Johnson gets lost in the world of Monster Hunter. ― I've long aspired to be the sort of person who is into Monster Hunter.

Richard Eisenbeis took the plunge, here's his report. ―  The Fate franchise is massive and sprawling. There are numerous games, TV anime, movies, novels, drama CDs, and manga. But while the franchise originally became popular duri...                    game review          2 comments       Persona 3: Dancing Moon Night & Persona 5: Dancing Star Night   2018 Aug  8, 22:00 2 comments                 games    In the wake of Persona 4's successful rhythm game, its siblings are getting in on the action!

Richard Eisenbeis delivers his full review of the newest entry in this TRPG saga. ― The Valkyria Chronicles series is a piece of historical fiction set in a world much like our own.

Branden Johnson elaborates. ― Nailing absurdist humor is tricky. If you wink too much at the audience, it can be eye roll-inducing, and if you aren't polished enough in your presentation, you run the risk of your audience laughing at you, not with you. But Nintendo has pulled it o...                    game review          2 comments       Review: Little Witch Academia: Chamber of Time   2018 May 23, 22:00 2 comments                 games    This dungeon-crawling action RPG boasts all the style of Studio Trigger's hit series, but not so much the substance. Todd Ciolek digs into this magical adventure. ― It's neither original nor unkind to say that Little Witch Academia stood out on appearances. The series is a charming tale of a misfit at a magical academy, a fantasy staple since well before Harry Potter, but it might not have leapt from...                    game review          3 comments       REVIEW: Sword Art Online: Fatal Bullet   2018 Mar 24, 23:49 3 comments                 games    This run-and-gun RPG for the PS4 allows SAO fans to interact with all their favorite characters in a brand-new story.

As a lover of RPGs and the films of Hayao Miyazaki, I figured it would be right up my alley. An RPG that looks and sounds like a real Studio Ghibli film is basically a...                    game review          4 comments       GAME REVIEW: Attack on Titan 2   2018 Mar 16, 22:00 4 comments                 games    This sequel to the first action game in the franchise from KOEI-TECMO and Omega Force makes significant improvements on its predecessor, but is it worth a purchase?

Heidi breaks down how this game stacks up against its predecessors for prior fans and newcomers alike. ― For being such a long-running game franchise, the Kunio-kun series of beat-em-ups is quite a confusing mess. It's a beat-em-up series about a bunch of high school delinquents fighting for turf and showing who's the toug...                    game review          3 comments       Resident Evil Revelations Collection   2017 Nov 28, 22:00 3 comments                 games    Both RE: Revelations games have arrived in a special re-release for the Nintendo Switch, but is there anything new in this edition worth picking up?

Todd Ciolek finds out. ― Etrian Odyssey games ask a lot. They require you to pace around dungeon grids full of nasty enemies. They require you to map out levels in the tradition of the hardest RPGs of 1986. They require you to try again and again, even after a sudden and vicious encounter wipes out yo...                    game review          7 comments       Cyberdimension Neptunia: 4 Goddesses Online   2017 Oct 11, 22:15 7 comments                 games    Is this super-meta RPG worth playing for more than its jokes and fanservice? Todd Ciolek finds out. ― Neptunia is a series of inexhaustible potential. The central RPGs feature anime heroines who represent various game consoles and companies, and that makes for rampant and excusable genre parody. Put the characters in a pop-idol simulation or a strategy-RPG and you're not just cynically exploiting a m...                    game review          21 comments       Super NES Classic Edition   2017 Oct  5, 22:00 21 comments                 games    With heaps of 16-bit classics to choose from including the never-before-released Star Fox 2, the Super NES Classic is a retro gamer's dream.

What will you do with your time in Rigbarth? ― It's a little hard to talk about the Story of Seasons games (and their Rune Factory spin-offs).

But what exactly are the decisions that got us here? ― Unlike animation, video games are in large part a disposable medium.

Dave Riley finds out how this classic has held up over ten years later. ― It took ten years, and one legendarily dismissive tweet, but we finally got it.

Branden Johnson finds out if this edition really lives up to all the hype. ― The level of excitement in the Smash Bros. fan community has probably never been higher. For all intents and purposes, this is the game. The one that has everything we could possibly want (okay, except for Waluigi)....                    game review          26 comments       Pokémon: Let's Go!   2018 Nov 21, 02:15 26 comments                 games    Pokémon fans can explore the Kanto region like never before in this high-def remake of the classic Yellow Version, but has Generation 1 aged gracefully? Branden Johnson finds out. ― I missed the Pokemon train entirely the first time around. It's strange; I love JRPGs, and I was the perfect age when Pokemon Red and Blue hit the Gameboy in the 90s. Whatever the reasons, I haven't played a single Pokemo...                    game review          2 comments       SNK 40th Anniversary Collection   2018 Nov 16, 02:22 2 comments                 games    SNK delivers a history lesson with an anthology of early arcade and NES titles.

We dig into a video-game icon's return! ― Don't let the number fool you. This may be the eleventh or twelfth central Mega Man title. It may be backed by several spin-off series. Yet it's been nearly a decade since the last full-blown game in the series. Even then, Mega Man 9 and 10 were deliberate throwbacks, built t...                    game review          4 comments       Capcom Beat 'Em Up Bundle   2018 Sep 24, 23:00 4 comments                 games    Capcom resurrects a bunch of their classic arcade brawlers with a seven-game collection.

Branden Johnson gets lost in the world of Monster Hunter. ― I've long aspired to be the sort of person who is into Monster Hunter.

Richard Eisenbeis delivers his full review of the newest entry in this TRPG saga. ― The Valkyria Chronicles series is a piece of historical fiction set in a world much like our own.

Branden Johnson elaborates. ― Nailing absurdist humor is tricky. If you wink too much at the audience, it can be eye roll-inducing, and if you aren't polished enough in your presentation, you run the risk of your audience laughing at you, not with you. But Nintendo has pulled it o...                    game review          2 comments       Review: Little Witch Academia: Chamber of Time   2018 May 23, 22:00 2 comments                 games    This dungeon-crawling action RPG boasts all the style of Studio Trigger's hit series, but not so much the substance. Todd Ciolek digs into this magical adventure. ― It's neither original nor unkind to say that Little Witch Academia stood out on appearances. The series is a charming tale of a misfit at a magical academy, a fantasy staple since well before Harry Potter, but it might not have leapt from...                    game review          3 comments       REVIEW: Sword Art Online: Fatal Bullet   2018 Mar 24, 23:49 3 comments                 games    This run-and-gun RPG for the PS4 allows SAO fans to interact with all their favorite characters in a brand-new story. But is it fun to play? Branden Johnson finds out. ― Unpopular opinion time: my least favorite arc in Sword Art Online was Gun Gale Online.

As a lover of RPGs and the films of Hayao Miyazaki, I figured it would be right up my alley. An RPG that looks and sounds like a real Studio Ghibli film is basically a...                    game review          4 comments       GAME REVIEW: Attack on Titan 2   2018 Mar 16, 22:00 4 comments                 games    This sequel to the first action game in the franchise from KOEI-TECMO and Omega Force makes significant improvements on its predecessor, but is it worth a purchase?

Heidi breaks down how this game stacks up against its predecessors for prior fans and newcomers alike. ― For being such a long-running game franchise, the Kunio-kun series of beat-em-ups is quite a confusing mess. It's a beat-em-up series about a bunch of high school delinquents fighting for turf and showing who's the toug...                    game review          3 comments       Resident Evil Revelations Collection   2017 Nov 28, 22:00 3 comments                 games    Both RE: Revelations games have arrived in a special re-release for the Nintendo Switch, but is there anything new in this edition worth picking up?

Todd Ciolek finds out. ― Etrian Odyssey games ask a lot. They require you to pace around dungeon grids full of nasty enemies. They require you to map out levels in the tradition of the hardest RPGs of 1986. They require you to try again and again, even after a sudden and vicious encounter wipes out yo...                    game review          7 comments       Cyberdimension Neptunia: 4 Goddesses Online   2017 Oct 11, 22:15 7 comments                 games    Is this super-meta RPG worth playing for more than its jokes and fanservice? Todd Ciolek finds out. ― Neptunia is a series of inexhaustible potential. The central RPGs feature anime heroines who represent various game consoles and companies, and that makes for rampant and excusable genre parody. Put the characters in a pop-idol simulation or a strategy-RPG and you're not just cynically exploiting a m...                    game review          21 comments       Super NES Classic Edition   2017 Oct  5, 22:00 21 comments                 games    With heaps of 16-bit classics to choose from including the never-before-released Star Fox 2, the Super NES Classic is a retro gamer's dream.

What will you do with your time in Rigbarth? ― It's a little hard to talk about the Story of Seasons games (and their Rune Factory spin-offs).

It's sharper, tighter, more enjoyable...and now competing directly with the latest Mario Kart on Nintendo's home turf. ― The original Chocobo Racing was not an astounding game, but it was a cleverly-positioned one. It offered the PlayStation owners of 1999 an answer to the Nintendo 64's Mario Kart while dusting itself with Final Fantasy refere...                           game review          8 comments       Persona 4 Arena Ultimax Review   Mar 11, 01:21 8 comments                 games    Now that Persona 4 Arena Ultimax is out on modern platforms with a massive adoption rate, the question is how much is in here for a single-playing Persona? The answer is an inspiring ""Quite a bit!"" ― The rerelease of 2014's Persona 4 Arena Ultimax finds itself in an odd situation for such a thing. The fighting game scene has ballooned into an even bigger, better place in the eight years since, so put...                    game review          1 comment       Jujutsu Kaisen: Escape From the Cursed Spirit of the Abandoned School   Feb 26, 01:00 1 comment                 games    Gojo assigns you to a mission to help the first-year students investigate a creepy abandoned school. Can you and the others use your techniques -- and your smarts -- to exorcise the cursed spirit before it's too late? ― When you think of an anime world you would want to live in, Jujutsu Kaisen probably isn't at the top of your list, if it is even on the list. But it's possible you've dreamed of going...                    game review          1 comment       Atelier Sophie 2: Alchemist of the Mysterious Dream   Feb 24, 22:00 1 comment                 games    The Nintendo Switch struggles to handle this new entry in the Atelier franchise, but beyond its technical issues the world of Erde Wiege introduces players to characters that quickly come to feel like longtime friends. ― There are three things I've come to expect from the Atelier series: cozy atmosphere, charming character writing, and breezy combat.

That may be the number on this latest flagship entry, but this is a vast and complicated series with many, many...                    game review          25 comments       REVIEW: Pokémon Legends: Arceus   Feb 20, 01:00 25 comments                 games    While the plot left much to be desired, Pokémon Legends: Arceus brings new energy and possibilities to the franchise. ― For years, it seems the big ask of Pokémon fans has been that the franchise innovate itself in a meaningful way. Pokémon Legends: Arceus seems to be Game Freak's response to that request, and I'd go out on a limb to say that it's exactly the sort of thing we've been waiting for.

But what exactly are the decisions that got us here? ― Unlike animation, video games are in large part a disposable medium.

Todd Ciolek finds out. ― Etrian Odyssey games ask a lot. They require you to pace around dungeon grids full of nasty enemies. They require you to map out levels in the tradition of the hardest RPGs of 1986. They require you to try again and again, even after a sudden and vicious encounter wipes out yo...                    game review          7 comments       Cyberdimension Neptunia: 4 Goddesses Online   2017 Oct 11, 22:15 7 comments                 games    Is this super-meta RPG worth playing for more than its jokes and fanservice? Todd Ciolek finds out. ― Neptunia is a series of inexhaustible potential. The central RPGs feature anime heroines who represent various game consoles and companies, and that makes for rampant and excusable genre parody. Put the characters in a pop-idol simulation or a strategy-RPG and you're not just cynically exploiting a m...                    game review          21 comments       Super NES Classic Edition   2017 Oct  5, 22:00 21 comments                 games    With heaps of 16-bit classics to choose from including the never-before-released Star Fox 2, the Super NES Classic is a retro gamer's dream.
