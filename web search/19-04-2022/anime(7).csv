Co-author Shaenon Garrity counts down her favorite manga from the column. ―  Shaenon's Ten Favorite 'House' Manga It falls upon my bowed shoulders to announce the news: House of 1,000 Manga is ending. After five years of weekly columns, the time has come to move on. Among other things, we're kind of running out of...                           column          26 comments       House of 1000 Manga - Kekkaishi   2015 Jun 18, 22:15 26 comments                 manga    Jason exorcises some demons with the teenage spirit-banishing crew of Kekkaishi, a 35-volume action adventure hit. ―  Kekkaishi Manga years are like dog years; a popular shonen or shojo manga lives for 10 or so years, it has a rich, full life (or not), and after it's gone you remember it fondly.

House of 1000 Manga is due in four hours, and I've read everything in the house. Drinking coffee is just making me more nervous and jittery, and making me think, when will someone translate a coffee-themed manga?

Best known in the U.S. for Tekkon Kinkreet (also published as Black and White), a sci-f...                    column          20 comments       House of 1000 Manga - Inuyashiki   2015 May 22, 00:00 20 comments                 manga    An old man becomes a cybernetic killing machine courtesy of the author of Gantz.

Don’t they have families to be with?” I almost read a YA shojo manga for this week, but instead, somehow, I'm ...                    column          8 comments       House of 1000 Manga - The Earl and the Fairy   2015 May 15, 00:00 8 comments                 manga    A plucky redheaded fairy expert gets more than she bargained for, along with a magical boyfriend. Shaenon investigates. ―  The Earl and the Fairy I admit it: I feel like I'm behind on the shojo manga these days. The most popular shonen series make enough noise in fandom that even an old Dirty Pair-reading fart like myself knows more or less what's up, and anyway right now it's mostly Attack on Titan ...                    column          10 comments       House of 1000 Manga - Poverty, Princesses and Zombies   2015 May  8, 00:00 10 comments                 manga    Jason checks out three prose novels about the life and challenges of working as a mangaka. ―  The Poverty, The Princess and the Zombies The way reading about food makes you hungry, reading about manga makes me want to read manga.

I wish Tatsumi, who passed away earlier this year, could have drawn a sequel about the second half of his career, during which he b...                    column          9 comments       House of 1000 Manga - Kakukaku Shikajika   2015 Apr 24, 00:00 9 comments                 manga    If you were ever curious what life was like for the woman who created Princess Jellyfish, Jason has the manga for you. ―  Kakukaku Shikajika “I want to go back in time and beat up that moron.” —Akiko Higashimura, and many other artists, talking about their younger self Few artists “live the dream” of becoming a professional when they're still a teenager.

Happily, he chronicled a sizeable chunk of it in his 2009 doorstopper of a manga memoir, A Drifting Life, which should be required reading for all who would dare call...                    column          7 comments       House of 1000 Manga - Kazuhiko Shimamoto   2015 Apr 10, 00:21 7 comments                 manga    Jason's series on manga about manga continues with a blood-pumping journey through the work of hotblooded Blazing Transfer Student mangaka Kazuhiko Shimamoto. ―  Kazuhiko Shimamoto “I’m just a fanatical hot-blooded mangaka! I can teach you about plot structure, but I can’t give you relationship advice!” “It’s not enough to burn only in your own world! In the face of a crisis, will your burning heart ...                    column          5 comments       House of 1000 Manga - MBQ   2015 Apr  3, 00:00 5 comments                 manga    Shaenon dives into the world of MBQ, a hyperactive dream of manga stardom from the now-legendary Felipe Smith. ―  Recently, manga scholar Matt Thorn ruffled some otaku feathers with a blog post entitled “Why it bugs me that you call your comics ‘manga’.” Although I admire Thorn above all other manga nerds, and as much as white kids appropriating Japanese culture bug me, too (albeit in a personally cr...                    column          21 comments       House of 1000 Manga - Bakuman.   2015 Mar 26, 23:00 21 comments                 manga    Jason straps in for a series of columns focusing on manga about manga, and naturally, his first stop is writer Tsugumi Ohba and artist Takeshi Obata's Bakuman.

I mean, the animation and soundtrack is great, and I actually liked seeing Touya go from a misanthropic edgelord to a more well-balanced, open-minded person throughout the series. Unfortunately, a lot of the over-technical sci-fi, philosophical ramblings, and the fact that the series tried to do way too much in too little time didn't do it for me. It just felt really overstuffed, and had it cut out a lot of its fat, it might have been better and more streamlined. But that's just me.

It just felt really overstuffed, and had it cut out a lot of its fat, it might have been better and more streamlined. But that's just me.            It's definitely a heavy chunk of existential philosophy to take in all at once and I agree I wish it explored the same themes over a longer run, though I think this point will be subjective. If nothing else, it does feel weird to me, much like Dennou Coil, that it was produced as a children's show. Children's shows can have mature themes and definitely intentionally target adults with deeper messaging packaged in a kid-digestable package (in fact, I personally prefer this kind of all-ages approach for kids' shows), but Chikyuugai's central focus on the philosophy later would confuse and possibly disinterest most children I know.   Dennou Coil would still be the better series comparatively (it's my #2 anime of all time, just below Madoka☆Magica). It is a very rare hidden anime gem, beloved to Japanese audiences, with almost zero venues to watch it in the English in the 15 years since it aired, so the current run on Netflix might be your only chance to catch it while you still can!   Nonetheless, Chikyuugai is very much going to stick with me for a long time. Highly recommend it to anyone curious, especially since the short length provides more bang for less time investment! Also, there are a few subtle references to Dennou Coil for fans of that, plus one very obvious reference later in the show.   Thanks for the review!

I mean, the animation and soundtrack is great, and I actually liked seeing Touya go from a misanthropic edgelord to a more well-balanced, open-minded person throughout the series. Unfortunately, a lot of the over-technical sci-fi, philosophical ramblings, and the fact that the series tried to do way too much in too little time didn't do it for me. It just felt really overstuffed, and had it cut out a lot of its fat, it might have been better and more streamlined. But that's just me.

It just felt really overstuffed, and had it cut out a lot of its fat, it might have been better and more streamlined. But that's just me.            It's definitely a heavy chunk of existential philosophy to take in all at once and I agree I wish it explored the same themes over a longer run, though I think this point will be subjective. If nothing else, it does feel weird to me, much like Dennou Coil, that it was produced as a children's show. Children's shows can have mature themes and definitely intentionally target adults with deeper messaging packaged in a kid-digestable package (in fact, I personally prefer this kind of all-ages approach for kids' shows), but Chikyuugai's central focus on the philosophy later would confuse and possibly disinterest most children I know.   Dennou Coil would still be the better series comparatively (it's my #2 anime of all time, just below Madoka☆Magica). It is a very rare hidden anime gem, beloved to Japanese audiences, with almost zero venues to watch it in the English in the 15 years since it aired, so the current run on Netflix might be your only chance to catch it while you still can!   Nonetheless, Chikyuugai is very much going to stick with me for a long time. Highly recommend it to anyone curious, especially since the short length provides more bang for less time investment! Also, there are a few subtle references to Dennou Coil for fans of that, plus one very obvious reference later in the show.   Thanks for the review!

It's definitely a heavy chunk of existential philosophy to take in all at once and I agree I wish it explored the same themes over a longer run, though I think this point will be subjective. If nothing else, it does feel weird to me, much like Dennou Coil, that it was produced as a children's show. Children's shows can have mature themes and definitely intentionally target adults with deeper messaging packaged in a kid-digestable package (in fact, I personally prefer this kind of all-ages approach for kids' shows), but Chikyuugai's central focus on the philosophy later would confuse and possibly disinterest most children I know.   Dennou Coil would still be the better series comparatively (it's my #2 anime of all time, just below Madoka☆Magica). It is a very rare hidden anime gem, beloved to Japanese audiences, with almost zero venues to watch it in the English in the 15 years since it aired, so the current run on Netflix might be your only chance to catch it while you still can!   Nonetheless, Chikyuugai is very much going to stick with me for a long time. Highly recommend it to anyone curious, especially since the short length provides more bang for less time investment! Also, there are a few subtle references to Dennou Coil for fans of that, plus one very obvious reference later in the show.   Thanks for the review!

I mean, the animation and soundtrack is great, and I actually liked seeing Touya go from a misanthropic edgelord to a more well-balanced, open-minded person throughout the series. Unfortunately, a lot of the over-technical sci-fi, philosophical ramblings, and the fact that the series tried to do way too much in too little time didn't do it for me. It just felt really overstuffed, and had it cut out a lot of its fat, it might have been better and more streamlined. But that's just me.

It just felt really overstuffed, and had it cut out a lot of its fat, it might have been better and more streamlined. But that's just me.            It's definitely a heavy chunk of existential philosophy to take in all at once and I agree I wish it explored the same themes over a longer run, though I think this point will be subjective. If nothing else, it does feel weird to me, much like Dennou Coil, that it was produced as a children's show. Children's shows can have mature themes and definitely intentionally target adults with deeper messaging packaged in a kid-digestable package (in fact, I personally prefer this kind of all-ages approach for kids' shows), but Chikyuugai's central focus on the philosophy later would confuse and possibly disinterest most children I know.   Dennou Coil would still be the better series comparatively (it's my #2 anime of all time, just below Madoka☆Magica). It is a very rare hidden anime gem, beloved to Japanese audiences, with almost zero venues to watch it in the English in the 15 years since it aired, so the current run on Netflix might be your only chance to catch it while you still can!   Nonetheless, Chikyuugai is very much going to stick with me for a long time. Highly recommend it to anyone curious, especially since the short length provides more bang for less time investment! Also, there are a few subtle references to Dennou Coil for fans of that, plus one very obvious reference later in the show.   Thanks for the review!

It's definitely a heavy chunk of existential philosophy to take in all at once and I agree I wish it explored the same themes over a longer run, though I think this point will be subjective. If nothing else, it does feel weird to me, much like Dennou Coil, that it was produced as a children's show. Children's shows can have mature themes and definitely intentionally target adults with deeper messaging packaged in a kid-digestable package (in fact, I personally prefer this kind of all-ages approach for kids' shows), but Chikyuugai's central focus on the philosophy later would confuse and possibly disinterest most children I know.   Dennou Coil would still be the better series comparatively (it's my #2 anime of all time, just below Madoka☆Magica). It is a very rare hidden anime gem, beloved to Japanese audiences, with almost zero venues to watch it in the English in the 15 years since it aired, so the current run on Netflix might be your only chance to catch it while you still can!   Nonetheless, Chikyuugai is very much going to stick with me for a long time. Highly recommend it to anyone curious, especially since the short length provides more bang for less time investment! Also, there are a few subtle references to Dennou Coil for fans of that, plus one very obvious reference later in the show.   Thanks for the review!

I mean, the animation and soundtrack is great, and I actually liked seeing Touya go from a misanthropic edgelord to a more well-balanced, open-minded person throughout the series. Unfortunately, a lot of the over-technical sci-fi, philosophical ramblings, and the fact that the series tried to do way too much in too little time didn't do it for me. It just felt really overstuffed, and had it cut out a lot of its fat, it might have been better and more streamlined. But that's just me.

It's definitely a heavy chunk of existential philosophy to take in all at once and I agree I wish it explored the same themes over a longer run, though I think this point will be subjective. If nothing else, it does feel weird to me, much like Dennou Coil, that it was produced as a children's show. Children's shows can have mature themes and definitely intentionally target adults with deeper messaging packaged in a kid-digestable package (in fact, I personally prefer this kind of all-ages approach for kids' shows), but Chikyuugai's central focus on the philosophy later would confuse and possibly disinterest most children I know.   Dennou Coil would still be the better series comparatively (it's my #2 anime of all time, just below Madoka☆Magica). It is a very rare hidden anime gem, beloved to Japanese audiences, with almost zero venues to watch it in the English in the 15 years since it aired, so the current run on Netflix might be your only chance to catch it while you still can!   Nonetheless, Chikyuugai is very much going to stick with me for a long time. Highly recommend it to anyone curious, especially since the short length provides more bang for less time investment! Also, there are a few subtle references to Dennou Coil for fans of that, plus one very obvious reference later in the show.   Thanks for the review!
