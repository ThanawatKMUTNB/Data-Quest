Apr 11th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Don't Hurt Me, My Healer! ?                     Community score: 2.5              What is this?   The ""isekai burnt-out adventurer comedy"" centers on two adventurers: the hopeless swordsman Arvin, and the sarcastic dark-elf healer Karla, who seems to be more talented with ticking people off than healing. (from manga)   Don't Hurt Me, My Healer! is based on Tannen ni Hakkō's Kono Healer, Mendokusai (This Healer's a Handful) manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Sundays.      How was the first episode?   James Beckett  Rating:                Full disclosure: Before getting to the premiere of Don't Hurt Me, My Healer!, I watched the new film Everything Everywhere all at once, and without derailing this review to cover a completely irrelevant and non-anime project, the film left me on Cloud Nine, so much so that I was guaranteed to enjoy practically anything in my post-masterpiece haze. You could have walked up and socked me right in the face, and I probably would have given the experience at least a two out of five. So, take my relatively positive score here with a grain of salt.    I'm not going to pretend that Don't Hurt Me, My Healer! is a great anime, or anything. A lot of its tryhard manzai-style humor is the kind of stuff that I usually find pretty grating, since so much of it boils down to one person acting like a manic lunatic for no particular reason, while the straight-man of the group explains in excruciating detail how their partner's behavior defies conventional expectations. “Wah, I tried to heal you, but I accidentally cursed you instead, because I'm grossly incompetent at my chosen profession!” “Well, that isn't how it was supposed to go!” Insert slide-whistle sound effect here. Still, “comedy is subjective” and all that, and it's my job to be honest with you, so here it goes: This incredibly stupid show made me laugh a few times, and I was never actively bored while I watched it.    In retrospect, a lot of my appreciation of this episode comes from the befuddled bear-thing simply trying to keep the two numbskull humans that it has only just met from self-annihilation-by-way-of-shenanigans. Arvin and Carla are, themselves, not especially hilarious, so a lot of the show's potential will depend on whether the characters they meet every week can balance out the altogether-too-muchness of the pair's whole shtick. Will everyone enjoy Don't Hurt Me, My Healer!? Lord, no. But it might prove to be a decent way to kill a half-hour if nothing else is on.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               You know how they say humor is subjective? Well, for me, this anime is less funny and more like pulling teeth: long, drawn-out, and painful. However, this should be no surprise; it's right there in the title, after all. In Japanese, this show is called “Kono Healer, Mendokusai,” which translates directly to “This Healer is a Pain to Deal With.” And holy crap do I feel that after watching this episode. In fact, it's not just the healer but the warrior and the bear as well; they're all a pain and I didn't enjoy a single moment of this episode.    Honestly, more than anything else, watching this episode felt like reading a particularly volatile comment section on a subject I cared nothing about. Instead of addressing each other's points, they change the subject, passively-aggressively attack each other, move the goalposts, and drag other people into it. It was at the moment the bear started talking that I realized what we were in for—that this argument was going to be our entire episode—and my heart filled with dread.    The only thing that got me through this episode (you know, besides being paid to watch it) was thinking about the simple question: “Is Carla really that dense or is she just messing with everyone?” Because, while it's presented as the former, I'm starting to think it's the latter. The real reason she doesn't have a party is not that she's incompetent, it's that she's a born sadist who gets off on causing people emotional pain. Every move she makes is calculated to get what she wants—be that a new mace or a person to torture. I doubt the so-called “curse” even exists; it's just her way of keeping her new punching bag at arm's length (though, I wouldn't put it past her to put an actual curse on him for the same reason).    Luckily, I am not cursed to remain around Carla nor do I have any reason to watch—much less think about—this series ever again. Good luck, Alvin. I wouldn't wish this hell upon anyone.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               There's nothing objectively offensive about Don't Hurt Me, My Healer!. It's just incredibly annoying. Or rather, Carla, the eponymous healer, is incredibly annoying. The premise, as I understood it prior to going in, is that dark elf Carla is a pretty terrible healer, doing the opposite of helping people despite her class. That may be true, although we don't see much evidence of it in this episode apart from the bit where she curses Alvin instead of healing him. What she is instead is intensely irritating, the anime equivalent of that mosquito that you can hear buzzing around your head in the night but can never quite find to squash. Somehow this is made worse by the fact that she's clearly meant to be funny; her attempts to be cutesy instead come off as grating and her every action is plainly self-serving. When she says that she's never been in a party before and Alvin remarks that, given her personality, that's not surprising, it's the truest statement in the episode.    Carla basically weighs the entire thing down, which is a shame because the show's not without other merits. Bear, the horned bear magibeast Alvin is initially fighting, is at least moderately amusing with the way that she can't seem to settle on a cute verbal affectation, cycling through “kuma,” “gao,” and “bear” with each new utterance. The fact that we never get to see Alvin's entire face is also pretty good, and watching the show come up with new ways to ensure that it's mostly hidden is both a fun poke at censorship via strategically placed item and just generally fun, especially since both Mostly and Carla are under the impression that his face is some sort of horror show of dullness. I also appreciate that Carla's healer outfit is perfectly normal and fully covering, which is unusual for a fantasy show; that it's practical as well is especially nice.    It's just too bad that Carla is so grating, and since she's the main character (or at least one of them, though who knows how long Alvin will last), that's a real problem. This has the unfortunate combination of very little plot, a thus-far uninteresting RPG-inspired fantasy world, and a character who just really rubbed me the wrong way. Your mileage may vary, but this wouldn't be my first choice for something to watch this season, even if you're hurting for any of its purported genres.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               There's nothing quite as unbearable as an unfunny comedy, is there? There have been some stinkers this season, some of them quantifiably worse than Don't Hurt Me, My Healer!, but nothing has felt quite as protracted and interminable as watching this premiere hammer its weak, wafer-thin premise into the ground for a full 20 minutes. It has one joke, which is at best mildly funny on paper, and it proceeds to flub telling that joke in what feels like the most excruciating bit of sketch comedy ever made. That it's actually a scripted, fully-animated TV show just makes it harder to sit through.    Ok, there was one joke that kind of got me to smile. The reveal that the generic rhino/bear monster wasn't just some random monster, but a character in her own right and basically the mediator between our two leads, was kind of funny. But the longer it went on the less funny it got, and by the third minute the gag had just folded itself in with the unfunny manzai banter of Alvin and Clara. Thus the one spark of comedic hope in this premiere faded into the night, never to be seen again, and there were still 14 minutes of this sucker to get through. And every joke from then on followed the same formula: Carla says something rude or arrogant, Alvin gets upset. At one point there's a gag about Carla not being able to properly heal his face (which he doesn't actually have) that lasts for eons and repeats the punchline a dozen times before it mercifully ends.    This is just the antithesis of charming comedy for me. It's rote, boring, and repetitive. Half the jokes are just Alvin yelling that Carla is being rude, as if shouting the point of a scene is inherently funny. And since the show is so barebones in art and animation, there's nothing to distract from how unfunny it is. It made for a miserable time, and unless you have a totally different sense of humor, there's nothing here for you.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review          1 comment       Hello, Melancholic!

Apr 11th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Don't Hurt Me, My Healer! ?                     Community score: 2.5              What is this?   The ""isekai burnt-out adventurer comedy"" centers on two adventurers: the hopeless swordsman Arvin, and the sarcastic dark-elf healer Karla, who seems to be more talented with ticking people off than healing. (from manga)   Don't Hurt Me, My Healer! is based on Tannen ni Hakkō's Kono Healer, Mendokusai (This Healer's a Handful) manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Sundays.      How was the first episode?   James Beckett  Rating:                Full disclosure: Before getting to the premiere of Don't Hurt Me, My Healer!, I watched the new film Everything Everywhere all at once, and without derailing this review to cover a completely irrelevant and non-anime project, the film left me on Cloud Nine, so much so that I was guaranteed to enjoy practically anything in my post-masterpiece haze. You could have walked up and socked me right in the face, and I probably would have given the experience at least a two out of five. So, take my relatively positive score here with a grain of salt.    I'm not going to pretend that Don't Hurt Me, My Healer! is a great anime, or anything. A lot of its tryhard manzai-style humor is the kind of stuff that I usually find pretty grating, since so much of it boils down to one person acting like a manic lunatic for no particular reason, while the straight-man of the group explains in excruciating detail how their partner's behavior defies conventional expectations. “Wah, I tried to heal you, but I accidentally cursed you instead, because I'm grossly incompetent at my chosen profession!” “Well, that isn't how it was supposed to go!” Insert slide-whistle sound effect here. Still, “comedy is subjective” and all that, and it's my job to be honest with you, so here it goes: This incredibly stupid show made me laugh a few times, and I was never actively bored while I watched it.    In retrospect, a lot of my appreciation of this episode comes from the befuddled bear-thing simply trying to keep the two numbskull humans that it has only just met from self-annihilation-by-way-of-shenanigans. Arvin and Carla are, themselves, not especially hilarious, so a lot of the show's potential will depend on whether the characters they meet every week can balance out the altogether-too-muchness of the pair's whole shtick. Will everyone enjoy Don't Hurt Me, My Healer!? Lord, no. But it might prove to be a decent way to kill a half-hour if nothing else is on.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               You know how they say humor is subjective? Well, for me, this anime is less funny and more like pulling teeth: long, drawn-out, and painful. However, this should be no surprise; it's right there in the title, after all. In Japanese, this show is called “Kono Healer, Mendokusai,” which translates directly to “This Healer is a Pain to Deal With.” And holy crap do I feel that after watching this episode. In fact, it's not just the healer but the warrior and the bear as well; they're all a pain and I didn't enjoy a single moment of this episode.    Honestly, more than anything else, watching this episode felt like reading a particularly volatile comment section on a subject I cared nothing about. Instead of addressing each other's points, they change the subject, passively-aggressively attack each other, move the goalposts, and drag other people into it. It was at the moment the bear started talking that I realized what we were in for—that this argument was going to be our entire episode—and my heart filled with dread.    The only thing that got me through this episode (you know, besides being paid to watch it) was thinking about the simple question: “Is Carla really that dense or is she just messing with everyone?” Because, while it's presented as the former, I'm starting to think it's the latter. The real reason she doesn't have a party is not that she's incompetent, it's that she's a born sadist who gets off on causing people emotional pain. Every move she makes is calculated to get what she wants—be that a new mace or a person to torture. I doubt the so-called “curse” even exists; it's just her way of keeping her new punching bag at arm's length (though, I wouldn't put it past her to put an actual curse on him for the same reason).    Luckily, I am not cursed to remain around Carla nor do I have any reason to watch—much less think about—this series ever again. Good luck, Alvin. I wouldn't wish this hell upon anyone.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               There's nothing objectively offensive about Don't Hurt Me, My Healer!. It's just incredibly annoying. Or rather, Carla, the eponymous healer, is incredibly annoying. The premise, as I understood it prior to going in, is that dark elf Carla is a pretty terrible healer, doing the opposite of helping people despite her class. That may be true, although we don't see much evidence of it in this episode apart from the bit where she curses Alvin instead of healing him. What she is instead is intensely irritating, the anime equivalent of that mosquito that you can hear buzzing around your head in the night but can never quite find to squash. Somehow this is made worse by the fact that she's clearly meant to be funny; her attempts to be cutesy instead come off as grating and her every action is plainly self-serving. When she says that she's never been in a party before and Alvin remarks that, given her personality, that's not surprising, it's the truest statement in the episode.    Carla basically weighs the entire thing down, which is a shame because the show's not without other merits. Bear, the horned bear magibeast Alvin is initially fighting, is at least moderately amusing with the way that she can't seem to settle on a cute verbal affectation, cycling through “kuma,” “gao,” and “bear” with each new utterance. The fact that we never get to see Alvin's entire face is also pretty good, and watching the show come up with new ways to ensure that it's mostly hidden is both a fun poke at censorship via strategically placed item and just generally fun, especially since both Mostly and Carla are under the impression that his face is some sort of horror show of dullness. I also appreciate that Carla's healer outfit is perfectly normal and fully covering, which is unusual for a fantasy show; that it's practical as well is especially nice.    It's just too bad that Carla is so grating, and since she's the main character (or at least one of them, though who knows how long Alvin will last), that's a real problem. This has the unfortunate combination of very little plot, a thus-far uninteresting RPG-inspired fantasy world, and a character who just really rubbed me the wrong way. Your mileage may vary, but this wouldn't be my first choice for something to watch this season, even if you're hurting for any of its purported genres.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               There's nothing quite as unbearable as an unfunny comedy, is there? There have been some stinkers this season, some of them quantifiably worse than Don't Hurt Me, My Healer!, but nothing has felt quite as protracted and interminable as watching this premiere hammer its weak, wafer-thin premise into the ground for a full 20 minutes.

That it's actually a scripted, fully-animated TV show just makes it harder to sit through.    Ok, there was one joke that kind of got me to smile. The reveal that the generic rhino/bear monster wasn't just some random monster, but a character in her own right and basically the mediator between our two leads, was kind of funny. But the longer it went on the less funny it got, and by the third minute the gag had just folded itself in with the unfunny manzai banter of Alvin and Clara. Thus the one spark of comedic hope in this premiere faded into the night, never to be seen again, and there were still 14 minutes of this sucker to get through. And every joke from then on followed the same formula: Carla says something rude or arrogant, Alvin gets upset. At one point there's a gag about Carla not being able to properly heal his face (which he doesn't actually have) that lasts for eons and repeats the punchline a dozen times before it mercifully ends.    This is just the antithesis of charming comedy for me. It's rote, boring, and repetitive. Half the jokes are just Alvin yelling that Carla is being rude, as if shouting the point of a scene is inherently funny. And since the show is so barebones in art and animation, there's nothing to distract from how unfunny it is. It made for a miserable time, and unless you have a totally different sense of humor, there's nothing here for you.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review          1 comment       Hello, Melancholic!

Apr 11th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Don't Hurt Me, My Healer! ?                     Community score: 2.5              What is this?   The ""isekai burnt-out adventurer comedy"" centers on two adventurers: the hopeless swordsman Arvin, and the sarcastic dark-elf healer Karla, who seems to be more talented with ticking people off than healing. (from manga)   Don't Hurt Me, My Healer! is based on Tannen ni Hakkō's Kono Healer, Mendokusai (This Healer's a Handful) manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Sundays.      How was the first episode?   James Beckett  Rating:                Full disclosure: Before getting to the premiere of Don't Hurt Me, My Healer!, I watched the new film Everything Everywhere all at once, and without derailing this review to cover a completely irrelevant and non-anime project, the film left me on Cloud Nine, so much so that I was guaranteed to enjoy practically anything in my post-masterpiece haze. You could have walked up and socked me right in the face, and I probably would have given the experience at least a two out of five. So, take my relatively positive score here with a grain of salt.    I'm not going to pretend that Don't Hurt Me, My Healer! is a great anime, or anything. A lot of its tryhard manzai-style humor is the kind of stuff that I usually find pretty grating, since so much of it boils down to one person acting like a manic lunatic for no particular reason, while the straight-man of the group explains in excruciating detail how their partner's behavior defies conventional expectations. “Wah, I tried to heal you, but I accidentally cursed you instead, because I'm grossly incompetent at my chosen profession!” “Well, that isn't how it was supposed to go!” Insert slide-whistle sound effect here. Still, “comedy is subjective” and all that, and it's my job to be honest with you, so here it goes: This incredibly stupid show made me laugh a few times, and I was never actively bored while I watched it.    In retrospect, a lot of my appreciation of this episode comes from the befuddled bear-thing simply trying to keep the two numbskull humans that it has only just met from self-annihilation-by-way-of-shenanigans. Arvin and Carla are, themselves, not especially hilarious, so a lot of the show's potential will depend on whether the characters they meet every week can balance out the altogether-too-muchness of the pair's whole shtick. Will everyone enjoy Don't Hurt Me, My Healer!? Lord, no. But it might prove to be a decent way to kill a half-hour if nothing else is on.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               You know how they say humor is subjective? Well, for me, this anime is less funny and more like pulling teeth: long, drawn-out, and painful. However, this should be no surprise; it's right there in the title, after all. In Japanese, this show is called “Kono Healer, Mendokusai,” which translates directly to “This Healer is a Pain to Deal With.” And holy crap do I feel that after watching this episode. In fact, it's not just the healer but the warrior and the bear as well; they're all a pain and I didn't enjoy a single moment of this episode.    Honestly, more than anything else, watching this episode felt like reading a particularly volatile comment section on a subject I cared nothing about. Instead of addressing each other's points, they change the subject, passively-aggressively attack each other, move the goalposts, and drag other people into it. It was at the moment the bear started talking that I realized what we were in for—that this argument was going to be our entire episode—and my heart filled with dread.    The only thing that got me through this episode (you know, besides being paid to watch it) was thinking about the simple question: “Is Carla really that dense or is she just messing with everyone?” Because, while it's presented as the former, I'm starting to think it's the latter. The real reason she doesn't have a party is not that she's incompetent, it's that she's a born sadist who gets off on causing people emotional pain. Every move she makes is calculated to get what she wants—be that a new mace or a person to torture. I doubt the so-called “curse” even exists; it's just her way of keeping her new punching bag at arm's length (though, I wouldn't put it past her to put an actual curse on him for the same reason).    Luckily, I am not cursed to remain around Carla nor do I have any reason to watch—much less think about—this series ever again. Good luck, Alvin. I wouldn't wish this hell upon anyone.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               There's nothing objectively offensive about Don't Hurt Me, My Healer!. It's just incredibly annoying. Or rather, Carla, the eponymous healer, is incredibly annoying. The premise, as I understood it prior to going in, is that dark elf Carla is a pretty terrible healer, doing the opposite of helping people despite her class. That may be true, although we don't see much evidence of it in this episode apart from the bit where she curses Alvin instead of healing him. What she is instead is intensely irritating, the anime equivalent of that mosquito that you can hear buzzing around your head in the night but can never quite find to squash. Somehow this is made worse by the fact that she's clearly meant to be funny; her attempts to be cutesy instead come off as grating and her every action is plainly self-serving. When she says that she's never been in a party before and Alvin remarks that, given her personality, that's not surprising, it's the truest statement in the episode.    Carla basically weighs the entire thing down, which is a shame because the show's not without other merits. Bear, the horned bear magibeast Alvin is initially fighting, is at least moderately amusing with the way that she can't seem to settle on a cute verbal affectation, cycling through “kuma,” “gao,” and “bear” with each new utterance. The fact that we never get to see Alvin's entire face is also pretty good, and watching the show come up with new ways to ensure that it's mostly hidden is both a fun poke at censorship via strategically placed item and just generally fun, especially since both Mostly and Carla are under the impression that his face is some sort of horror show of dullness. I also appreciate that Carla's healer outfit is perfectly normal and fully covering, which is unusual for a fantasy show; that it's practical as well is especially nice.    It's just too bad that Carla is so grating, and since she's the main character (or at least one of them, though who knows how long Alvin will last), that's a real problem. This has the unfortunate combination of very little plot, a thus-far uninteresting RPG-inspired fantasy world, and a character who just really rubbed me the wrong way. Your mileage may vary, but this wouldn't be my first choice for something to watch this season, even if you're hurting for any of its purported genres.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               There's nothing quite as unbearable as an unfunny comedy, is there? There have been some stinkers this season, some of them quantifiably worse than Don't Hurt Me, My Healer!, but nothing has felt quite as protracted and interminable as watching this premiere hammer its weak, wafer-thin premise into the ground for a full 20 minutes. It has one joke, which is at best mildly funny on paper, and it proceeds to flub telling that joke in what feels like the most excruciating bit of sketch comedy ever made. That it's actually a scripted, fully-animated TV show just makes it harder to sit through.    Ok, there was one joke that kind of got me to smile. The reveal that the generic rhino/bear monster wasn't just some random monster, but a character in her own right and basically the mediator between our two leads, was kind of funny. But the longer it went on the less funny it got, and by the third minute the gag had just folded itself in with the unfunny manzai banter of Alvin and Clara. Thus the one spark of comedic hope in this premiere faded into the night, never to be seen again, and there were still 14 minutes of this sucker to get through. And every joke from then on followed the same formula: Carla says something rude or arrogant, Alvin gets upset. At one point there's a gag about Carla not being able to properly heal his face (which he doesn't actually have) that lasts for eons and repeats the punchline a dozen times before it mercifully ends.    This is just the antithesis of charming comedy for me. It's rote, boring, and repetitive. Half the jokes are just Alvin yelling that Carla is being rude, as if shouting the point of a scene is inherently funny. And since the show is so barebones in art and animation, there's nothing to distract from how unfunny it is.

Apr 11th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Don't Hurt Me, My Healer! ?                     Community score: 2.5              What is this?   The ""isekai burnt-out adventurer comedy"" centers on two adventurers: the hopeless swordsman Arvin, and the sarcastic dark-elf healer Karla, who seems to be more talented with ticking people off than healing. (from manga)   Don't Hurt Me, My Healer! is based on Tannen ni Hakkō's Kono Healer, Mendokusai (This Healer's a Handful) manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Sundays.      How was the first episode?   James Beckett  Rating:                Full disclosure: Before getting to the premiere of Don't Hurt Me, My Healer!, I watched the new film Everything Everywhere all at once, and without derailing this review to cover a completely irrelevant and non-anime project, the film left me on Cloud Nine, so much so that I was guaranteed to enjoy practically anything in my post-masterpiece haze. You could have walked up and socked me right in the face, and I probably would have given the experience at least a two out of five. So, take my relatively positive score here with a grain of salt.    I'm not going to pretend that Don't Hurt Me, My Healer! is a great anime, or anything. A lot of its tryhard manzai-style humor is the kind of stuff that I usually find pretty grating, since so much of it boils down to one person acting like a manic lunatic for no particular reason, while the straight-man of the group explains in excruciating detail how their partner's behavior defies conventional expectations. “Wah, I tried to heal you, but I accidentally cursed you instead, because I'm grossly incompetent at my chosen profession!” “Well, that isn't how it was supposed to go!” Insert slide-whistle sound effect here. Still, “comedy is subjective” and all that, and it's my job to be honest with you, so here it goes: This incredibly stupid show made me laugh a few times, and I was never actively bored while I watched it.    In retrospect, a lot of my appreciation of this episode comes from the befuddled bear-thing simply trying to keep the two numbskull humans that it has only just met from self-annihilation-by-way-of-shenanigans. Arvin and Carla are, themselves, not especially hilarious, so a lot of the show's potential will depend on whether the characters they meet every week can balance out the altogether-too-muchness of the pair's whole shtick. Will everyone enjoy Don't Hurt Me, My Healer!? Lord, no. But it might prove to be a decent way to kill a half-hour if nothing else is on.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               You know how they say humor is subjective? Well, for me, this anime is less funny and more like pulling teeth: long, drawn-out, and painful. However, this should be no surprise; it's right there in the title, after all. In Japanese, this show is called “Kono Healer, Mendokusai,” which translates directly to “This Healer is a Pain to Deal With.” And holy crap do I feel that after watching this episode. In fact, it's not just the healer but the warrior and the bear as well; they're all a pain and I didn't enjoy a single moment of this episode.    Honestly, more than anything else, watching this episode felt like reading a particularly volatile comment section on a subject I cared nothing about. Instead of addressing each other's points, they change the subject, passively-aggressively attack each other, move the goalposts, and drag other people into it. It was at the moment the bear started talking that I realized what we were in for—that this argument was going to be our entire episode—and my heart filled with dread.    The only thing that got me through this episode (you know, besides being paid to watch it) was thinking about the simple question: “Is Carla really that dense or is she just messing with everyone?” Because, while it's presented as the former, I'm starting to think it's the latter. The real reason she doesn't have a party is not that she's incompetent, it's that she's a born sadist who gets off on causing people emotional pain. Every move she makes is calculated to get what she wants—be that a new mace or a person to torture. I doubt the so-called “curse” even exists; it's just her way of keeping her new punching bag at arm's length (though, I wouldn't put it past her to put an actual curse on him for the same reason).    Luckily, I am not cursed to remain around Carla nor do I have any reason to watch—much less think about—this series ever again. Good luck, Alvin. I wouldn't wish this hell upon anyone.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               There's nothing objectively offensive about Don't Hurt Me, My Healer!. It's just incredibly annoying. Or rather, Carla, the eponymous healer, is incredibly annoying. The premise, as I understood it prior to going in, is that dark elf Carla is a pretty terrible healer, doing the opposite of helping people despite her class. That may be true, although we don't see much evidence of it in this episode apart from the bit where she curses Alvin instead of healing him. What she is instead is intensely irritating, the anime equivalent of that mosquito that you can hear buzzing around your head in the night but can never quite find to squash. Somehow this is made worse by the fact that she's clearly meant to be funny; her attempts to be cutesy instead come off as grating and her every action is plainly self-serving. When she says that she's never been in a party before and Alvin remarks that, given her personality, that's not surprising, it's the truest statement in the episode.    Carla basically weighs the entire thing down, which is a shame because the show's not without other merits. Bear, the horned bear magibeast Alvin is initially fighting, is at least moderately amusing with the way that she can't seem to settle on a cute verbal affectation, cycling through “kuma,” “gao,” and “bear” with each new utterance. The fact that we never get to see Alvin's entire face is also pretty good, and watching the show come up with new ways to ensure that it's mostly hidden is both a fun poke at censorship via strategically placed item and just generally fun, especially since both Mostly and Carla are under the impression that his face is some sort of horror show of dullness. I also appreciate that Carla's healer outfit is perfectly normal and fully covering, which is unusual for a fantasy show; that it's practical as well is especially nice.    It's just too bad that Carla is so grating, and since she's the main character (or at least one of them, though who knows how long Alvin will last), that's a real problem. This has the unfortunate combination of very little plot, a thus-far uninteresting RPG-inspired fantasy world, and a character who just really rubbed me the wrong way. Your mileage may vary, but this wouldn't be my first choice for something to watch this season, even if you're hurting for any of its purported genres.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               There's nothing quite as unbearable as an unfunny comedy, is there? There have been some stinkers this season, some of them quantifiably worse than Don't Hurt Me, My Healer!, but nothing has felt quite as protracted and interminable as watching this premiere hammer its weak, wafer-thin premise into the ground for a full 20 minutes. It has one joke, which is at best mildly funny on paper, and it proceeds to flub telling that joke in what feels like the most excruciating bit of sketch comedy ever made. That it's actually a scripted, fully-animated TV show just makes it harder to sit through.    Ok, there was one joke that kind of got me to smile. The reveal that the generic rhino/bear monster wasn't just some random monster, but a character in her own right and basically the mediator between our two leads, was kind of funny. But the longer it went on the less funny it got, and by the third minute the gag had just folded itself in with the unfunny manzai banter of Alvin and Clara. Thus the one spark of comedic hope in this premiere faded into the night, never to be seen again, and there were still 14 minutes of this sucker to get through. And every joke from then on followed the same formula: Carla says something rude or arrogant, Alvin gets upset. At one point there's a gag about Carla not being able to properly heal his face (which he doesn't actually have) that lasts for eons and repeats the punchline a dozen times before it mercifully ends.    This is just the antithesis of charming comedy for me. It's rote, boring, and repetitive. Half the jokes are just Alvin yelling that Carla is being rude, as if shouting the point of a scene is inherently funny. And since the show is so barebones in art and animation, there's nothing to distract from how unfunny it is. It made for a miserable time, and unless you have a totally different sense of humor, there's nothing here for you.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review          1 comment       Hello, Melancholic!

James Beckett  Rating:                Full disclosure: Before getting to the premiere of Don't Hurt Me, My Healer!, I watched the new film Everything Everywhere all at once, and without derailing this review to cover a completely irrelevant and non-anime project, the film left me on Cloud Nine, so much so that I was guaranteed to enjoy practically anything in my post-masterpiece haze. You could have walked up and socked me right in the face, and I probably would have given the experience at least a two out of five. So, take my relatively positive score here with a grain of salt.    I'm not going to pretend that Don't Hurt Me, My Healer! is a great anime, or anything. A lot of its tryhard manzai-style humor is the kind of stuff that I usually find pretty grating, since so much of it boils down to one person acting like a manic lunatic for no particular reason, while the straight-man of the group explains in excruciating detail how their partner's behavior defies conventional expectations. “Wah, I tried to heal you, but I accidentally cursed you instead, because I'm grossly incompetent at my chosen profession!” “Well, that isn't how it was supposed to go!” Insert slide-whistle sound effect here. Still, “comedy is subjective” and all that, and it's my job to be honest with you, so here it goes: This incredibly stupid show made me laugh a few times, and I was never actively bored while I watched it.    In retrospect, a lot of my appreciation of this episode comes from the befuddled bear-thing simply trying to keep the two numbskull humans that it has only just met from self-annihilation-by-way-of-shenanigans. Arvin and Carla are, themselves, not especially hilarious, so a lot of the show's potential will depend on whether the characters they meet every week can balance out the altogether-too-muchness of the pair's whole shtick. Will everyone enjoy Don't Hurt Me, My Healer!? Lord, no. But it might prove to be a decent way to kill a half-hour if nothing else is on.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               You know how they say humor is subjective? Well, for me, this anime is less funny and more like pulling teeth: long, drawn-out, and painful. However, this should be no surprise; it's right there in the title, after all. In Japanese, this show is called “Kono Healer, Mendokusai,” which translates directly to “This Healer is a Pain to Deal With.” And holy crap do I feel that after watching this episode. In fact, it's not just the healer but the warrior and the bear as well; they're all a pain and I didn't enjoy a single moment of this episode.    Honestly, more than anything else, watching this episode felt like reading a particularly volatile comment section on a subject I cared nothing about. Instead of addressing each other's points, they change the subject, passively-aggressively attack each other, move the goalposts, and drag other people into it. It was at the moment the bear started talking that I realized what we were in for—that this argument was going to be our entire episode—and my heart filled with dread.    The only thing that got me through this episode (you know, besides being paid to watch it) was thinking about the simple question: “Is Carla really that dense or is she just messing with everyone?” Because, while it's presented as the former, I'm starting to think it's the latter. The real reason she doesn't have a party is not that she's incompetent, it's that she's a born sadist who gets off on causing people emotional pain. Every move she makes is calculated to get what she wants—be that a new mace or a person to torture. I doubt the so-called “curse” even exists; it's just her way of keeping her new punching bag at arm's length (though, I wouldn't put it past her to put an actual curse on him for the same reason).    Luckily, I am not cursed to remain around Carla nor do I have any reason to watch—much less think about—this series ever again. Good luck, Alvin. I wouldn't wish this hell upon anyone.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               There's nothing objectively offensive about Don't Hurt Me, My Healer!. It's just incredibly annoying. Or rather, Carla, the eponymous healer, is incredibly annoying. The premise, as I understood it prior to going in, is that dark elf Carla is a pretty terrible healer, doing the opposite of helping people despite her class. That may be true, although we don't see much evidence of it in this episode apart from the bit where she curses Alvin instead of healing him. What she is instead is intensely irritating, the anime equivalent of that mosquito that you can hear buzzing around your head in the night but can never quite find to squash. Somehow this is made worse by the fact that she's clearly meant to be funny; her attempts to be cutesy instead come off as grating and her every action is plainly self-serving. When she says that she's never been in a party before and Alvin remarks that, given her personality, that's not surprising, it's the truest statement in the episode.    Carla basically weighs the entire thing down, which is a shame because the show's not without other merits. Bear, the horned bear magibeast Alvin is initially fighting, is at least moderately amusing with the way that she can't seem to settle on a cute verbal affectation, cycling through “kuma,” “gao,” and “bear” with each new utterance. The fact that we never get to see Alvin's entire face is also pretty good, and watching the show come up with new ways to ensure that it's mostly hidden is both a fun poke at censorship via strategically placed item and just generally fun, especially since both Mostly and Carla are under the impression that his face is some sort of horror show of dullness. I also appreciate that Carla's healer outfit is perfectly normal and fully covering, which is unusual for a fantasy show; that it's practical as well is especially nice.    It's just too bad that Carla is so grating, and since she's the main character (or at least one of them, though who knows how long Alvin will last), that's a real problem. This has the unfortunate combination of very little plot, a thus-far uninteresting RPG-inspired fantasy world, and a character who just really rubbed me the wrong way. Your mileage may vary, but this wouldn't be my first choice for something to watch this season, even if you're hurting for any of its purported genres.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               There's nothing quite as unbearable as an unfunny comedy, is there? There have been some stinkers this season, some of them quantifiably worse than Don't Hurt Me, My Healer!, but nothing has felt quite as protracted and interminable as watching this premiere hammer its weak, wafer-thin premise into the ground for a full 20 minutes. It has one joke, which is at best mildly funny on paper, and it proceeds to flub telling that joke in what feels like the most excruciating bit of sketch comedy ever made. That it's actually a scripted, fully-animated TV show just makes it harder to sit through.    Ok, there was one joke that kind of got me to smile. The reveal that the generic rhino/bear monster wasn't just some random monster, but a character in her own right and basically the mediator between our two leads, was kind of funny. But the longer it went on the less funny it got, and by the third minute the gag had just folded itself in with the unfunny manzai banter of Alvin and Clara. Thus the one spark of comedic hope in this premiere faded into the night, never to be seen again, and there were still 14 minutes of this sucker to get through. And every joke from then on followed the same formula: Carla says something rude or arrogant, Alvin gets upset. At one point there's a gag about Carla not being able to properly heal his face (which he doesn't actually have) that lasts for eons and repeats the punchline a dozen times before it mercifully ends.    This is just the antithesis of charming comedy for me. It's rote, boring, and repetitive. Half the jokes are just Alvin yelling that Carla is being rude, as if shouting the point of a scene is inherently funny. And since the show is so barebones in art and animation, there's nothing to distract from how unfunny it is. It made for a miserable time, and unless you have a totally different sense of humor, there's nothing here for you.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

A lot of its tryhard manzai-style humor is the kind of stuff that I usually find pretty grating, since so much of it boils down to one person acting like a manic lunatic for no particular reason, while the straight-man of the group explains in excruciating detail how their partner's behavior defies conventional expectations. “Wah, I tried to heal you, but I accidentally cursed you instead, because I'm grossly incompetent at my chosen profession!” “Well, that isn't how it was supposed to go!” Insert slide-whistle sound effect here. Still, “comedy is subjective” and all that, and it's my job to be honest with you, so here it goes: This incredibly stupid show made me laugh a few times, and I was never actively bored while I watched it.    In retrospect, a lot of my appreciation of this episode comes from the befuddled bear-thing simply trying to keep the two numbskull humans that it has only just met from self-annihilation-by-way-of-shenanigans. Arvin and Carla are, themselves, not especially hilarious, so a lot of the show's potential will depend on whether the characters they meet every week can balance out the altogether-too-muchness of the pair's whole shtick. Will everyone enjoy Don't Hurt Me, My Healer!? Lord, no. But it might prove to be a decent way to kill a half-hour if nothing else is on.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               You know how they say humor is subjective? Well, for me, this anime is less funny and more like pulling teeth: long, drawn-out, and painful. However, this should be no surprise; it's right there in the title, after all. In Japanese, this show is called “Kono Healer, Mendokusai,” which translates directly to “This Healer is a Pain to Deal With.” And holy crap do I feel that after watching this episode. In fact, it's not just the healer but the warrior and the bear as well; they're all a pain and I didn't enjoy a single moment of this episode.    Honestly, more than anything else, watching this episode felt like reading a particularly volatile comment section on a subject I cared nothing about. Instead of addressing each other's points, they change the subject, passively-aggressively attack each other, move the goalposts, and drag other people into it. It was at the moment the bear started talking that I realized what we were in for—that this argument was going to be our entire episode—and my heart filled with dread.    The only thing that got me through this episode (you know, besides being paid to watch it) was thinking about the simple question: “Is Carla really that dense or is she just messing with everyone?” Because, while it's presented as the former, I'm starting to think it's the latter. The real reason she doesn't have a party is not that she's incompetent, it's that she's a born sadist who gets off on causing people emotional pain. Every move she makes is calculated to get what she wants—be that a new mace or a person to torture. I doubt the so-called “curse” even exists; it's just her way of keeping her new punching bag at arm's length (though, I wouldn't put it past her to put an actual curse on him for the same reason).    Luckily, I am not cursed to remain around Carla nor do I have any reason to watch—much less think about—this series ever again. Good luck, Alvin. I wouldn't wish this hell upon anyone.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               There's nothing objectively offensive about Don't Hurt Me, My Healer!. It's just incredibly annoying. Or rather, Carla, the eponymous healer, is incredibly annoying. The premise, as I understood it prior to going in, is that dark elf Carla is a pretty terrible healer, doing the opposite of helping people despite her class. That may be true, although we don't see much evidence of it in this episode apart from the bit where she curses Alvin instead of healing him. What she is instead is intensely irritating, the anime equivalent of that mosquito that you can hear buzzing around your head in the night but can never quite find to squash. Somehow this is made worse by the fact that she's clearly meant to be funny; her attempts to be cutesy instead come off as grating and her every action is plainly self-serving. When she says that she's never been in a party before and Alvin remarks that, given her personality, that's not surprising, it's the truest statement in the episode.    Carla basically weighs the entire thing down, which is a shame because the show's not without other merits. Bear, the horned bear magibeast Alvin is initially fighting, is at least moderately amusing with the way that she can't seem to settle on a cute verbal affectation, cycling through “kuma,” “gao,” and “bear” with each new utterance. The fact that we never get to see Alvin's entire face is also pretty good, and watching the show come up with new ways to ensure that it's mostly hidden is both a fun poke at censorship via strategically placed item and just generally fun, especially since both Mostly and Carla are under the impression that his face is some sort of horror show of dullness. I also appreciate that Carla's healer outfit is perfectly normal and fully covering, which is unusual for a fantasy show; that it's practical as well is especially nice.    It's just too bad that Carla is so grating, and since she's the main character (or at least one of them, though who knows how long Alvin will last), that's a real problem. This has the unfortunate combination of very little plot, a thus-far uninteresting RPG-inspired fantasy world, and a character who just really rubbed me the wrong way. Your mileage may vary, but this wouldn't be my first choice for something to watch this season, even if you're hurting for any of its purported genres.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               There's nothing quite as unbearable as an unfunny comedy, is there? There have been some stinkers this season, some of them quantifiably worse than Don't Hurt Me, My Healer!, but nothing has felt quite as protracted and interminable as watching this premiere hammer its weak, wafer-thin premise into the ground for a full 20 minutes. It has one joke, which is at best mildly funny on paper, and it proceeds to flub telling that joke in what feels like the most excruciating bit of sketch comedy ever made. That it's actually a scripted, fully-animated TV show just makes it harder to sit through.    Ok, there was one joke that kind of got me to smile. The reveal that the generic rhino/bear monster wasn't just some random monster, but a character in her own right and basically the mediator between our two leads, was kind of funny. But the longer it went on the less funny it got, and by the third minute the gag had just folded itself in with the unfunny manzai banter of Alvin and Clara. Thus the one spark of comedic hope in this premiere faded into the night, never to be seen again, and there were still 14 minutes of this sucker to get through. And every joke from then on followed the same formula: Carla says something rude or arrogant, Alvin gets upset. At one point there's a gag about Carla not being able to properly heal his face (which he doesn't actually have) that lasts for eons and repeats the punchline a dozen times before it mercifully ends.    This is just the antithesis of charming comedy for me. It's rote, boring, and repetitive. Half the jokes are just Alvin yelling that Carla is being rude, as if shouting the point of a scene is inherently funny. And since the show is so barebones in art and animation, there's nothing to distract from how unfunny it is. It made for a miserable time, and unless you have a totally different sense of humor, there's nothing here for you.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives     ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

The only thing that got me through this episode (you know, besides being paid to watch it) was thinking about the simple question: “Is Carla really that dense or is she just messing with everyone?” Because, while it's presented as the former, I'm starting to think it's the latter. The real reason she doesn't have a party is not that she's incompetent, it's that she's a born sadist who gets off on causing people emotional pain. Every move she makes is calculated to get what she wants—be that a new mace or a person to torture. I doubt the so-called “curse” even exists; it's just her way of keeping her new punching bag at arm's length (though, I wouldn't put it past her to put an actual curse on him for the same reason).    Luckily, I am not cursed to remain around Carla nor do I have any reason to watch—much less think about—this series ever again. Good luck, Alvin. I wouldn't wish this hell upon anyone.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               There's nothing objectively offensive about Don't Hurt Me, My Healer!. It's just incredibly annoying. Or rather, Carla, the eponymous healer, is incredibly annoying. The premise, as I understood it prior to going in, is that dark elf Carla is a pretty terrible healer, doing the opposite of helping people despite her class. That may be true, although we don't see much evidence of it in this episode apart from the bit where she curses Alvin instead of healing him. What she is instead is intensely irritating, the anime equivalent of that mosquito that you can hear buzzing around your head in the night but can never quite find to squash. Somehow this is made worse by the fact that she's clearly meant to be funny; her attempts to be cutesy instead come off as grating and her every action is plainly self-serving. When she says that she's never been in a party before and Alvin remarks that, given her personality, that's not surprising, it's the truest statement in the episode.    Carla basically weighs the entire thing down, which is a shame because the show's not without other merits. Bear, the horned bear magibeast Alvin is initially fighting, is at least moderately amusing with the way that she can't seem to settle on a cute verbal affectation, cycling through “kuma,” “gao,” and “bear” with each new utterance. The fact that we never get to see Alvin's entire face is also pretty good, and watching the show come up with new ways to ensure that it's mostly hidden is both a fun poke at censorship via strategically placed item and just generally fun, especially since both Mostly and Carla are under the impression that his face is some sort of horror show of dullness. I also appreciate that Carla's healer outfit is perfectly normal and fully covering, which is unusual for a fantasy show; that it's practical as well is especially nice.    It's just too bad that Carla is so grating, and since she's the main character (or at least one of them, though who knows how long Alvin will last), that's a real problem. This has the unfortunate combination of very little plot, a thus-far uninteresting RPG-inspired fantasy world, and a character who just really rubbed me the wrong way. Your mileage may vary, but this wouldn't be my first choice for something to watch this season, even if you're hurting for any of its purported genres.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               There's nothing quite as unbearable as an unfunny comedy, is there? There have been some stinkers this season, some of them quantifiably worse than Don't Hurt Me, My Healer!, but nothing has felt quite as protracted and interminable as watching this premiere hammer its weak, wafer-thin premise into the ground for a full 20 minutes. It has one joke, which is at best mildly funny on paper, and it proceeds to flub telling that joke in what feels like the most excruciating bit of sketch comedy ever made. That it's actually a scripted, fully-animated TV show just makes it harder to sit through.    Ok, there was one joke that kind of got me to smile. The reveal that the generic rhino/bear monster wasn't just some random monster, but a character in her own right and basically the mediator between our two leads, was kind of funny. But the longer it went on the less funny it got, and by the third minute the gag had just folded itself in with the unfunny manzai banter of Alvin and Clara. Thus the one spark of comedic hope in this premiere faded into the night, never to be seen again, and there were still 14 minutes of this sucker to get through. And every joke from then on followed the same formula: Carla says something rude or arrogant, Alvin gets upset. At one point there's a gag about Carla not being able to properly heal his face (which he doesn't actually have) that lasts for eons and repeats the punchline a dozen times before it mercifully ends.    This is just the antithesis of charming comedy for me. It's rote, boring, and repetitive. Half the jokes are just Alvin yelling that Carla is being rude, as if shouting the point of a scene is inherently funny. And since the show is so barebones in art and animation, there's nothing to distract from how unfunny it is. It made for a miserable time, and unless you have a totally different sense of humor, there's nothing here for you.

19-04-2022,anime,2,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/preview-guide/2022/spring/dont-hurt-me-my-healer/.183649,"Don't Hurt Me, My Healer! - The Spring 2022 Preview Guide - Anime News Network:SEA","            How would you rate episode 1 of Don't Hurt Me, My Healer! ?                     Community score: 2.5              What is this?   The ""isekai burnt-out adventurer comedy"" centers on two adventurers: the hopeless swordsman Arvin, and the sarcastic dark-elf healer Karla, who seems to be more talented with ticking people off than healing. (from manga)   Don't Hurt Me, My Healer! is based on Tannen ni Hakkō's Kono Healer, Mendokusai (This Healer's a Handful) manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Sundays.      How was the first episode?   James Beckett  Rating:                Full disclosure: Before getting to the premiere of Don't Hurt Me, My Healer!, I watched the new film Everything Everywhere all at once, and without derailing this review to cover a completely irrelevant and non-anime project, the film left me on Cloud Nine, so much so that I was guaranteed to enjoy practically anything in my post-masterpiece haze. You could have walked up and socked me right in the face, and I probably would have given the experience at least a two out of five. So, take my relatively positive score here with a grain of salt.    I'm not going to pretend that Don't Hurt Me, My Healer! is a great anime, or anything. A lot of its tryhard manzai-style humor is the kind of stuff that I usually find pretty grating, since so much of it boils down to one person acting like a manic lunatic for no particular reason, while the straight-man of the group explains in excruciating detail how their partner's behavior defies conventional expectations. “Wah, I tried to heal you, but I accidentally cursed you instead, because I'm grossly incompetent at my chosen profession!” “Well, that isn't how it was supposed to go!” Insert slide-whistle sound effect here. Still, “comedy is subjective” and all that, and it's my job to be honest with you, so here it goes: This incredibly stupid show made me laugh a few times, and I was never actively bored while I watched it.    In retrospect, a lot of my appreciation of this episode comes from the befuddled bear-thing simply trying to keep the two numbskull humans that it has only just met from self-annihilation-by-way-of-shenanigans. Arvin and Carla are, themselves, not especially hilarious, so a lot of the show's potential will depend on whether the characters they meet every week can balance out the altogether-too-muchness of the pair's whole shtick. Will everyone enjoy Don't Hurt Me, My Healer!? Lord, no. But it might prove to be a decent way to kill a half-hour if nothing else is on.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               You know how they say humor is subjective? Well, for me, this anime is less funny and more like pulling teeth: long, drawn-out, and painful. However, this should be no surprise; it's right there in the title, after all. In Japanese, this show is called “Kono Healer, Mendokusai,” which translates directly to “This Healer is a Pain to Deal With.” And holy crap do I feel that after watching this episode. In fact, it's not just the healer but the warrior and the bear as well; they're all a pain and I didn't enjoy a single moment of this episode.    Honestly, more than anything else, watching this episode felt like reading a particularly volatile comment section on a subject I cared nothing about. Instead of addressing each other's points, they change the subject, passively-aggressively attack each other, move the goalposts, and drag other people into it. It was at the moment the bear started talking that I realized what we were in for—that this argument was going to be our entire episode—and my heart filled with dread.    The only thing that got me through this episode (you know, besides being paid to watch it) was thinking about the simple question: “Is Carla really that dense or is she just messing with everyone?” Because, while it's presented as the former, I'm starting to think it's the latter.

Kazuaki Shimada (The Promised Neverland) is designing the characters, and [K]NoW_NAME (Fairy gone, Dorohedoro, Sakura Quest) is the music producer.

But when he receives the ultimate impossible assignment—get married and have a kid—he may finally be in over his head!

Viz Media added the manga to its app as part of its Shonen Jump subscription in September 2019. The company is also publishing the manga in print.

News Spy×Family Anime Adds 6 Cast Members Including Kensho Ono as Yuri   posted on 2022-04-17 10:19 UTC-8 by Crystalyn Hodgkins         Anime's opening sequence video also streamed    The official website for the television anime of Tatsuya Endō's SPY×FAMILY manga announced six more cast members for the show on Saturday. Toho Animation also began streaming the show's opening theme sequence on Saturday.      The new cast includes:     Kensho Ono as Yuri Briar   Umeka Shouji as Camilla   Manaka Iwami as Millie   Mirei Kumagai as Sharon   Shōhei Kajikawa as Dominic   Junichi Suwabe as Shop Manager of Garden    The anime premiered on April 9. Crunchyroll is streaming the anime as it airs and is also streaming an English dub.    Kazuhiro Furuhashi (Mobile Suit Gundam UC, Rurouni Kenshin, Getbackers, 2019 Dororo) is directing the anime at Wit Studio and CloverWorks. Kazuaki Shimada (The Promised Neverland) is designing the characters, and [K]NoW_NAME (Fairy gone, Dorohedoro, Sakura Quest) is the music producer.    Viz Media is publishing the manga in English, and it describes the story:    Master spy Twilight is the best at what he does when it comes to going undercover on dangerous missions in the name of a better world. But when he receives the ultimate impossible assignment—get married and have a kid—he may finally be in over his head!   Not one to depend on others, Twilight has his work cut out for him procuring both a wife and a child for his mission to infiltrate an elite private school. What he doesn't know is that the wife he's chosen is an assassin and the child he's adopted is a telepath!    Shueisha is offering the manga in English on its MANGA Plus service on the same day. Viz Media added the manga to its app as part of its Shonen Jump subscription in September 2019. The company is also publishing the manga in print.

News Kairi Shimotsuki Ends Rusted Armors: Dawn Manga in May   posted on 2022-04-18 21:15 UTC-8 by Crystalyn Hodgkins          Brave10 author launched manga in multimedia project in May 2021    The May issue of Kadokawa's Monthly Comic Gene magazine revealed on Friday that Kairi Shimotsuki's Sabiiro no Armor: Reimei (Rusted Armors: Dawn) manga will end in the magazine's next issue on May 13.    Shimotsuki (Brave10, Madness, Devil Kings Basara, Arthur Bright) launched the manga in Monthly Comic Gene in May 2021. Kadokawa published the manga's first volume on December 27.    The Sabiiro no Armor (Rusted Armors) franchise is a multimedia project that started as a series of 2.5-D stage plays. The first play ran in 2017. Artist hagi previously launched a manga version in January 2019 in Monthly Comic Gene. The manga's second and final volume shipped in January 2020.    Normally, ""2.5-D"" stage play projects are based on existing anime or manga, but with the Rusted Armors project the stage play started first. Nelke Planning oversees the project. The project focuses on the relationship between the gun-toting Magoichi — who is the leader of the Saika Ikki mercenary group — and the Sengoku era warlord Oda Nobunaga.    A television anime in the franchise premiered on January 9, and Crunchyroll streamed the 12-episode series as it aired.

News Kairi Shimotsuki Ends Rusted Armors: Dawn Manga in May   posted on 2022-04-18 21:15 UTC-8 by Crystalyn Hodgkins          Brave10 author launched manga in multimedia project in May 2021    The May issue of Kadokawa's Monthly Comic Gene magazine revealed on Friday that Kairi Shimotsuki's Sabiiro no Armor: Reimei (Rusted Armors: Dawn) manga will end in the magazine's next issue on May 13.    Shimotsuki (Brave10, Madness, Devil Kings Basara, Arthur Bright) launched the manga in Monthly Comic Gene in May 2021. Kadokawa published the manga's first volume on December 27.    The Sabiiro no Armor (Rusted Armors) franchise is a multimedia project that started as a series of 2.5-D stage plays. The first play ran in 2017. Artist hagi previously launched a manga version in January 2019 in Monthly Comic Gene. The manga's second and final volume shipped in January 2020.    Normally, ""2.5-D"" stage play projects are based on existing anime or manga, but with the Rusted Armors project the stage play started first. Nelke Planning oversees the project. The project focuses on the relationship between the gun-toting Magoichi — who is the leader of the Saika Ikki mercenary group — and the Sengoku era warlord Oda Nobunaga.    A television anime in the franchise premiered on January 9, and Crunchyroll streamed the 12-episode series as it aired.

News Kairi Shimotsuki Ends Rusted Armors: Dawn Manga in May   posted on 2022-04-18 21:15 UTC-8 by Crystalyn Hodgkins          Brave10 author launched manga in multimedia project in May 2021    The May issue of Kadokawa's Monthly Comic Gene magazine revealed on Friday that Kairi Shimotsuki's Sabiiro no Armor: Reimei (Rusted Armors: Dawn) manga will end in the magazine's next issue on May 13.    Shimotsuki (Brave10, Madness, Devil Kings Basara, Arthur Bright) launched the manga in Monthly Comic Gene in May 2021. Kadokawa published the manga's first volume on December 27.    The Sabiiro no Armor (Rusted Armors) franchise is a multimedia project that started as a series of 2.5-D stage plays. The first play ran in 2017. Artist hagi previously launched a manga version in January 2019 in Monthly Comic Gene. The manga's second and final volume shipped in January 2020.    Normally, ""2.5-D"" stage play projects are based on existing anime or manga, but with the Rusted Armors project the stage play started first. Nelke Planning oversees the project. The project focuses on the relationship between the gun-toting Magoichi — who is the leader of the Saika Ikki mercenary group — and the Sengoku era warlord Oda Nobunaga.    A television anime in the franchise premiered on January 9, and Crunchyroll streamed the 12-episode series as it aired.

Shimotsuki (Brave10, Madness, Devil Kings Basara, Arthur Bright) launched the manga in Monthly Comic Gene in May 2021. Kadokawa published the manga's first volume on December 27.    The Sabiiro no Armor (Rusted Armors) franchise is a multimedia project that started as a series of 2.5-D stage plays. The first play ran in 2017. Artist hagi previously launched a manga version in January 2019 in Monthly Comic Gene. The manga's second and final volume shipped in January 2020.    Normally, ""2.5-D"" stage play projects are based on existing anime or manga, but with the Rusted Armors project the stage play started first. Nelke Planning oversees the project. The project focuses on the relationship between the gun-toting Magoichi — who is the leader of the Saika Ikki mercenary group — and the Sengoku era warlord Oda Nobunaga.

PREVIEW: The Mecha Action-Shooter Gundam Evolution   by Jean-Karlo Lemus, Apr 14th 2022          The Gundam universe has no shortage of video game adaptations, and this past week saw the five-day-long network test for Bandai Namco's newest take on the storied franchise. Gundam Evolution stands poised to be the franchise's first-ever free-to-play shooter. We were allowed to take part in the network test for the Steam version of the game and experience it first-hand.

The selection of mech units is surprisingly eclectic: while the traditional RX-78-2 Mobile Suit is of course selectable, armed with its beam cannon and hammer, players can also control the Turn ∀  Gundam, the Gundam Exia, the Barbatos Gundam, and even non-Gundam units like the Guntank, the Zaku II, and the Dom. Each unit controls more or less the same, with the main differences being the nature of their weapons and their skills: while most units like the RX-78 focus on ranged weapons, some units like the Barbatos or the Exia focus on melee attacks. Being mechs, each unit has thrusters that allow for dashes, boosts, and hovering, adding lots of complexity to movement. Each unit also features two unique skills with cooldowns, and a chargeable G-maneuver that unleashes a special skill. During our playtime, we specialized in the Turn ∀ Gundam, which featured a charge shot for their beam canon, a personal healing skill, and a grappling attack. In all, there are 14 playable units.    Gundam Evolution's network test consisted of simple online ranked matches where teams of six compete against each other. Three gameplay modes will be featured in the full game: Point Capture, Domination, and Destruction. Each mode features teams alternating between Attackers and Defenders, tasked with either carrying out specific objectives or preventing the opposing team from carrying them out. Domination requires Attackers to capture one of three randomly-spawning objectives, Destruction requires charging a bomb at a point on the map until it detonates the point, and Point Capture involves simply occupying a point on the map in order to score points. During our time in the Network Test, we only experienced Point Capture. We also only tested out one map, but there was no shortage of excitement to be had. Further gameplay modes have been promised in the future following the full release of the title.     Matches are a good mix of hectic chaos and tense anticipation. A lack of awareness will get you destroyed in short order, thus a keen eye and quick reflexes are essential to survival. It's possible to rescue downed units before they're destroyed, albeit at the risk of leaving yourself open to attackers that are no doubt still in the area. Capture points quickly become heated clashes between teams as they're contested, the ebb and flow of the match varying as units are shot down or respawn to rejoin the fray. A well-balanced match can easily run into overtime as both teams struggle for a foothold above the other. The connections were stable, however we did experience a drop from the network during one particularly heated match. With Gundam Evolution still being tested and refined, we can hope that this problem will be smoothed over.    Gundam Evolution is free-to-play and features an in-game cash shop, as well as a battle pass, alternate skins, and player icons. Old Gundams can be customized with snazzy recolors, while players can set their profile pictures to images of beloved Gundam characters like Amuro Ray or Char Aznable. Skins can also be earned by leveling up with your battle pass; the network test featured an exclusive skin for the RX-78 attainable upon reaching level 20. For the most part, skins seem to be available through a lootbox system, which players buy into via tickets earned from the cash shop or from in-game awards.     In all, Gundam Evolution's network test was a success. While some network issues interrupted the fun and the looming threat of a lootbox system shadows the game, the moment-to-moment gameplay is fun and frantic and the sheer fanservice of zipping through the map as the White Devil, complete with classic Gundam sound effects, is undeniably charming. While a definite release date has yet to be set, players can look forward to Gundam Evolution's release later this year on PS4, Xbox One, PS5, Xbox Series S and X, and Steam.     discuss this in the forum (5 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Feature homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review          1 comment       Hello, Melancholic!

PREVIEW: The Mecha Action-Shooter Gundam Evolution   by Jean-Karlo Lemus, Apr 14th 2022          The Gundam universe has no shortage of video game adaptations, and this past week saw the five-day-long network test for Bandai Namco's newest take on the storied franchise. Gundam Evolution stands poised to be the franchise's first-ever free-to-play shooter. We were allowed to take part in the network test for the Steam version of the game and experience it first-hand.     As the title implies, players operate as specific mobile suits from across the Gundam franchise. The selection of mech units is surprisingly eclectic: while the traditional RX-78-2 Mobile Suit is of course selectable, armed with its beam cannon and hammer, players can also control the Turn ∀  Gundam, the Gundam Exia, the Barbatos Gundam, and even non-Gundam units like the Guntank, the Zaku II, and the Dom. Each unit controls more or less the same, with the main differences being the nature of their weapons and their skills: while most units like the RX-78 focus on ranged weapons, some units like the Barbatos or the Exia focus on melee attacks. Being mechs, each unit has thrusters that allow for dashes, boosts, and hovering, adding lots of complexity to movement. Each unit also features two unique skills with cooldowns, and a chargeable G-maneuver that unleashes a special skill. During our playtime, we specialized in the Turn ∀ Gundam, which featured a charge shot for their beam canon, a personal healing skill, and a grappling attack. In all, there are 14 playable units.    Gundam Evolution's network test consisted of simple online ranked matches where teams of six compete against each other. Three gameplay modes will be featured in the full game: Point Capture, Domination, and Destruction. Each mode features teams alternating between Attackers and Defenders, tasked with either carrying out specific objectives or preventing the opposing team from carrying them out. Domination requires Attackers to capture one of three randomly-spawning objectives, Destruction requires charging a bomb at a point on the map until it detonates the point, and Point Capture involves simply occupying a point on the map in order to score points. During our time in the Network Test, we only experienced Point Capture. We also only tested out one map, but there was no shortage of excitement to be had. Further gameplay modes have been promised in the future following the full release of the title.     Matches are a good mix of hectic chaos and tense anticipation. A lack of awareness will get you destroyed in short order, thus a keen eye and quick reflexes are essential to survival. It's possible to rescue downed units before they're destroyed, albeit at the risk of leaving yourself open to attackers that are no doubt still in the area. Capture points quickly become heated clashes between teams as they're contested, the ebb and flow of the match varying as units are shot down or respawn to rejoin the fray. A well-balanced match can easily run into overtime as both teams struggle for a foothold above the other. The connections were stable, however we did experience a drop from the network during one particularly heated match. With Gundam Evolution still being tested and refined, we can hope that this problem will be smoothed over.    Gundam Evolution is free-to-play and features an in-game cash shop, as well as a battle pass, alternate skins, and player icons. Old Gundams can be customized with snazzy recolors, while players can set their profile pictures to images of beloved Gundam characters like Amuro Ray or Char Aznable. Skins can also be earned by leveling up with your battle pass; the network test featured an exclusive skin for the RX-78 attainable upon reaching level 20. For the most part, skins seem to be available through a lootbox system, which players buy into via tickets earned from the cash shop or from in-game awards.     In all, Gundam Evolution's network test was a success. While some network issues interrupted the fun and the looming threat of a lootbox system shadows the game, the moment-to-moment gameplay is fun and frantic and the sheer fanservice of zipping through the map as the White Devil, complete with classic Gundam sound effects, is undeniably charming. While a definite release date has yet to be set, players can look forward to Gundam Evolution's release later this year on PS4, Xbox One, PS5, Xbox Series S and X, and Steam.     discuss this in the forum (5 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Feature homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review          1 comment       Hello, Melancholic!

PREVIEW: The Mecha Action-Shooter Gundam Evolution   by Jean-Karlo Lemus, Apr 14th 2022          The Gundam universe has no shortage of video game adaptations, and this past week saw the five-day-long network test for Bandai Namco's newest take on the storied franchise. Gundam Evolution stands poised to be the franchise's first-ever free-to-play shooter. We were allowed to take part in the network test for the Steam version of the game and experience it first-hand.     As the title implies, players operate as specific mobile suits from across the Gundam franchise. The selection of mech units is surprisingly eclectic: while the traditional RX-78-2 Mobile Suit is of course selectable, armed with its beam cannon and hammer, players can also control the Turn ∀  Gundam, the Gundam Exia, the Barbatos Gundam, and even non-Gundam units like the Guntank, the Zaku II, and the Dom. Each unit controls more or less the same, with the main differences being the nature of their weapons and their skills: while most units like the RX-78 focus on ranged weapons, some units like the Barbatos or the Exia focus on melee attacks. Being mechs, each unit has thrusters that allow for dashes, boosts, and hovering, adding lots of complexity to movement. Each unit also features two unique skills with cooldowns, and a chargeable G-maneuver that unleashes a special skill. During our playtime, we specialized in the Turn ∀ Gundam, which featured a charge shot for their beam canon, a personal healing skill, and a grappling attack. In all, there are 14 playable units.    Gundam Evolution's network test consisted of simple online ranked matches where teams of six compete against each other. Three gameplay modes will be featured in the full game: Point Capture, Domination, and Destruction. Each mode features teams alternating between Attackers and Defenders, tasked with either carrying out specific objectives or preventing the opposing team from carrying them out. Domination requires Attackers to capture one of three randomly-spawning objectives, Destruction requires charging a bomb at a point on the map until it detonates the point, and Point Capture involves simply occupying a point on the map in order to score points. During our time in the Network Test, we only experienced Point Capture. We also only tested out one map, but there was no shortage of excitement to be had. Further gameplay modes have been promised in the future following the full release of the title.     Matches are a good mix of hectic chaos and tense anticipation. A lack of awareness will get you destroyed in short order, thus a keen eye and quick reflexes are essential to survival. It's possible to rescue downed units before they're destroyed, albeit at the risk of leaving yourself open to attackers that are no doubt still in the area. Capture points quickly become heated clashes between teams as they're contested, the ebb and flow of the match varying as units are shot down or respawn to rejoin the fray. A well-balanced match can easily run into overtime as both teams struggle for a foothold above the other. The connections were stable, however we did experience a drop from the network during one particularly heated match. With Gundam Evolution still being tested and refined, we can hope that this problem will be smoothed over.    Gundam Evolution is free-to-play and features an in-game cash shop, as well as a battle pass, alternate skins, and player icons. Old Gundams can be customized with snazzy recolors, while players can set their profile pictures to images of beloved Gundam characters like Amuro Ray or Char Aznable. Skins can also be earned by leveling up with your battle pass; the network test featured an exclusive skin for the RX-78 attainable upon reaching level 20. For the most part, skins seem to be available through a lootbox system, which players buy into via tickets earned from the cash shop or from in-game awards.     In all, Gundam Evolution's network test was a success. While some network issues interrupted the fun and the looming threat of a lootbox system shadows the game, the moment-to-moment gameplay is fun and frantic and the sheer fanservice of zipping through the map as the White Devil, complete with classic Gundam sound effects, is undeniably charming. While a definite release date has yet to be set, players can look forward to Gundam Evolution's release later this year on PS4, Xbox One, PS5, Xbox Series S and X, and Steam.     discuss this in the forum (5 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Feature homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review          1 comment       Hello, Melancholic!

PREVIEW: The Mecha Action-Shooter Gundam Evolution   by Jean-Karlo Lemus, Apr 14th 2022          The Gundam universe has no shortage of video game adaptations, and this past week saw the five-day-long network test for Bandai Namco's newest take on the storied franchise. Gundam Evolution stands poised to be the franchise's first-ever free-to-play shooter. We were allowed to take part in the network test for the Steam version of the game and experience it first-hand.     As the title implies, players operate as specific mobile suits from across the Gundam franchise. The selection of mech units is surprisingly eclectic: while the traditional RX-78-2 Mobile Suit is of course selectable, armed with its beam cannon and hammer, players can also control the Turn ∀  Gundam, the Gundam Exia, the Barbatos Gundam, and even non-Gundam units like the Guntank, the Zaku II, and the Dom. Each unit controls more or less the same, with the main differences being the nature of their weapons and their skills: while most units like the RX-78 focus on ranged weapons, some units like the Barbatos or the Exia focus on melee attacks. Being mechs, each unit has thrusters that allow for dashes, boosts, and hovering, adding lots of complexity to movement. Each unit also features two unique skills with cooldowns, and a chargeable G-maneuver that unleashes a special skill. During our playtime, we specialized in the Turn ∀ Gundam, which featured a charge shot for their beam canon, a personal healing skill, and a grappling attack. In all, there are 14 playable units.    Gundam Evolution's network test consisted of simple online ranked matches where teams of six compete against each other. Three gameplay modes will be featured in the full game: Point Capture, Domination, and Destruction. Each mode features teams alternating between Attackers and Defenders, tasked with either carrying out specific objectives or preventing the opposing team from carrying them out. Domination requires Attackers to capture one of three randomly-spawning objectives, Destruction requires charging a bomb at a point on the map until it detonates the point, and Point Capture involves simply occupying a point on the map in order to score points. During our time in the Network Test, we only experienced Point Capture. We also only tested out one map, but there was no shortage of excitement to be had. Further gameplay modes have been promised in the future following the full release of the title.     Matches are a good mix of hectic chaos and tense anticipation. A lack of awareness will get you destroyed in short order, thus a keen eye and quick reflexes are essential to survival. It's possible to rescue downed units before they're destroyed, albeit at the risk of leaving yourself open to attackers that are no doubt still in the area. Capture points quickly become heated clashes between teams as they're contested, the ebb and flow of the match varying as units are shot down or respawn to rejoin the fray. A well-balanced match can easily run into overtime as both teams struggle for a foothold above the other. The connections were stable, however we did experience a drop from the network during one particularly heated match. With Gundam Evolution still being tested and refined, we can hope that this problem will be smoothed over.    Gundam Evolution is free-to-play and features an in-game cash shop, as well as a battle pass, alternate skins, and player icons. Old Gundams can be customized with snazzy recolors, while players can set their profile pictures to images of beloved Gundam characters like Amuro Ray or Char Aznable. Skins can also be earned by leveling up with your battle pass; the network test featured an exclusive skin for the RX-78 attainable upon reaching level 20. For the most part, skins seem to be available through a lootbox system, which players buy into via tickets earned from the cash shop or from in-game awards.     In all, Gundam Evolution's network test was a success. While some network issues interrupted the fun and the looming threat of a lootbox system shadows the game, the moment-to-moment gameplay is fun and frantic and the sheer fanservice of zipping through the map as the White Devil, complete with classic Gundam sound effects, is undeniably charming. While a definite release date has yet to be set, players can look forward to Gundam Evolution's release later this year on PS4, Xbox One, PS5, Xbox Series S and X, and Steam.     discuss this in the forum (5 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Feature homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review          1 comment       Hello, Melancholic!

Interest Newspaper Ad for Raunchy Tawawa on Monday Manga Draws Ire   posted on 2022-04-16 02:45 UTC-8 by Lynzee Loveridge         The global gender equality group UN Women deems ad ""unacceptable,"" calls for explanation from The Nikkei newspaper    A full-page ad for the Tawawa on Monday (Getsuyōbi no Tawawa) fanservice manga series was published in The Nikkei newspaper on April 4 and has since drawn criticism from the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women). The global gender equality organization issued a letter to the newspaper on April 11 stating that the advertisement is ""unacceptable"" and asked for further clarification about the choice to print it.     電車で紙の日経読んでいたら月曜日のたわわの広告を発見(　ﾟ∀ﾟ)o彡° pic.twitter.com/ggc3eKoJ6D— kissshot2015 (@Kissshot2015) April 4, 2022     The ad shows main character Ai standing in profile in her school uniform. The text reads, ""I hope this will be a wonderful week."" Kodansha placed the ad to promote the release of the manga's fourth volume.    ""April 4th is the first Monday of the year for new employees,"" a representative from Young Magazine told Comic Natalie. ""We put up a full-page ad to blow away their anxiety and cheer them up"".""    The manga series began in 2015 as weekly pin-ups posted on artist  Kiseki Himura's Twitter account. The main character, Ai, is a high school girl with large breasts who encounters a businessman on the train ride to school. The girl's regular appearance on the train brightens up the man's gloomy Monday commute.    The Nikkei paper is part of UN Women's Unstereotype Alliance effort, a global campaign to promote ""gender equality through media and advertising and eliminate harmful stereotypes."" The Nikkei paper has taken an active role in promoting the initiative's ideas in the past, including the ""Nikkei Woman Empowerment Advertising Award,"" which recognizes advertisements that contribute to gender equality. The award has a three-step process for screening ads known as ""The 3 Ps"" - Presence (does the ad include diverse people?), Perspective (does it take the perspectives of both men and women into account?), and Personality (does the subject show personality and independence?).    Kae Ishikawa, the director of UN Women's Japan-based office, was interviewed by The Huffington Post about the advertisement, which sparked additional controversy online. According to Ishikawa, the manga ad fails to meet the requirements outlined in The 3 Ps. She told The Huffington Post that the ad reflects a male-centric view of high school girls and that their personality is limited to being sexually enticing to men.    ""Obviously, advertising a manga about a underage girl as a male sexual target risks promoting stereotypes that impose these roles on women,"" Ishikawa said.    Part of the issue is the newspaper's target audience, according to Tokyo Institute of Technology professor Renge Jibu. The Nikkei is the largest business newspaper in Japan, akin to the U.S.'s The Wall Street Journal or the U.K.'s Financial Times. The choice to run the ad there was more likely to draw attention from people who didn't want to see it.    ""It's not a problem for people who want to read Young Magazine to pick it up and read it there,"" Professor Jibu said. ""Rather, the problem is that the media failed to protect the 'right of women and men who do not like sexually explicit manga not to be exposed to expressions they do not want to see.'""    The Nikkei's PR office told The Huffington Post that the company is aware of the current controversy revolving around the ad but do not comment on individual ad placement decisions.    Kodansha issued a statement to The Huffington Post in light of the online controversy. The company said, ""The advertisement was placed in conjunction with the release of the new book in order to attract new readers. We take your comments seriously and will give full consideration to the future development of our advertising.""    Ishikawa told The Huffington Post that she was told by a representative in a meeting with the newspaper that the advertisement was evaluated by various people in the company, but they did not recognize the ad as a problem. She also stated the organization is not questioning the publishers and creators of works like Tawawa on Monday, only the role The Nikkei played in placing the ad due to the publication's status as part of the Unstereotype Alliance effort.    ""Without an explanation from the company, I am not convinced that we will continue to work with them to promote gender equality through the power of advertising,"" Ishikawa said.    Publishing organizations in other countries have stricter guidelines relating to gender equality in advertisements. For example, the U.K.-based Advertising Standards Association has banned advertising using ""harmful stereotypes based on gender"" since 2019.    ""This full-page advertisement has made it clear that Japanese companies and the media are left behind in these international trends,"" said Professor Jibu.    UN Women have asked for a timely response from The Nikkei but have not received a response.    Even the series' anime adaptation has faced some controversy in the past. The first 12-episode season of anime shorts debuted on YouTube in October 2016, but YouTube removed the first episode before restoring it within the same week. NBCUniversal Entertainment Japan relaunched the series on Nico Nico Video beginning with the second episode.    Similar controversies have sparked discussion in the past, including a free Red Cross poster of the titular character from Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out! and a panel of Love Live! Sunshine!! character Chika Takami to promote Nishiura oranges.  In 2015, a sightseeing association in Minokamo, Gifu Prefecture changed a promotional poster depicting a No-Rin character in a sensual pose after receiving complaints that it was inappropriate.    Getsuyōbi no Tawawa  began serializing in Kodansha's Weekly Young Magazine in November 2020. Crunchyroll is streaming both anime seasons on its platform.

Interest Newspaper Ad for Raunchy Tawawa on Monday Manga Draws Ire   posted on 2022-04-16 02:45 UTC-8 by Lynzee Loveridge         The global gender equality group UN Women deems ad ""unacceptable,"" calls for explanation from The Nikkei newspaper    A full-page ad for the Tawawa on Monday (Getsuyōbi no Tawawa) fanservice manga series was published in The Nikkei newspaper on April 4 and has since drawn criticism from the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women). The global gender equality organization issued a letter to the newspaper on April 11 stating that the advertisement is ""unacceptable"" and asked for further clarification about the choice to print it.     電車で紙の日経読んでいたら月曜日のたわわの広告を発見(　ﾟ∀ﾟ)o彡° pic.twitter.com/ggc3eKoJ6D— kissshot2015 (@Kissshot2015) April 4, 2022     The ad shows main character Ai standing in profile in her school uniform. The text reads, ""I hope this will be a wonderful week."" Kodansha placed the ad to promote the release of the manga's fourth volume.    ""April 4th is the first Monday of the year for new employees,"" a representative from Young Magazine told Comic Natalie. ""We put up a full-page ad to blow away their anxiety and cheer them up"".""    The manga series began in 2015 as weekly pin-ups posted on artist  Kiseki Himura's Twitter account. The main character, Ai, is a high school girl with large breasts who encounters a businessman on the train ride to school. The girl's regular appearance on the train brightens up the man's gloomy Monday commute.    The Nikkei paper is part of UN Women's Unstereotype Alliance effort, a global campaign to promote ""gender equality through media and advertising and eliminate harmful stereotypes."" The Nikkei paper has taken an active role in promoting the initiative's ideas in the past, including the ""Nikkei Woman Empowerment Advertising Award,"" which recognizes advertisements that contribute to gender equality. The award has a three-step process for screening ads known as ""The 3 Ps"" - Presence (does the ad include diverse people?), Perspective (does it take the perspectives of both men and women into account?), and Personality (does the subject show personality and independence?).    Kae Ishikawa, the director of UN Women's Japan-based office, was interviewed by The Huffington Post about the advertisement, which sparked additional controversy online. According to Ishikawa, the manga ad fails to meet the requirements outlined in The 3 Ps. She told The Huffington Post that the ad reflects a male-centric view of high school girls and that their personality is limited to being sexually enticing to men.    ""Obviously, advertising a manga about a underage girl as a male sexual target risks promoting stereotypes that impose these roles on women,"" Ishikawa said.    Part of the issue is the newspaper's target audience, according to Tokyo Institute of Technology professor Renge Jibu. The Nikkei is the largest business newspaper in Japan, akin to the U.S.'s The Wall Street Journal or the U.K.'s Financial Times. The choice to run the ad there was more likely to draw attention from people who didn't want to see it.    ""It's not a problem for people who want to read Young Magazine to pick it up and read it there,"" Professor Jibu said. ""Rather, the problem is that the media failed to protect the 'right of women and men who do not like sexually explicit manga not to be exposed to expressions they do not want to see.'""    The Nikkei's PR office told The Huffington Post that the company is aware of the current controversy revolving around the ad but do not comment on individual ad placement decisions.    Kodansha issued a statement to The Huffington Post in light of the online controversy. The company said, ""The advertisement was placed in conjunction with the release of the new book in order to attract new readers. We take your comments seriously and will give full consideration to the future development of our advertising.""    Ishikawa told The Huffington Post that she was told by a representative in a meeting with the newspaper that the advertisement was evaluated by various people in the company, but they did not recognize the ad as a problem. She also stated the organization is not questioning the publishers and creators of works like Tawawa on Monday, only the role The Nikkei played in placing the ad due to the publication's status as part of the Unstereotype Alliance effort.    ""Without an explanation from the company, I am not convinced that we will continue to work with them to promote gender equality through the power of advertising,"" Ishikawa said.    Publishing organizations in other countries have stricter guidelines relating to gender equality in advertisements. For example, the U.K.-based Advertising Standards Association has banned advertising using ""harmful stereotypes based on gender"" since 2019.    ""This full-page advertisement has made it clear that Japanese companies and the media are left behind in these international trends,"" said Professor Jibu.    UN Women have asked for a timely response from The Nikkei but have not received a response.    Even the series' anime adaptation has faced some controversy in the past. The first 12-episode season of anime shorts debuted on YouTube in October 2016, but YouTube removed the first episode before restoring it within the same week. NBCUniversal Entertainment Japan relaunched the series on Nico Nico Video beginning with the second episode.    Similar controversies have sparked discussion in the past, including a free Red Cross poster of the titular character from Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out! and a panel of Love Live! Sunshine!! character Chika Takami to promote Nishiura oranges.  In 2015, a sightseeing association in Minokamo, Gifu Prefecture changed a promotional poster depicting a No-Rin character in a sensual pose after receiving complaints that it was inappropriate.    Getsuyōbi no Tawawa  began serializing in Kodansha's Weekly Young Magazine in November 2020. Crunchyroll is streaming both anime seasons on its platform.

According to Ishikawa, the manga ad fails to meet the requirements outlined in The 3 Ps. She told The Huffington Post that the ad reflects a male-centric view of high school girls and that their personality is limited to being sexually enticing to men.    ""Obviously, advertising a manga about a underage girl as a male sexual target risks promoting stereotypes that impose these roles on women,"" Ishikawa said.    Part of the issue is the newspaper's target audience, according to Tokyo Institute of Technology professor Renge Jibu. The Nikkei is the largest business newspaper in Japan, akin to the U.S.'s The Wall Street Journal or the U.K.'s Financial Times. The choice to run the ad there was more likely to draw attention from people who didn't want to see it.    ""It's not a problem for people who want to read Young Magazine to pick it up and read it there,"" Professor Jibu said. ""Rather, the problem is that the media failed to protect the 'right of women and men who do not like sexually explicit manga not to be exposed to expressions they do not want to see.'""    The Nikkei's PR office told The Huffington Post that the company is aware of the current controversy revolving around the ad but do not comment on individual ad placement decisions.    Kodansha issued a statement to The Huffington Post in light of the online controversy. The company said, ""The advertisement was placed in conjunction with the release of the new book in order to attract new readers. We take your comments seriously and will give full consideration to the future development of our advertising.""    Ishikawa told The Huffington Post that she was told by a representative in a meeting with the newspaper that the advertisement was evaluated by various people in the company, but they did not recognize the ad as a problem. She also stated the organization is not questioning the publishers and creators of works like Tawawa on Monday, only the role The Nikkei played in placing the ad due to the publication's status as part of the Unstereotype Alliance effort.    ""Without an explanation from the company, I am not convinced that we will continue to work with them to promote gender equality through the power of advertising,"" Ishikawa said.    Publishing organizations in other countries have stricter guidelines relating to gender equality in advertisements. For example, the U.K.-based Advertising Standards Association has banned advertising using ""harmful stereotypes based on gender"" since 2019.    ""This full-page advertisement has made it clear that Japanese companies and the media are left behind in these international trends,"" said Professor Jibu.    UN Women have asked for a timely response from The Nikkei but have not received a response.    Even the series' anime adaptation has faced some controversy in the past. The first 12-episode season of anime shorts debuted on YouTube in October 2016, but YouTube removed the first episode before restoring it within the same week. NBCUniversal Entertainment Japan relaunched the series on Nico Nico Video beginning with the second episode.    Similar controversies have sparked discussion in the past, including a free Red Cross poster of the titular character from Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out! and a panel of Love Live! Sunshine!! character Chika Takami to promote Nishiura oranges.  In 2015, a sightseeing association in Minokamo, Gifu Prefecture changed a promotional poster depicting a No-Rin character in a sensual pose after receiving complaints that it was inappropriate.    Getsuyōbi no Tawawa  began serializing in Kodansha's Weekly Young Magazine in November 2020. Crunchyroll is streaming both anime seasons on its platform.

Interest Newspaper Ad for Raunchy Tawawa on Monday Manga Draws Ire   posted on 2022-04-16 02:45 UTC-8 by Lynzee Loveridge         The global gender equality group UN Women deems ad ""unacceptable,"" calls for explanation from The Nikkei newspaper    A full-page ad for the Tawawa on Monday (Getsuyōbi no Tawawa) fanservice manga series was published in The Nikkei newspaper on April 4 and has since drawn criticism from the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women). The global gender equality organization issued a letter to the newspaper on April 11 stating that the advertisement is ""unacceptable"" and asked for further clarification about the choice to print it.     電車で紙の日経読んでいたら月曜日のたわわの広告を発見(　ﾟ∀ﾟ)o彡° pic.twitter.com/ggc3eKoJ6D— kissshot2015 (@Kissshot2015) April 4, 2022     The ad shows main character Ai standing in profile in her school uniform. The text reads, ""I hope this will be a wonderful week."" Kodansha placed the ad to promote the release of the manga's fourth volume.    ""April 4th is the first Monday of the year for new employees,"" a representative from Young Magazine told Comic Natalie. ""We put up a full-page ad to blow away their anxiety and cheer them up"".""    The manga series began in 2015 as weekly pin-ups posted on artist  Kiseki Himura's Twitter account. The main character, Ai, is a high school girl with large breasts who encounters a businessman on the train ride to school. The girl's regular appearance on the train brightens up the man's gloomy Monday commute.    The Nikkei paper is part of UN Women's Unstereotype Alliance effort, a global campaign to promote ""gender equality through media and advertising and eliminate harmful stereotypes."" The Nikkei paper has taken an active role in promoting the initiative's ideas in the past, including the ""Nikkei Woman Empowerment Advertising Award,"" which recognizes advertisements that contribute to gender equality. The award has a three-step process for screening ads known as ""The 3 Ps"" - Presence (does the ad include diverse people?), Perspective (does it take the perspectives of both men and women into account?), and Personality (does the subject show personality and independence?).

Interest Newspaper Ad for Raunchy Tawawa on Monday Manga Draws Ire   posted on 2022-04-16 02:45 UTC-8 by Lynzee Loveridge         The global gender equality group UN Women deems ad ""unacceptable,"" calls for explanation from The Nikkei newspaper    A full-page ad for the Tawawa on Monday (Getsuyōbi no Tawawa) fanservice manga series was published in The Nikkei newspaper on April 4 and has since drawn criticism from the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women). The global gender equality organization issued a letter to the newspaper on April 11 stating that the advertisement is ""unacceptable"" and asked for further clarification about the choice to print it.     電車で紙の日経読んでいたら月曜日のたわわの広告を発見(　ﾟ∀ﾟ)o彡° pic.twitter.com/ggc3eKoJ6D— kissshot2015 (@Kissshot2015) April 4, 2022     The ad shows main character Ai standing in profile in her school uniform. The text reads, ""I hope this will be a wonderful week."" Kodansha placed the ad to promote the release of the manga's fourth volume.    ""April 4th is the first Monday of the year for new employees,"" a representative from Young Magazine told Comic Natalie. ""We put up a full-page ad to blow away their anxiety and cheer them up"".""    The manga series began in 2015 as weekly pin-ups posted on artist  Kiseki Himura's Twitter account. The main character, Ai, is a high school girl with large breasts who encounters a businessman on the train ride to school. The girl's regular appearance on the train brightens up the man's gloomy Monday commute.    The Nikkei paper is part of UN Women's Unstereotype Alliance effort, a global campaign to promote ""gender equality through media and advertising and eliminate harmful stereotypes."" The Nikkei paper has taken an active role in promoting the initiative's ideas in the past, including the ""Nikkei Woman Empowerment Advertising Award,"" which recognizes advertisements that contribute to gender equality. The award has a three-step process for screening ads known as ""The 3 Ps"" - Presence (does the ad include diverse people?), Perspective (does it take the perspectives of both men and women into account?), and Personality (does the subject show personality and independence?).    Kae Ishikawa, the director of UN Women's Japan-based office, was interviewed by The Huffington Post about the advertisement, which sparked additional controversy online. According to Ishikawa, the manga ad fails to meet the requirements outlined in The 3 Ps. She told The Huffington Post that the ad reflects a male-centric view of high school girls and that their personality is limited to being sexually enticing to men.    ""Obviously, advertising a manga about a underage girl as a male sexual target risks promoting stereotypes that impose these roles on women,"" Ishikawa said.    Part of the issue is the newspaper's target audience, according to Tokyo Institute of Technology professor Renge Jibu. The Nikkei is the largest business newspaper in Japan, akin to the U.S.'s The Wall Street Journal or the U.K.'s Financial Times. The choice to run the ad there was more likely to draw attention from people who didn't want to see it.    ""It's not a problem for people who want to read Young Magazine to pick it up and read it there,"" Professor Jibu said. ""Rather, the problem is that the media failed to protect the 'right of women and men who do not like sexually explicit manga not to be exposed to expressions they do not want to see.'""    The Nikkei's PR office told The Huffington Post that the company is aware of the current controversy revolving around the ad but do not comment on individual ad placement decisions.    Kodansha issued a statement to The Huffington Post in light of the online controversy. The company said, ""The advertisement was placed in conjunction with the release of the new book in order to attract new readers. We take your comments seriously and will give full consideration to the future development of our advertising.""    Ishikawa told The Huffington Post that she was told by a representative in a meeting with the newspaper that the advertisement was evaluated by various people in the company, but they did not recognize the ad as a problem. She also stated the organization is not questioning the publishers and creators of works like Tawawa on Monday, only the role The Nikkei played in placing the ad due to the publication's status as part of the Unstereotype Alliance effort.    ""Without an explanation from the company, I am not convinced that we will continue to work with them to promote gender equality through the power of advertising,"" Ishikawa said.    Publishing organizations in other countries have stricter guidelines relating to gender equality in advertisements. For example, the U.K.-based Advertising Standards Association has banned advertising using ""harmful stereotypes based on gender"" since 2019.    ""This full-page advertisement has made it clear that Japanese companies and the media are left behind in these international trends,"" said Professor Jibu.    UN Women have asked for a timely response from The Nikkei but have not received a response.    Even the series' anime adaptation has faced some controversy in the past. The first 12-episode season of anime shorts debuted on YouTube in October 2016, but YouTube removed the first episode before restoring it within the same week. NBCUniversal Entertainment Japan relaunched the series on Nico Nico Video beginning with the second episode.    Similar controversies have sparked discussion in the past, including a free Red Cross poster of the titular character from Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out! and a panel of Love Live! Sunshine!! character Chika Takami to promote Nishiura oranges.  In 2015, a sightseeing association in Minokamo, Gifu Prefecture changed a promotional poster depicting a No-Rin character in a sensual pose after receiving complaints that it was inappropriate.    Getsuyōbi no Tawawa  began serializing in Kodansha's Weekly Young Magazine in November 2020. Crunchyroll is streaming both anime seasons on its platform.

The global gender equality organization issued a letter to the newspaper on April 11 stating that the advertisement is ""unacceptable"" and asked for further clarification about the choice to print it.     電車で紙の日経読んでいたら月曜日のたわわの広告を発見(　ﾟ∀ﾟ)o彡° pic.twitter.com/ggc3eKoJ6D— kissshot2015 (@Kissshot2015) April 4, 2022     The ad shows main character Ai standing in profile in her school uniform. The text reads, ""I hope this will be a wonderful week."" Kodansha placed the ad to promote the release of the manga's fourth volume.    ""April 4th is the first Monday of the year for new employees,"" a representative from Young Magazine told Comic Natalie. ""We put up a full-page ad to blow away their anxiety and cheer them up"".""    The manga series began in 2015 as weekly pin-ups posted on artist  Kiseki Himura's Twitter account. The main character, Ai, is a high school girl with large breasts who encounters a businessman on the train ride to school. The girl's regular appearance on the train brightens up the man's gloomy Monday commute.    The Nikkei paper is part of UN Women's Unstereotype Alliance effort, a global campaign to promote ""gender equality through media and advertising and eliminate harmful stereotypes."" The Nikkei paper has taken an active role in promoting the initiative's ideas in the past, including the ""Nikkei Woman Empowerment Advertising Award,"" which recognizes advertisements that contribute to gender equality. The award has a three-step process for screening ads known as ""The 3 Ps"" - Presence (does the ad include diverse people?), Perspective (does it take the perspectives of both men and women into account?), and Personality (does the subject show personality and independence?).    Kae Ishikawa, the director of UN Women's Japan-based office, was interviewed by The Huffington Post about the advertisement, which sparked additional controversy online. According to Ishikawa, the manga ad fails to meet the requirements outlined in The 3 Ps. She told The Huffington Post that the ad reflects a male-centric view of high school girls and that their personality is limited to being sexually enticing to men.    ""Obviously, advertising a manga about a underage girl as a male sexual target risks promoting stereotypes that impose these roles on women,"" Ishikawa said.    Part of the issue is the newspaper's target audience, according to Tokyo Institute of Technology professor Renge Jibu. The Nikkei is the largest business newspaper in Japan, akin to the U.S.'s The Wall Street Journal or the U.K.'s Financial Times. The choice to run the ad there was more likely to draw attention from people who didn't want to see it.    ""It's not a problem for people who want to read Young Magazine to pick it up and read it there,"" Professor Jibu said. ""Rather, the problem is that the media failed to protect the 'right of women and men who do not like sexually explicit manga not to be exposed to expressions they do not want to see.'""    The Nikkei's PR office told The Huffington Post that the company is aware of the current controversy revolving around the ad but do not comment on individual ad placement decisions.    Kodansha issued a statement to The Huffington Post in light of the online controversy. The company said, ""The advertisement was placed in conjunction with the release of the new book in order to attract new readers. We take your comments seriously and will give full consideration to the future development of our advertising.""    Ishikawa told The Huffington Post that she was told by a representative in a meeting with the newspaper that the advertisement was evaluated by various people in the company, but they did not recognize the ad as a problem. She also stated the organization is not questioning the publishers and creators of works like Tawawa on Monday, only the role The Nikkei played in placing the ad due to the publication's status as part of the Unstereotype Alliance effort.    ""Without an explanation from the company, I am not convinced that we will continue to work with them to promote gender equality through the power of advertising,"" Ishikawa said.    Publishing organizations in other countries have stricter guidelines relating to gender equality in advertisements. For example, the U.K.-based Advertising Standards Association has banned advertising using ""harmful stereotypes based on gender"" since 2019.    ""This full-page advertisement has made it clear that Japanese companies and the media are left behind in these international trends,"" said Professor Jibu.    UN Women have asked for a timely response from The Nikkei but have not received a response.    Even the series' anime adaptation has faced some controversy in the past.

The global gender equality organization issued a letter to the newspaper on April 11 stating that the advertisement is ""unacceptable"" and asked for further clarification about the choice to print it.     電車で紙の日経読んでいたら月曜日のたわわの広告を発見(　ﾟ∀ﾟ)o彡° pic.twitter.com/ggc3eKoJ6D— kissshot2015 (@Kissshot2015) April 4, 2022     The ad shows main character Ai standing in profile in her school uniform. The text reads, ""I hope this will be a wonderful week."" Kodansha placed the ad to promote the release of the manga's fourth volume.    ""April 4th is the first Monday of the year for new employees,"" a representative from Young Magazine told Comic Natalie. ""We put up a full-page ad to blow away their anxiety and cheer them up"".""    The manga series began in 2015 as weekly pin-ups posted on artist  Kiseki Himura's Twitter account. The main character, Ai, is a high school girl with large breasts who encounters a businessman on the train ride to school. The girl's regular appearance on the train brightens up the man's gloomy Monday commute.    The Nikkei paper is part of UN Women's Unstereotype Alliance effort, a global campaign to promote ""gender equality through media and advertising and eliminate harmful stereotypes."" The Nikkei paper has taken an active role in promoting the initiative's ideas in the past, including the ""Nikkei Woman Empowerment Advertising Award,"" which recognizes advertisements that contribute to gender equality. The award has a three-step process for screening ads known as ""The 3 Ps"" - Presence (does the ad include diverse people?), Perspective (does it take the perspectives of both men and women into account?), and Personality (does the subject show personality and independence?).    Kae Ishikawa, the director of UN Women's Japan-based office, was interviewed by The Huffington Post about the advertisement, which sparked additional controversy online. According to Ishikawa, the manga ad fails to meet the requirements outlined in The 3 Ps. She told The Huffington Post that the ad reflects a male-centric view of high school girls and that their personality is limited to being sexually enticing to men.    ""Obviously, advertising a manga about a underage girl as a male sexual target risks promoting stereotypes that impose these roles on women,"" Ishikawa said.    Part of the issue is the newspaper's target audience, according to Tokyo Institute of Technology professor Renge Jibu. The Nikkei is the largest business newspaper in Japan, akin to the U.S.'s The Wall Street Journal or the U.K.'s Financial Times. The choice to run the ad there was more likely to draw attention from people who didn't want to see it.    ""It's not a problem for people who want to read Young Magazine to pick it up and read it there,"" Professor Jibu said. ""Rather, the problem is that the media failed to protect the 'right of women and men who do not like sexually explicit manga not to be exposed to expressions they do not want to see.'""    The Nikkei's PR office told The Huffington Post that the company is aware of the current controversy revolving around the ad but do not comment on individual ad placement decisions.    Kodansha issued a statement to The Huffington Post in light of the online controversy. The company said, ""The advertisement was placed in conjunction with the release of the new book in order to attract new readers. We take your comments seriously and will give full consideration to the future development of our advertising.""    Ishikawa told The Huffington Post that she was told by a representative in a meeting with the newspaper that the advertisement was evaluated by various people in the company, but they did not recognize the ad as a problem. She also stated the organization is not questioning the publishers and creators of works like Tawawa on Monday, only the role The Nikkei played in placing the ad due to the publication's status as part of the Unstereotype Alliance effort.    ""Without an explanation from the company, I am not convinced that we will continue to work with them to promote gender equality through the power of advertising,"" Ishikawa said.    Publishing organizations in other countries have stricter guidelines relating to gender equality in advertisements. For example, the U.K.-based Advertising Standards Association has banned advertising using ""harmful stereotypes based on gender"" since 2019.    ""This full-page advertisement has made it clear that Japanese companies and the media are left behind in these international trends,"" said Professor Jibu.    UN Women have asked for a timely response from The Nikkei but have not received a response.    Even the series' anime adaptation has faced some controversy in the past. The first 12-episode season of anime shorts debuted on YouTube in October 2016, but YouTube removed the first episode before restoring it within the same week. NBCUniversal Entertainment Japan relaunched the series on Nico Nico Video beginning with the second episode.    Similar controversies have sparked discussion in the past, including a free Red Cross poster of the titular character from Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out! and a panel of Love Live! Sunshine!! character Chika Takami to promote Nishiura oranges.  In 2015, a sightseeing association in Minokamo, Gifu Prefecture changed a promotional poster depicting a No-Rin character in a sensual pose after receiving complaints that it was inappropriate.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost   Apr  8th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost ?                     Community score: 3.4              What is this?   Fushihara is a woman who is a ""slave"" to her company. She meets Yūrei, the ghost girl who wants to help her.    Shachiku-san wa Yо̄jo Yuurei ni Iyasaretai. is based on Imari Arita's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                So, here's the question of the day for you all. Does this episode—and perhaps the entire anime—count as a dead baby joke? Because I've been wondering that since the moment I started watching.    This episode is built around the joke that working at your average Japanese company is more terrifying than ghosts. Shachiku is a hard worker and is thus exploited by her lazy boss who forces her to do all the work he can't be bothered with. This results in late nights working all alone. And even when faced with a supernatural being coming to kill her, she simply works on. Or to put it another way, it's only a matter of time until she wakes up reincarnated in another world.    Enter our innocent baby ghost. She doesn't want Shachiku to die and is hoping to find a way to help her. Of course, the best help would be forcing Shachiku to go home and sleep, but when that fails, our little ghost turns to massages, tea breaks, and loving hugs to help the overworked woman power through. It's all very cute—but that's not enough to keep the episode interesting.    This is made worse by how the episode is directed. We see the same scenes (lunch time and Shachiku's first encounter with the ghost) several times. Sure, sometimes it's from Shachiku's point of view and sometimes it's from the ghosts—and sometimes it confusingly switches between them in the same scene. It gets repetitive and boring. And honestly, I found the show more depressing than funny or cute due to the premise alone. Overwork is still a serious issue here and I've seen more than a few friends overworked into depression.    In the end, this show lives or dies on how much you enjoy the cuteness overload of the baby ghost. If that's your cup of tea, you'll be just fine watching it. If you need more than cuteness in your anime, however, you might want to pass on this one.      Caitlin Moore  Rating:                If I were to describe Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost in a single word, it would be “cloying.” If reviews have to be more than one word, I would calling it cloying, mawkish, saccharine, treacly, twee, sickly sweet, maudlin, insipid, and akin to chugging a gallon bottle of liquid sucralose. It has no flavor profile beyond sweet, no interests beyond making you say, “Dawwww, how pwecioush,” if you're not barfing in the corner from being force fed a pound of aspartame. You notice how I'm only comparing it to artificial sweeteners? That's because there's not a single real thing about this.    In case you're new here, hi, I'm Caitlin and I work in early childhood education with children from the ages of six months to three years. I have an extremely limited tolerance for fictional children that don't act even remotely like real children, and I gotta say, the baby ghost resembles a real toddler about as much as a maltipoo resembles a wolf. She exists to be cute and emotionally support Fushihara as she works late into the night upon the orders of her asshole boss, and really nothing else. Real children are to her as what biblical angels are to those naked cherub paintings they sell in Christian tchotchke shops.    This is ostensibly a comedy, but every punchline consists of, “The baby ghost does something and it's cute!” It lingers on her teary eyes, her tiny pigeon-toed feet, her blobby little hands, but it doesn't take much to realize that there was never an actual joke. The humor doesn't land so much as squirm about slowly about like those slugs that keep eating my goddamn pansies and sorry, what were we talking about again? Miss Shachiku is so agonizingly boring that my mind keeps sliding away from it like a slug sliding across the dirt to get to my pansies oops it happened again. Better wrap this up.    Don't watch Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost if you like kids. Stay away if you have even the slightest concept of what makes young children funny and weird and infuriating and a joy to spend time with. Skip it if you see children for what they are, as small humans learning about the ways the world works and also happen to act like tiny drunk adults most of the time.      James Beckett  Rating:                Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost is one of those anime that we seem to get one or two of every season that forces me to ask one very simple question: “Why the hell wasn't this thing a short?” Within just the first couple of minutes, I was already worried that I wouldn't jive with this comedy's particular focus on overbearing cutesy-poo fluff, but when I saw that the episode was a full half-hour, my heart sank. And I hadn't even gotten to the second half of the premiere yet.    The main issue with Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost is that it isn't funny. At all. It doesn't even really have proper jokes, outside of the recurring bit where the titular ghost implores the titular Miss Shachiku to go home and sleep, rather than be worked to death, and Fushihara refuses because she wants to gush over how cute the ghost is. That's it. That's the whole premise. Every other potential joke is ruined by the episode's horrid pacing. There's certainly comedy to be mined from satirizing Japan's hostile workplace culture, dark as it may be, but Miss Shachiku seems content to have the little ghost make a bunch of baby noises for an interminably long time while its overworked protagonist gleefully rides the Overtime Monorail into an early grave.    Also—and this may be my leftover hangover from Heroines Run the School talking—we need to have a conversation about these shows that try to get away with forcing their voice actresses to make the most insufferable toddler sounds imaginable for thirty minutes straight and passing it off as comedy. I'm not going to pretend that I was jazzed about the core concept of the baby ghost to begin with, since I was turned off from the moment that I realized that the subtitles were going to have her say things like “Pwease” for the whole show. Outside of the ghost's voice and mannerisms, though, there was nothing outright offensive or unbearable about Miss Shachiku. It was mostly just slow and unfunny, which I could tolerate for a few minutes.    Then the second half of the episode kicked in, in which we see the events of the first half of the episode from the ghost's perspective, and all of it was so utterly pointless and unnecessary that I actually started getting mad. Did we need to really need to watch the ghost putter about and talk to herself about things that we already saw her say and do in the previous half? The gag of the ghost using a little speaker to sound scary was the closest that the opening came to a decent joke; did the show really need to kill it by overexplaining where she got it and how she decided to use it? Did somebody on the production committee just want to play a cruel prank on project No.9 by forcing the staff to animate four times as much as they needed to for this thing, and then they decided to keep it all in the show to add insult to injury?    I don't know. All I know is that Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost was the exact opposite of a good time, for me. There are better slice-of-life anime, better workplace comedies, and better ghost stories out there to have fun with. Don't let this one haunt your Spring Season.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I almost feel badly about giving this show such a low rating, because it's clearly trying its hardest. There's a sort of earnestness about the whole thing that ought to make it more appealing than it is, a sort of well-meaning cuteness that's clearly intended to soothe the tired soul. But there's a fine line between “soothing” and “boring,” and I'm afraid that Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost crosses it with wild abandon, trying its best to be as charming as possible without actually understanding what makes something sweet.    Mostly that's because I felt a bit talked down to by the episode. Our protagonist, Fushihara, is being overworked by her boss when a baby ghost (or a ghost baby) starts telling her to leave the building. The ghost is just concerned for Fushihara's well-being, and also thinks she's paying the woman back for the “offerings” of onigiri; meanwhile we know that Fushihara and the other workers have been wondering who keeps stealing their lunches. It's almost too deliberately adorable to actually be cute, and there's a real sense that we're being hit over the head with things that we're meant to find warm and fuzzy without them being that way naturally. Things like the baby ghost laying out a futon for Fushihara and then falling asleep in it herself reek of the sort of manufactured little kid behavior that not many real kids exhibit, as if the ghost was written by someone with an academic idea of toddlers without ever having interacted with one.    Of course, it's a show about a ghost (and a nekomata, a fox, an oni, and a teeny tiny maid, if the opening theme is to be believed), so realism isn't necessarily something it needs to adhere to. But the saccharine nature of the episode is just off-putting, to say nothing of the uneven nature of the storytelling, which relies on both the baby's cuteness and hopping back and forth in time, neither of which quite work. I'm probably being too nitpicky here, but all the manufactured sweetness in the world couldn't quite hold my attention with this one.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Whenever we get one of these shows, I can't help but feel kind of depressed about the whole thing. They're not super common, but the past few years we seem to always get at least one of these “soothing” comedies about a criminally overworked office worker getting some supernatural assistance from a cute little spirit creature. But it's never in helping the lead character find a new job or learning to value themselves enough to not work themselves into an early grave – the spirit is always just there to offer some basic comfort and support to make the rise & grind slightly more bearable. That's a premise that just can't be very fun, especially not with a show as slow-paced and repetitive as this premiere.    Because “slow” is the word for this entire episode. Jokes come with the speed of a sleepy tortoise, extending the setup for every gag well past the breaking point, for a punchline that nearly always amounts to “aww, isn't this lil ghost girl just pwecious” and little else. And that's before we get into the back half of the episode, which is just a retelling of the previous events from said ghost girl's perspective, and adds very little besides a couple of equally dull gags. In total it feels like a premiere that was planned to be an 8-minute short, and had to suddenly scramble to fill 20 at the last minute. That belabored timing pretty much strangles any chance of comedic timing even if the jokes were conceptually hilarious.    So we're left with a show that's depressing when it means to be heartwarming, and either boring or annoying when it's meant to be funny. That's a certified death knell for any show, and especially one as slight as Little Baby Ghost. I don't think I'll ever find one of these shows endearing – something about getting a fairy sidekick to make 18-hour workdays slightly less soul annihilating just tastes like ash in my mouth – but this one is far from exemplary.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review          1 comment       Hello, Melancholic!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost   Apr  8th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost ?                     Community score: 3.4              What is this?   Fushihara is a woman who is a ""slave"" to her company. She meets Yūrei, the ghost girl who wants to help her.    Shachiku-san wa Yо̄jo Yuurei ni Iyasaretai. is based on Imari Arita's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                So, here's the question of the day for you all. Does this episode—and perhaps the entire anime—count as a dead baby joke? Because I've been wondering that since the moment I started watching.    This episode is built around the joke that working at your average Japanese company is more terrifying than ghosts. Shachiku is a hard worker and is thus exploited by her lazy boss who forces her to do all the work he can't be bothered with. This results in late nights working all alone. And even when faced with a supernatural being coming to kill her, she simply works on. Or to put it another way, it's only a matter of time until she wakes up reincarnated in another world.    Enter our innocent baby ghost. She doesn't want Shachiku to die and is hoping to find a way to help her. Of course, the best help would be forcing Shachiku to go home and sleep, but when that fails, our little ghost turns to massages, tea breaks, and loving hugs to help the overworked woman power through. It's all very cute—but that's not enough to keep the episode interesting.    This is made worse by how the episode is directed. We see the same scenes (lunch time and Shachiku's first encounter with the ghost) several times. Sure, sometimes it's from Shachiku's point of view and sometimes it's from the ghosts—and sometimes it confusingly switches between them in the same scene. It gets repetitive and boring. And honestly, I found the show more depressing than funny or cute due to the premise alone. Overwork is still a serious issue here and I've seen more than a few friends overworked into depression.    In the end, this show lives or dies on how much you enjoy the cuteness overload of the baby ghost. If that's your cup of tea, you'll be just fine watching it. If you need more than cuteness in your anime, however, you might want to pass on this one.      Caitlin Moore  Rating:                If I were to describe Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost in a single word, it would be “cloying.” If reviews have to be more than one word, I would calling it cloying, mawkish, saccharine, treacly, twee, sickly sweet, maudlin, insipid, and akin to chugging a gallon bottle of liquid sucralose. It has no flavor profile beyond sweet, no interests beyond making you say, “Dawwww, how pwecioush,” if you're not barfing in the corner from being force fed a pound of aspartame. You notice how I'm only comparing it to artificial sweeteners? That's because there's not a single real thing about this.    In case you're new here, hi, I'm Caitlin and I work in early childhood education with children from the ages of six months to three years. I have an extremely limited tolerance for fictional children that don't act even remotely like real children, and I gotta say, the baby ghost resembles a real toddler about as much as a maltipoo resembles a wolf. She exists to be cute and emotionally support Fushihara as she works late into the night upon the orders of her asshole boss, and really nothing else. Real children are to her as what biblical angels are to those naked cherub paintings they sell in Christian tchotchke shops.    This is ostensibly a comedy, but every punchline consists of, “The baby ghost does something and it's cute!” It lingers on her teary eyes, her tiny pigeon-toed feet, her blobby little hands, but it doesn't take much to realize that there was never an actual joke. The humor doesn't land so much as squirm about slowly about like those slugs that keep eating my goddamn pansies and sorry, what were we talking about again? Miss Shachiku is so agonizingly boring that my mind keeps sliding away from it like a slug sliding across the dirt to get to my pansies oops it happened again. Better wrap this up.    Don't watch Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost if you like kids. Stay away if you have even the slightest concept of what makes young children funny and weird and infuriating and a joy to spend time with. Skip it if you see children for what they are, as small humans learning about the ways the world works and also happen to act like tiny drunk adults most of the time.      James Beckett  Rating:                Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost is one of those anime that we seem to get one or two of every season that forces me to ask one very simple question: “Why the hell wasn't this thing a short?” Within just the first couple of minutes, I was already worried that I wouldn't jive with this comedy's particular focus on overbearing cutesy-poo fluff, but when I saw that the episode was a full half-hour, my heart sank. And I hadn't even gotten to the second half of the premiere yet.    The main issue with Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost is that it isn't funny. At all. It doesn't even really have proper jokes, outside of the recurring bit where the titular ghost implores the titular Miss Shachiku to go home and sleep, rather than be worked to death, and Fushihara refuses because she wants to gush over how cute the ghost is. That's it. That's the whole premise. Every other potential joke is ruined by the episode's horrid pacing. There's certainly comedy to be mined from satirizing Japan's hostile workplace culture, dark as it may be, but Miss Shachiku seems content to have the little ghost make a bunch of baby noises for an interminably long time while its overworked protagonist gleefully rides the Overtime Monorail into an early grave.    Also—and this may be my leftover hangover from Heroines Run the School talking—we need to have a conversation about these shows that try to get away with forcing their voice actresses to make the most insufferable toddler sounds imaginable for thirty minutes straight and passing it off as comedy. I'm not going to pretend that I was jazzed about the core concept of the baby ghost to begin with, since I was turned off from the moment that I realized that the subtitles were going to have her say things like “Pwease” for the whole show. Outside of the ghost's voice and mannerisms, though, there was nothing outright offensive or unbearable about Miss Shachiku. It was mostly just slow and unfunny, which I could tolerate for a few minutes.    Then the second half of the episode kicked in, in which we see the events of the first half of the episode from the ghost's perspective, and all of it was so utterly pointless and unnecessary that I actually started getting mad. Did we need to really need to watch the ghost putter about and talk to herself about things that we already saw her say and do in the previous half? The gag of the ghost using a little speaker to sound scary was the closest that the opening came to a decent joke; did the show really need to kill it by overexplaining where she got it and how she decided to use it? Did somebody on the production committee just want to play a cruel prank on project No.9 by forcing the staff to animate four times as much as they needed to for this thing, and then they decided to keep it all in the show to add insult to injury?    I don't know. All I know is that Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost was the exact opposite of a good time, for me. There are better slice-of-life anime, better workplace comedies, and better ghost stories out there to have fun with. Don't let this one haunt your Spring Season.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I almost feel badly about giving this show such a low rating, because it's clearly trying its hardest. There's a sort of earnestness about the whole thing that ought to make it more appealing than it is, a sort of well-meaning cuteness that's clearly intended to soothe the tired soul. But there's a fine line between “soothing” and “boring,” and I'm afraid that Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost crosses it with wild abandon, trying its best to be as charming as possible without actually understanding what makes something sweet.    Mostly that's because I felt a bit talked down to by the episode. Our protagonist, Fushihara, is being overworked by her boss when a baby ghost (or a ghost baby) starts telling her to leave the building. The ghost is just concerned for Fushihara's well-being, and also thinks she's paying the woman back for the “offerings” of onigiri; meanwhile we know that Fushihara and the other workers have been wondering who keeps stealing their lunches. It's almost too deliberately adorable to actually be cute, and there's a real sense that we're being hit over the head with things that we're meant to find warm and fuzzy without them being that way naturally. Things like the baby ghost laying out a futon for Fushihara and then falling asleep in it herself reek of the sort of manufactured little kid behavior that not many real kids exhibit, as if the ghost was written by someone with an academic idea of toddlers without ever having interacted with one.    Of course, it's a show about a ghost (and a nekomata, a fox, an oni, and a teeny tiny maid, if the opening theme is to be believed), so realism isn't necessarily something it needs to adhere to. But the saccharine nature of the episode is just off-putting, to say nothing of the uneven nature of the storytelling, which relies on both the baby's cuteness and hopping back and forth in time, neither of which quite work. I'm probably being too nitpicky here, but all the manufactured sweetness in the world couldn't quite hold my attention with this one.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Whenever we get one of these shows, I can't help but feel kind of depressed about the whole thing. They're not super common, but the past few years we seem to always get at least one of these “soothing” comedies about a criminally overworked office worker getting some supernatural assistance from a cute little spirit creature. But it's never in helping the lead character find a new job or learning to value themselves enough to not work themselves into an early grave – the spirit is always just there to offer some basic comfort and support to make the rise & grind slightly more bearable. That's a premise that just can't be very fun, especially not with a show as slow-paced and repetitive as this premiere.    Because “slow” is the word for this entire episode. Jokes come with the speed of a sleepy tortoise, extending the setup for every gag well past the breaking point, for a punchline that nearly always amounts to “aww, isn't this lil ghost girl just pwecious” and little else. And that's before we get into the back half of the episode, which is just a retelling of the previous events from said ghost girl's perspective, and adds very little besides a couple of equally dull gags. In total it feels like a premiere that was planned to be an 8-minute short, and had to suddenly scramble to fill 20 at the last minute. That belabored timing pretty much strangles any chance of comedic timing even if the jokes were conceptually hilarious.    So we're left with a show that's depressing when it means to be heartwarming, and either boring or annoying when it's meant to be funny. That's a certified death knell for any show, and especially one as slight as Little Baby Ghost. I don't think I'll ever find one of these shows endearing – something about getting a fairy sidekick to make 18-hour workdays slightly less soul annihilating just tastes like ash in my mouth – but this one is far from exemplary.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review          1 comment       Hello, Melancholic!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost   Apr  8th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost ?                     Community score: 3.4              What is this?   Fushihara is a woman who is a ""slave"" to her company. She meets Yūrei, the ghost girl who wants to help her.    Shachiku-san wa Yо̄jo Yuurei ni Iyasaretai. is based on Imari Arita's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                So, here's the question of the day for you all. Does this episode—and perhaps the entire anime—count as a dead baby joke? Because I've been wondering that since the moment I started watching.    This episode is built around the joke that working at your average Japanese company is more terrifying than ghosts. Shachiku is a hard worker and is thus exploited by her lazy boss who forces her to do all the work he can't be bothered with. This results in late nights working all alone. And even when faced with a supernatural being coming to kill her, she simply works on. Or to put it another way, it's only a matter of time until she wakes up reincarnated in another world.    Enter our innocent baby ghost. She doesn't want Shachiku to die and is hoping to find a way to help her. Of course, the best help would be forcing Shachiku to go home and sleep, but when that fails, our little ghost turns to massages, tea breaks, and loving hugs to help the overworked woman power through. It's all very cute—but that's not enough to keep the episode interesting.    This is made worse by how the episode is directed. We see the same scenes (lunch time and Shachiku's first encounter with the ghost) several times. Sure, sometimes it's from Shachiku's point of view and sometimes it's from the ghosts—and sometimes it confusingly switches between them in the same scene. It gets repetitive and boring. And honestly, I found the show more depressing than funny or cute due to the premise alone. Overwork is still a serious issue here and I've seen more than a few friends overworked into depression.    In the end, this show lives or dies on how much you enjoy the cuteness overload of the baby ghost. If that's your cup of tea, you'll be just fine watching it. If you need more than cuteness in your anime, however, you might want to pass on this one.      Caitlin Moore  Rating:                If I were to describe Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost in a single word, it would be “cloying.” If reviews have to be more than one word, I would calling it cloying, mawkish, saccharine, treacly, twee, sickly sweet, maudlin, insipid, and akin to chugging a gallon bottle of liquid sucralose. It has no flavor profile beyond sweet, no interests beyond making you say, “Dawwww, how pwecioush,” if you're not barfing in the corner from being force fed a pound of aspartame. You notice how I'm only comparing it to artificial sweeteners? That's because there's not a single real thing about this.    In case you're new here, hi, I'm Caitlin and I work in early childhood education with children from the ages of six months to three years. I have an extremely limited tolerance for fictional children that don't act even remotely like real children, and I gotta say, the baby ghost resembles a real toddler about as much as a maltipoo resembles a wolf. She exists to be cute and emotionally support Fushihara as she works late into the night upon the orders of her asshole boss, and really nothing else. Real children are to her as what biblical angels are to those naked cherub paintings they sell in Christian tchotchke shops.    This is ostensibly a comedy, but every punchline consists of, “The baby ghost does something and it's cute!” It lingers on her teary eyes, her tiny pigeon-toed feet, her blobby little hands, but it doesn't take much to realize that there was never an actual joke. The humor doesn't land so much as squirm about slowly about like those slugs that keep eating my goddamn pansies and sorry, what were we talking about again? Miss Shachiku is so agonizingly boring that my mind keeps sliding away from it like a slug sliding across the dirt to get to my pansies oops it happened again. Better wrap this up.    Don't watch Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost if you like kids. Stay away if you have even the slightest concept of what makes young children funny and weird and infuriating and a joy to spend time with. Skip it if you see children for what they are, as small humans learning about the ways the world works and also happen to act like tiny drunk adults most of the time.      James Beckett  Rating:                Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost is one of those anime that we seem to get one or two of every season that forces me to ask one very simple question: “Why the hell wasn't this thing a short?” Within just the first couple of minutes, I was already worried that I wouldn't jive with this comedy's particular focus on overbearing cutesy-poo fluff, but when I saw that the episode was a full half-hour, my heart sank. And I hadn't even gotten to the second half of the premiere yet.    The main issue with Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost is that it isn't funny. At all. It doesn't even really have proper jokes, outside of the recurring bit where the titular ghost implores the titular Miss Shachiku to go home and sleep, rather than be worked to death, and Fushihara refuses because she wants to gush over how cute the ghost is. That's it. That's the whole premise. Every other potential joke is ruined by the episode's horrid pacing. There's certainly comedy to be mined from satirizing Japan's hostile workplace culture, dark as it may be, but Miss Shachiku seems content to have the little ghost make a bunch of baby noises for an interminably long time while its overworked protagonist gleefully rides the Overtime Monorail into an early grave.    Also—and this may be my leftover hangover from Heroines Run the School talking—we need to have a conversation about these shows that try to get away with forcing their voice actresses to make the most insufferable toddler sounds imaginable for thirty minutes straight and passing it off as comedy. I'm not going to pretend that I was jazzed about the core concept of the baby ghost to begin with, since I was turned off from the moment that I realized that the subtitles were going to have her say things like “Pwease” for the whole show. Outside of the ghost's voice and mannerisms, though, there was nothing outright offensive or unbearable about Miss Shachiku. It was mostly just slow and unfunny, which I could tolerate for a few minutes.    Then the second half of the episode kicked in, in which we see the events of the first half of the episode from the ghost's perspective, and all of it was so utterly pointless and unnecessary that I actually started getting mad. Did we need to really need to watch the ghost putter about and talk to herself about things that we already saw her say and do in the previous half? The gag of the ghost using a little speaker to sound scary was the closest that the opening came to a decent joke; did the show really need to kill it by overexplaining where she got it and how she decided to use it? Did somebody on the production committee just want to play a cruel prank on project No.9 by forcing the staff to animate four times as much as they needed to for this thing, and then they decided to keep it all in the show to add insult to injury?    I don't know. All I know is that Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost was the exact opposite of a good time, for me. There are better slice-of-life anime, better workplace comedies, and better ghost stories out there to have fun with. Don't let this one haunt your Spring Season.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I almost feel badly about giving this show such a low rating, because it's clearly trying its hardest. There's a sort of earnestness about the whole thing that ought to make it more appealing than it is, a sort of well-meaning cuteness that's clearly intended to soothe the tired soul. But there's a fine line between “soothing” and “boring,” and I'm afraid that Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost crosses it with wild abandon, trying its best to be as charming as possible without actually understanding what makes something sweet.    Mostly that's because I felt a bit talked down to by the episode. Our protagonist, Fushihara, is being overworked by her boss when a baby ghost (or a ghost baby) starts telling her to leave the building. The ghost is just concerned for Fushihara's well-being, and also thinks she's paying the woman back for the “offerings” of onigiri; meanwhile we know that Fushihara and the other workers have been wondering who keeps stealing their lunches. It's almost too deliberately adorable to actually be cute, and there's a real sense that we're being hit over the head with things that we're meant to find warm and fuzzy without them being that way naturally. Things like the baby ghost laying out a futon for Fushihara and then falling asleep in it herself reek of the sort of manufactured little kid behavior that not many real kids exhibit, as if the ghost was written by someone with an academic idea of toddlers without ever having interacted with one.    Of course, it's a show about a ghost (and a nekomata, a fox, an oni, and a teeny tiny maid, if the opening theme is to be believed), so realism isn't necessarily something it needs to adhere to. But the saccharine nature of the episode is just off-putting, to say nothing of the uneven nature of the storytelling, which relies on both the baby's cuteness and hopping back and forth in time, neither of which quite work. I'm probably being too nitpicky here, but all the manufactured sweetness in the world couldn't quite hold my attention with this one.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Whenever we get one of these shows, I can't help but feel kind of depressed about the whole thing. They're not super common, but the past few years we seem to always get at least one of these “soothing” comedies about a criminally overworked office worker getting some supernatural assistance from a cute little spirit creature. But it's never in helping the lead character find a new job or learning to value themselves enough to not work themselves into an early grave – the spirit is always just there to offer some basic comfort and support to make the rise & grind slightly more bearable. That's a premise that just can't be very fun, especially not with a show as slow-paced and repetitive as this premiere.    Because “slow” is the word for this entire episode. Jokes come with the speed of a sleepy tortoise, extending the setup for every gag well past the breaking point, for a punchline that nearly always amounts to “aww, isn't this lil ghost girl just pwecious” and little else. And that's before we get into the back half of the episode, which is just a retelling of the previous events from said ghost girl's perspective, and adds very little besides a couple of equally dull gags. In total it feels like a premiere that was planned to be an 8-minute short, and had to suddenly scramble to fill 20 at the last minute. That belabored timing pretty much strangles any chance of comedic timing even if the jokes were conceptually hilarious.    So we're left with a show that's depressing when it means to be heartwarming, and either boring or annoying when it's meant to be funny. That's a certified death knell for any show, and especially one as slight as Little Baby Ghost. I don't think I'll ever find one of these shows endearing – something about getting a fairy sidekick to make 18-hour workdays slightly less soul annihilating just tastes like ash in my mouth – but this one is far from exemplary.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review          1 comment       Hello, Melancholic!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost   Apr  8th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost ?                     Community score: 3.4              What is this?   Fushihara is a woman who is a ""slave"" to her company. She meets Yūrei, the ghost girl who wants to help her.    Shachiku-san wa Yо̄jo Yuurei ni Iyasaretai. is based on Imari Arita's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                So, here's the question of the day for you all. Does this episode—and perhaps the entire anime—count as a dead baby joke? Because I've been wondering that since the moment I started watching.    This episode is built around the joke that working at your average Japanese company is more terrifying than ghosts. Shachiku is a hard worker and is thus exploited by her lazy boss who forces her to do all the work he can't be bothered with. This results in late nights working all alone. And even when faced with a supernatural being coming to kill her, she simply works on. Or to put it another way, it's only a matter of time until she wakes up reincarnated in another world.    Enter our innocent baby ghost. She doesn't want Shachiku to die and is hoping to find a way to help her. Of course, the best help would be forcing Shachiku to go home and sleep, but when that fails, our little ghost turns to massages, tea breaks, and loving hugs to help the overworked woman power through. It's all very cute—but that's not enough to keep the episode interesting.    This is made worse by how the episode is directed. We see the same scenes (lunch time and Shachiku's first encounter with the ghost) several times. Sure, sometimes it's from Shachiku's point of view and sometimes it's from the ghosts—and sometimes it confusingly switches between them in the same scene. It gets repetitive and boring. And honestly, I found the show more depressing than funny or cute due to the premise alone. Overwork is still a serious issue here and I've seen more than a few friends overworked into depression.    In the end, this show lives or dies on how much you enjoy the cuteness overload of the baby ghost. If that's your cup of tea, you'll be just fine watching it. If you need more than cuteness in your anime, however, you might want to pass on this one.      Caitlin Moore  Rating:                If I were to describe Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost in a single word, it would be “cloying.” If reviews have to be more than one word, I would calling it cloying, mawkish, saccharine, treacly, twee, sickly sweet, maudlin, insipid, and akin to chugging a gallon bottle of liquid sucralose. It has no flavor profile beyond sweet, no interests beyond making you say, “Dawwww, how pwecioush,” if you're not barfing in the corner from being force fed a pound of aspartame. You notice how I'm only comparing it to artificial sweeteners? That's because there's not a single real thing about this.    In case you're new here, hi, I'm Caitlin and I work in early childhood education with children from the ages of six months to three years. I have an extremely limited tolerance for fictional children that don't act even remotely like real children, and I gotta say, the baby ghost resembles a real toddler about as much as a maltipoo resembles a wolf. She exists to be cute and emotionally support Fushihara as she works late into the night upon the orders of her asshole boss, and really nothing else. Real children are to her as what biblical angels are to those naked cherub paintings they sell in Christian tchotchke shops.    This is ostensibly a comedy, but every punchline consists of, “The baby ghost does something and it's cute!” It lingers on her teary eyes, her tiny pigeon-toed feet, her blobby little hands, but it doesn't take much to realize that there was never an actual joke. The humor doesn't land so much as squirm about slowly about like those slugs that keep eating my goddamn pansies and sorry, what were we talking about again? Miss Shachiku is so agonizingly boring that my mind keeps sliding away from it like a slug sliding across the dirt to get to my pansies oops it happened again. Better wrap this up.    Don't watch Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost if you like kids. Stay away if you have even the slightest concept of what makes young children funny and weird and infuriating and a joy to spend time with. Skip it if you see children for what they are, as small humans learning about the ways the world works and also happen to act like tiny drunk adults most of the time.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost   Apr  8th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost ?                     Community score: 3.4              What is this?   Fushihara is a woman who is a ""slave"" to her company. She meets Yūrei, the ghost girl who wants to help her.    Shachiku-san wa Yо̄jo Yuurei ni Iyasaretai. is based on Imari Arita's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                So, here's the question of the day for you all. Does this episode—and perhaps the entire anime—count as a dead baby joke? Because I've been wondering that since the moment I started watching.    This episode is built around the joke that working at your average Japanese company is more terrifying than ghosts. Shachiku is a hard worker and is thus exploited by her lazy boss who forces her to do all the work he can't be bothered with. This results in late nights working all alone. And even when faced with a supernatural being coming to kill her, she simply works on. Or to put it another way, it's only a matter of time until she wakes up reincarnated in another world.    Enter our innocent baby ghost. She doesn't want Shachiku to die and is hoping to find a way to help her. Of course, the best help would be forcing Shachiku to go home and sleep, but when that fails, our little ghost turns to massages, tea breaks, and loving hugs to help the overworked woman power through. It's all very cute—but that's not enough to keep the episode interesting.    This is made worse by how the episode is directed. We see the same scenes (lunch time and Shachiku's first encounter with the ghost) several times. Sure, sometimes it's from Shachiku's point of view and sometimes it's from the ghosts—and sometimes it confusingly switches between them in the same scene. It gets repetitive and boring. And honestly, I found the show more depressing than funny or cute due to the premise alone. Overwork is still a serious issue here and I've seen more than a few friends overworked into depression.    In the end, this show lives or dies on how much you enjoy the cuteness overload of the baby ghost. If that's your cup of tea, you'll be just fine watching it. If you need more than cuteness in your anime, however, you might want to pass on this one.      Caitlin Moore  Rating:                If I were to describe Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost in a single word, it would be “cloying.” If reviews have to be more than one word, I would calling it cloying, mawkish, saccharine, treacly, twee, sickly sweet, maudlin, insipid, and akin to chugging a gallon bottle of liquid sucralose. It has no flavor profile beyond sweet, no interests beyond making you say, “Dawwww, how pwecioush,” if you're not barfing in the corner from being force fed a pound of aspartame. You notice how I'm only comparing it to artificial sweeteners? That's because there's not a single real thing about this.    In case you're new here, hi, I'm Caitlin and I work in early childhood education with children from the ages of six months to three years. I have an extremely limited tolerance for fictional children that don't act even remotely like real children, and I gotta say, the baby ghost resembles a real toddler about as much as a maltipoo resembles a wolf. She exists to be cute and emotionally support Fushihara as she works late into the night upon the orders of her asshole boss, and really nothing else. Real children are to her as what biblical angels are to those naked cherub paintings they sell in Christian tchotchke shops.    This is ostensibly a comedy, but every punchline consists of, “The baby ghost does something and it's cute!” It lingers on her teary eyes, her tiny pigeon-toed feet, her blobby little hands, but it doesn't take much to realize that there was never an actual joke. The humor doesn't land so much as squirm about slowly about like those slugs that keep eating my goddamn pansies and sorry, what were we talking about again? Miss Shachiku is so agonizingly boring that my mind keeps sliding away from it like a slug sliding across the dirt to get to my pansies oops it happened again. Better wrap this up.    Don't watch Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost if you like kids. Stay away if you have even the slightest concept of what makes young children funny and weird and infuriating and a joy to spend time with. Skip it if you see children for what they are, as small humans learning about the ways the world works and also happen to act like tiny drunk adults most of the time.      James Beckett  Rating:                Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost is one of those anime that we seem to get one or two of every season that forces me to ask one very simple question: “Why the hell wasn't this thing a short?” Within just the first couple of minutes, I was already worried that I wouldn't jive with this comedy's particular focus on overbearing cutesy-poo fluff, but when I saw that the episode was a full half-hour, my heart sank. And I hadn't even gotten to the second half of the premiere yet.    The main issue with Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost is that it isn't funny. At all. It doesn't even really have proper jokes, outside of the recurring bit where the titular ghost implores the titular Miss Shachiku to go home and sleep, rather than be worked to death, and Fushihara refuses because she wants to gush over how cute the ghost is. That's it. That's the whole premise. Every other potential joke is ruined by the episode's horrid pacing. There's certainly comedy to be mined from satirizing Japan's hostile workplace culture, dark as it may be, but Miss Shachiku seems content to have the little ghost make a bunch of baby noises for an interminably long time while its overworked protagonist gleefully rides the Overtime Monorail into an early grave.    Also—and this may be my leftover hangover from Heroines Run the School talking—we need to have a conversation about these shows that try to get away with forcing their voice actresses to make the most insufferable toddler sounds imaginable for thirty minutes straight and passing it off as comedy. I'm not going to pretend that I was jazzed about the core concept of the baby ghost to begin with, since I was turned off from the moment that I realized that the subtitles were going to have her say things like “Pwease” for the whole show. Outside of the ghost's voice and mannerisms, though, there was nothing outright offensive or unbearable about Miss Shachiku. It was mostly just slow and unfunny, which I could tolerate for a few minutes.    Then the second half of the episode kicked in, in which we see the events of the first half of the episode from the ghost's perspective, and all of it was so utterly pointless and unnecessary that I actually started getting mad. Did we need to really need to watch the ghost putter about and talk to herself about things that we already saw her say and do in the previous half? The gag of the ghost using a little speaker to sound scary was the closest that the opening came to a decent joke; did the show really need to kill it by overexplaining where she got it and how she decided to use it? Did somebody on the production committee just want to play a cruel prank on project No.9 by forcing the staff to animate four times as much as they needed to for this thing, and then they decided to keep it all in the show to add insult to injury?    I don't know. All I know is that Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost was the exact opposite of a good time, for me. There are better slice-of-life anime, better workplace comedies, and better ghost stories out there to have fun with. Don't let this one haunt your Spring Season.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I almost feel badly about giving this show such a low rating, because it's clearly trying its hardest. There's a sort of earnestness about the whole thing that ought to make it more appealing than it is, a sort of well-meaning cuteness that's clearly intended to soothe the tired soul. But there's a fine line between “soothing” and “boring,” and I'm afraid that Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost crosses it with wild abandon, trying its best to be as charming as possible without actually understanding what makes something sweet.    Mostly that's because I felt a bit talked down to by the episode. Our protagonist, Fushihara, is being overworked by her boss when a baby ghost (or a ghost baby) starts telling her to leave the building. The ghost is just concerned for Fushihara's well-being, and also thinks she's paying the woman back for the “offerings” of onigiri; meanwhile we know that Fushihara and the other workers have been wondering who keeps stealing their lunches. It's almost too deliberately adorable to actually be cute, and there's a real sense that we're being hit over the head with things that we're meant to find warm and fuzzy without them being that way naturally. Things like the baby ghost laying out a futon for Fushihara and then falling asleep in it herself reek of the sort of manufactured little kid behavior that not many real kids exhibit, as if the ghost was written by someone with an academic idea of toddlers without ever having interacted with one.    Of course, it's a show about a ghost (and a nekomata, a fox, an oni, and a teeny tiny maid, if the opening theme is to be believed), so realism isn't necessarily something it needs to adhere to. But the saccharine nature of the episode is just off-putting, to say nothing of the uneven nature of the storytelling, which relies on both the baby's cuteness and hopping back and forth in time, neither of which quite work. I'm probably being too nitpicky here, but all the manufactured sweetness in the world couldn't quite hold my attention with this one.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Whenever we get one of these shows, I can't help but feel kind of depressed about the whole thing. They're not super common, but the past few years we seem to always get at least one of these “soothing” comedies about a criminally overworked office worker getting some supernatural assistance from a cute little spirit creature. But it's never in helping the lead character find a new job or learning to value themselves enough to not work themselves into an early grave – the spirit is always just there to offer some basic comfort and support to make the rise & grind slightly more bearable. That's a premise that just can't be very fun, especially not with a show as slow-paced and repetitive as this premiere.    Because “slow” is the word for this entire episode. Jokes come with the speed of a sleepy tortoise, extending the setup for every gag well past the breaking point, for a punchline that nearly always amounts to “aww, isn't this lil ghost girl just pwecious” and little else. And that's before we get into the back half of the episode, which is just a retelling of the previous events from said ghost girl's perspective, and adds very little besides a couple of equally dull gags. In total it feels like a premiere that was planned to be an 8-minute short, and had to suddenly scramble to fill 20 at the last minute. That belabored timing pretty much strangles any chance of comedic timing even if the jokes were conceptually hilarious.    So we're left with a show that's depressing when it means to be heartwarming, and either boring or annoying when it's meant to be funny. That's a certified death knell for any show, and especially one as slight as Little Baby Ghost. I don't think I'll ever find one of these shows endearing – something about getting a fairy sidekick to make 18-hour workdays slightly less soul annihilating just tastes like ash in my mouth – but this one is far from exemplary.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Mostly that's because I felt a bit talked down to by the episode. Our protagonist, Fushihara, is being overworked by her boss when a baby ghost (or a ghost baby) starts telling her to leave the building. The ghost is just concerned for Fushihara's well-being, and also thinks she's paying the woman back for the “offerings” of onigiri; meanwhile we know that Fushihara and the other workers have been wondering who keeps stealing their lunches. It's almost too deliberately adorable to actually be cute, and there's a real sense that we're being hit over the head with things that we're meant to find warm and fuzzy without them being that way naturally. Things like the baby ghost laying out a futon for Fushihara and then falling asleep in it herself reek of the sort of manufactured little kid behavior that not many real kids exhibit, as if the ghost was written by someone with an academic idea of toddlers without ever having interacted with one.    Of course, it's a show about a ghost (and a nekomata, a fox, an oni, and a teeny tiny maid, if the opening theme is to be believed), so realism isn't necessarily something it needs to adhere to. But the saccharine nature of the episode is just off-putting, to say nothing of the uneven nature of the storytelling, which relies on both the baby's cuteness and hopping back and forth in time, neither of which quite work. I'm probably being too nitpicky here, but all the manufactured sweetness in the world couldn't quite hold my attention with this one.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Whenever we get one of these shows, I can't help but feel kind of depressed about the whole thing. They're not super common, but the past few years we seem to always get at least one of these “soothing” comedies about a criminally overworked office worker getting some supernatural assistance from a cute little spirit creature. But it's never in helping the lead character find a new job or learning to value themselves enough to not work themselves into an early grave – the spirit is always just there to offer some basic comfort and support to make the rise & grind slightly more bearable. That's a premise that just can't be very fun, especially not with a show as slow-paced and repetitive as this premiere.    Because “slow” is the word for this entire episode. Jokes come with the speed of a sleepy tortoise, extending the setup for every gag well past the breaking point, for a punchline that nearly always amounts to “aww, isn't this lil ghost girl just pwecious” and little else. And that's before we get into the back half of the episode, which is just a retelling of the previous events from said ghost girl's perspective, and adds very little besides a couple of equally dull gags. In total it feels like a premiere that was planned to be an 8-minute short, and had to suddenly scramble to fill 20 at the last minute. That belabored timing pretty much strangles any chance of comedic timing even if the jokes were conceptually hilarious.    So we're left with a show that's depressing when it means to be heartwarming, and either boring or annoying when it's meant to be funny. That's a certified death knell for any show, and especially one as slight as Little Baby Ghost. I don't think I'll ever find one of these shows endearing – something about getting a fairy sidekick to make 18-hour workdays slightly less soul annihilating just tastes like ash in my mouth – but this one is far from exemplary.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More     ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 3.4              What is this?   Fushihara is a woman who is a ""slave"" to her company. She meets Yūrei, the ghost girl who wants to help her.    Shachiku-san wa Yо̄jo Yuurei ni Iyasaretai. is based on Imari Arita's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                So, here's the question of the day for you all. Does this episode—and perhaps the entire anime—count as a dead baby joke? Because I've been wondering that since the moment I started watching.    This episode is built around the joke that working at your average Japanese company is more terrifying than ghosts. Shachiku is a hard worker and is thus exploited by her lazy boss who forces her to do all the work he can't be bothered with. This results in late nights working all alone. And even when faced with a supernatural being coming to kill her, she simply works on. Or to put it another way, it's only a matter of time until she wakes up reincarnated in another world.    Enter our innocent baby ghost. She doesn't want Shachiku to die and is hoping to find a way to help her. Of course, the best help would be forcing Shachiku to go home and sleep, but when that fails, our little ghost turns to massages, tea breaks, and loving hugs to help the overworked woman power through. It's all very cute—but that's not enough to keep the episode interesting.    This is made worse by how the episode is directed. We see the same scenes (lunch time and Shachiku's first encounter with the ghost) several times. Sure, sometimes it's from Shachiku's point of view and sometimes it's from the ghosts—and sometimes it confusingly switches between them in the same scene. It gets repetitive and boring. And honestly, I found the show more depressing than funny or cute due to the premise alone. Overwork is still a serious issue here and I've seen more than a few friends overworked into depression.    In the end, this show lives or dies on how much you enjoy the cuteness overload of the baby ghost. If that's your cup of tea, you'll be just fine watching it. If you need more than cuteness in your anime, however, you might want to pass on this one.      Caitlin Moore  Rating:                If I were to describe Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost in a single word, it would be “cloying.” If reviews have to be more than one word, I would calling it cloying, mawkish, saccharine, treacly, twee, sickly sweet, maudlin, insipid, and akin to chugging a gallon bottle of liquid sucralose. It has no flavor profile beyond sweet, no interests beyond making you say, “Dawwww, how pwecioush,” if you're not barfing in the corner from being force fed a pound of aspartame. You notice how I'm only comparing it to artificial sweeteners? That's because there's not a single real thing about this.    In case you're new here, hi, I'm Caitlin and I work in early childhood education with children from the ages of six months to three years. I have an extremely limited tolerance for fictional children that don't act even remotely like real children, and I gotta say, the baby ghost resembles a real toddler about as much as a maltipoo resembles a wolf. She exists to be cute and emotionally support Fushihara as she works late into the night upon the orders of her asshole boss, and really nothing else. Real children are to her as what biblical angels are to those naked cherub paintings they sell in Christian tchotchke shops.    This is ostensibly a comedy, but every punchline consists of, “The baby ghost does something and it's cute!” It lingers on her teary eyes, her tiny pigeon-toed feet, her blobby little hands, but it doesn't take much to realize that there was never an actual joke. The humor doesn't land so much as squirm about slowly about like those slugs that keep eating my goddamn pansies and sorry, what were we talking about again? Miss Shachiku is so agonizingly boring that my mind keeps sliding away from it like a slug sliding across the dirt to get to my pansies oops it happened again. Better wrap this up.    Don't watch Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost if you like kids. Stay away if you have even the slightest concept of what makes young children funny and weird and infuriating and a joy to spend time with. Skip it if you see children for what they are, as small humans learning about the ways the world works and also happen to act like tiny drunk adults most of the time.      James Beckett  Rating:                Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost is one of those anime that we seem to get one or two of every season that forces me to ask one very simple question: “Why the hell wasn't this thing a short?” Within just the first couple of minutes, I was already worried that I wouldn't jive with this comedy's particular focus on overbearing cutesy-poo fluff, but when I saw that the episode was a full half-hour, my heart sank. And I hadn't even gotten to the second half of the premiere yet.    The main issue with Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost is that it isn't funny. At all. It doesn't even really have proper jokes, outside of the recurring bit where the titular ghost implores the titular Miss Shachiku to go home and sleep, rather than be worked to death, and Fushihara refuses because she wants to gush over how cute the ghost is. That's it. That's the whole premise. Every other potential joke is ruined by the episode's horrid pacing. There's certainly comedy to be mined from satirizing Japan's hostile workplace culture, dark as it may be, but Miss Shachiku seems content to have the little ghost make a bunch of baby noises for an interminably long time while its overworked protagonist gleefully rides the Overtime Monorail into an early grave.    Also—and this may be my leftover hangover from Heroines Run the School talking—we need to have a conversation about these shows that try to get away with forcing their voice actresses to make the most insufferable toddler sounds imaginable for thirty minutes straight and passing it off as comedy. I'm not going to pretend that I was jazzed about the core concept of the baby ghost to begin with, since I was turned off from the moment that I realized that the subtitles were going to have her say things like “Pwease” for the whole show. Outside of the ghost's voice and mannerisms, though, there was nothing outright offensive or unbearable about Miss Shachiku. It was mostly just slow and unfunny, which I could tolerate for a few minutes.    Then the second half of the episode kicked in, in which we see the events of the first half of the episode from the ghost's perspective, and all of it was so utterly pointless and unnecessary that I actually started getting mad. Did we need to really need to watch the ghost putter about and talk to herself about things that we already saw her say and do in the previous half? The gag of the ghost using a little speaker to sound scary was the closest that the opening came to a decent joke; did the show really need to kill it by overexplaining where she got it and how she decided to use it? Did somebody on the production committee just want to play a cruel prank on project No.9 by forcing the staff to animate four times as much as they needed to for this thing, and then they decided to keep it all in the show to add insult to injury?    I don't know. All I know is that Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost was the exact opposite of a good time, for me. There are better slice-of-life anime, better workplace comedies, and better ghost stories out there to have fun with. Don't let this one haunt your Spring Season.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I almost feel badly about giving this show such a low rating, because it's clearly trying its hardest. There's a sort of earnestness about the whole thing that ought to make it more appealing than it is, a sort of well-meaning cuteness that's clearly intended to soothe the tired soul. But there's a fine line between “soothing” and “boring,” and I'm afraid that Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost crosses it with wild abandon, trying its best to be as charming as possible without actually understanding what makes something sweet.

It's all very cute—but that's not enough to keep the episode interesting.    This is made worse by how the episode is directed. We see the same scenes (lunch time and Shachiku's first encounter with the ghost) several times. Sure, sometimes it's from Shachiku's point of view and sometimes it's from the ghosts—and sometimes it confusingly switches between them in the same scene. It gets repetitive and boring. And honestly, I found the show more depressing than funny or cute due to the premise alone. Overwork is still a serious issue here and I've seen more than a few friends overworked into depression.    In the end, this show lives or dies on how much you enjoy the cuteness overload of the baby ghost. If that's your cup of tea, you'll be just fine watching it. If you need more than cuteness in your anime, however, you might want to pass on this one.      Caitlin Moore  Rating:                If I were to describe Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost in a single word, it would be “cloying.” If reviews have to be more than one word, I would calling it cloying, mawkish, saccharine, treacly, twee, sickly sweet, maudlin, insipid, and akin to chugging a gallon bottle of liquid sucralose. It has no flavor profile beyond sweet, no interests beyond making you say, “Dawwww, how pwecioush,” if you're not barfing in the corner from being force fed a pound of aspartame.

In case you're new here, hi, I'm Caitlin and I work in early childhood education with children from the ages of six months to three years. I have an extremely limited tolerance for fictional children that don't act even remotely like real children, and I gotta say, the baby ghost resembles a real toddler about as much as a maltipoo resembles a wolf. She exists to be cute and emotionally support Fushihara as she works late into the night upon the orders of her asshole boss, and really nothing else. Real children are to her as what biblical angels are to those naked cherub paintings they sell in Christian tchotchke shops.    This is ostensibly a comedy, but every punchline consists of, “The baby ghost does something and it's cute!” It lingers on her teary eyes, her tiny pigeon-toed feet, her blobby little hands, but it doesn't take much to realize that there was never an actual joke. The humor doesn't land so much as squirm about slowly about like those slugs that keep eating my goddamn pansies and sorry, what were we talking about again? Miss Shachiku is so agonizingly boring that my mind keeps sliding away from it like a slug sliding across the dirt to get to my pansies oops it happened again. Better wrap this up.    Don't watch Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost if you like kids. Stay away if you have even the slightest concept of what makes young children funny and weird and infuriating and a joy to spend time with. Skip it if you see children for what they are, as small humans learning about the ways the world works and also happen to act like tiny drunk adults most of the time.      James Beckett  Rating:                Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost is one of those anime that we seem to get one or two of every season that forces me to ask one very simple question: “Why the hell wasn't this thing a short?” Within just the first couple of minutes, I was already worried that I wouldn't jive with this comedy's particular focus on overbearing cutesy-poo fluff, but when I saw that the episode was a full half-hour, my heart sank. And I hadn't even gotten to the second half of the premiere yet.    The main issue with Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost is that it isn't funny. At all. It doesn't even really have proper jokes, outside of the recurring bit where the titular ghost implores the titular Miss Shachiku to go home and sleep, rather than be worked to death, and Fushihara refuses because she wants to gush over how cute the ghost is. That's it. That's the whole premise. Every other potential joke is ruined by the episode's horrid pacing. There's certainly comedy to be mined from satirizing Japan's hostile workplace culture, dark as it may be, but Miss Shachiku seems content to have the little ghost make a bunch of baby noises for an interminably long time while its overworked protagonist gleefully rides the Overtime Monorail into an early grave.    Also—and this may be my leftover hangover from Heroines Run the School talking—we need to have a conversation about these shows that try to get away with forcing their voice actresses to make the most insufferable toddler sounds imaginable for thirty minutes straight and passing it off as comedy. I'm not going to pretend that I was jazzed about the core concept of the baby ghost to begin with, since I was turned off from the moment that I realized that the subtitles were going to have her say things like “Pwease” for the whole show. Outside of the ghost's voice and mannerisms, though, there was nothing outright offensive or unbearable about Miss Shachiku. It was mostly just slow and unfunny, which I could tolerate for a few minutes.    Then the second half of the episode kicked in, in which we see the events of the first half of the episode from the ghost's perspective, and all of it was so utterly pointless and unnecessary that I actually started getting mad. Did we need to really need to watch the ghost putter about and talk to herself about things that we already saw her say and do in the previous half? The gag of the ghost using a little speaker to sound scary was the closest that the opening came to a decent joke; did the show really need to kill it by overexplaining where she got it and how she decided to use it? Did somebody on the production committee just want to play a cruel prank on project No.9 by forcing the staff to animate four times as much as they needed to for this thing, and then they decided to keep it all in the show to add insult to injury?

There are better slice-of-life anime, better workplace comedies, and better ghost stories out there to have fun with. Don't let this one haunt your Spring Season.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I almost feel badly about giving this show such a low rating, because it's clearly trying its hardest. There's a sort of earnestness about the whole thing that ought to make it more appealing than it is, a sort of well-meaning cuteness that's clearly intended to soothe the tired soul. But there's a fine line between “soothing” and “boring,” and I'm afraid that Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost crosses it with wild abandon, trying its best to be as charming as possible without actually understanding what makes something sweet.    Mostly that's because I felt a bit talked down to by the episode. Our protagonist, Fushihara, is being overworked by her boss when a baby ghost (or a ghost baby) starts telling her to leave the building. The ghost is just concerned for Fushihara's well-being, and also thinks she's paying the woman back for the “offerings” of onigiri; meanwhile we know that Fushihara and the other workers have been wondering who keeps stealing their lunches. It's almost too deliberately adorable to actually be cute, and there's a real sense that we're being hit over the head with things that we're meant to find warm and fuzzy without them being that way naturally. Things like the baby ghost laying out a futon for Fushihara and then falling asleep in it herself reek of the sort of manufactured little kid behavior that not many real kids exhibit, as if the ghost was written by someone with an academic idea of toddlers without ever having interacted with one.    Of course, it's a show about a ghost (and a nekomata, a fox, an oni, and a teeny tiny maid, if the opening theme is to be believed), so realism isn't necessarily something it needs to adhere to. But the saccharine nature of the episode is just off-putting, to say nothing of the uneven nature of the storytelling, which relies on both the baby's cuteness and hopping back and forth in time, neither of which quite work. I'm probably being too nitpicky here, but all the manufactured sweetness in the world couldn't quite hold my attention with this one.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Whenever we get one of these shows, I can't help but feel kind of depressed about the whole thing. They're not super common, but the past few years we seem to always get at least one of these “soothing” comedies about a criminally overworked office worker getting some supernatural assistance from a cute little spirit creature. But it's never in helping the lead character find a new job or learning to value themselves enough to not work themselves into an early grave – the spirit is always just there to offer some basic comfort and support to make the rise & grind slightly more bearable. That's a premise that just can't be very fun, especially not with a show as slow-paced and repetitive as this premiere.    Because “slow” is the word for this entire episode. Jokes come with the speed of a sleepy tortoise, extending the setup for every gag well past the breaking point, for a punchline that nearly always amounts to “aww, isn't this lil ghost girl just pwecious” and little else. And that's before we get into the back half of the episode, which is just a retelling of the previous events from said ghost girl's perspective, and adds very little besides a couple of equally dull gags. In total it feels like a premiere that was planned to be an 8-minute short, and had to suddenly scramble to fill 20 at the last minute. That belabored timing pretty much strangles any chance of comedic timing even if the jokes were conceptually hilarious.    So we're left with a show that's depressing when it means to be heartwarming, and either boring or annoying when it's meant to be funny. That's a certified death knell for any show, and especially one as slight as Little Baby Ghost. I don't think I'll ever find one of these shows endearing – something about getting a fairy sidekick to make 18-hour workdays slightly less soul annihilating just tastes like ash in my mouth – but this one is far from exemplary.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives    ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                So, here's the question of the day for you all. Does this episode—and perhaps the entire anime—count as a dead baby joke? Because I've been wondering that since the moment I started watching.    This episode is built around the joke that working at your average Japanese company is more terrifying than ghosts. Shachiku is a hard worker and is thus exploited by her lazy boss who forces her to do all the work he can't be bothered with. This results in late nights working all alone. And even when faced with a supernatural being coming to kill her, she simply works on. Or to put it another way, it's only a matter of time until she wakes up reincarnated in another world.    Enter our innocent baby ghost. She doesn't want Shachiku to die and is hoping to find a way to help her. Of course, the best help would be forcing Shachiku to go home and sleep, but when that fails, our little ghost turns to massages, tea breaks, and loving hugs to help the overworked woman power through.

But there's a fine line between “soothing” and “boring,” and I'm afraid that Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost crosses it with wild abandon, trying its best to be as charming as possible without actually understanding what makes something sweet.    Mostly that's because I felt a bit talked down to by the episode. Our protagonist, Fushihara, is being overworked by her boss when a baby ghost (or a ghost baby) starts telling her to leave the building. The ghost is just concerned for Fushihara's well-being, and also thinks she's paying the woman back for the “offerings” of onigiri; meanwhile we know that Fushihara and the other workers have been wondering who keeps stealing their lunches. It's almost too deliberately adorable to actually be cute, and there's a real sense that we're being hit over the head with things that we're meant to find warm and fuzzy without them being that way naturally. Things like the baby ghost laying out a futon for Fushihara and then falling asleep in it herself reek of the sort of manufactured little kid behavior that not many real kids exhibit, as if the ghost was written by someone with an academic idea of toddlers without ever having interacted with one.    Of course, it's a show about a ghost (and a nekomata, a fox, an oni, and a teeny tiny maid, if the opening theme is to be believed), so realism isn't necessarily something it needs to adhere to. But the saccharine nature of the episode is just off-putting, to say nothing of the uneven nature of the storytelling, which relies on both the baby's cuteness and hopping back and forth in time, neither of which quite work. I'm probably being too nitpicky here, but all the manufactured sweetness in the world couldn't quite hold my attention with this one.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Whenever we get one of these shows, I can't help but feel kind of depressed about the whole thing. They're not super common, but the past few years we seem to always get at least one of these “soothing” comedies about a criminally overworked office worker getting some supernatural assistance from a cute little spirit creature. But it's never in helping the lead character find a new job or learning to value themselves enough to not work themselves into an early grave – the spirit is always just there to offer some basic comfort and support to make the rise & grind slightly more bearable. That's a premise that just can't be very fun, especially not with a show as slow-paced and repetitive as this premiere.    Because “slow” is the word for this entire episode. Jokes come with the speed of a sleepy tortoise, extending the setup for every gag well past the breaking point, for a punchline that nearly always amounts to “aww, isn't this lil ghost girl just pwecious” and little else. And that's before we get into the back half of the episode, which is just a retelling of the previous events from said ghost girl's perspective, and adds very little besides a couple of equally dull gags. In total it feels like a premiere that was planned to be an 8-minute short, and had to suddenly scramble to fill 20 at the last minute. That belabored timing pretty much strangles any chance of comedic timing even if the jokes were conceptually hilarious.    So we're left with a show that's depressing when it means to be heartwarming, and either boring or annoying when it's meant to be funny. That's a certified death knell for any show, and especially one as slight as Little Baby Ghost. I don't think I'll ever find one of these shows endearing – something about getting a fairy sidekick to make 18-hour workdays slightly less soul annihilating just tastes like ash in my mouth – but this one is far from exemplary.

19-04-2022,anime,1,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/preview-guide/2022/spring/miss-shachiku-and-the-little-baby-ghost/.183614,Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost - The Spring 2022 Preview Guide - Anime News Network:SEA,"            How would you rate episode 1 of Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost ?                     Community score: 3.4              What is this?   Fushihara is a woman who is a ""slave"" to her company. She meets Yūrei, the ghost girl who wants to help her.    Shachiku-san wa Yо̄jo Yuurei ni Iyasaretai. is based on Imari Arita's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                So, here's the question of the day for you all. Does this episode—and perhaps the entire anime—count as a dead baby joke? Because I've been wondering that since the moment I started watching.    This episode is built around the joke that working at your average Japanese company is more terrifying than ghosts. Shachiku is a hard worker and is thus exploited by her lazy boss who forces her to do all the work he can't be bothered with. This results in late nights working all alone. And even when faced with a supernatural being coming to kill her, she simply works on. Or to put it another way, it's only a matter of time until she wakes up reincarnated in another world.    Enter our innocent baby ghost. She doesn't want Shachiku to die and is hoping to find a way to help her. Of course, the best help would be forcing Shachiku to go home and sleep, but when that fails, our little ghost turns to massages, tea breaks, and loving hugs to help the overworked woman power through. It's all very cute—but that's not enough to keep the episode interesting.    This is made worse by how the episode is directed. We see the same scenes (lunch time and Shachiku's first encounter with the ghost) several times. Sure, sometimes it's from Shachiku's point of view and sometimes it's from the ghosts—and sometimes it confusingly switches between them in the same scene. It gets repetitive and boring. And honestly, I found the show more depressing than funny or cute due to the premise alone. Overwork is still a serious issue here and I've seen more than a few friends overworked into depression.    In the end, this show lives or dies on how much you enjoy the cuteness overload of the baby ghost. If that's your cup of tea, you'll be just fine watching it. If you need more than cuteness in your anime, however, you might want to pass on this one.      Caitlin Moore  Rating:                If I were to describe Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost in a single word, it would be “cloying.” If reviews have to be more than one word, I would calling it cloying, mawkish, saccharine, treacly, twee, sickly sweet, maudlin, insipid, and akin to chugging a gallon bottle of liquid sucralose. It has no flavor profile beyond sweet, no interests beyond making you say, “Dawwww, how pwecioush,” if you're not barfing in the corner from being force fed a pound of aspartame. You notice how I'm only comparing it to artificial sweeteners? That's because there's not a single real thing about this.    In case you're new here, hi, I'm Caitlin and I work in early childhood education with children from the ages of six months to three years. I have an extremely limited tolerance for fictional children that don't act even remotely like real children, and I gotta say, the baby ghost resembles a real toddler about as much as a maltipoo resembles a wolf. She exists to be cute and emotionally support Fushihara as she works late into the night upon the orders of her asshole boss, and really nothing else. Real children are to her as what biblical angels are to those naked cherub paintings they sell in Christian tchotchke shops.    This is ostensibly a comedy, but every punchline consists of, “The baby ghost does something and it's cute!” It lingers on her teary eyes, her tiny pigeon-toed feet, her blobby little hands, but it doesn't take much to realize that there was never an actual joke. The humor doesn't land so much as squirm about slowly about like those slugs that keep eating my goddamn pansies and sorry, what were we talking about again? Miss Shachiku is so agonizingly boring that my mind keeps sliding away from it like a slug sliding across the dirt to get to my pansies oops it happened again. Better wrap this up.    Don't watch Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost if you like kids. Stay away if you have even the slightest concept of what makes young children funny and weird and infuriating and a joy to spend time with. Skip it if you see children for what they are, as small humans learning about the ways the world works and also happen to act like tiny drunk adults most of the time.      James Beckett  Rating:                Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost is one of those anime that we seem to get one or two of every season that forces me to ask one very simple question: “Why the hell wasn't this thing a short?” Within just the first couple of minutes, I was already worried that I wouldn't jive with this comedy's particular focus on overbearing cutesy-poo fluff, but when I saw that the episode was a full half-hour, my heart sank. And I hadn't even gotten to the second half of the premiere yet.    The main issue with Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost is that it isn't funny. At all. It doesn't even really have proper jokes, outside of the recurring bit where the titular ghost implores the titular Miss Shachiku to go home and sleep, rather than be worked to death, and Fushihara refuses because she wants to gush over how cute the ghost is. That's it. That's the whole premise. Every other potential joke is ruined by the episode's horrid pacing. There's certainly comedy to be mined from satirizing Japan's hostile workplace culture, dark as it may be, but Miss Shachiku seems content to have the little ghost make a bunch of baby noises for an interminably long time while its overworked protagonist gleefully rides the Overtime Monorail into an early grave.    Also—and this may be my leftover hangover from Heroines Run the School talking—we need to have a conversation about these shows that try to get away with forcing their voice actresses to make the most insufferable toddler sounds imaginable for thirty minutes straight and passing it off as comedy. I'm not going to pretend that I was jazzed about the core concept of the baby ghost to begin with, since I was turned off from the moment that I realized that the subtitles were going to have her say things like “Pwease” for the whole show. Outside of the ghost's voice and mannerisms, though, there was nothing outright offensive or unbearable about Miss Shachiku. It was mostly just slow and unfunny, which I could tolerate for a few minutes.    Then the second half of the episode kicked in, in which we see the events of the first half of the episode from the ghost's perspective, and all of it was so utterly pointless and unnecessary that I actually started getting mad. Did we need to really need to watch the ghost putter about and talk to herself about things that we already saw her say and do in the previous half? The gag of the ghost using a little speaker to sound scary was the closest that the opening came to a decent joke; did the show really need to kill it by overexplaining where she got it and how she decided to use it? Did somebody on the production committee just want to play a cruel prank on project No.9 by forcing the staff to animate four times as much as they needed to for this thing, and then they decided to keep it all in the show to add insult to injury?    I don't know. All I know is that Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost was the exact opposite of a good time, for me. There are better slice-of-life anime, better workplace comedies, and better ghost stories out there to have fun with. Don't let this one haunt your Spring Season.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I almost feel badly about giving this show such a low rating, because it's clearly trying its hardest. There's a sort of earnestness about the whole thing that ought to make it more appealing than it is, a sort of well-meaning cuteness that's clearly intended to soothe the tired soul. But there's a fine line between “soothing” and “boring,” and I'm afraid that Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost crosses it with wild abandon, trying its best to be as charming as possible without actually understanding what makes something sweet.

Of course, it's a show about a ghost (and a nekomata, a fox, an oni, and a teeny tiny maid, if the opening theme is to be believed), so realism isn't necessarily something it needs to adhere to. But the saccharine nature of the episode is just off-putting, to say nothing of the uneven nature of the storytelling, which relies on both the baby's cuteness and hopping back and forth in time, neither of which quite work.

News 25th Detective Conan Film Earns 1.9 Billion Yen in 1st 3 Days   posted on 2022-04-18 16:36 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda         Film earned 1% more in 1st 3 days than Detective Conan: Fist of Blue Sapphire     Detective Conan: The Bride of Halloween (Meitantei Conan: Halloween no Hanayome), the 25th anime film in the Detective Conan franchise, earned 1,907,467,150 yen (about US$15.06 million) and sold 1,321,944 tickets in its first three days from Friday to Sunday. It also ranked #1 in the Japanese box office for the April 16-17 weekend.    The film earned 1% more in its first three days than the previous record-holding film (for total earnings) in the franchise, Detective Conan: Fist of Blue Sapphire, in its first three days. That film earned 1,886,292,700 yen (about US$16.85 million at the time) in its first three days.    The film earned 523,668,950 yen (about US$4.13 million) and sold 355,577 tickets on Friday. On Saturday, it pulled in 726,220,800 yen (about US$5.73 million) and sold 502,578 tickets. It earned 657,577,400 yen (about US$5.19 million) and sold 463,789 tickets on Sunday. The film earned 24% more than Detective Conan: Fist of Blue Sapphire in its first day. That film earned 422 million yen (about US$3.77 million at the time) in its first day.    Detective Conan: Fist of Blue Sapphire went on to earn 9.37 billion yen (about US$86.2 million). The staff of the Detective Conan: The Bride of Halloween film aim for the film to be the first in the franchise to earn 10 billion yen.    Susumu Mitsunaka (Haikyu!!) directed the film at TMS Entertainment. Takahiro Ōkura (Detective Conan: Fist of Blue Sapphire, Detective Conan: The Crimson Love Letter) wrote the screenplay. Gosho Aoyama was credited for the original work. Yūgo Kanno (JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders, Psycho-Pass) composed the music for the film. BUMP OF CHICKEN performed the film's theme song ""Chronostasis.""    The movie takes places in Shibuya on Halloween. At the Shibuya Hikarie building, a certain wedding ceremony is taking place. There, Miwako Sato is in a wedding dress. Suddenly, an intruder bursts in, and Wataru Takagi is injured protecting Miwako. At the same time, the serial bombing criminal from the incident three years ago that killed Jinpei Matsuda (whom Miwako was in love with) escapes. Rei Furuya, who used to be a classmate of Jinpei's at the police academy, tracks the culprit down, but a mysterious costumed person appears and attaches a collar bomb to his neck. Conan hears about the incident that happened three years ago from Rei, and tries to disarm the collar bomb.    Detective Conan: The Scarlet Bullet (Meitantei Conan: Hiiro no Dangan), the 24th film in the franchise, opened in Japan in April 2021 after a one-year COVID-19 delay. TMS Entertainment screened the world premiere of the film's English dub at Anime NYC in November 2021. The film also had a simultaneous release in 22 countries and territories outside of Japan.

BUMP OF CHICKEN performed the film's theme song ""Chronostasis.""    The movie takes places in Shibuya on Halloween. At the Shibuya Hikarie building, a certain wedding ceremony is taking place. There, Miwako Sato is in a wedding dress. Suddenly, an intruder bursts in, and Wataru Takagi is injured protecting Miwako. At the same time, the serial bombing criminal from the incident three years ago that killed Jinpei Matsuda (whom Miwako was in love with) escapes. Rei Furuya, who used to be a classmate of Jinpei's at the police academy, tracks the culprit down, but a mysterious costumed person appears and attaches a collar bomb to his neck. Conan hears about the incident that happened three years ago from Rei, and tries to disarm the collar bomb.    Detective Conan: The Scarlet Bullet (Meitantei Conan: Hiiro no Dangan), the 24th film in the franchise, opened in Japan in April 2021 after a one-year COVID-19 delay.

News 25th Detective Conan Film Earns 1.9 Billion Yen in 1st 3 Days   posted on 2022-04-18 16:36 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda         Film earned 1% more in 1st 3 days than Detective Conan: Fist of Blue Sapphire     Detective Conan: The Bride of Halloween (Meitantei Conan: Halloween no Hanayome), the 25th anime film in the Detective Conan franchise, earned 1,907,467,150 yen (about US$15.06 million) and sold 1,321,944 tickets in its first three days from Friday to Sunday. It also ranked #1 in the Japanese box office for the April 16-17 weekend.    The film earned 1% more in its first three days than the previous record-holding film (for total earnings) in the franchise, Detective Conan: Fist of Blue Sapphire, in its first three days. That film earned 1,886,292,700 yen (about US$16.85 million at the time) in its first three days.    The film earned 523,668,950 yen (about US$4.13 million) and sold 355,577 tickets on Friday. On Saturday, it pulled in 726,220,800 yen (about US$5.73 million) and sold 502,578 tickets. It earned 657,577,400 yen (about US$5.19 million) and sold 463,789 tickets on Sunday. The film earned 24% more than Detective Conan: Fist of Blue Sapphire in its first day. That film earned 422 million yen (about US$3.77 million at the time) in its first day.    Detective Conan: Fist of Blue Sapphire went on to earn 9.37 billion yen (about US$86.2 million). The staff of the Detective Conan: The Bride of Halloween film aim for the film to be the first in the franchise to earn 10 billion yen.    Susumu Mitsunaka (Haikyu!!) directed the film at TMS Entertainment. Takahiro Ōkura (Detective Conan: Fist of Blue Sapphire, Detective Conan: The Crimson Love Letter) wrote the screenplay. Gosho Aoyama was credited for the original work. Yūgo Kanno (JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders, Psycho-Pass) composed the music for the film. BUMP OF CHICKEN performed the film's theme song ""Chronostasis.""    The movie takes places in Shibuya on Halloween. At the Shibuya Hikarie building, a certain wedding ceremony is taking place. There, Miwako Sato is in a wedding dress. Suddenly, an intruder bursts in, and Wataru Takagi is injured protecting Miwako. At the same time, the serial bombing criminal from the incident three years ago that killed Jinpei Matsuda (whom Miwako was in love with) escapes. Rei Furuya, who used to be a classmate of Jinpei's at the police academy, tracks the culprit down, but a mysterious costumed person appears and attaches a collar bomb to his neck. Conan hears about the incident that happened three years ago from Rei, and tries to disarm the collar bomb.    Detective Conan: The Scarlet Bullet (Meitantei Conan: Hiiro no Dangan), the 24th film in the franchise, opened in Japan in April 2021 after a one-year COVID-19 delay. TMS Entertainment screened the world premiere of the film's English dub at Anime NYC in November 2021. The film also had a simultaneous release in 22 countries and territories outside of Japan.

It also ranked #1 in the Japanese box office for the April 16-17 weekend.    The film earned 1% more in its first three days than the previous record-holding film (for total earnings) in the franchise, Detective Conan: Fist of Blue Sapphire, in its first three days. That film earned 1,886,292,700 yen (about US$16.85 million at the time) in its first three days.    The film earned 523,668,950 yen (about US$4.13 million) and sold 355,577 tickets on Friday. On Saturday, it pulled in 726,220,800 yen (about US$5.73 million) and sold 502,578 tickets. It earned 657,577,400 yen (about US$5.19 million) and sold 463,789 tickets on Sunday. The film earned 24% more than Detective Conan: Fist of Blue Sapphire in its first day. That film earned 422 million yen (about US$3.77 million at the time) in its first day.    Detective Conan: Fist of Blue Sapphire went on to earn 9.37 billion yen (about US$86.2 million). The staff of the Detective Conan: The Bride of Halloween film aim for the film to be the first in the franchise to earn 10 billion yen.    Susumu Mitsunaka (Haikyu!!) directed the film at TMS Entertainment. Takahiro Ōkura (Detective Conan: Fist of Blue Sapphire, Detective Conan: The Crimson Love Letter) wrote the screenplay. Gosho Aoyama was credited for the original work. Yūgo Kanno (JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders, Psycho-Pass) composed the music for the film. BUMP OF CHICKEN performed the film's theme song ""Chronostasis.""    The movie takes places in Shibuya on Halloween. At the Shibuya Hikarie building, a certain wedding ceremony is taking place. There, Miwako Sato is in a wedding dress. Suddenly, an intruder bursts in, and Wataru Takagi is injured protecting Miwako. At the same time, the serial bombing criminal from the incident three years ago that killed Jinpei Matsuda (whom Miwako was in love with) escapes. Rei Furuya, who used to be a classmate of Jinpei's at the police academy, tracks the culprit down, but a mysterious costumed person appears and attaches a collar bomb to his neck. Conan hears about the incident that happened three years ago from Rei, and tries to disarm the collar bomb.    Detective Conan: The Scarlet Bullet (Meitantei Conan: Hiiro no Dangan), the 24th film in the franchise, opened in Japan in April 2021 after a one-year COVID-19 delay. TMS Entertainment screened the world premiere of the film's English dub at Anime NYC in November 2021. The film also had a simultaneous release in 22 countries and territories outside of Japan.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These Gekitotsu   Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 25 of Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision (movies) ?                     Community score: 4.5              What is this?   Following the resolution of their respective civil wars, the conflict between the Free Planets Alliance and the Galactic Empire has resumed in earnest. Julian Mintz, adopted son of Yang Wen-Li, enlists in the Alliance military and, while being trained during a routine patrol, finds himself caught up in a conflict with a passing Empire fleet. Under the command of Dusty Attenborough, the Alliance soldiers struggle to hold their ground until Yang can send reinforcements, as Julian and his fellow recruits struggle to adapt to the realities of being thrust into real combat for the first time.    Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These Gekitotsu is the third season of the new anime of Yoshiki Tanaka's epic science fiction novel and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?    Christopher Farris  Rating:                Three years later we're back with another set of new Legend of the Galactic Heroes movies, with Crunchyroll once again chopping them up and releasing them as weekly episodes. Granted, it's more likely the other way around, as just with the pacing of the previous 'season', this first episode pretty clearly functions as an isolated half-hour that is connected with a greater whole as any piece of serialized storytelling. And it means there's enough focus in this premiere episode to bring us back into the story of all these Galactic Heroes, with just enough passing remarks on the status quo to remind us of how we got here (Though given the storied history-book density of LOGH, it might not hurt to at least go back and peruse some synopses for the preceding plot. It has been three actual years after all).    Helping to ease us into all that is the fact that this one has a relatively narrower, smaller-scale focus than LOGH adventures previously tended to end up with. The real-world-style march of time in this galaxy sees Yang's young ward Julian formally enlist in the Alliance military, and it's through his eyes that we get back to engaging with the focal conflict of this series. It comes off as a brisk, concentrated re-introduction to things, where instead of focusing on Reinhard or his consolidations in the Empire, we get a bunch of flashbacks to Julian's training and details of what he's been put through up until this first battle he finds himself in. They do also throw in some informational setup for future long-term developments of this arc (there's a reason a class question prompts a whole spiel from Julian about warp technology), but otherwise this is firmly a story about seeing the war through the fresh eyes of a rookie and their feelings of contrast with the various flavors of veteran we know exist in the LOGH ranks.    That's all well and good in terms of directly defining Julian as we follow him in this new stage of his life and the show's plot, but it does also have the side effect of the series feeling given to over-explaining its tones at every turn. There's basically no time to see Julian reflect on his situation on his own; each point has to be punctuated by a conversation with someone else in this establishment. For instance, the episode sends Dusty down to just have this detailed, emotional conversation with Julian in-between fighting where the kid directly exposits all his thoughts and feelings about the battle he was just in. The episode ends with Julian's rookie-in-arms Peter rambling about the complexities of experience and survivor's guilt in relation to the deaths of their more experienced comrades, when the following simple, solemn shot of Julian looking up at his instructor's name on the listing of the deceased communicates that same impact much more effectively in a moment. If you've been keeping up with this LOGH adaptation this long, these kinds of overt sensibilities aren't really surprising, but it's still mildly annoying to see them still in place, even as the series shows inklings of knowing how to do more with less.    Thankfully, a lot of the appreciable little touches of LOGH persist here. I love the bit where Dusty relates a funny anecdote to the bridge crew and they all laugh, despite being in the middle of a heated battle. Similarly, the idea that ostensibly-inexperienced fighter-pilot movements would cause Empire officers to second-guess their approaches because they're used to going up against Yang's galaxy-brain strategies is a fun acknowledgement of how far reputation for the main characters has come at this point in the story. And it's all presented with the now-expected glossy finish of this modern animated adaptation, making the most of the opportunity to open with an episode that features a bunch of zippy space-ship dogfights. Some of its less-welcome adaptational flourishes persist, but this is still recognizably Legend of the Galactic Heroes, and it's still nice to have more of it.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                One of the great things about space operas is the size of their stories. Here we have the start of a new season, with one of our warring protagonists suffering from the tragic death of a close friend and the other having just crushed a rebellion full of people he respected. Yet this episode touches on none of that—our main characters barely even make an appearance. Rather, it is a largely self-contained “boots on the ground” story from the front lines centering on the first deployment of Yang Wen-li's adoptive son, Julian.    Julain is in a unique position. While he is intelligent and brave, he stands in the shadow of the Alliance's greatest hero. Instead of being jealous of this fact, he is humbled and wants to be of use to his adopted father. But how do you support a man like that? By becoming a fighter pilot, Julain has decided to be Yang's eyes on the front. His personal struggle over the episode is one of ego, learning to accept the victories and the losses without letting them go to his head or force him into despair.    At the same time, the whole episode is a graphic example of the futility of war. What we watch is a meaningless battle: two patrolling fleets that run into each other and start fighting. Then both sides call in reinforcements and it just snowballs. It's a pointless meatgrinder of a battle. Nothing will change based on who wins or loses. By the time Yang shows up with a fleet so massive that retreat is the only option for the Empire, pretty much every fighter pilot besides Julian is dead—and the one other newbie who made it through is on the edge of a mental break.    It's great stuff full of drama that explores the nature of the human soul—or to put it another way, it's an average episode of The Legend of Galactic Heroes.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review          1 comment       Hello, Melancholic!

Helping to ease us into all that is the fact that this one has a relatively narrower, smaller-scale focus than LOGH adventures previously tended to end up with. The real-world-style march of time in this galaxy sees Yang's young ward Julian formally enlist in the Alliance military, and it's through his eyes that we get back to engaging with the focal conflict of this series. It comes off as a brisk, concentrated re-introduction to things, where instead of focusing on Reinhard or his consolidations in the Empire, we get a bunch of flashbacks to Julian's training and details of what he's been put through up until this first battle he finds himself in. They do also throw in some informational setup for future long-term developments of this arc (there's a reason a class question prompts a whole spiel from Julian about warp technology), but otherwise this is firmly a story about seeing the war through the fresh eyes of a rookie and their feelings of contrast with the various flavors of veteran we know exist in the LOGH ranks.    That's all well and good in terms of directly defining Julian as we follow him in this new stage of his life and the show's plot, but it does also have the side effect of the series feeling given to over-explaining its tones at every turn. There's basically no time to see Julian reflect on his situation on his own; each point has to be punctuated by a conversation with someone else in this establishment. For instance, the episode sends Dusty down to just have this detailed, emotional conversation with Julian in-between fighting where the kid directly exposits all his thoughts and feelings about the battle he was just in. The episode ends with Julian's rookie-in-arms Peter rambling about the complexities of experience and survivor's guilt in relation to the deaths of their more experienced comrades, when the following simple, solemn shot of Julian looking up at his instructor's name on the listing of the deceased communicates that same impact much more effectively in a moment. If you've been keeping up with this LOGH adaptation this long, these kinds of overt sensibilities aren't really surprising, but it's still mildly annoying to see them still in place, even as the series shows inklings of knowing how to do more with less.    Thankfully, a lot of the appreciable little touches of LOGH persist here. I love the bit where Dusty relates a funny anecdote to the bridge crew and they all laugh, despite being in the middle of a heated battle. Similarly, the idea that ostensibly-inexperienced fighter-pilot movements would cause Empire officers to second-guess their approaches because they're used to going up against Yang's galaxy-brain strategies is a fun acknowledgement of how far reputation for the main characters has come at this point in the story. And it's all presented with the now-expected glossy finish of this modern animated adaptation, making the most of the opportunity to open with an episode that features a bunch of zippy space-ship dogfights. Some of its less-welcome adaptational flourishes persist, but this is still recognizably Legend of the Galactic Heroes, and it's still nice to have more of it.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                One of the great things about space operas is the size of their stories. Here we have the start of a new season, with one of our warring protagonists suffering from the tragic death of a close friend and the other having just crushed a rebellion full of people he respected. Yet this episode touches on none of that—our main characters barely even make an appearance. Rather, it is a largely self-contained “boots on the ground” story from the front lines centering on the first deployment of Yang Wen-li's adoptive son, Julian.    Julain is in a unique position. While he is intelligent and brave, he stands in the shadow of the Alliance's greatest hero. Instead of being jealous of this fact, he is humbled and wants to be of use to his adopted father. But how do you support a man like that? By becoming a fighter pilot, Julain has decided to be Yang's eyes on the front. His personal struggle over the episode is one of ego, learning to accept the victories and the losses without letting them go to his head or force him into despair.    At the same time, the whole episode is a graphic example of the futility of war. What we watch is a meaningless battle: two patrolling fleets that run into each other and start fighting. Then both sides call in reinforcements and it just snowballs. It's a pointless meatgrinder of a battle. Nothing will change based on who wins or loses. By the time Yang shows up with a fleet so massive that retreat is the only option for the Empire, pretty much every fighter pilot besides Julian is dead—and the one other newbie who made it through is on the edge of a mental break.    It's great stuff full of drama that explores the nature of the human soul—or to put it another way, it's an average episode of The Legend of Galactic Heroes.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review          1 comment       Hello, Melancholic!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These Gekitotsu   Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 25 of Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision (movies) ?                     Community score: 4.5              What is this?   Following the resolution of their respective civil wars, the conflict between the Free Planets Alliance and the Galactic Empire has resumed in earnest. Julian Mintz, adopted son of Yang Wen-Li, enlists in the Alliance military and, while being trained during a routine patrol, finds himself caught up in a conflict with a passing Empire fleet. Under the command of Dusty Attenborough, the Alliance soldiers struggle to hold their ground until Yang can send reinforcements, as Julian and his fellow recruits struggle to adapt to the realities of being thrust into real combat for the first time.    Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These Gekitotsu is the third season of the new anime of Yoshiki Tanaka's epic science fiction novel and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?    Christopher Farris  Rating:                Three years later we're back with another set of new Legend of the Galactic Heroes movies, with Crunchyroll once again chopping them up and releasing them as weekly episodes. Granted, it's more likely the other way around, as just with the pacing of the previous 'season', this first episode pretty clearly functions as an isolated half-hour that is connected with a greater whole as any piece of serialized storytelling. And it means there's enough focus in this premiere episode to bring us back into the story of all these Galactic Heroes, with just enough passing remarks on the status quo to remind us of how we got here (Though given the storied history-book density of LOGH, it might not hurt to at least go back and peruse some synopses for the preceding plot. It has been three actual years after all).    Helping to ease us into all that is the fact that this one has a relatively narrower, smaller-scale focus than LOGH adventures previously tended to end up with. The real-world-style march of time in this galaxy sees Yang's young ward Julian formally enlist in the Alliance military, and it's through his eyes that we get back to engaging with the focal conflict of this series. It comes off as a brisk, concentrated re-introduction to things, where instead of focusing on Reinhard or his consolidations in the Empire, we get a bunch of flashbacks to Julian's training and details of what he's been put through up until this first battle he finds himself in. They do also throw in some informational setup for future long-term developments of this arc (there's a reason a class question prompts a whole spiel from Julian about warp technology), but otherwise this is firmly a story about seeing the war through the fresh eyes of a rookie and their feelings of contrast with the various flavors of veteran we know exist in the LOGH ranks.    That's all well and good in terms of directly defining Julian as we follow him in this new stage of his life and the show's plot, but it does also have the side effect of the series feeling given to over-explaining its tones at every turn. There's basically no time to see Julian reflect on his situation on his own; each point has to be punctuated by a conversation with someone else in this establishment. For instance, the episode sends Dusty down to just have this detailed, emotional conversation with Julian in-between fighting where the kid directly exposits all his thoughts and feelings about the battle he was just in. The episode ends with Julian's rookie-in-arms Peter rambling about the complexities of experience and survivor's guilt in relation to the deaths of their more experienced comrades, when the following simple, solemn shot of Julian looking up at his instructor's name on the listing of the deceased communicates that same impact much more effectively in a moment. If you've been keeping up with this LOGH adaptation this long, these kinds of overt sensibilities aren't really surprising, but it's still mildly annoying to see them still in place, even as the series shows inklings of knowing how to do more with less.    Thankfully, a lot of the appreciable little touches of LOGH persist here. I love the bit where Dusty relates a funny anecdote to the bridge crew and they all laugh, despite being in the middle of a heated battle. Similarly, the idea that ostensibly-inexperienced fighter-pilot movements would cause Empire officers to second-guess their approaches because they're used to going up against Yang's galaxy-brain strategies is a fun acknowledgement of how far reputation for the main characters has come at this point in the story. And it's all presented with the now-expected glossy finish of this modern animated adaptation, making the most of the opportunity to open with an episode that features a bunch of zippy space-ship dogfights. Some of its less-welcome adaptational flourishes persist, but this is still recognizably Legend of the Galactic Heroes, and it's still nice to have more of it.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                One of the great things about space operas is the size of their stories. Here we have the start of a new season, with one of our warring protagonists suffering from the tragic death of a close friend and the other having just crushed a rebellion full of people he respected.

His personal struggle over the episode is one of ego, learning to accept the victories and the losses without letting them go to his head or force him into despair.    At the same time, the whole episode is a graphic example of the futility of war. What we watch is a meaningless battle: two patrolling fleets that run into each other and start fighting. Then both sides call in reinforcements and it just snowballs. It's a pointless meatgrinder of a battle. Nothing will change based on who wins or loses. By the time Yang shows up with a fleet so massive that retreat is the only option for the Empire, pretty much every fighter pilot besides Julian is dead—and the one other newbie who made it through is on the edge of a mental break.    It's great stuff full of drama that explores the nature of the human soul—or to put it another way, it's an average episode of The Legend of Galactic Heroes.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review          1 comment       Hello, Melancholic!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These Gekitotsu   Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 25 of Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision (movies) ?                     Community score: 4.5              What is this?   Following the resolution of their respective civil wars, the conflict between the Free Planets Alliance and the Galactic Empire has resumed in earnest. Julian Mintz, adopted son of Yang Wen-Li, enlists in the Alliance military and, while being trained during a routine patrol, finds himself caught up in a conflict with a passing Empire fleet. Under the command of Dusty Attenborough, the Alliance soldiers struggle to hold their ground until Yang can send reinforcements, as Julian and his fellow recruits struggle to adapt to the realities of being thrust into real combat for the first time.    Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These Gekitotsu is the third season of the new anime of Yoshiki Tanaka's epic science fiction novel and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?    Christopher Farris  Rating:                Three years later we're back with another set of new Legend of the Galactic Heroes movies, with Crunchyroll once again chopping them up and releasing them as weekly episodes. Granted, it's more likely the other way around, as just with the pacing of the previous 'season', this first episode pretty clearly functions as an isolated half-hour that is connected with a greater whole as any piece of serialized storytelling. And it means there's enough focus in this premiere episode to bring us back into the story of all these Galactic Heroes, with just enough passing remarks on the status quo to remind us of how we got here (Though given the storied history-book density of LOGH, it might not hurt to at least go back and peruse some synopses for the preceding plot. It has been three actual years after all).    Helping to ease us into all that is the fact that this one has a relatively narrower, smaller-scale focus than LOGH adventures previously tended to end up with. The real-world-style march of time in this galaxy sees Yang's young ward Julian formally enlist in the Alliance military, and it's through his eyes that we get back to engaging with the focal conflict of this series. It comes off as a brisk, concentrated re-introduction to things, where instead of focusing on Reinhard or his consolidations in the Empire, we get a bunch of flashbacks to Julian's training and details of what he's been put through up until this first battle he finds himself in. They do also throw in some informational setup for future long-term developments of this arc (there's a reason a class question prompts a whole spiel from Julian about warp technology), but otherwise this is firmly a story about seeing the war through the fresh eyes of a rookie and their feelings of contrast with the various flavors of veteran we know exist in the LOGH ranks.    That's all well and good in terms of directly defining Julian as we follow him in this new stage of his life and the show's plot, but it does also have the side effect of the series feeling given to over-explaining its tones at every turn. There's basically no time to see Julian reflect on his situation on his own; each point has to be punctuated by a conversation with someone else in this establishment. For instance, the episode sends Dusty down to just have this detailed, emotional conversation with Julian in-between fighting where the kid directly exposits all his thoughts and feelings about the battle he was just in. The episode ends with Julian's rookie-in-arms Peter rambling about the complexities of experience and survivor's guilt in relation to the deaths of their more experienced comrades, when the following simple, solemn shot of Julian looking up at his instructor's name on the listing of the deceased communicates that same impact much more effectively in a moment. If you've been keeping up with this LOGH adaptation this long, these kinds of overt sensibilities aren't really surprising, but it's still mildly annoying to see them still in place, even as the series shows inklings of knowing how to do more with less.    Thankfully, a lot of the appreciable little touches of LOGH persist here. I love the bit where Dusty relates a funny anecdote to the bridge crew and they all laugh, despite being in the middle of a heated battle. Similarly, the idea that ostensibly-inexperienced fighter-pilot movements would cause Empire officers to second-guess their approaches because they're used to going up against Yang's galaxy-brain strategies is a fun acknowledgement of how far reputation for the main characters has come at this point in the story. And it's all presented with the now-expected glossy finish of this modern animated adaptation, making the most of the opportunity to open with an episode that features a bunch of zippy space-ship dogfights. Some of its less-welcome adaptational flourishes persist, but this is still recognizably Legend of the Galactic Heroes, and it's still nice to have more of it.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                One of the great things about space operas is the size of their stories. Here we have the start of a new season, with one of our warring protagonists suffering from the tragic death of a close friend and the other having just crushed a rebellion full of people he respected. Yet this episode touches on none of that—our main characters barely even make an appearance. Rather, it is a largely self-contained “boots on the ground” story from the front lines centering on the first deployment of Yang Wen-li's adoptive son, Julian.    Julain is in a unique position. While he is intelligent and brave, he stands in the shadow of the Alliance's greatest hero. Instead of being jealous of this fact, he is humbled and wants to be of use to his adopted father. But how do you support a man like that? By becoming a fighter pilot, Julain has decided to be Yang's eyes on the front. His personal struggle over the episode is one of ego, learning to accept the victories and the losses without letting them go to his head or force him into despair.    At the same time, the whole episode is a graphic example of the futility of war. What we watch is a meaningless battle: two patrolling fleets that run into each other and start fighting. Then both sides call in reinforcements and it just snowballs. It's a pointless meatgrinder of a battle. Nothing will change based on who wins or loses. By the time Yang shows up with a fleet so massive that retreat is the only option for the Empire, pretty much every fighter pilot besides Julian is dead—and the one other newbie who made it through is on the edge of a mental break.    It's great stuff full of drama that explores the nature of the human soul—or to put it another way, it's an average episode of The Legend of Galactic Heroes.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review          1 comment       Hello, Melancholic!

There's basically no time to see Julian reflect on his situation on his own; each point has to be punctuated by a conversation with someone else in this establishment. For instance, the episode sends Dusty down to just have this detailed, emotional conversation with Julian in-between fighting where the kid directly exposits all his thoughts and feelings about the battle he was just in. The episode ends with Julian's rookie-in-arms Peter rambling about the complexities of experience and survivor's guilt in relation to the deaths of their more experienced comrades, when the following simple, solemn shot of Julian looking up at his instructor's name on the listing of the deceased communicates that same impact much more effectively in a moment. If you've been keeping up with this LOGH adaptation this long, these kinds of overt sensibilities aren't really surprising, but it's still mildly annoying to see them still in place, even as the series shows inklings of knowing how to do more with less.    Thankfully, a lot of the appreciable little touches of LOGH persist here. I love the bit where Dusty relates a funny anecdote to the bridge crew and they all laugh, despite being in the middle of a heated battle. Similarly, the idea that ostensibly-inexperienced fighter-pilot movements would cause Empire officers to second-guess their approaches because they're used to going up against Yang's galaxy-brain strategies is a fun acknowledgement of how far reputation for the main characters has come at this point in the story. And it's all presented with the now-expected glossy finish of this modern animated adaptation, making the most of the opportunity to open with an episode that features a bunch of zippy space-ship dogfights. Some of its less-welcome adaptational flourishes persist, but this is still recognizably Legend of the Galactic Heroes, and it's still nice to have more of it.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                One of the great things about space operas is the size of their stories. Here we have the start of a new season, with one of our warring protagonists suffering from the tragic death of a close friend and the other having just crushed a rebellion full of people he respected. Yet this episode touches on none of that—our main characters barely even make an appearance. Rather, it is a largely self-contained “boots on the ground” story from the front lines centering on the first deployment of Yang Wen-li's adoptive son, Julian.    Julain is in a unique position. While he is intelligent and brave, he stands in the shadow of the Alliance's greatest hero. Instead of being jealous of this fact, he is humbled and wants to be of use to his adopted father. But how do you support a man like that? By becoming a fighter pilot, Julain has decided to be Yang's eyes on the front. His personal struggle over the episode is one of ego, learning to accept the victories and the losses without letting them go to his head or force him into despair.    At the same time, the whole episode is a graphic example of the futility of war. What we watch is a meaningless battle: two patrolling fleets that run into each other and start fighting. Then both sides call in reinforcements and it just snowballs. It's a pointless meatgrinder of a battle. Nothing will change based on who wins or loses. By the time Yang shows up with a fleet so massive that retreat is the only option for the Empire, pretty much every fighter pilot besides Julian is dead—and the one other newbie who made it through is on the edge of a mental break.    It's great stuff full of drama that explores the nature of the human soul—or to put it another way, it's an average episode of The Legend of Galactic Heroes.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These Gekitotsu   Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 25 of Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision (movies) ?                     Community score: 4.5              What is this?   Following the resolution of their respective civil wars, the conflict between the Free Planets Alliance and the Galactic Empire has resumed in earnest. Julian Mintz, adopted son of Yang Wen-Li, enlists in the Alliance military and, while being trained during a routine patrol, finds himself caught up in a conflict with a passing Empire fleet. Under the command of Dusty Attenborough, the Alliance soldiers struggle to hold their ground until Yang can send reinforcements, as Julian and his fellow recruits struggle to adapt to the realities of being thrust into real combat for the first time.    Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These Gekitotsu is the third season of the new anime of Yoshiki Tanaka's epic science fiction novel and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?    Christopher Farris  Rating:                Three years later we're back with another set of new Legend of the Galactic Heroes movies, with Crunchyroll once again chopping them up and releasing them as weekly episodes. Granted, it's more likely the other way around, as just with the pacing of the previous 'season', this first episode pretty clearly functions as an isolated half-hour that is connected with a greater whole as any piece of serialized storytelling. And it means there's enough focus in this premiere episode to bring us back into the story of all these Galactic Heroes, with just enough passing remarks on the status quo to remind us of how we got here (Though given the storied history-book density of LOGH, it might not hurt to at least go back and peruse some synopses for the preceding plot. It has been three actual years after all).    Helping to ease us into all that is the fact that this one has a relatively narrower, smaller-scale focus than LOGH adventures previously tended to end up with. The real-world-style march of time in this galaxy sees Yang's young ward Julian formally enlist in the Alliance military, and it's through his eyes that we get back to engaging with the focal conflict of this series. It comes off as a brisk, concentrated re-introduction to things, where instead of focusing on Reinhard or his consolidations in the Empire, we get a bunch of flashbacks to Julian's training and details of what he's been put through up until this first battle he finds himself in. They do also throw in some informational setup for future long-term developments of this arc (there's a reason a class question prompts a whole spiel from Julian about warp technology), but otherwise this is firmly a story about seeing the war through the fresh eyes of a rookie and their feelings of contrast with the various flavors of veteran we know exist in the LOGH ranks.

Similarly, the idea that ostensibly-inexperienced fighter-pilot movements would cause Empire officers to second-guess their approaches because they're used to going up against Yang's galaxy-brain strategies is a fun acknowledgement of how far reputation for the main characters has come at this point in the story. And it's all presented with the now-expected glossy finish of this modern animated adaptation, making the most of the opportunity to open with an episode that features a bunch of zippy space-ship dogfights. Some of its less-welcome adaptational flourishes persist, but this is still recognizably Legend of the Galactic Heroes, and it's still nice to have more of it.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                One of the great things about space operas is the size of their stories. Here we have the start of a new season, with one of our warring protagonists suffering from the tragic death of a close friend and the other having just crushed a rebellion full of people he respected. Yet this episode touches on none of that—our main characters barely even make an appearance. Rather, it is a largely self-contained “boots on the ground” story from the front lines centering on the first deployment of Yang Wen-li's adoptive son, Julian.    Julain is in a unique position. While he is intelligent and brave, he stands in the shadow of the Alliance's greatest hero. Instead of being jealous of this fact, he is humbled and wants to be of use to his adopted father. But how do you support a man like that? By becoming a fighter pilot, Julain has decided to be Yang's eyes on the front. His personal struggle over the episode is one of ego, learning to accept the victories and the losses without letting them go to his head or force him into despair.    At the same time, the whole episode is a graphic example of the futility of war. What we watch is a meaningless battle: two patrolling fleets that run into each other and start fighting. Then both sides call in reinforcements and it just snowballs. It's a pointless meatgrinder of a battle. Nothing will change based on who wins or loses. By the time Yang shows up with a fleet so massive that retreat is the only option for the Empire, pretty much every fighter pilot besides Julian is dead—and the one other newbie who made it through is on the edge of a mental break.    It's great stuff full of drama that explores the nature of the human soul—or to put it another way, it's an average episode of The Legend of Galactic Heroes.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives    ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 4.5              What is this?   Following the resolution of their respective civil wars, the conflict between the Free Planets Alliance and the Galactic Empire has resumed in earnest. Julian Mintz, adopted son of Yang Wen-Li, enlists in the Alliance military and, while being trained during a routine patrol, finds himself caught up in a conflict with a passing Empire fleet. Under the command of Dusty Attenborough, the Alliance soldiers struggle to hold their ground until Yang can send reinforcements, as Julian and his fellow recruits struggle to adapt to the realities of being thrust into real combat for the first time.    Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These Gekitotsu is the third season of the new anime of Yoshiki Tanaka's epic science fiction novel and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?    Christopher Farris  Rating:                Three years later we're back with another set of new Legend of the Galactic Heroes movies, with Crunchyroll once again chopping them up and releasing them as weekly episodes. Granted, it's more likely the other way around, as just with the pacing of the previous 'season', this first episode pretty clearly functions as an isolated half-hour that is connected with a greater whole as any piece of serialized storytelling. And it means there's enough focus in this premiere episode to bring us back into the story of all these Galactic Heroes, with just enough passing remarks on the status quo to remind us of how we got here (Though given the storied history-book density of LOGH, it might not hurt to at least go back and peruse some synopses for the preceding plot. It has been three actual years after all).    Helping to ease us into all that is the fact that this one has a relatively narrower, smaller-scale focus than LOGH adventures previously tended to end up with. The real-world-style march of time in this galaxy sees Yang's young ward Julian formally enlist in the Alliance military, and it's through his eyes that we get back to engaging with the focal conflict of this series. It comes off as a brisk, concentrated re-introduction to things, where instead of focusing on Reinhard or his consolidations in the Empire, we get a bunch of flashbacks to Julian's training and details of what he's been put through up until this first battle he finds himself in. They do also throw in some informational setup for future long-term developments of this arc (there's a reason a class question prompts a whole spiel from Julian about warp technology), but otherwise this is firmly a story about seeing the war through the fresh eyes of a rookie and their feelings of contrast with the various flavors of veteran we know exist in the LOGH ranks.    That's all well and good in terms of directly defining Julian as we follow him in this new stage of his life and the show's plot, but it does also have the side effect of the series feeling given to over-explaining its tones at every turn. There's basically no time to see Julian reflect on his situation on his own; each point has to be punctuated by a conversation with someone else in this establishment. For instance, the episode sends Dusty down to just have this detailed, emotional conversation with Julian in-between fighting where the kid directly exposits all his thoughts and feelings about the battle he was just in. The episode ends with Julian's rookie-in-arms Peter rambling about the complexities of experience and survivor's guilt in relation to the deaths of their more experienced comrades, when the following simple, solemn shot of Julian looking up at his instructor's name on the listing of the deceased communicates that same impact much more effectively in a moment. If you've been keeping up with this LOGH adaptation this long, these kinds of overt sensibilities aren't really surprising, but it's still mildly annoying to see them still in place, even as the series shows inklings of knowing how to do more with less.
