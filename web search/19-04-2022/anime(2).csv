The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Fanfare of Adolescence   Apr  3rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Fanfare of Adolescence ?                     Community score: 3.0              What is this?   There's a competitive, three-year horse racing academy that trains boys to become jockeys. Those who wish to enter must not only pass an academic test but a physical and fitness test as well. Yū Arimura is a former popular idol who becomes enamored with horse racing after seeing it for the first time, and wants to join the academy. Shun Kazanami was raised on an island, and only experienced horse races through radio broadcasts growing up. Amane comes from a high-class family in England, and his father is a former jockey. The show follows these three 15-year-old boys and others at the academy.    Fanfare of Adolescence is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                It's hard to believe we've gotten two such diametrically opposed sports anime in one day! While Love All Play was pure grounded realism, Fanfare of Adolescence leans to the opposite side of the spectrum, all high emotion and contrived drama. It stops just short of superpowers, although one of the characters does have a preternatural connection with horses. Which one is better depends pretty much entirely on your preferences, but I'm going to be real with you – neither is very good, albeit for different reasons.    Going in, I knew that one of the big challenges for Fanfare of Adolescence was going to be its animation. Horses are notoriously difficult to draw and even harder to animate, and modern anime have resorted to all kinds of shortcuts to get around this complication. They almost never look good and at times are even comically bad. But I figured, of course an anime about jockeying would figure something out! Recruit some talented animators who could draw their way around knobbly knees and long faces and bring some majesty to these beautiful creatures.    But then the first horse showed up and it was all awkward, uncanny CG and oh dear, this is not going to be a good-looking series at all, is it?    Not that it would be a good-looking show, even if Yuu's brain didn't explode into a LiSA Frank nightmare every time he thought about equids. There's a ton of bizarre camera angles, including shots of legs, crotch shots as characters cross their legs, and on-the-nose visual metaphors involving two paths going through the woods interrupted by visions of horses made out of cherry blossoms. No, seriously.    All of this is in favor of a supremely contrived plot. If Yuu has never been on a horse before, how the heck did he make it into jockey school? The script makes such a big deal about how hard the school is to get into, but is that just because of its standard entrance exam? Why is Waver Velvet one of his classmates? Why did cherry blossoms appear when Shun catches Yuu? Is this actually BL? Not that I'd be complaining if it was…    Fanfare of Adolescence operates on the same kind of logic as male idol shows, where nobody acts quite like a person and things happen just because rather than any kind of internal logic. It's silly, and while it should be a fun ride for the right kind of fan, I doubt it'll be a runaway success.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Sports anime often begin with someone being charmed by a sport they know nothing about and being driven to learn it. Fanfare of Adolescence takes this common framework and makes it about the lead singer of a popular teen boy band who decides to throw away his career and become a jockey. It's a convenient, if somewhat ridiculous, setup that makes him both hated by the serious jockey students and eager to prove himself. It's not great but it works well enough for a first episode—and it helps that the other students feel like people rather than walking tropes.    What really got my eyes rolling, however, was the back half of the episode. That these kids, who are “serious” about becoming jockeys, know nothing about horses is pure insanity and hurts me on a deeply personal level. Everything they do in this episode is wrong at best and life-threatening at worst. The scene of Yuu and Shun galloping double as they try to catch the reins of a panicking racehorse had me livid—and that's before it's revealed that neither had even gotten on a horse before. It's so ludicrously stupid that I can't help but wonder if the writers had ever even talked to a person who had any experience with riding a horse before. Then comes all the layers of metaphysical bullshit—i.e., ghost horses and listening to the sounds of nature—and this couldn't have rubbed me the wrong way more.    And yet, despite all that, I don't regret watching this episode. For all its misconceptions about horseback riding, it is a master class in direction. Nearly every shot in this episode is visually interesting. What could have been a normal scene of Yuu walking down the street is instead enhanced by showing him reflected through convex mirrors. Massive wide shots are used to show when he is lost, and moments of extreme emotion are effectively conveyed through close-ups on his mouth. And that's before we get into the breathtaking beauty of the surreal moments of the episode. At this point, if Makoto Katō directed an anime about buttering toast I'd watch it. Add in a score penned by Hiroyuki Sawano and I am left torn. Is it possible to watch an anime with a story you hate just because you love everything else about it? I don't know, but I have a sneaking suspicion I'm going to find out.        James Beckett  Rating:               I'm going to have to use one of my ADHD Passes on this one, y'all. I'm on my meds, I swear, and I even had a half-cup of strong coffee just before watching Fanfare of Adolescence. I closed any distracting tabs, I avoided Wikipedia and Twitter at all costs, and I even put my phone in the other room. Even with my best-laid precautions, though, I had to restart this premiere three times just to get through the first ten minutes. My brain simply would not entertain the notion of being able to focus on Fanfare of Adolescence for more than a minute or two before it started to wander, keen on occupying my time with literally anything else. Twice, right around the time that the Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up guide our hero Yu past The World's Most Obvious Visual Metaphor, I got up to do chores.    I'm not into horse jockeying, personally, but that doesn't mean that I'm going to automatically dismiss a show for having depicting subject matter that doesn't specifically cater to my interests. I care about ice skating about as much as I care about horse sports, and that didn't stop me from loving the hell out of Yuri!!! on Ice. The problem with Fanfare of Adolescence is not that it is about a niche sport. The show simply makes the same mistake that a lot of really specific sports and hobby shows make: It assumes that, so long as the main gimmick is covered and you've got a cast of vaguely handsome anime boys (and girl) to throw at the screen, the audience won't notice that you've completely forgotten to come up with a decent story.    We're talking about a main character who is throwing away the life of a professional pop idol and abandoning his fame to pursue a career as a horse jockey. How on Earth does a guy like that end up being the least interesting member of a cast that is comprised of other guys whose only defining features are their hair styles? When the hilariously sincere Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up, and I finally made it through to the second half of the episode, I was hoping I might at least get some kicks out of the show's unintentional camp factor, but no, we can't even trust a goofy acid-trip phantom to stick around long enough to keep things interesting.    Instead, once the not-drama of Yu's arrival at Horse School is over with, we're treated to the similarly terrifying Actual Living Horses that the boys (and gal) have to deal with, and I'll give Fanfare of Adolescence this much: Even if the CGI horses look really awkward, I was kind of excited to watch them get all spooked and run around a bunch. I knew it was too much to ask for one of them to legitimately kick one of the characters in the head, although my hopes were briefly raised when ol' Yu somehow got it in his head that he could win a game of chicken against a 600-pund behemoth with stones for feet. Still, if nothing else, the show about horse racing was kind enough to have the riders and horses actually do stuff for a bit, and that kept my brain distracted long enough for me to get through the rest of the premiere relatively unscathed.    I didn't hate Fanfare of Adolescence, but it's tone and style are diametrically opposed to my own sensibilities, and it's going to take a hell of a lot more than C-tier characters and cookie-cutter cliches to win me over. I'm sure it will be just the thing for some folks, though, which means that, with any luck. Psychedelic Ghost Horse may yet ride again.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Let me start with what I really admire about this first episode: at the prestigious jockey academy our hero quits being an idol to attend, the token girl student is allowed to wear pants. That's right, her uniform is exactly like the boys' and no one is treating her ambitions as less than the boys' – in fact, they're much kinder to Eri than they are to Yu, the aforementioned former idol. It would have been so easy to take the typical anime road here and tart up her uniform, and that they didn't inclined me to take this a bit more seriously than I otherwise might have.    Although the phantom horse made out of sakura petals that guides Yu to the correct path to school is a bit much. As are the band-uniform look of the instructors, and Shun's preternatural nature skills that enable him to read the wind, stand motionless in the bow of a boat going full speed, and perfectly ride a horse for the first time ever while chasing another, spooked horse. There's definitely some imbalance in this episode, and that takes away from its more grounded moments, like the very real garbage poor Yu is getting for deciding to do something with his life that no one expected, and the body language of the horses. (Their ears, specifically.) It's hard to tell how closely this is going to stick to the realities of learning to work with and ride horses professionally and how much odd metaphysical stuff is going to get in the way of that.    The premise isn't bad, though, and it's not hard to get behind Yu's desire to do something different with his life. We can simultaneously see how he's very good at putting on a public face and how draining that is for him; one of his strongest moments in this episode is when he tells off the reporters at the end, preferring to be addressed by his real name instead of his stage name. His classmates' mixed reactions to his presence is also decently handled; most of them don't quite know what to do with him, while one is visibly annoyed by his presence, possibly suspecting that this is all some sort of publicity stunt. As with most sports shows, there are a lot of named characters all thrown at us right off the bat, but they're at least nicely color-coded for those of us with no memory for names. I don't love the look of the show, mostly because (ears aside) there's something just a little off about the way the horses are drawn and animated. This feels like a very middle-of-the-road introductory episode, and I suspect that your enthusiasm for horses may determine if you decide to follow it.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This show was going to have an uphill battle with me from the start. Not because of the premise – I'm not big on horse racing, sure, but I like sports stories and animals, so a series about horse jockeys certainly could be cool. No, my problem was with the title: Fanfare of Adolescence sounds like a fake, joke anime you'd see in a real show. It's flowery as hell without actually telling you anything about the story or characters, and you could stick the name on damn near any high school drama anime and it would fit just fine. It's a bad name and they should feel bad about it.    The other issue it ran into early on is that I just don't care about our main character's big conflict in this premiere. Arimura may be a perfectly nice guy with some ridiculous Horse Sense, but when his whole struggle is that he's suddenly quit being a super popular idol to become a horse jockey, and every piece of conflict through this episode is about the media hounding him, it's just hard to relate to any of it. I don't care about how his orientation is awkward because of all the press, or how some of his classmates think he's just doing this for attention. I want to see some gosh dang horses, racing or at rest, and get an idea of how all these characters relate to the creatures they'll presumably be working with for the whole season. Get to that instead of prefacing it with all this showbiz drama.    Thankfully, things do pick up a bit once a random accident sets a couple of horses loose, and our freshman jockeys have to try and wrangle them. It's certainly cliché, and the way it actually happens is rather ridiculous, but it lets us actually see the interesting part of this premise for the final few minutes of the premiere, at least. It's not exactly stunning material – Arimura and his new buddy ride a horse together, rein in a second, and have a hilariously over-the-top shiptease moment to cap it off – but it's a conflict I wouldn't find in any other sports show airing this season. And while the CG on the horses leaves something to be desired, it at least looks alright in motion and manages to sell the speed of the whole thing. It's a serviceable presentation of why you'd want to watch this show instead of any given show about cute anime boys in high school, and I wish the rest of this premiere had been more like it.    In all, the premiere evens out to being just sorta ok. It's not terrible, though it is fairly dull until somebody actually mounts a horse. The biggest flaw is that for all the focus on Arimura's character he doesn't really have much discernible personality, and his co-star is instantly more engaging as some kind of Horse Savant. I may stick around just to see if they can manage to leave the idol plotline behind after this, but for now it's iffy.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review          1 comment       Hello, Melancholic!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Fanfare of Adolescence   Apr  3rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Fanfare of Adolescence ?                     Community score: 3.0              What is this?   There's a competitive, three-year horse racing academy that trains boys to become jockeys. Those who wish to enter must not only pass an academic test but a physical and fitness test as well. Yū Arimura is a former popular idol who becomes enamored with horse racing after seeing it for the first time, and wants to join the academy. Shun Kazanami was raised on an island, and only experienced horse races through radio broadcasts growing up. Amane comes from a high-class family in England, and his father is a former jockey. The show follows these three 15-year-old boys and others at the academy.    Fanfare of Adolescence is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                It's hard to believe we've gotten two such diametrically opposed sports anime in one day! While Love All Play was pure grounded realism, Fanfare of Adolescence leans to the opposite side of the spectrum, all high emotion and contrived drama. It stops just short of superpowers, although one of the characters does have a preternatural connection with horses. Which one is better depends pretty much entirely on your preferences, but I'm going to be real with you – neither is very good, albeit for different reasons.    Going in, I knew that one of the big challenges for Fanfare of Adolescence was going to be its animation. Horses are notoriously difficult to draw and even harder to animate, and modern anime have resorted to all kinds of shortcuts to get around this complication. They almost never look good and at times are even comically bad. But I figured, of course an anime about jockeying would figure something out! Recruit some talented animators who could draw their way around knobbly knees and long faces and bring some majesty to these beautiful creatures.    But then the first horse showed up and it was all awkward, uncanny CG and oh dear, this is not going to be a good-looking series at all, is it?    Not that it would be a good-looking show, even if Yuu's brain didn't explode into a LiSA Frank nightmare every time he thought about equids. There's a ton of bizarre camera angles, including shots of legs, crotch shots as characters cross their legs, and on-the-nose visual metaphors involving two paths going through the woods interrupted by visions of horses made out of cherry blossoms. No, seriously.    All of this is in favor of a supremely contrived plot. If Yuu has never been on a horse before, how the heck did he make it into jockey school? The script makes such a big deal about how hard the school is to get into, but is that just because of its standard entrance exam? Why is Waver Velvet one of his classmates? Why did cherry blossoms appear when Shun catches Yuu? Is this actually BL? Not that I'd be complaining if it was…    Fanfare of Adolescence operates on the same kind of logic as male idol shows, where nobody acts quite like a person and things happen just because rather than any kind of internal logic. It's silly, and while it should be a fun ride for the right kind of fan, I doubt it'll be a runaway success.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Sports anime often begin with someone being charmed by a sport they know nothing about and being driven to learn it. Fanfare of Adolescence takes this common framework and makes it about the lead singer of a popular teen boy band who decides to throw away his career and become a jockey. It's a convenient, if somewhat ridiculous, setup that makes him both hated by the serious jockey students and eager to prove himself. It's not great but it works well enough for a first episode—and it helps that the other students feel like people rather than walking tropes.    What really got my eyes rolling, however, was the back half of the episode. That these kids, who are “serious” about becoming jockeys, know nothing about horses is pure insanity and hurts me on a deeply personal level. Everything they do in this episode is wrong at best and life-threatening at worst. The scene of Yuu and Shun galloping double as they try to catch the reins of a panicking racehorse had me livid—and that's before it's revealed that neither had even gotten on a horse before. It's so ludicrously stupid that I can't help but wonder if the writers had ever even talked to a person who had any experience with riding a horse before. Then comes all the layers of metaphysical bullshit—i.e., ghost horses and listening to the sounds of nature—and this couldn't have rubbed me the wrong way more.    And yet, despite all that, I don't regret watching this episode. For all its misconceptions about horseback riding, it is a master class in direction. Nearly every shot in this episode is visually interesting. What could have been a normal scene of Yuu walking down the street is instead enhanced by showing him reflected through convex mirrors. Massive wide shots are used to show when he is lost, and moments of extreme emotion are effectively conveyed through close-ups on his mouth. And that's before we get into the breathtaking beauty of the surreal moments of the episode. At this point, if Makoto Katō directed an anime about buttering toast I'd watch it. Add in a score penned by Hiroyuki Sawano and I am left torn. Is it possible to watch an anime with a story you hate just because you love everything else about it? I don't know, but I have a sneaking suspicion I'm going to find out.        James Beckett  Rating:               I'm going to have to use one of my ADHD Passes on this one, y'all. I'm on my meds, I swear, and I even had a half-cup of strong coffee just before watching Fanfare of Adolescence. I closed any distracting tabs, I avoided Wikipedia and Twitter at all costs, and I even put my phone in the other room. Even with my best-laid precautions, though, I had to restart this premiere three times just to get through the first ten minutes. My brain simply would not entertain the notion of being able to focus on Fanfare of Adolescence for more than a minute or two before it started to wander, keen on occupying my time with literally anything else. Twice, right around the time that the Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up guide our hero Yu past The World's Most Obvious Visual Metaphor, I got up to do chores.    I'm not into horse jockeying, personally, but that doesn't mean that I'm going to automatically dismiss a show for having depicting subject matter that doesn't specifically cater to my interests. I care about ice skating about as much as I care about horse sports, and that didn't stop me from loving the hell out of Yuri!!! on Ice. The problem with Fanfare of Adolescence is not that it is about a niche sport. The show simply makes the same mistake that a lot of really specific sports and hobby shows make: It assumes that, so long as the main gimmick is covered and you've got a cast of vaguely handsome anime boys (and girl) to throw at the screen, the audience won't notice that you've completely forgotten to come up with a decent story.    We're talking about a main character who is throwing away the life of a professional pop idol and abandoning his fame to pursue a career as a horse jockey. How on Earth does a guy like that end up being the least interesting member of a cast that is comprised of other guys whose only defining features are their hair styles? When the hilariously sincere Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up, and I finally made it through to the second half of the episode, I was hoping I might at least get some kicks out of the show's unintentional camp factor, but no, we can't even trust a goofy acid-trip phantom to stick around long enough to keep things interesting.    Instead, once the not-drama of Yu's arrival at Horse School is over with, we're treated to the similarly terrifying Actual Living Horses that the boys (and gal) have to deal with, and I'll give Fanfare of Adolescence this much: Even if the CGI horses look really awkward, I was kind of excited to watch them get all spooked and run around a bunch. I knew it was too much to ask for one of them to legitimately kick one of the characters in the head, although my hopes were briefly raised when ol' Yu somehow got it in his head that he could win a game of chicken against a 600-pund behemoth with stones for feet. Still, if nothing else, the show about horse racing was kind enough to have the riders and horses actually do stuff for a bit, and that kept my brain distracted long enough for me to get through the rest of the premiere relatively unscathed.    I didn't hate Fanfare of Adolescence, but it's tone and style are diametrically opposed to my own sensibilities, and it's going to take a hell of a lot more than C-tier characters and cookie-cutter cliches to win me over. I'm sure it will be just the thing for some folks, though, which means that, with any luck. Psychedelic Ghost Horse may yet ride again.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Let me start with what I really admire about this first episode: at the prestigious jockey academy our hero quits being an idol to attend, the token girl student is allowed to wear pants. That's right, her uniform is exactly like the boys' and no one is treating her ambitions as less than the boys' – in fact, they're much kinder to Eri than they are to Yu, the aforementioned former idol. It would have been so easy to take the typical anime road here and tart up her uniform, and that they didn't inclined me to take this a bit more seriously than I otherwise might have.    Although the phantom horse made out of sakura petals that guides Yu to the correct path to school is a bit much. As are the band-uniform look of the instructors, and Shun's preternatural nature skills that enable him to read the wind, stand motionless in the bow of a boat going full speed, and perfectly ride a horse for the first time ever while chasing another, spooked horse. There's definitely some imbalance in this episode, and that takes away from its more grounded moments, like the very real garbage poor Yu is getting for deciding to do something with his life that no one expected, and the body language of the horses. (Their ears, specifically.) It's hard to tell how closely this is going to stick to the realities of learning to work with and ride horses professionally and how much odd metaphysical stuff is going to get in the way of that.    The premise isn't bad, though, and it's not hard to get behind Yu's desire to do something different with his life. We can simultaneously see how he's very good at putting on a public face and how draining that is for him; one of his strongest moments in this episode is when he tells off the reporters at the end, preferring to be addressed by his real name instead of his stage name. His classmates' mixed reactions to his presence is also decently handled; most of them don't quite know what to do with him, while one is visibly annoyed by his presence, possibly suspecting that this is all some sort of publicity stunt. As with most sports shows, there are a lot of named characters all thrown at us right off the bat, but they're at least nicely color-coded for those of us with no memory for names. I don't love the look of the show, mostly because (ears aside) there's something just a little off about the way the horses are drawn and animated. This feels like a very middle-of-the-road introductory episode, and I suspect that your enthusiasm for horses may determine if you decide to follow it.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This show was going to have an uphill battle with me from the start. Not because of the premise – I'm not big on horse racing, sure, but I like sports stories and animals, so a series about horse jockeys certainly could be cool. No, my problem was with the title: Fanfare of Adolescence sounds like a fake, joke anime you'd see in a real show. It's flowery as hell without actually telling you anything about the story or characters, and you could stick the name on damn near any high school drama anime and it would fit just fine. It's a bad name and they should feel bad about it.    The other issue it ran into early on is that I just don't care about our main character's big conflict in this premiere. Arimura may be a perfectly nice guy with some ridiculous Horse Sense, but when his whole struggle is that he's suddenly quit being a super popular idol to become a horse jockey, and every piece of conflict through this episode is about the media hounding him, it's just hard to relate to any of it. I don't care about how his orientation is awkward because of all the press, or how some of his classmates think he's just doing this for attention. I want to see some gosh dang horses, racing or at rest, and get an idea of how all these characters relate to the creatures they'll presumably be working with for the whole season. Get to that instead of prefacing it with all this showbiz drama.    Thankfully, things do pick up a bit once a random accident sets a couple of horses loose, and our freshman jockeys have to try and wrangle them. It's certainly cliché, and the way it actually happens is rather ridiculous, but it lets us actually see the interesting part of this premise for the final few minutes of the premiere, at least. It's not exactly stunning material – Arimura and his new buddy ride a horse together, rein in a second, and have a hilariously over-the-top shiptease moment to cap it off – but it's a conflict I wouldn't find in any other sports show airing this season. And while the CG on the horses leaves something to be desired, it at least looks alright in motion and manages to sell the speed of the whole thing. It's a serviceable presentation of why you'd want to watch this show instead of any given show about cute anime boys in high school, and I wish the rest of this premiere had been more like it.    In all, the premiere evens out to being just sorta ok. It's not terrible, though it is fairly dull until somebody actually mounts a horse. The biggest flaw is that for all the focus on Arimura's character he doesn't really have much discernible personality, and his co-star is instantly more engaging as some kind of Horse Savant. I may stick around just to see if they can manage to leave the idol plotline behind after this, but for now it's iffy.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review          1 comment       Hello, Melancholic!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Fanfare of Adolescence   Apr  3rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Fanfare of Adolescence ?                     Community score: 3.0              What is this?   There's a competitive, three-year horse racing academy that trains boys to become jockeys. Those who wish to enter must not only pass an academic test but a physical and fitness test as well. Yū Arimura is a former popular idol who becomes enamored with horse racing after seeing it for the first time, and wants to join the academy. Shun Kazanami was raised on an island, and only experienced horse races through radio broadcasts growing up. Amane comes from a high-class family in England, and his father is a former jockey. The show follows these three 15-year-old boys and others at the academy.    Fanfare of Adolescence is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                It's hard to believe we've gotten two such diametrically opposed sports anime in one day! While Love All Play was pure grounded realism, Fanfare of Adolescence leans to the opposite side of the spectrum, all high emotion and contrived drama. It stops just short of superpowers, although one of the characters does have a preternatural connection with horses. Which one is better depends pretty much entirely on your preferences, but I'm going to be real with you – neither is very good, albeit for different reasons.    Going in, I knew that one of the big challenges for Fanfare of Adolescence was going to be its animation. Horses are notoriously difficult to draw and even harder to animate, and modern anime have resorted to all kinds of shortcuts to get around this complication. They almost never look good and at times are even comically bad. But I figured, of course an anime about jockeying would figure something out! Recruit some talented animators who could draw their way around knobbly knees and long faces and bring some majesty to these beautiful creatures.    But then the first horse showed up and it was all awkward, uncanny CG and oh dear, this is not going to be a good-looking series at all, is it?    Not that it would be a good-looking show, even if Yuu's brain didn't explode into a LiSA Frank nightmare every time he thought about equids. There's a ton of bizarre camera angles, including shots of legs, crotch shots as characters cross their legs, and on-the-nose visual metaphors involving two paths going through the woods interrupted by visions of horses made out of cherry blossoms. No, seriously.    All of this is in favor of a supremely contrived plot. If Yuu has never been on a horse before, how the heck did he make it into jockey school? The script makes such a big deal about how hard the school is to get into, but is that just because of its standard entrance exam? Why is Waver Velvet one of his classmates? Why did cherry blossoms appear when Shun catches Yuu? Is this actually BL? Not that I'd be complaining if it was…    Fanfare of Adolescence operates on the same kind of logic as male idol shows, where nobody acts quite like a person and things happen just because rather than any kind of internal logic. It's silly, and while it should be a fun ride for the right kind of fan, I doubt it'll be a runaway success.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Sports anime often begin with someone being charmed by a sport they know nothing about and being driven to learn it. Fanfare of Adolescence takes this common framework and makes it about the lead singer of a popular teen boy band who decides to throw away his career and become a jockey. It's a convenient, if somewhat ridiculous, setup that makes him both hated by the serious jockey students and eager to prove himself. It's not great but it works well enough for a first episode—and it helps that the other students feel like people rather than walking tropes.    What really got my eyes rolling, however, was the back half of the episode. That these kids, who are “serious” about becoming jockeys, know nothing about horses is pure insanity and hurts me on a deeply personal level. Everything they do in this episode is wrong at best and life-threatening at worst. The scene of Yuu and Shun galloping double as they try to catch the reins of a panicking racehorse had me livid—and that's before it's revealed that neither had even gotten on a horse before. It's so ludicrously stupid that I can't help but wonder if the writers had ever even talked to a person who had any experience with riding a horse before. Then comes all the layers of metaphysical bullshit—i.e., ghost horses and listening to the sounds of nature—and this couldn't have rubbed me the wrong way more.    And yet, despite all that, I don't regret watching this episode. For all its misconceptions about horseback riding, it is a master class in direction. Nearly every shot in this episode is visually interesting. What could have been a normal scene of Yuu walking down the street is instead enhanced by showing him reflected through convex mirrors. Massive wide shots are used to show when he is lost, and moments of extreme emotion are effectively conveyed through close-ups on his mouth. And that's before we get into the breathtaking beauty of the surreal moments of the episode. At this point, if Makoto Katō directed an anime about buttering toast I'd watch it. Add in a score penned by Hiroyuki Sawano and I am left torn. Is it possible to watch an anime with a story you hate just because you love everything else about it? I don't know, but I have a sneaking suspicion I'm going to find out.        James Beckett  Rating:               I'm going to have to use one of my ADHD Passes on this one, y'all. I'm on my meds, I swear, and I even had a half-cup of strong coffee just before watching Fanfare of Adolescence. I closed any distracting tabs, I avoided Wikipedia and Twitter at all costs, and I even put my phone in the other room. Even with my best-laid precautions, though, I had to restart this premiere three times just to get through the first ten minutes. My brain simply would not entertain the notion of being able to focus on Fanfare of Adolescence for more than a minute or two before it started to wander, keen on occupying my time with literally anything else. Twice, right around the time that the Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up guide our hero Yu past The World's Most Obvious Visual Metaphor, I got up to do chores.    I'm not into horse jockeying, personally, but that doesn't mean that I'm going to automatically dismiss a show for having depicting subject matter that doesn't specifically cater to my interests. I care about ice skating about as much as I care about horse sports, and that didn't stop me from loving the hell out of Yuri!!! on Ice. The problem with Fanfare of Adolescence is not that it is about a niche sport. The show simply makes the same mistake that a lot of really specific sports and hobby shows make: It assumes that, so long as the main gimmick is covered and you've got a cast of vaguely handsome anime boys (and girl) to throw at the screen, the audience won't notice that you've completely forgotten to come up with a decent story.    We're talking about a main character who is throwing away the life of a professional pop idol and abandoning his fame to pursue a career as a horse jockey. How on Earth does a guy like that end up being the least interesting member of a cast that is comprised of other guys whose only defining features are their hair styles? When the hilariously sincere Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up, and I finally made it through to the second half of the episode, I was hoping I might at least get some kicks out of the show's unintentional camp factor, but no, we can't even trust a goofy acid-trip phantom to stick around long enough to keep things interesting.    Instead, once the not-drama of Yu's arrival at Horse School is over with, we're treated to the similarly terrifying Actual Living Horses that the boys (and gal) have to deal with, and I'll give Fanfare of Adolescence this much: Even if the CGI horses look really awkward, I was kind of excited to watch them get all spooked and run around a bunch. I knew it was too much to ask for one of them to legitimately kick one of the characters in the head, although my hopes were briefly raised when ol' Yu somehow got it in his head that he could win a game of chicken against a 600-pund behemoth with stones for feet. Still, if nothing else, the show about horse racing was kind enough to have the riders and horses actually do stuff for a bit, and that kept my brain distracted long enough for me to get through the rest of the premiere relatively unscathed.    I didn't hate Fanfare of Adolescence, but it's tone and style are diametrically opposed to my own sensibilities, and it's going to take a hell of a lot more than C-tier characters and cookie-cutter cliches to win me over. I'm sure it will be just the thing for some folks, though, which means that, with any luck. Psychedelic Ghost Horse may yet ride again.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Let me start with what I really admire about this first episode: at the prestigious jockey academy our hero quits being an idol to attend, the token girl student is allowed to wear pants. That's right, her uniform is exactly like the boys' and no one is treating her ambitions as less than the boys' – in fact, they're much kinder to Eri than they are to Yu, the aforementioned former idol. It would have been so easy to take the typical anime road here and tart up her uniform, and that they didn't inclined me to take this a bit more seriously than I otherwise might have.    Although the phantom horse made out of sakura petals that guides Yu to the correct path to school is a bit much. As are the band-uniform look of the instructors, and Shun's preternatural nature skills that enable him to read the wind, stand motionless in the bow of a boat going full speed, and perfectly ride a horse for the first time ever while chasing another, spooked horse. There's definitely some imbalance in this episode, and that takes away from its more grounded moments, like the very real garbage poor Yu is getting for deciding to do something with his life that no one expected, and the body language of the horses. (Their ears, specifically.) It's hard to tell how closely this is going to stick to the realities of learning to work with and ride horses professionally and how much odd metaphysical stuff is going to get in the way of that.    The premise isn't bad, though, and it's not hard to get behind Yu's desire to do something different with his life. We can simultaneously see how he's very good at putting on a public face and how draining that is for him; one of his strongest moments in this episode is when he tells off the reporters at the end, preferring to be addressed by his real name instead of his stage name. His classmates' mixed reactions to his presence is also decently handled; most of them don't quite know what to do with him, while one is visibly annoyed by his presence, possibly suspecting that this is all some sort of publicity stunt. As with most sports shows, there are a lot of named characters all thrown at us right off the bat, but they're at least nicely color-coded for those of us with no memory for names. I don't love the look of the show, mostly because (ears aside) there's something just a little off about the way the horses are drawn and animated. This feels like a very middle-of-the-road introductory episode, and I suspect that your enthusiasm for horses may determine if you decide to follow it.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This show was going to have an uphill battle with me from the start. Not because of the premise – I'm not big on horse racing, sure, but I like sports stories and animals, so a series about horse jockeys certainly could be cool. No, my problem was with the title: Fanfare of Adolescence sounds like a fake, joke anime you'd see in a real show. It's flowery as hell without actually telling you anything about the story or characters, and you could stick the name on damn near any high school drama anime and it would fit just fine. It's a bad name and they should feel bad about it.    The other issue it ran into early on is that I just don't care about our main character's big conflict in this premiere. Arimura may be a perfectly nice guy with some ridiculous Horse Sense, but when his whole struggle is that he's suddenly quit being a super popular idol to become a horse jockey, and every piece of conflict through this episode is about the media hounding him, it's just hard to relate to any of it. I don't care about how his orientation is awkward because of all the press, or how some of his classmates think he's just doing this for attention. I want to see some gosh dang horses, racing or at rest, and get an idea of how all these characters relate to the creatures they'll presumably be working with for the whole season. Get to that instead of prefacing it with all this showbiz drama.    Thankfully, things do pick up a bit once a random accident sets a couple of horses loose, and our freshman jockeys have to try and wrangle them. It's certainly cliché, and the way it actually happens is rather ridiculous, but it lets us actually see the interesting part of this premise for the final few minutes of the premiere, at least. It's not exactly stunning material – Arimura and his new buddy ride a horse together, rein in a second, and have a hilariously over-the-top shiptease moment to cap it off – but it's a conflict I wouldn't find in any other sports show airing this season. And while the CG on the horses leaves something to be desired, it at least looks alright in motion and manages to sell the speed of the whole thing. It's a serviceable presentation of why you'd want to watch this show instead of any given show about cute anime boys in high school, and I wish the rest of this premiere had been more like it.    In all, the premiere evens out to being just sorta ok. It's not terrible, though it is fairly dull until somebody actually mounts a horse. The biggest flaw is that for all the focus on Arimura's character he doesn't really have much discernible personality, and his co-star is instantly more engaging as some kind of Horse Savant. I may stick around just to see if they can manage to leave the idol plotline behind after this, but for now it's iffy.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review          1 comment       Hello, Melancholic!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Fanfare of Adolescence   Apr  3rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Fanfare of Adolescence ?                     Community score: 3.0              What is this?   There's a competitive, three-year horse racing academy that trains boys to become jockeys. Those who wish to enter must not only pass an academic test but a physical and fitness test as well. Yū Arimura is a former popular idol who becomes enamored with horse racing after seeing it for the first time, and wants to join the academy. Shun Kazanami was raised on an island, and only experienced horse races through radio broadcasts growing up. Amane comes from a high-class family in England, and his father is a former jockey. The show follows these three 15-year-old boys and others at the academy.    Fanfare of Adolescence is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                It's hard to believe we've gotten two such diametrically opposed sports anime in one day! While Love All Play was pure grounded realism, Fanfare of Adolescence leans to the opposite side of the spectrum, all high emotion and contrived drama. It stops just short of superpowers, although one of the characters does have a preternatural connection with horses. Which one is better depends pretty much entirely on your preferences, but I'm going to be real with you – neither is very good, albeit for different reasons.    Going in, I knew that one of the big challenges for Fanfare of Adolescence was going to be its animation. Horses are notoriously difficult to draw and even harder to animate, and modern anime have resorted to all kinds of shortcuts to get around this complication. They almost never look good and at times are even comically bad. But I figured, of course an anime about jockeying would figure something out! Recruit some talented animators who could draw their way around knobbly knees and long faces and bring some majesty to these beautiful creatures.    But then the first horse showed up and it was all awkward, uncanny CG and oh dear, this is not going to be a good-looking series at all, is it?    Not that it would be a good-looking show, even if Yuu's brain didn't explode into a LiSA Frank nightmare every time he thought about equids. There's a ton of bizarre camera angles, including shots of legs, crotch shots as characters cross their legs, and on-the-nose visual metaphors involving two paths going through the woods interrupted by visions of horses made out of cherry blossoms. No, seriously.    All of this is in favor of a supremely contrived plot. If Yuu has never been on a horse before, how the heck did he make it into jockey school? The script makes such a big deal about how hard the school is to get into, but is that just because of its standard entrance exam? Why is Waver Velvet one of his classmates? Why did cherry blossoms appear when Shun catches Yuu? Is this actually BL? Not that I'd be complaining if it was…    Fanfare of Adolescence operates on the same kind of logic as male idol shows, where nobody acts quite like a person and things happen just because rather than any kind of internal logic. It's silly, and while it should be a fun ride for the right kind of fan, I doubt it'll be a runaway success.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Sports anime often begin with someone being charmed by a sport they know nothing about and being driven to learn it. Fanfare of Adolescence takes this common framework and makes it about the lead singer of a popular teen boy band who decides to throw away his career and become a jockey. It's a convenient, if somewhat ridiculous, setup that makes him both hated by the serious jockey students and eager to prove himself. It's not great but it works well enough for a first episode—and it helps that the other students feel like people rather than walking tropes.    What really got my eyes rolling, however, was the back half of the episode. That these kids, who are “serious” about becoming jockeys, know nothing about horses is pure insanity and hurts me on a deeply personal level. Everything they do in this episode is wrong at best and life-threatening at worst. The scene of Yuu and Shun galloping double as they try to catch the reins of a panicking racehorse had me livid—and that's before it's revealed that neither had even gotten on a horse before. It's so ludicrously stupid that I can't help but wonder if the writers had ever even talked to a person who had any experience with riding a horse before. Then comes all the layers of metaphysical bullshit—i.e., ghost horses and listening to the sounds of nature—and this couldn't have rubbed me the wrong way more.    And yet, despite all that, I don't regret watching this episode. For all its misconceptions about horseback riding, it is a master class in direction. Nearly every shot in this episode is visually interesting. What could have been a normal scene of Yuu walking down the street is instead enhanced by showing him reflected through convex mirrors. Massive wide shots are used to show when he is lost, and moments of extreme emotion are effectively conveyed through close-ups on his mouth. And that's before we get into the breathtaking beauty of the surreal moments of the episode. At this point, if Makoto Katō directed an anime about buttering toast I'd watch it. Add in a score penned by Hiroyuki Sawano and I am left torn. Is it possible to watch an anime with a story you hate just because you love everything else about it? I don't know, but I have a sneaking suspicion I'm going to find out.        James Beckett  Rating:               I'm going to have to use one of my ADHD Passes on this one, y'all. I'm on my meds, I swear, and I even had a half-cup of strong coffee just before watching Fanfare of Adolescence. I closed any distracting tabs, I avoided Wikipedia and Twitter at all costs, and I even put my phone in the other room. Even with my best-laid precautions, though, I had to restart this premiere three times just to get through the first ten minutes. My brain simply would not entertain the notion of being able to focus on Fanfare of Adolescence for more than a minute or two before it started to wander, keen on occupying my time with literally anything else. Twice, right around the time that the Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up guide our hero Yu past The World's Most Obvious Visual Metaphor, I got up to do chores.    I'm not into horse jockeying, personally, but that doesn't mean that I'm going to automatically dismiss a show for having depicting subject matter that doesn't specifically cater to my interests. I care about ice skating about as much as I care about horse sports, and that didn't stop me from loving the hell out of Yuri!!! on Ice. The problem with Fanfare of Adolescence is not that it is about a niche sport. The show simply makes the same mistake that a lot of really specific sports and hobby shows make: It assumes that, so long as the main gimmick is covered and you've got a cast of vaguely handsome anime boys (and girl) to throw at the screen, the audience won't notice that you've completely forgotten to come up with a decent story.    We're talking about a main character who is throwing away the life of a professional pop idol and abandoning his fame to pursue a career as a horse jockey. How on Earth does a guy like that end up being the least interesting member of a cast that is comprised of other guys whose only defining features are their hair styles? When the hilariously sincere Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up, and I finally made it through to the second half of the episode, I was hoping I might at least get some kicks out of the show's unintentional camp factor, but no, we can't even trust a goofy acid-trip phantom to stick around long enough to keep things interesting.    Instead, once the not-drama of Yu's arrival at Horse School is over with, we're treated to the similarly terrifying Actual Living Horses that the boys (and gal) have to deal with, and I'll give Fanfare of Adolescence this much: Even if the CGI horses look really awkward, I was kind of excited to watch them get all spooked and run around a bunch. I knew it was too much to ask for one of them to legitimately kick one of the characters in the head, although my hopes were briefly raised when ol' Yu somehow got it in his head that he could win a game of chicken against a 600-pund behemoth with stones for feet. Still, if nothing else, the show about horse racing was kind enough to have the riders and horses actually do stuff for a bit, and that kept my brain distracted long enough for me to get through the rest of the premiere relatively unscathed.    I didn't hate Fanfare of Adolescence, but it's tone and style are diametrically opposed to my own sensibilities, and it's going to take a hell of a lot more than C-tier characters and cookie-cutter cliches to win me over. I'm sure it will be just the thing for some folks, though, which means that, with any luck. Psychedelic Ghost Horse may yet ride again.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Let me start with what I really admire about this first episode: at the prestigious jockey academy our hero quits being an idol to attend, the token girl student is allowed to wear pants. That's right, her uniform is exactly like the boys' and no one is treating her ambitions as less than the boys' – in fact, they're much kinder to Eri than they are to Yu, the aforementioned former idol. It would have been so easy to take the typical anime road here and tart up her uniform, and that they didn't inclined me to take this a bit more seriously than I otherwise might have.    Although the phantom horse made out of sakura petals that guides Yu to the correct path to school is a bit much. As are the band-uniform look of the instructors, and Shun's preternatural nature skills that enable him to read the wind, stand motionless in the bow of a boat going full speed, and perfectly ride a horse for the first time ever while chasing another, spooked horse. There's definitely some imbalance in this episode, and that takes away from its more grounded moments, like the very real garbage poor Yu is getting for deciding to do something with his life that no one expected, and the body language of the horses. (Their ears, specifically.) It's hard to tell how closely this is going to stick to the realities of learning to work with and ride horses professionally and how much odd metaphysical stuff is going to get in the way of that.    The premise isn't bad, though, and it's not hard to get behind Yu's desire to do something different with his life. We can simultaneously see how he's very good at putting on a public face and how draining that is for him; one of his strongest moments in this episode is when he tells off the reporters at the end, preferring to be addressed by his real name instead of his stage name. His classmates' mixed reactions to his presence is also decently handled; most of them don't quite know what to do with him, while one is visibly annoyed by his presence, possibly suspecting that this is all some sort of publicity stunt. As with most sports shows, there are a lot of named characters all thrown at us right off the bat, but they're at least nicely color-coded for those of us with no memory for names. I don't love the look of the show, mostly because (ears aside) there's something just a little off about the way the horses are drawn and animated. This feels like a very middle-of-the-road introductory episode, and I suspect that your enthusiasm for horses may determine if you decide to follow it.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This show was going to have an uphill battle with me from the start. Not because of the premise – I'm not big on horse racing, sure, but I like sports stories and animals, so a series about horse jockeys certainly could be cool. No, my problem was with the title: Fanfare of Adolescence sounds like a fake, joke anime you'd see in a real show. It's flowery as hell without actually telling you anything about the story or characters, and you could stick the name on damn near any high school drama anime and it would fit just fine. It's a bad name and they should feel bad about it.    The other issue it ran into early on is that I just don't care about our main character's big conflict in this premiere. Arimura may be a perfectly nice guy with some ridiculous Horse Sense, but when his whole struggle is that he's suddenly quit being a super popular idol to become a horse jockey, and every piece of conflict through this episode is about the media hounding him, it's just hard to relate to any of it. I don't care about how his orientation is awkward because of all the press, or how some of his classmates think he's just doing this for attention. I want to see some gosh dang horses, racing or at rest, and get an idea of how all these characters relate to the creatures they'll presumably be working with for the whole season. Get to that instead of prefacing it with all this showbiz drama.    Thankfully, things do pick up a bit once a random accident sets a couple of horses loose, and our freshman jockeys have to try and wrangle them. It's certainly cliché, and the way it actually happens is rather ridiculous, but it lets us actually see the interesting part of this premise for the final few minutes of the premiere, at least. It's not exactly stunning material – Arimura and his new buddy ride a horse together, rein in a second, and have a hilariously over-the-top shiptease moment to cap it off – but it's a conflict I wouldn't find in any other sports show airing this season. And while the CG on the horses leaves something to be desired, it at least looks alright in motion and manages to sell the speed of the whole thing. It's a serviceable presentation of why you'd want to watch this show instead of any given show about cute anime boys in high school, and I wish the rest of this premiere had been more like it.    In all, the premiere evens out to being just sorta ok. It's not terrible, though it is fairly dull until somebody actually mounts a horse. The biggest flaw is that for all the focus on Arimura's character he doesn't really have much discernible personality, and his co-star is instantly more engaging as some kind of Horse Savant. I may stick around just to see if they can manage to leave the idol plotline behind after this, but for now it's iffy.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review          1 comment       Hello, Melancholic!

Fanfare of Adolescence takes this common framework and makes it about the lead singer of a popular teen boy band who decides to throw away his career and become a jockey. It's a convenient, if somewhat ridiculous, setup that makes him both hated by the serious jockey students and eager to prove himself. It's not great but it works well enough for a first episode—and it helps that the other students feel like people rather than walking tropes.    What really got my eyes rolling, however, was the back half of the episode. That these kids, who are “serious” about becoming jockeys, know nothing about horses is pure insanity and hurts me on a deeply personal level. Everything they do in this episode is wrong at best and life-threatening at worst. The scene of Yuu and Shun galloping double as they try to catch the reins of a panicking racehorse had me livid—and that's before it's revealed that neither had even gotten on a horse before. It's so ludicrously stupid that I can't help but wonder if the writers had ever even talked to a person who had any experience with riding a horse before. Then comes all the layers of metaphysical bullshit—i.e., ghost horses and listening to the sounds of nature—and this couldn't have rubbed me the wrong way more.    And yet, despite all that, I don't regret watching this episode. For all its misconceptions about horseback riding, it is a master class in direction. Nearly every shot in this episode is visually interesting. What could have been a normal scene of Yuu walking down the street is instead enhanced by showing him reflected through convex mirrors. Massive wide shots are used to show when he is lost, and moments of extreme emotion are effectively conveyed through close-ups on his mouth. And that's before we get into the breathtaking beauty of the surreal moments of the episode. At this point, if Makoto Katō directed an anime about buttering toast I'd watch it. Add in a score penned by Hiroyuki Sawano and I am left torn. Is it possible to watch an anime with a story you hate just because you love everything else about it? I don't know, but I have a sneaking suspicion I'm going to find out.        James Beckett  Rating:               I'm going to have to use one of my ADHD Passes on this one, y'all. I'm on my meds, I swear, and I even had a half-cup of strong coffee just before watching Fanfare of Adolescence. I closed any distracting tabs, I avoided Wikipedia and Twitter at all costs, and I even put my phone in the other room. Even with my best-laid precautions, though, I had to restart this premiere three times just to get through the first ten minutes. My brain simply would not entertain the notion of being able to focus on Fanfare of Adolescence for more than a minute or two before it started to wander, keen on occupying my time with literally anything else. Twice, right around the time that the Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up guide our hero Yu past The World's Most Obvious Visual Metaphor, I got up to do chores.    I'm not into horse jockeying, personally, but that doesn't mean that I'm going to automatically dismiss a show for having depicting subject matter that doesn't specifically cater to my interests. I care about ice skating about as much as I care about horse sports, and that didn't stop me from loving the hell out of Yuri!!! on Ice. The problem with Fanfare of Adolescence is not that it is about a niche sport. The show simply makes the same mistake that a lot of really specific sports and hobby shows make: It assumes that, so long as the main gimmick is covered and you've got a cast of vaguely handsome anime boys (and girl) to throw at the screen, the audience won't notice that you've completely forgotten to come up with a decent story.    We're talking about a main character who is throwing away the life of a professional pop idol and abandoning his fame to pursue a career as a horse jockey. How on Earth does a guy like that end up being the least interesting member of a cast that is comprised of other guys whose only defining features are their hair styles? When the hilariously sincere Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up, and I finally made it through to the second half of the episode, I was hoping I might at least get some kicks out of the show's unintentional camp factor, but no, we can't even trust a goofy acid-trip phantom to stick around long enough to keep things interesting.    Instead, once the not-drama of Yu's arrival at Horse School is over with, we're treated to the similarly terrifying Actual Living Horses that the boys (and gal) have to deal with, and I'll give Fanfare of Adolescence this much: Even if the CGI horses look really awkward, I was kind of excited to watch them get all spooked and run around a bunch. I knew it was too much to ask for one of them to legitimately kick one of the characters in the head, although my hopes were briefly raised when ol' Yu somehow got it in his head that he could win a game of chicken against a 600-pund behemoth with stones for feet. Still, if nothing else, the show about horse racing was kind enough to have the riders and horses actually do stuff for a bit, and that kept my brain distracted long enough for me to get through the rest of the premiere relatively unscathed.    I didn't hate Fanfare of Adolescence, but it's tone and style are diametrically opposed to my own sensibilities, and it's going to take a hell of a lot more than C-tier characters and cookie-cutter cliches to win me over. I'm sure it will be just the thing for some folks, though, which means that, with any luck. Psychedelic Ghost Horse may yet ride again.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Let me start with what I really admire about this first episode: at the prestigious jockey academy our hero quits being an idol to attend, the token girl student is allowed to wear pants. That's right, her uniform is exactly like the boys' and no one is treating her ambitions as less than the boys' – in fact, they're much kinder to Eri than they are to Yu, the aforementioned former idol. It would have been so easy to take the typical anime road here and tart up her uniform, and that they didn't inclined me to take this a bit more seriously than I otherwise might have.    Although the phantom horse made out of sakura petals that guides Yu to the correct path to school is a bit much. As are the band-uniform look of the instructors, and Shun's preternatural nature skills that enable him to read the wind, stand motionless in the bow of a boat going full speed, and perfectly ride a horse for the first time ever while chasing another, spooked horse. There's definitely some imbalance in this episode, and that takes away from its more grounded moments, like the very real garbage poor Yu is getting for deciding to do something with his life that no one expected, and the body language of the horses. (Their ears, specifically.) It's hard to tell how closely this is going to stick to the realities of learning to work with and ride horses professionally and how much odd metaphysical stuff is going to get in the way of that.    The premise isn't bad, though, and it's not hard to get behind Yu's desire to do something different with his life. We can simultaneously see how he's very good at putting on a public face and how draining that is for him; one of his strongest moments in this episode is when he tells off the reporters at the end, preferring to be addressed by his real name instead of his stage name. His classmates' mixed reactions to his presence is also decently handled; most of them don't quite know what to do with him, while one is visibly annoyed by his presence, possibly suspecting that this is all some sort of publicity stunt. As with most sports shows, there are a lot of named characters all thrown at us right off the bat, but they're at least nicely color-coded for those of us with no memory for names. I don't love the look of the show, mostly because (ears aside) there's something just a little off about the way the horses are drawn and animated. This feels like a very middle-of-the-road introductory episode, and I suspect that your enthusiasm for horses may determine if you decide to follow it.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This show was going to have an uphill battle with me from the start. Not because of the premise – I'm not big on horse racing, sure, but I like sports stories and animals, so a series about horse jockeys certainly could be cool. No, my problem was with the title: Fanfare of Adolescence sounds like a fake, joke anime you'd see in a real show. It's flowery as hell without actually telling you anything about the story or characters, and you could stick the name on damn near any high school drama anime and it would fit just fine. It's a bad name and they should feel bad about it.    The other issue it ran into early on is that I just don't care about our main character's big conflict in this premiere. Arimura may be a perfectly nice guy with some ridiculous Horse Sense, but when his whole struggle is that he's suddenly quit being a super popular idol to become a horse jockey, and every piece of conflict through this episode is about the media hounding him, it's just hard to relate to any of it. I don't care about how his orientation is awkward because of all the press, or how some of his classmates think he's just doing this for attention. I want to see some gosh dang horses, racing or at rest, and get an idea of how all these characters relate to the creatures they'll presumably be working with for the whole season. Get to that instead of prefacing it with all this showbiz drama.    Thankfully, things do pick up a bit once a random accident sets a couple of horses loose, and our freshman jockeys have to try and wrangle them. It's certainly cliché, and the way it actually happens is rather ridiculous, but it lets us actually see the interesting part of this premise for the final few minutes of the premiere, at least. It's not exactly stunning material – Arimura and his new buddy ride a horse together, rein in a second, and have a hilariously over-the-top shiptease moment to cap it off – but it's a conflict I wouldn't find in any other sports show airing this season. And while the CG on the horses leaves something to be desired, it at least looks alright in motion and manages to sell the speed of the whole thing. It's a serviceable presentation of why you'd want to watch this show instead of any given show about cute anime boys in high school, and I wish the rest of this premiere had been more like it.    In all, the premiere evens out to being just sorta ok. It's not terrible, though it is fairly dull until somebody actually mounts a horse. The biggest flaw is that for all the focus on Arimura's character he doesn't really have much discernible personality, and his co-star is instantly more engaging as some kind of Horse Savant. I may stick around just to see if they can manage to leave the idol plotline behind after this, but for now it's iffy.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Fanfare of Adolescence   Apr  3rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Fanfare of Adolescence ?                     Community score: 3.0              What is this?   There's a competitive, three-year horse racing academy that trains boys to become jockeys. Those who wish to enter must not only pass an academic test but a physical and fitness test as well. Yū Arimura is a former popular idol who becomes enamored with horse racing after seeing it for the first time, and wants to join the academy. Shun Kazanami was raised on an island, and only experienced horse races through radio broadcasts growing up. Amane comes from a high-class family in England, and his father is a former jockey. The show follows these three 15-year-old boys and others at the academy.    Fanfare of Adolescence is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                It's hard to believe we've gotten two such diametrically opposed sports anime in one day! While Love All Play was pure grounded realism, Fanfare of Adolescence leans to the opposite side of the spectrum, all high emotion and contrived drama. It stops just short of superpowers, although one of the characters does have a preternatural connection with horses. Which one is better depends pretty much entirely on your preferences, but I'm going to be real with you – neither is very good, albeit for different reasons.    Going in, I knew that one of the big challenges for Fanfare of Adolescence was going to be its animation. Horses are notoriously difficult to draw and even harder to animate, and modern anime have resorted to all kinds of shortcuts to get around this complication. They almost never look good and at times are even comically bad. But I figured, of course an anime about jockeying would figure something out! Recruit some talented animators who could draw their way around knobbly knees and long faces and bring some majesty to these beautiful creatures.    But then the first horse showed up and it was all awkward, uncanny CG and oh dear, this is not going to be a good-looking series at all, is it?    Not that it would be a good-looking show, even if Yuu's brain didn't explode into a LiSA Frank nightmare every time he thought about equids. There's a ton of bizarre camera angles, including shots of legs, crotch shots as characters cross their legs, and on-the-nose visual metaphors involving two paths going through the woods interrupted by visions of horses made out of cherry blossoms. No, seriously.    All of this is in favor of a supremely contrived plot. If Yuu has never been on a horse before, how the heck did he make it into jockey school? The script makes such a big deal about how hard the school is to get into, but is that just because of its standard entrance exam? Why is Waver Velvet one of his classmates? Why did cherry blossoms appear when Shun catches Yuu? Is this actually BL? Not that I'd be complaining if it was…    Fanfare of Adolescence operates on the same kind of logic as male idol shows, where nobody acts quite like a person and things happen just because rather than any kind of internal logic. It's silly, and while it should be a fun ride for the right kind of fan, I doubt it'll be a runaway success.

And yet, despite all that, I don't regret watching this episode. For all its misconceptions about horseback riding, it is a master class in direction. Nearly every shot in this episode is visually interesting. What could have been a normal scene of Yuu walking down the street is instead enhanced by showing him reflected through convex mirrors. Massive wide shots are used to show when he is lost, and moments of extreme emotion are effectively conveyed through close-ups on his mouth. And that's before we get into the breathtaking beauty of the surreal moments of the episode. At this point, if Makoto Katō directed an anime about buttering toast I'd watch it. Add in a score penned by Hiroyuki Sawano and I am left torn. Is it possible to watch an anime with a story you hate just because you love everything else about it? I don't know, but I have a sneaking suspicion I'm going to find out.        James Beckett  Rating:               I'm going to have to use one of my ADHD Passes on this one, y'all. I'm on my meds, I swear, and I even had a half-cup of strong coffee just before watching Fanfare of Adolescence. I closed any distracting tabs, I avoided Wikipedia and Twitter at all costs, and I even put my phone in the other room. Even with my best-laid precautions, though, I had to restart this premiere three times just to get through the first ten minutes. My brain simply would not entertain the notion of being able to focus on Fanfare of Adolescence for more than a minute or two before it started to wander, keen on occupying my time with literally anything else. Twice, right around the time that the Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up guide our hero Yu past The World's Most Obvious Visual Metaphor, I got up to do chores.    I'm not into horse jockeying, personally, but that doesn't mean that I'm going to automatically dismiss a show for having depicting subject matter that doesn't specifically cater to my interests. I care about ice skating about as much as I care about horse sports, and that didn't stop me from loving the hell out of Yuri!!! on Ice. The problem with Fanfare of Adolescence is not that it is about a niche sport. The show simply makes the same mistake that a lot of really specific sports and hobby shows make: It assumes that, so long as the main gimmick is covered and you've got a cast of vaguely handsome anime boys (and girl) to throw at the screen, the audience won't notice that you've completely forgotten to come up with a decent story.    We're talking about a main character who is throwing away the life of a professional pop idol and abandoning his fame to pursue a career as a horse jockey. How on Earth does a guy like that end up being the least interesting member of a cast that is comprised of other guys whose only defining features are their hair styles? When the hilariously sincere Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up, and I finally made it through to the second half of the episode, I was hoping I might at least get some kicks out of the show's unintentional camp factor, but no, we can't even trust a goofy acid-trip phantom to stick around long enough to keep things interesting.    Instead, once the not-drama of Yu's arrival at Horse School is over with, we're treated to the similarly terrifying Actual Living Horses that the boys (and gal) have to deal with, and I'll give Fanfare of Adolescence this much: Even if the CGI horses look really awkward, I was kind of excited to watch them get all spooked and run around a bunch. I knew it was too much to ask for one of them to legitimately kick one of the characters in the head, although my hopes were briefly raised when ol' Yu somehow got it in his head that he could win a game of chicken against a 600-pund behemoth with stones for feet. Still, if nothing else, the show about horse racing was kind enough to have the riders and horses actually do stuff for a bit, and that kept my brain distracted long enough for me to get through the rest of the premiere relatively unscathed.    I didn't hate Fanfare of Adolescence, but it's tone and style are diametrically opposed to my own sensibilities, and it's going to take a hell of a lot more than C-tier characters and cookie-cutter cliches to win me over. I'm sure it will be just the thing for some folks, though, which means that, with any luck. Psychedelic Ghost Horse may yet ride again.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Let me start with what I really admire about this first episode: at the prestigious jockey academy our hero quits being an idol to attend, the token girl student is allowed to wear pants. That's right, her uniform is exactly like the boys' and no one is treating her ambitions as less than the boys' – in fact, they're much kinder to Eri than they are to Yu, the aforementioned former idol. It would have been so easy to take the typical anime road here and tart up her uniform, and that they didn't inclined me to take this a bit more seriously than I otherwise might have.    Although the phantom horse made out of sakura petals that guides Yu to the correct path to school is a bit much. As are the band-uniform look of the instructors, and Shun's preternatural nature skills that enable him to read the wind, stand motionless in the bow of a boat going full speed, and perfectly ride a horse for the first time ever while chasing another, spooked horse. There's definitely some imbalance in this episode, and that takes away from its more grounded moments, like the very real garbage poor Yu is getting for deciding to do something with his life that no one expected, and the body language of the horses. (Their ears, specifically.) It's hard to tell how closely this is going to stick to the realities of learning to work with and ride horses professionally and how much odd metaphysical stuff is going to get in the way of that.    The premise isn't bad, though, and it's not hard to get behind Yu's desire to do something different with his life. We can simultaneously see how he's very good at putting on a public face and how draining that is for him; one of his strongest moments in this episode is when he tells off the reporters at the end, preferring to be addressed by his real name instead of his stage name. His classmates' mixed reactions to his presence is also decently handled; most of them don't quite know what to do with him, while one is visibly annoyed by his presence, possibly suspecting that this is all some sort of publicity stunt. As with most sports shows, there are a lot of named characters all thrown at us right off the bat, but they're at least nicely color-coded for those of us with no memory for names. I don't love the look of the show, mostly because (ears aside) there's something just a little off about the way the horses are drawn and animated. This feels like a very middle-of-the-road introductory episode, and I suspect that your enthusiasm for horses may determine if you decide to follow it.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This show was going to have an uphill battle with me from the start. Not because of the premise – I'm not big on horse racing, sure, but I like sports stories and animals, so a series about horse jockeys certainly could be cool. No, my problem was with the title: Fanfare of Adolescence sounds like a fake, joke anime you'd see in a real show. It's flowery as hell without actually telling you anything about the story or characters, and you could stick the name on damn near any high school drama anime and it would fit just fine. It's a bad name and they should feel bad about it.    The other issue it ran into early on is that I just don't care about our main character's big conflict in this premiere. Arimura may be a perfectly nice guy with some ridiculous Horse Sense, but when his whole struggle is that he's suddenly quit being a super popular idol to become a horse jockey, and every piece of conflict through this episode is about the media hounding him, it's just hard to relate to any of it. I don't care about how his orientation is awkward because of all the press, or how some of his classmates think he's just doing this for attention. I want to see some gosh dang horses, racing or at rest, and get an idea of how all these characters relate to the creatures they'll presumably be working with for the whole season. Get to that instead of prefacing it with all this showbiz drama.    Thankfully, things do pick up a bit once a random accident sets a couple of horses loose, and our freshman jockeys have to try and wrangle them. It's certainly cliché, and the way it actually happens is rather ridiculous, but it lets us actually see the interesting part of this premise for the final few minutes of the premiere, at least. It's not exactly stunning material – Arimura and his new buddy ride a horse together, rein in a second, and have a hilariously over-the-top shiptease moment to cap it off – but it's a conflict I wouldn't find in any other sports show airing this season. And while the CG on the horses leaves something to be desired, it at least looks alright in motion and manages to sell the speed of the whole thing. It's a serviceable presentation of why you'd want to watch this show instead of any given show about cute anime boys in high school, and I wish the rest of this premiere had been more like it.    In all, the premiere evens out to being just sorta ok. It's not terrible, though it is fairly dull until somebody actually mounts a horse. The biggest flaw is that for all the focus on Arimura's character he doesn't really have much discernible personality, and his co-star is instantly more engaging as some kind of Horse Savant. I may stick around just to see if they can manage to leave the idol plotline behind after this, but for now it's iffy.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 3.0              What is this?   There's a competitive, three-year horse racing academy that trains boys to become jockeys. Those who wish to enter must not only pass an academic test but a physical and fitness test as well. Yū Arimura is a former popular idol who becomes enamored with horse racing after seeing it for the first time, and wants to join the academy. Shun Kazanami was raised on an island, and only experienced horse races through radio broadcasts growing up. Amane comes from a high-class family in England, and his father is a former jockey. The show follows these three 15-year-old boys and others at the academy.    Fanfare of Adolescence is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                It's hard to believe we've gotten two such diametrically opposed sports anime in one day! While Love All Play was pure grounded realism, Fanfare of Adolescence leans to the opposite side of the spectrum, all high emotion and contrived drama. It stops just short of superpowers, although one of the characters does have a preternatural connection with horses. Which one is better depends pretty much entirely on your preferences, but I'm going to be real with you – neither is very good, albeit for different reasons.    Going in, I knew that one of the big challenges for Fanfare of Adolescence was going to be its animation. Horses are notoriously difficult to draw and even harder to animate, and modern anime have resorted to all kinds of shortcuts to get around this complication. They almost never look good and at times are even comically bad. But I figured, of course an anime about jockeying would figure something out! Recruit some talented animators who could draw their way around knobbly knees and long faces and bring some majesty to these beautiful creatures.    But then the first horse showed up and it was all awkward, uncanny CG and oh dear, this is not going to be a good-looking series at all, is it?    Not that it would be a good-looking show, even if Yuu's brain didn't explode into a LiSA Frank nightmare every time he thought about equids. There's a ton of bizarre camera angles, including shots of legs, crotch shots as characters cross their legs, and on-the-nose visual metaphors involving two paths going through the woods interrupted by visions of horses made out of cherry blossoms. No, seriously.    All of this is in favor of a supremely contrived plot. If Yuu has never been on a horse before, how the heck did he make it into jockey school? The script makes such a big deal about how hard the school is to get into, but is that just because of its standard entrance exam? Why is Waver Velvet one of his classmates? Why did cherry blossoms appear when Shun catches Yuu? Is this actually BL? Not that I'd be complaining if it was…    Fanfare of Adolescence operates on the same kind of logic as male idol shows, where nobody acts quite like a person and things happen just because rather than any kind of internal logic. It's silly, and while it should be a fun ride for the right kind of fan, I doubt it'll be a runaway success.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Sports anime often begin with someone being charmed by a sport they know nothing about and being driven to learn it. Fanfare of Adolescence takes this common framework and makes it about the lead singer of a popular teen boy band who decides to throw away his career and become a jockey. It's a convenient, if somewhat ridiculous, setup that makes him both hated by the serious jockey students and eager to prove himself. It's not great but it works well enough for a first episode—and it helps that the other students feel like people rather than walking tropes.    What really got my eyes rolling, however, was the back half of the episode. That these kids, who are “serious” about becoming jockeys, know nothing about horses is pure insanity and hurts me on a deeply personal level. Everything they do in this episode is wrong at best and life-threatening at worst. The scene of Yuu and Shun galloping double as they try to catch the reins of a panicking racehorse had me livid—and that's before it's revealed that neither had even gotten on a horse before. It's so ludicrously stupid that I can't help but wonder if the writers had ever even talked to a person who had any experience with riding a horse before. Then comes all the layers of metaphysical bullshit—i.e., ghost horses and listening to the sounds of nature—and this couldn't have rubbed me the wrong way more.

The problem with Fanfare of Adolescence is not that it is about a niche sport. The show simply makes the same mistake that a lot of really specific sports and hobby shows make: It assumes that, so long as the main gimmick is covered and you've got a cast of vaguely handsome anime boys (and girl) to throw at the screen, the audience won't notice that you've completely forgotten to come up with a decent story.    We're talking about a main character who is throwing away the life of a professional pop idol and abandoning his fame to pursue a career as a horse jockey. How on Earth does a guy like that end up being the least interesting member of a cast that is comprised of other guys whose only defining features are their hair styles? When the hilariously sincere Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up, and I finally made it through to the second half of the episode, I was hoping I might at least get some kicks out of the show's unintentional camp factor, but no, we can't even trust a goofy acid-trip phantom to stick around long enough to keep things interesting.    Instead, once the not-drama of Yu's arrival at Horse School is over with, we're treated to the similarly terrifying Actual Living Horses that the boys (and gal) have to deal with, and I'll give Fanfare of Adolescence this much: Even if the CGI horses look really awkward, I was kind of excited to watch them get all spooked and run around a bunch. I knew it was too much to ask for one of them to legitimately kick one of the characters in the head, although my hopes were briefly raised when ol' Yu somehow got it in his head that he could win a game of chicken against a 600-pund behemoth with stones for feet. Still, if nothing else, the show about horse racing was kind enough to have the riders and horses actually do stuff for a bit, and that kept my brain distracted long enough for me to get through the rest of the premiere relatively unscathed.    I didn't hate Fanfare of Adolescence, but it's tone and style are diametrically opposed to my own sensibilities, and it's going to take a hell of a lot more than C-tier characters and cookie-cutter cliches to win me over. I'm sure it will be just the thing for some folks, though, which means that, with any luck. Psychedelic Ghost Horse may yet ride again.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Let me start with what I really admire about this first episode: at the prestigious jockey academy our hero quits being an idol to attend, the token girl student is allowed to wear pants. That's right, her uniform is exactly like the boys' and no one is treating her ambitions as less than the boys' – in fact, they're much kinder to Eri than they are to Yu, the aforementioned former idol. It would have been so easy to take the typical anime road here and tart up her uniform, and that they didn't inclined me to take this a bit more seriously than I otherwise might have.    Although the phantom horse made out of sakura petals that guides Yu to the correct path to school is a bit much. As are the band-uniform look of the instructors, and Shun's preternatural nature skills that enable him to read the wind, stand motionless in the bow of a boat going full speed, and perfectly ride a horse for the first time ever while chasing another, spooked horse. There's definitely some imbalance in this episode, and that takes away from its more grounded moments, like the very real garbage poor Yu is getting for deciding to do something with his life that no one expected, and the body language of the horses. (Their ears, specifically.) It's hard to tell how closely this is going to stick to the realities of learning to work with and ride horses professionally and how much odd metaphysical stuff is going to get in the way of that.    The premise isn't bad, though, and it's not hard to get behind Yu's desire to do something different with his life. We can simultaneously see how he's very good at putting on a public face and how draining that is for him; one of his strongest moments in this episode is when he tells off the reporters at the end, preferring to be addressed by his real name instead of his stage name. His classmates' mixed reactions to his presence is also decently handled; most of them don't quite know what to do with him, while one is visibly annoyed by his presence, possibly suspecting that this is all some sort of publicity stunt. As with most sports shows, there are a lot of named characters all thrown at us right off the bat, but they're at least nicely color-coded for those of us with no memory for names. I don't love the look of the show, mostly because (ears aside) there's something just a little off about the way the horses are drawn and animated. This feels like a very middle-of-the-road introductory episode, and I suspect that your enthusiasm for horses may determine if you decide to follow it.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This show was going to have an uphill battle with me from the start. Not because of the premise – I'm not big on horse racing, sure, but I like sports stories and animals, so a series about horse jockeys certainly could be cool. No, my problem was with the title: Fanfare of Adolescence sounds like a fake, joke anime you'd see in a real show. It's flowery as hell without actually telling you anything about the story or characters, and you could stick the name on damn near any high school drama anime and it would fit just fine. It's a bad name and they should feel bad about it.    The other issue it ran into early on is that I just don't care about our main character's big conflict in this premiere. Arimura may be a perfectly nice guy with some ridiculous Horse Sense, but when his whole struggle is that he's suddenly quit being a super popular idol to become a horse jockey, and every piece of conflict through this episode is about the media hounding him, it's just hard to relate to any of it. I don't care about how his orientation is awkward because of all the press, or how some of his classmates think he's just doing this for attention. I want to see some gosh dang horses, racing or at rest, and get an idea of how all these characters relate to the creatures they'll presumably be working with for the whole season. Get to that instead of prefacing it with all this showbiz drama.    Thankfully, things do pick up a bit once a random accident sets a couple of horses loose, and our freshman jockeys have to try and wrangle them. It's certainly cliché, and the way it actually happens is rather ridiculous, but it lets us actually see the interesting part of this premise for the final few minutes of the premiere, at least. It's not exactly stunning material – Arimura and his new buddy ride a horse together, rein in a second, and have a hilariously over-the-top shiptease moment to cap it off – but it's a conflict I wouldn't find in any other sports show airing this season. And while the CG on the horses leaves something to be desired, it at least looks alright in motion and manages to sell the speed of the whole thing. It's a serviceable presentation of why you'd want to watch this show instead of any given show about cute anime boys in high school, and I wish the rest of this premiere had been more like it.    In all, the premiere evens out to being just sorta ok. It's not terrible, though it is fairly dull until somebody actually mounts a horse. The biggest flaw is that for all the focus on Arimura's character he doesn't really have much discernible personality, and his co-star is instantly more engaging as some kind of Horse Savant. I may stick around just to see if they can manage to leave the idol plotline behind after this, but for now it's iffy.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives    ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 3.0              What is this?   There's a competitive, three-year horse racing academy that trains boys to become jockeys. Those who wish to enter must not only pass an academic test but a physical and fitness test as well. Yū Arimura is a former popular idol who becomes enamored with horse racing after seeing it for the first time, and wants to join the academy. Shun Kazanami was raised on an island, and only experienced horse races through radio broadcasts growing up. Amane comes from a high-class family in England, and his father is a former jockey. The show follows these three 15-year-old boys and others at the academy.    Fanfare of Adolescence is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                It's hard to believe we've gotten two such diametrically opposed sports anime in one day! While Love All Play was pure grounded realism, Fanfare of Adolescence leans to the opposite side of the spectrum, all high emotion and contrived drama. It stops just short of superpowers, although one of the characters does have a preternatural connection with horses. Which one is better depends pretty much entirely on your preferences, but I'm going to be real with you – neither is very good, albeit for different reasons.    Going in, I knew that one of the big challenges for Fanfare of Adolescence was going to be its animation. Horses are notoriously difficult to draw and even harder to animate, and modern anime have resorted to all kinds of shortcuts to get around this complication. They almost never look good and at times are even comically bad. But I figured, of course an anime about jockeying would figure something out! Recruit some talented animators who could draw their way around knobbly knees and long faces and bring some majesty to these beautiful creatures.    But then the first horse showed up and it was all awkward, uncanny CG and oh dear, this is not going to be a good-looking series at all, is it?    Not that it would be a good-looking show, even if Yuu's brain didn't explode into a LiSA Frank nightmare every time he thought about equids. There's a ton of bizarre camera angles, including shots of legs, crotch shots as characters cross their legs, and on-the-nose visual metaphors involving two paths going through the woods interrupted by visions of horses made out of cherry blossoms. No, seriously.    All of this is in favor of a supremely contrived plot. If Yuu has never been on a horse before, how the heck did he make it into jockey school? The script makes such a big deal about how hard the school is to get into, but is that just because of its standard entrance exam? Why is Waver Velvet one of his classmates? Why did cherry blossoms appear when Shun catches Yuu? Is this actually BL? Not that I'd be complaining if it was…    Fanfare of Adolescence operates on the same kind of logic as male idol shows, where nobody acts quite like a person and things happen just because rather than any kind of internal logic. It's silly, and while it should be a fun ride for the right kind of fan, I doubt it'll be a runaway success.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Sports anime often begin with someone being charmed by a sport they know nothing about and being driven to learn it. Fanfare of Adolescence takes this common framework and makes it about the lead singer of a popular teen boy band who decides to throw away his career and become a jockey. It's a convenient, if somewhat ridiculous, setup that makes him both hated by the serious jockey students and eager to prove himself. It's not great but it works well enough for a first episode—and it helps that the other students feel like people rather than walking tropes.    What really got my eyes rolling, however, was the back half of the episode. That these kids, who are “serious” about becoming jockeys, know nothing about horses is pure insanity and hurts me on a deeply personal level. Everything they do in this episode is wrong at best and life-threatening at worst. The scene of Yuu and Shun galloping double as they try to catch the reins of a panicking racehorse had me livid—and that's before it's revealed that neither had even gotten on a horse before. It's so ludicrously stupid that I can't help but wonder if the writers had ever even talked to a person who had any experience with riding a horse before. Then comes all the layers of metaphysical bullshit—i.e., ghost horses and listening to the sounds of nature—and this couldn't have rubbed me the wrong way more.    And yet, despite all that, I don't regret watching this episode. For all its misconceptions about horseback riding, it is a master class in direction. Nearly every shot in this episode is visually interesting. What could have been a normal scene of Yuu walking down the street is instead enhanced by showing him reflected through convex mirrors. Massive wide shots are used to show when he is lost, and moments of extreme emotion are effectively conveyed through close-ups on his mouth. And that's before we get into the breathtaking beauty of the surreal moments of the episode. At this point, if Makoto Katō directed an anime about buttering toast I'd watch it. Add in a score penned by Hiroyuki Sawano and I am left torn. Is it possible to watch an anime with a story you hate just because you love everything else about it? I don't know, but I have a sneaking suspicion I'm going to find out.        James Beckett  Rating:               I'm going to have to use one of my ADHD Passes on this one, y'all. I'm on my meds, I swear, and I even had a half-cup of strong coffee just before watching Fanfare of Adolescence. I closed any distracting tabs, I avoided Wikipedia and Twitter at all costs, and I even put my phone in the other room. Even with my best-laid precautions, though, I had to restart this premiere three times just to get through the first ten minutes. My brain simply would not entertain the notion of being able to focus on Fanfare of Adolescence for more than a minute or two before it started to wander, keen on occupying my time with literally anything else. Twice, right around the time that the Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up guide our hero Yu past The World's Most Obvious Visual Metaphor, I got up to do chores.

Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Let me start with what I really admire about this first episode: at the prestigious jockey academy our hero quits being an idol to attend, the token girl student is allowed to wear pants. That's right, her uniform is exactly like the boys' and no one is treating her ambitions as less than the boys' – in fact, they're much kinder to Eri than they are to Yu, the aforementioned former idol. It would have been so easy to take the typical anime road here and tart up her uniform, and that they didn't inclined me to take this a bit more seriously than I otherwise might have.    Although the phantom horse made out of sakura petals that guides Yu to the correct path to school is a bit much. As are the band-uniform look of the instructors, and Shun's preternatural nature skills that enable him to read the wind, stand motionless in the bow of a boat going full speed, and perfectly ride a horse for the first time ever while chasing another, spooked horse. There's definitely some imbalance in this episode, and that takes away from its more grounded moments, like the very real garbage poor Yu is getting for deciding to do something with his life that no one expected, and the body language of the horses. (Their ears, specifically.) It's hard to tell how closely this is going to stick to the realities of learning to work with and ride horses professionally and how much odd metaphysical stuff is going to get in the way of that.    The premise isn't bad, though, and it's not hard to get behind Yu's desire to do something different with his life. We can simultaneously see how he's very good at putting on a public face and how draining that is for him; one of his strongest moments in this episode is when he tells off the reporters at the end, preferring to be addressed by his real name instead of his stage name. His classmates' mixed reactions to his presence is also decently handled; most of them don't quite know what to do with him, while one is visibly annoyed by his presence, possibly suspecting that this is all some sort of publicity stunt. As with most sports shows, there are a lot of named characters all thrown at us right off the bat, but they're at least nicely color-coded for those of us with no memory for names. I don't love the look of the show, mostly because (ears aside) there's something just a little off about the way the horses are drawn and animated. This feels like a very middle-of-the-road introductory episode, and I suspect that your enthusiasm for horses may determine if you decide to follow it.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This show was going to have an uphill battle with me from the start. Not because of the premise – I'm not big on horse racing, sure, but I like sports stories and animals, so a series about horse jockeys certainly could be cool. No, my problem was with the title: Fanfare of Adolescence sounds like a fake, joke anime you'd see in a real show. It's flowery as hell without actually telling you anything about the story or characters, and you could stick the name on damn near any high school drama anime and it would fit just fine. It's a bad name and they should feel bad about it.    The other issue it ran into early on is that I just don't care about our main character's big conflict in this premiere. Arimura may be a perfectly nice guy with some ridiculous Horse Sense, but when his whole struggle is that he's suddenly quit being a super popular idol to become a horse jockey, and every piece of conflict through this episode is about the media hounding him, it's just hard to relate to any of it. I don't care about how his orientation is awkward because of all the press, or how some of his classmates think he's just doing this for attention. I want to see some gosh dang horses, racing or at rest, and get an idea of how all these characters relate to the creatures they'll presumably be working with for the whole season. Get to that instead of prefacing it with all this showbiz drama.    Thankfully, things do pick up a bit once a random accident sets a couple of horses loose, and our freshman jockeys have to try and wrangle them. It's certainly cliché, and the way it actually happens is rather ridiculous, but it lets us actually see the interesting part of this premise for the final few minutes of the premiere, at least. It's not exactly stunning material – Arimura and his new buddy ride a horse together, rein in a second, and have a hilariously over-the-top shiptease moment to cap it off – but it's a conflict I wouldn't find in any other sports show airing this season. And while the CG on the horses leaves something to be desired, it at least looks alright in motion and manages to sell the speed of the whole thing. It's a serviceable presentation of why you'd want to watch this show instead of any given show about cute anime boys in high school, and I wish the rest of this premiere had been more like it.    In all, the premiere evens out to being just sorta ok. It's not terrible, though it is fairly dull until somebody actually mounts a horse. The biggest flaw is that for all the focus on Arimura's character he doesn't really have much discernible personality, and his co-star is instantly more engaging as some kind of Horse Savant. I may stick around just to see if they can manage to leave the idol plotline behind after this, but for now it's iffy.

19-04-2022,anime,12,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/preview-guide/2022/spring/fanfare-of-adolescence/.183511,Fanfare of Adolescence - The Spring 2022 Preview Guide - Anime News Network:SEA,"            How would you rate episode 1 of Fanfare of Adolescence ?                     Community score: 3.0              What is this?   There's a competitive, three-year horse racing academy that trains boys to become jockeys. Those who wish to enter must not only pass an academic test but a physical and fitness test as well. Yū Arimura is a former popular idol who becomes enamored with horse racing after seeing it for the first time, and wants to join the academy. Shun Kazanami was raised on an island, and only experienced horse races through radio broadcasts growing up. Amane comes from a high-class family in England, and his father is a former jockey. The show follows these three 15-year-old boys and others at the academy.    Fanfare of Adolescence is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                It's hard to believe we've gotten two such diametrically opposed sports anime in one day! While Love All Play was pure grounded realism, Fanfare of Adolescence leans to the opposite side of the spectrum, all high emotion and contrived drama. It stops just short of superpowers, although one of the characters does have a preternatural connection with horses. Which one is better depends pretty much entirely on your preferences, but I'm going to be real with you – neither is very good, albeit for different reasons.    Going in, I knew that one of the big challenges for Fanfare of Adolescence was going to be its animation. Horses are notoriously difficult to draw and even harder to animate, and modern anime have resorted to all kinds of shortcuts to get around this complication. They almost never look good and at times are even comically bad. But I figured, of course an anime about jockeying would figure something out! Recruit some talented animators who could draw their way around knobbly knees and long faces and bring some majesty to these beautiful creatures.    But then the first horse showed up and it was all awkward, uncanny CG and oh dear, this is not going to be a good-looking series at all, is it?    Not that it would be a good-looking show, even if Yuu's brain didn't explode into a LiSA Frank nightmare every time he thought about equids. There's a ton of bizarre camera angles, including shots of legs, crotch shots as characters cross their legs, and on-the-nose visual metaphors involving two paths going through the woods interrupted by visions of horses made out of cherry blossoms. No, seriously.    All of this is in favor of a supremely contrived plot. If Yuu has never been on a horse before, how the heck did he make it into jockey school? The script makes such a big deal about how hard the school is to get into, but is that just because of its standard entrance exam? Why is Waver Velvet one of his classmates? Why did cherry blossoms appear when Shun catches Yuu? Is this actually BL? Not that I'd be complaining if it was…    Fanfare of Adolescence operates on the same kind of logic as male idol shows, where nobody acts quite like a person and things happen just because rather than any kind of internal logic. It's silly, and while it should be a fun ride for the right kind of fan, I doubt it'll be a runaway success.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Sports anime often begin with someone being charmed by a sport they know nothing about and being driven to learn it. Fanfare of Adolescence takes this common framework and makes it about the lead singer of a popular teen boy band who decides to throw away his career and become a jockey. It's a convenient, if somewhat ridiculous, setup that makes him both hated by the serious jockey students and eager to prove himself. It's not great but it works well enough for a first episode—and it helps that the other students feel like people rather than walking tropes.    What really got my eyes rolling, however, was the back half of the episode. That these kids, who are “serious” about becoming jockeys, know nothing about horses is pure insanity and hurts me on a deeply personal level. Everything they do in this episode is wrong at best and life-threatening at worst. The scene of Yuu and Shun galloping double as they try to catch the reins of a panicking racehorse had me livid—and that's before it's revealed that neither had even gotten on a horse before. It's so ludicrously stupid that I can't help but wonder if the writers had ever even talked to a person who had any experience with riding a horse before. Then comes all the layers of metaphysical bullshit—i.e., ghost horses and listening to the sounds of nature—and this couldn't have rubbed me the wrong way more.    And yet, despite all that, I don't regret watching this episode. For all its misconceptions about horseback riding, it is a master class in direction. Nearly every shot in this episode is visually interesting. What could have been a normal scene of Yuu walking down the street is instead enhanced by showing him reflected through convex mirrors. Massive wide shots are used to show when he is lost, and moments of extreme emotion are effectively conveyed through close-ups on his mouth. And that's before we get into the breathtaking beauty of the surreal moments of the episode. At this point, if Makoto Katō directed an anime about buttering toast I'd watch it. Add in a score penned by Hiroyuki Sawano and I am left torn. Is it possible to watch an anime with a story you hate just because you love everything else about it? I don't know, but I have a sneaking suspicion I'm going to find out.        James Beckett  Rating:               I'm going to have to use one of my ADHD Passes on this one, y'all. I'm on my meds, I swear, and I even had a half-cup of strong coffee just before watching Fanfare of Adolescence. I closed any distracting tabs, I avoided Wikipedia and Twitter at all costs, and I even put my phone in the other room. Even with my best-laid precautions, though, I had to restart this premiere three times just to get through the first ten minutes. My brain simply would not entertain the notion of being able to focus on Fanfare of Adolescence for more than a minute or two before it started to wander, keen on occupying my time with literally anything else. Twice, right around the time that the Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up guide our hero Yu past The World's Most Obvious Visual Metaphor, I got up to do chores.    I'm not into horse jockeying, personally, but that doesn't mean that I'm going to automatically dismiss a show for having depicting subject matter that doesn't specifically cater to my interests. I care about ice skating about as much as I care about horse sports, and that didn't stop me from loving the hell out of Yuri!!! on Ice. The problem with Fanfare of Adolescence is not that it is about a niche sport. The show simply makes the same mistake that a lot of really specific sports and hobby shows make: It assumes that, so long as the main gimmick is covered and you've got a cast of vaguely handsome anime boys (and girl) to throw at the screen, the audience won't notice that you've completely forgotten to come up with a decent story.    We're talking about a main character who is throwing away the life of a professional pop idol and abandoning his fame to pursue a career as a horse jockey. How on Earth does a guy like that end up being the least interesting member of a cast that is comprised of other guys whose only defining features are their hair styles? When the hilariously sincere Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up, and I finally made it through to the second half of the episode, I was hoping I might at least get some kicks out of the show's unintentional camp factor, but no, we can't even trust a goofy acid-trip phantom to stick around long enough to keep things interesting.    Instead, once the not-drama of Yu's arrival at Horse School is over with, we're treated to the similarly terrifying Actual Living Horses that the boys (and gal) have to deal with, and I'll give Fanfare of Adolescence this much: Even if the CGI horses look really awkward, I was kind of excited to watch them get all spooked and run around a bunch. I knew it was too much to ask for one of them to legitimately kick one of the characters in the head, although my hopes were briefly raised when ol' Yu somehow got it in his head that he could win a game of chicken against a 600-pund behemoth with stones for feet. Still, if nothing else, the show about horse racing was kind enough to have the riders and horses actually do stuff for a bit, and that kept my brain distracted long enough for me to get through the rest of the premiere relatively unscathed.    I didn't hate Fanfare of Adolescence, but it's tone and style are diametrically opposed to my own sensibilities, and it's going to take a hell of a lot more than C-tier characters and cookie-cutter cliches to win me over. I'm sure it will be just the thing for some folks, though, which means that, with any luck. Psychedelic Ghost Horse may yet ride again.

Chameleon There are at least four genres of anime that, no matter what anybody does, always seem to completely fall on their face when released in the West: sports, realistic military, yakuza and yankee (juvenile delinquent) shows. These were discovered through a lot of trial and error in the early...                    column          18 comments       Pile of Shame - The Tibetan Dog   2014 Sep  3, 00:21 18 comments                 anime    An underappreciated Madhouse feature from 2011 featuring a boy and his dog in the harsh terrain of Tibet. ―  The Tibetan Dog Japanese/Chinese co-productions don't happen very often. The last one I can think of would be 1997's anime adaptation of Tsui Hark's Chinese Ghost Story, which was charming in appearance but kind of a plodding, pointless affair. In 2007 another one started production, after ani...                    column          10 comments       Pile of Shame - The Enemy's The Pirates!   2014 Aug 20, 00:00 10 comments                 anime    Justin tries to return to an old 90s favorite that has become more famous for its obscure, awful dub. ―  The Enemy's The Pirates! ~The Cat's Banquet~ There's a Japanese tradition of stand-up comedy duos known as ""manzai (漫才)."" Manzai routines are high-speed, rapid-fire conversations between one person, who's an idiot or a weirdo of some kind (boke), and a straight man (tsukkomi), who's constantly mut...                    column          32 comments       Pile of Shame - MARCO: 3,000 Leagues in Search of Mother   2014 Aug  6, 02:40 32 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look at a remake of Takahata's World Masterpiece Theater classic. Does it hold up? Ehh... ―  MARCO: 3,000 Leagues in Search of Mother We need to declare a new genre of anime, right here and now. There needs to be a separate category for the metric ton of overwrought family fare Japan makes, that aims to be Studio Ghibli in quality, but ends up succumbing to its maudlin sentimentality a...                    column          6 comments       Pile of Shame - Eiji   2014 Jul 22, 22:59 6 comments                 anime    Hisashi Eguchi's boxing manga got a short movie treatment back in 1990, but does it hold up? ―  Eiji Hisashi Eguchi is probably a guy that's better known among Japanese creatives than among American otaku. As an illustrator and manga artist, he's designed characters for such anime as Roujin Z and Spriggan, heavily influenced the look of Satoshi Kon's characters (Perfect Blue's final look was based on...                    column          33 comments       Pile of Shame - Mermaid's Scar   2014 Jul  9, 01:15 33 comments                 anime    Rumiko Takahashi's macabre OAV still holds up, and is still creepy, but the dub is really weird sounding. ―  Mermaid's Scar Mermaid's Scar is one of those early stocked-at-every-Blockbuster-Video-in-the-country hits of the VHS era that almost every fan that came of age in the mid-90s saw at one time or another. Colorful, violent, and hypnotic in its own way, it made a big impression on 13-year-old Ju...                    column          10 comments       Pile of Shame - ESPer Mami: Hoshizora no Dancing Doll   2014 Jun 25, 00:00 10 comments                 anime    Justin discovers a once-loved series by the creator of Doraemon, and finds it to be pretty dull. ―  ESPer Mami: Hoshizora no Dancing Doll Even though it's never been particularly popular among anime fans in the West, most people at least have heard of Doraemon, Fujiko F. Fujio's famous magical large blue cat character who's the star of over 2500 episodes of TV anime and 35 movies (not including short...                    column          18 comments       Pile of Shame - Guyver: Out of Control   2014 Jun 11, 03:43 18 comments                 anime    A mildly entertaining, but super-dated OAV incarnation of everyone's favorite superhero/grotesque monster/schoolboy. ―  Guyver: Out of Control Guyver: Out of Control was one of the earliest anime VHS releases in the US, and being an alternate retelling of the same story that the same company, US Renditions, would later release in dubbed form, was one of the first titles to confuse the hell out of peo...                    column          45 comments       Pile of Shame - Full Moon O Sagashite   2014 May 28, 00:00 45 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look back at the oddball Magical-Idol-Singer-With-Cancer Show from the early '00s. Because every little girl loves stories about dying tragically. ―  Full Moon o Sagashite I often joke that I love shows about children suffering. I usually mean that as a joke: anime usually involves young protagonists, but too often their concerns are superficial: being the best at a game, or a sport, o...                    column          34 comments       Pile of Shame - 3x3 Eyes   2014 May 14, 02:26 34 comments                 anime    Once a mainstay of anime club video rooms, 3x3 Eyes isn't brought up very often today. Does it stand up? Justin finds out. ―  3x3 EYES Yuzo Takada was never really a big name among American otaku, but back in the 90s his stuff ranked as some of the most popular anime of its day, including Blue Seed, Cat Girl Nuku Nuku, and this -- 3x3 EYES, a dark and gory adventure OAV that once adorned a good numbe...                    column          20 comments       Pile of Shame - Legend of the Dragon Kings   2014 Apr 30, 00:00 20 comments                 anime    A highly mediocre adaptation of a best-selling book series that was illustrated by Yoshitaka Amano and CLAMP. The anime looks nothing like that, of course. ―  Legend of the Dragon Kings(A.K.A. Sohryuden, Legend of the Four Kings) When a much-loved book or manga series gets a TV anime adaptation, fans of the original work hold their breath. Some adaptations improve on the original work. Others take it...                    column          8 comments       Pile of Shame - Nitaboh   2014 Apr 16, 00:00 8 comments                 anime    One of the few anime biographies, Nitaboh is surprisingly formulaic for being a true story. ―  Nitaboh, The Shamisen Master Last year, an old friend of mine asked me to help a non-profit group of radio producers come up with a Kickstarter video for a public radio project called ""Heavenly Sight,"" a multi-part audio documentary and web resource on blind African American blues and jazz musicians. It was...                    column          18 comments       Pile of Shame - Dark Warrior (Makyu Senjo)   2014 Apr  2, 00:00 18 comments                 anime    A non-hentai show from hentai producers that somehow nobody remembers, despite getting two dubs. There's a reason. ―  Dark Warrior (Makyu Senjo) It's pretty rare that an anime gets released in both the US and the UK, and with English dubs no less, and yet hardly anyone even remembers the show exists. Dark Warrior (AKA Makyu Senjo) is one of those, seemingly having made zero impact on fans upon its re...                    column          20 comments       Pile of Shame - Goddamn!!   2014 Mar 19, 06:39 20 comments                 anime    A rally car racing OAV that, aside from the provocative name, doesn't make much of an impact. ―  Goddamn!! Kaoru Shintani has never had much of an American fanbase. His most famous work, the fighter pilot drama series Area 88, landed in the US with a resounding thud in both of its anime adaptations as well as Viz's repeated attempts to publish the manga in English. I lay blame for that mostly in his ...                    column          23 comments       Pile of Shame - Adventures of Hols, Prince of the Sun   2014 Mar  5, 02:24 23 comments                 anime    Isao Takahata's troubled first feature is easily the best anime of the 1960s. ―  Adventures of Hols, Prince of the Sun It's the iron age, somewhere in Scandinavia, and a young boy warrior named Hols is just coming back home from a fierce battle with a pack of wolves. His father, on his deathbed, bids him to return to the Northern village they fled years ago, when an evil sorcerer named Grunwald devas...                    column          8 comments       Pile of Shame - Ai City   2014 Feb 19, 01:00 8 comments                 anime    A sleeper sci-fi film from Koichi Mashimo that might break your brain, but will definitely dazzle your eyes while doing so. ―  Ai City In the opening scenes of Ai City, we are dropped into the middle of a car chase in what is possibly New York City. In the back seat is a former cop, who was fired and is now a private investigator. He doesn't know why he's there, and neither do we.

The rest of the team is all guys, but they don't stand a chance against the tomboy, and politely bow out. In addition to being fearfullly strong, Natsuki is also the protog...                    column          13 comments       Pile of Shame - Seven Cities Story   2014 Jan 22, 01:00 13 comments                 anime    A two-part OAV that tries to transplant Legend of Galactic Heroes onto a sideways-rotated Earth, and succeeds only in being dull and confusing. ―  Seven Cities Story One day, with no warning, the Earth's polar axis shifts 90 degrees, shaking up human civilization like an Etch-A-Sketch and killing everybody. Luckily by this time, humanity had a pretty decent settlement going on the moon, and once thin...                    column          23 comments       Pile of Shame - After School Tinker Bell   2014 Jan  8, 01:00 23 comments                 anime    This week, an OAV based on a light novel series about a romantic couple that solves mysteries around their school. ―  After School Tinker Bell In the last few years there have been a ton of anime adapted from light novels: those small, pulpy, simply written and easy-to-read populist books that lie somewhere between young adult novels and manga. But light novels have been around for a very long time, ...                    column          12 comments       Pile of Shame - Handsome Girl   2013 Dec 25, 01:00 12 comments                 anime    Justin revisits an old one-shot OAV by the creator of Marmalade Boy... and is a little underwhelmed. ―  Handsome Girl When I was in high school, I loved the show Marmalade Boy. A lot. In fact, I wrote an article about it! A perfectly addictive confectionary of chaste teenaged yearning and romance, and undiluted raw crippling angst, I lost many an evening to the adventures of the lovelorn protagonists...                    column          11 comments       Pile of Shame - The Sensualist   2013 Dec 11, 02:10 11 comments                 anime    This week, a unique erotic historical fiction film that has completely slipped through the cracks. ―  The Sensualist (A.K.A. The Life of an Amorous Man) I first saw The Sensualist as a fuzzy VHS tape when I was a teenager. While it's ostensibly an adult work, it never seemed lurid or arousing to me. Rather, it held this strange transcendent beauty. It felt like a piece of another person's life, so fo...                    column          16 comments       Pile of Shame - Emblem Take 2   2013 Nov 27, 02:02 16 comments                 anime    This week, a rare yakuza time travel comedy. Perhaps the ONLY yakuza time travel comedy. ―  Emblem Take 2 Yakuza aren't a pleasant topic. Japan's fully-entrenched organized crime families and organizations, and their connections with everything from banking to entertainment to politics show us Japan at its most corrupt and embarrassing. Unless you go looking for trouble in Tokyo, it's unlikely that a...                    column          17 comments       Pile of Shame: Ai Monogatari: 9 Love Stories   2013 Nov 13, 01:13 17 comments                 anime    Trying to watch this OAV like biting into a large wad of wet cotton: it's not offensive or unpleasant, but you want to end the experience as fast as humanly possible. ―  Ai Monogatari: 9 Love Stories If there's anything that anime lacks, it's real, adult love stories. We have enough yearning, angsty teen romance to sink a battleship, but realistic love stories about people whose frontal lobes are fir...                    column          23 comments       Pile of Shame - Wanna-Be's   2013 Oct 30, 00:01 23 comments     Did anyone say ""I want more women's wrestling anime?"" .... No? Didn't think so. ―  Wanna-Be's Lately there's been a lot of chatter about the girls' wrestling TV series, Wanna Be The Strongest In The World. Given that virtually none of the chatter is positive, I'm not really making plans to check out the show for myself. But hearing about a mediocre girls' wresting anime did jog my memory about anothe...                    column          5 comments       Pile of Shame - Grandeek: The Alternative   2013 Sep 18, 00:56 5 comments                 anime    An early digipaint OAV that has a lot of potential, but is so awkwardly made that the storytelling really suffers. ―  Grandeek: The Alternative When visiting Japan, one of my favorite things to do is explore the DVD sections of every Book Off location I can find.

Instead, it's just sort of lazy and crappy. ―  Butt Attack Punisher Girl Gautaman One thing you can say about Butt Attack Girl Punisher Gautaman (and its sequel OAV, Butt Attack Punisher Girl Gautaman R), you know pretty much exactly what you're getting: a cut-rate early-90s dirty comedy OAV about a girl that beats dudes down with her butt.

I mean that honestly. There was a time not long ago, even in otaku circles, when the idea of incest was odd and outré enough to elicit giggles from the less mature parts of ourselves, and maybe even an ""oh god.""

Pile of Shame FINAL: Chie the Brat The Pile of Shame recedes into the mists of history with one final installment, on Isao Takahata's criminally underseen Chie the Brat.  « »     Pile of Shame        — Archives —                  Filters          All Southeast Asia  •  Anime Manga Novels Games Music Merch Events Industry People Live-Action COVID-19           Text-only Compact View             Text-only List View             Text-only Grid View             List View with Images             Grid View with Images                               column          39 comments       Pile of Shame - Colorful   2014 Nov 12, 01:00 39 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look at an understated art house drama anime from a few years ago, and finds a lot to admire. ―  COLORFUL To paraphrase Hideaki Anno, people don't commit suicide because they're depressed, people commit suicide because they can no longer imagine happiness. That thought occurred to me again and again while I was watching Colorful, the remarkable feature film produced by Sunrise in 2010,...                    column          16 comments       Pile of Shame - SOS!

Tokyo Metro Explorers: The Next Anime fans who were around back in 2007 might remember a company briefly appearing on the scene known as Bandai Visual USA. If they do remember, it's usually not a fond memory: BVUSA was the first attempt by a major Japanese anime producer to insert themselves into th...                           column          17 comments       Pile of Shame - Dead Heat & 3D Anime   2014 Oct 15, 00:00 17 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look at the first (and one of the only) 3D anime ever made, for an obscure videodisc system only sold in Japan. ―  Dead Heat Sometimes the reasons behind an anime getting made are more interesting than the show itself. That's definitely the case with Dead Heat, an obscure 1987 OAV from Sunrise that runs only a half hour. Back in the wild days of the nascent 80s home video market, there...                    column          49 comments       Pile of Shame - Special Duty Combat Unit Shinesman   2014 Oct  1, 00:06 49 comments                 anime    Justin revisits what was once considered the finest sentai parody in the land. Does it still hold up? ―  Special Duty Combat Unit Shinesman It's always a terrifying thing, going back to old shows you loved when you were younger and revisiting them. Many of them, comedies in particular, tend to age very poorly. They connect with us at the time, but humor is just so particular and fickle -- what made y...                    column          31 comments       Pile of Shame - Bite Me! Chameleon   2014 Sep 17, 00:00 31 comments                 anime    This little-seen delinquent comedy, an early ADV release, made Justin want to hurt himself. ―  Bite Me! Chameleon There are at least four genres of anime that, no matter what anybody does, always seem to completely fall on their face when released in the West: sports, realistic military, yakuza and yankee (juvenile delinquent) shows. These were discovered through a lot of trial and error in the early...                    column          18 comments       Pile of Shame - The Tibetan Dog   2014 Sep  3, 00:21 18 comments                 anime    An underappreciated Madhouse feature from 2011 featuring a boy and his dog in the harsh terrain of Tibet. ―  The Tibetan Dog Japanese/Chinese co-productions don't happen very often. The last one I can think of would be 1997's anime adaptation of Tsui Hark's Chinese Ghost Story, which was charming in appearance but kind of a plodding, pointless affair. In 2007 another one started production, after ani...                    column          10 comments       Pile of Shame - The Enemy's The Pirates!   2014 Aug 20, 00:00 10 comments                 anime    Justin tries to return to an old 90s favorite that has become more famous for its obscure, awful dub. ―  The Enemy's The Pirates! ~The Cat's Banquet~ There's a Japanese tradition of stand-up comedy duos known as ""manzai (漫才)."" Manzai routines are high-speed, rapid-fire conversations between one person, who's an idiot or a weirdo of some kind (boke), and a straight man (tsukkomi), who's constantly mut...                    column          32 comments       Pile of Shame - MARCO: 3,000 Leagues in Search of Mother   2014 Aug  6, 02:40 32 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look at a remake of Takahata's World Masterpiece Theater classic. Does it hold up? Ehh... ―  MARCO: 3,000 Leagues in Search of Mother We need to declare a new genre of anime, right here and now. There needs to be a separate category for the metric ton of overwrought family fare Japan makes, that aims to be Studio Ghibli in quality, but ends up succumbing to its maudlin sentimentality a...                    column          6 comments       Pile of Shame - Eiji   2014 Jul 22, 22:59 6 comments                 anime    Hisashi Eguchi's boxing manga got a short movie treatment back in 1990, but does it hold up? ―  Eiji Hisashi Eguchi is probably a guy that's better known among Japanese creatives than among American otaku. As an illustrator and manga artist, he's designed characters for such anime as Roujin Z and Spriggan, heavily influenced the look of Satoshi Kon's characters (Perfect Blue's final look was based on...                    column          33 comments       Pile of Shame - Mermaid's Scar   2014 Jul  9, 01:15 33 comments                 anime    Rumiko Takahashi's macabre OAV still holds up, and is still creepy, but the dub is really weird sounding. ―  Mermaid's Scar Mermaid's Scar is one of those early stocked-at-every-Blockbuster-Video-in-the-country hits of the VHS era that almost every fan that came of age in the mid-90s saw at one time or another. Colorful, violent, and hypnotic in its own way, it made a big impression on 13-year-old Ju...                    column          10 comments       Pile of Shame - ESPer Mami: Hoshizora no Dancing Doll   2014 Jun 25, 00:00 10 comments                 anime    Justin discovers a once-loved series by the creator of Doraemon, and finds it to be pretty dull. ―  ESPer Mami: Hoshizora no Dancing Doll Even though it's never been particularly popular among anime fans in the West, most people at least have heard of Doraemon, Fujiko F. Fujio's famous magical large blue cat character who's the star of over 2500 episodes of TV anime and 35 movies (not including short...                    column          18 comments       Pile of Shame - Guyver: Out of Control   2014 Jun 11, 03:43 18 comments                 anime    A mildly entertaining, but super-dated OAV incarnation of everyone's favorite superhero/grotesque monster/schoolboy. ―  Guyver: Out of Control Guyver: Out of Control was one of the earliest anime VHS releases in the US, and being an alternate retelling of the same story that the same company, US Renditions, would later release in dubbed form, was one of the first titles to confuse the hell out of peo...                    column          45 comments       Pile of Shame - Full Moon O Sagashite   2014 May 28, 00:00 45 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look back at the oddball Magical-Idol-Singer-With-Cancer Show from the early '00s. Because every little girl loves stories about dying tragically. ―  Full Moon o Sagashite I often joke that I love shows about children suffering. I usually mean that as a joke: anime usually involves young protagonists, but too often their concerns are superficial: being the best at a game, or a sport, o...                    column          34 comments       Pile of Shame - 3x3 Eyes   2014 May 14, 02:26 34 comments                 anime    Once a mainstay of anime club video rooms, 3x3 Eyes isn't brought up very often today. Does it stand up? Justin finds out. ―  3x3 EYES Yuzo Takada was never really a big name among American otaku, but back in the 90s his stuff ranked as some of the most popular anime of its day, including Blue Seed, Cat Girl Nuku Nuku, and this -- 3x3 EYES, a dark and gory adventure OAV that once adorned a good numbe...                    column          20 comments       Pile of Shame - Legend of the Dragon Kings   2014 Apr 30, 00:00 20 comments                 anime    A highly mediocre adaptation of a best-selling book series that was illustrated by Yoshitaka Amano and CLAMP. The anime looks nothing like that, of course. ―  Legend of the Dragon Kings(A.K.A. Sohryuden, Legend of the Four Kings) When a much-loved book or manga series gets a TV anime adaptation, fans of the original work hold their breath. Some adaptations improve on the original work. Others take it...                    column          8 comments       Pile of Shame - Nitaboh   2014 Apr 16, 00:00 8 comments                 anime    One of the few anime biographies, Nitaboh is surprisingly formulaic for being a true story. ―  Nitaboh, The Shamisen Master Last year, an old friend of mine asked me to help a non-profit group of radio producers come up with a Kickstarter video for a public radio project called ""Heavenly Sight,"" a multi-part audio documentary and web resource on blind African American blues and jazz musicians. It was...                    column          18 comments       Pile of Shame - Dark Warrior (Makyu Senjo)   2014 Apr  2, 00:00 18 comments                 anime    A non-hentai show from hentai producers that somehow nobody remembers, despite getting two dubs. There's a reason. ―  Dark Warrior (Makyu Senjo) It's pretty rare that an anime gets released in both the US and the UK, and with English dubs no less, and yet hardly anyone even remembers the show exists. Dark Warrior (AKA Makyu Senjo) is one of those, seemingly having made zero impact on fans upon its re...                    column          20 comments       Pile of Shame - Goddamn!!   2014 Mar 19, 06:39 20 comments                 anime    A rally car racing OAV that, aside from the provocative name, doesn't make much of an impact. ―  Goddamn!! Kaoru Shintani has never had much of an American fanbase. His most famous work, the fighter pilot drama series Area 88, landed in the US with a resounding thud in both of its anime adaptations as well as Viz's repeated attempts to publish the manga in English. I lay blame for that mostly in his ...                    column          23 comments       Pile of Shame - Adventures of Hols, Prince of the Sun   2014 Mar  5, 02:24 23 comments                 anime    Isao Takahata's troubled first feature is easily the best anime of the 1960s. ―  Adventures of Hols, Prince of the Sun It's the iron age, somewhere in Scandinavia, and a young boy warrior named Hols is just coming back home from a fierce battle with a pack of wolves. His father, on his deathbed, bids him to return to the Northern village they fled years ago, when an evil sorcerer named Grunwald devas...                    column          8 comments       Pile of Shame - Ai City   2014 Feb 19, 01:00 8 comments                 anime    A sleeper sci-fi film from Koichi Mashimo that might break your brain, but will definitely dazzle your eyes while doing so. ―  Ai City In the opening scenes of Ai City, we are dropped into the middle of a car chase in what is possibly New York City. In the back seat is a former cop, who was fired and is now a private investigator. He doesn't know why he's there, and neither do we. In the front seat a...                    column          14 comments       Pile of Shame - Natsuki Crisis   2014 Feb  5, 01:00 14 comments                 anime    A fun two-part girls-fighting-in-high-school OAV that doesn't take itself too seriously... until it does. ―  Natsuki Crisis When we first meet Kitsumi Natsuki, she's in her school dojo, gleefully trying to find a sparring partner. The rest of the team is all guys, but they don't stand a chance against the tomboy, and politely bow out. In addition to being fearfullly strong, Natsuki is also the protog...                    column          13 comments       Pile of Shame - Seven Cities Story   2014 Jan 22, 01:00 13 comments                 anime    A two-part OAV that tries to transplant Legend of Galactic Heroes onto a sideways-rotated Earth, and succeeds only in being dull and confusing. ―  Seven Cities Story One day, with no warning, the Earth's polar axis shifts 90 degrees, shaking up human civilization like an Etch-A-Sketch and killing everybody. Luckily by this time, humanity had a pretty decent settlement going on the moon, and once thin...                    column          23 comments       Pile of Shame - After School Tinker Bell   2014 Jan  8, 01:00 23 comments                 anime    This week, an OAV based on a light novel series about a romantic couple that solves mysteries around their school. ―  After School Tinker Bell In the last few years there have been a ton of anime adapted from light novels: those small, pulpy, simply written and easy-to-read populist books that lie somewhere between young adult novels and manga. But light novels have been around for a very long time, ...                    column          12 comments       Pile of Shame - Handsome Girl   2013 Dec 25, 01:00 12 comments                 anime    Justin revisits an old one-shot OAV by the creator of Marmalade Boy... and is a little underwhelmed. ―  Handsome Girl When I was in high school, I loved the show Marmalade Boy. A lot. In fact, I wrote an article about it! A perfectly addictive confectionary of chaste teenaged yearning and romance, and undiluted raw crippling angst, I lost many an evening to the adventures of the lovelorn protagonists...                    column          11 comments       Pile of Shame - The Sensualist   2013 Dec 11, 02:10 11 comments                 anime    This week, a unique erotic historical fiction film that has completely slipped through the cracks. ―  The Sensualist (A.K.A. The Life of an Amorous Man) I first saw The Sensualist as a fuzzy VHS tape when I was a teenager. While it's ostensibly an adult work, it never seemed lurid or arousing to me. Rather, it held this strange transcendent beauty. It felt like a piece of another person's life, so fo...                    column          16 comments       Pile of Shame - Emblem Take 2   2013 Nov 27, 02:02 16 comments                 anime    This week, a rare yakuza time travel comedy. Perhaps the ONLY yakuza time travel comedy. ―  Emblem Take 2 Yakuza aren't a pleasant topic. Japan's fully-entrenched organized crime families and organizations, and their connections with everything from banking to entertainment to politics show us Japan at its most corrupt and embarrassing. Unless you go looking for trouble in Tokyo, it's unlikely that a...                    column          17 comments       Pile of Shame: Ai Monogatari: 9 Love Stories   2013 Nov 13, 01:13 17 comments                 anime    Trying to watch this OAV like biting into a large wad of wet cotton: it's not offensive or unpleasant, but you want to end the experience as fast as humanly possible. ―  Ai Monogatari: 9 Love Stories If there's anything that anime lacks, it's real, adult love stories. We have enough yearning, angsty teen romance to sink a battleship, but realistic love stories about people whose frontal lobes are fir...                    column          23 comments       Pile of Shame - Wanna-Be's   2013 Oct 30, 00:01 23 comments     Did anyone say ""I want more women's wrestling anime?"" .... No? Didn't think so. ―  Wanna-Be's Lately there's been a lot of chatter about the girls' wrestling TV series, Wanna Be The Strongest In The World. Given that virtually none of the chatter is positive, I'm not really making plans to check out the show for myself. But hearing about a mediocre girls' wresting anime did jog my memory about anothe...                    column          5 comments       Pile of Shame - Grandeek: The Alternative   2013 Sep 18, 00:56 5 comments                 anime    An early digipaint OAV that has a lot of potential, but is so awkwardly made that the storytelling really suffers. ―  Grandeek: The Alternative When visiting Japan, one of my favorite things to do is explore the DVD sections of every Book Off location I can find. Usually I can identify and easily dismiss pretty much everything on the shelf, but every once in a while I happen upon something that I hav...                    column          17 comments       Pile of Shame - Butt Attack Punisher Girl Gautaman   2013 Sep  4, 00:00 17 comments                 anime                manga    It could've been offensive, bawdy, witty and hilarious. Instead, it's just sort of lazy and crappy. ―  Butt Attack Punisher Girl Gautaman One thing you can say about Butt Attack Girl Punisher Gautaman (and its sequel OAV, Butt Attack Punisher Girl Gautaman R), you know pretty much exactly what you're getting: a cut-rate early-90s dirty comedy OAV about a girl that beats dudes down with her butt. It o...                    column          43 comments       Pile of Shame - Yagami-kun's Family Affairs   2013 Aug 21, 00:08 43 comments                 anime    This week, a slapstick comedy OAV from 1990 that's all about incest. ―  Yagami-kun's Family Affairs Remember when incest was shocking? I mean that honestly. There was a time not long ago, even in otaku circles, when the idea of incest was odd and outré enough to elicit giggles from the less mature parts of ourselves, and maybe even an ""oh god."" You can tell what we used to be like by going up to your...                    column          28 comments       Pile of Shame - Moshidora   2013 Aug  7, 02:32 28 comments                 anime    Only Japan would attempt to take a business management textbook and turn it into a high school sports story. ―  Moshidora When I first heard the premise behind Moshidora, which is short for a ridiculously long title that translates to, ""What If the Girl Manager of a High School Baseball Team Read Drucker's 'Management?'"" I believe I laughed and said, ""Oh, Japan."" Because really, what other response i...                    column          22 comments       Pile of Shame - Kenya Boy   2013 Jul 24, 01:00 22 comments                 anime    Adjectives fail Justin has he tries to describe the absolute insanity contained in a 1984 feature film retelling of a popular 1950s manga series. ― One of the benefits to writing a column on obscure anime for so long is that occasionally friends hand you things that they think would inspire a good column.

That thought occurred to me again and again while I was watching Colorful, the remarkable feature film produced by Sunrise in 2010,...                    column          16 comments       Pile of Shame - SOS!

Tokyo Metro Explorers: The Next Anime fans who were around back in 2007 might remember a company briefly appearing on the scene known as Bandai Visual USA. If they do remember, it's usually not a fond memory: BVUSA was the first attempt by a major Japanese anime producer to insert themselves into th...                           column          17 comments       Pile of Shame - Dead Heat & 3D Anime   2014 Oct 15, 00:00 17 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look at the first (and one of the only) 3D anime ever made, for an obscure videodisc system only sold in Japan. ―  Dead Heat Sometimes the reasons behind an anime getting made are more interesting than the show itself. That's definitely the case with Dead Heat, an obscure 1987 OAV from Sunrise that runs only a half hour. Back in the wild days of the nascent 80s home video market, there...                    column          49 comments       Pile of Shame - Special Duty Combat Unit Shinesman   2014 Oct  1, 00:06 49 comments                 anime    Justin revisits what was once considered the finest sentai parody in the land. Does it still hold up? ―  Special Duty Combat Unit Shinesman It's always a terrifying thing, going back to old shows you loved when you were younger and revisiting them. Many of them, comedies in particular, tend to age very poorly. They connect with us at the time, but humor is just so particular and fickle -- what made y...                    column          31 comments       Pile of Shame - Bite Me! Chameleon   2014 Sep 17, 00:00 31 comments                 anime    This little-seen delinquent comedy, an early ADV release, made Justin want to hurt himself. ―  Bite Me! Chameleon There are at least four genres of anime that, no matter what anybody does, always seem to completely fall on their face when released in the West: sports, realistic military, yakuza and yankee (juvenile delinquent) shows. These were discovered through a lot of trial and error in the early...                    column          18 comments       Pile of Shame - The Tibetan Dog   2014 Sep  3, 00:21 18 comments                 anime    An underappreciated Madhouse feature from 2011 featuring a boy and his dog in the harsh terrain of Tibet. ―  The Tibetan Dog Japanese/Chinese co-productions don't happen very often. The last one I can think of would be 1997's anime adaptation of Tsui Hark's Chinese Ghost Story, which was charming in appearance but kind of a plodding, pointless affair. In 2007 another one started production, after ani...                    column          10 comments       Pile of Shame - The Enemy's The Pirates!   2014 Aug 20, 00:00 10 comments                 anime    Justin tries to return to an old 90s favorite that has become more famous for its obscure, awful dub. ―  The Enemy's The Pirates! ~The Cat's Banquet~ There's a Japanese tradition of stand-up comedy duos known as ""manzai (漫才)."" Manzai routines are high-speed, rapid-fire conversations between one person, who's an idiot or a weirdo of some kind (boke), and a straight man (tsukkomi), who's constantly mut...                    column          32 comments       Pile of Shame - MARCO: 3,000 Leagues in Search of Mother   2014 Aug  6, 02:40 32 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look at a remake of Takahata's World Masterpiece Theater classic. Does it hold up? Ehh... ―  MARCO: 3,000 Leagues in Search of Mother We need to declare a new genre of anime, right here and now. There needs to be a separate category for the metric ton of overwrought family fare Japan makes, that aims to be Studio Ghibli in quality, but ends up succumbing to its maudlin sentimentality a...                    column          6 comments       Pile of Shame - Eiji   2014 Jul 22, 22:59 6 comments                 anime    Hisashi Eguchi's boxing manga got a short movie treatment back in 1990, but does it hold up? ―  Eiji Hisashi Eguchi is probably a guy that's better known among Japanese creatives than among American otaku. As an illustrator and manga artist, he's designed characters for such anime as Roujin Z and Spriggan, heavily influenced the look of Satoshi Kon's characters (Perfect Blue's final look was based on...                    column          33 comments       Pile of Shame - Mermaid's Scar   2014 Jul  9, 01:15 33 comments                 anime    Rumiko Takahashi's macabre OAV still holds up, and is still creepy, but the dub is really weird sounding. ―  Mermaid's Scar Mermaid's Scar is one of those early stocked-at-every-Blockbuster-Video-in-the-country hits of the VHS era that almost every fan that came of age in the mid-90s saw at one time or another. Colorful, violent, and hypnotic in its own way, it made a big impression on 13-year-old Ju...                    column          10 comments       Pile of Shame - ESPer Mami: Hoshizora no Dancing Doll   2014 Jun 25, 00:00 10 comments                 anime    Justin discovers a once-loved series by the creator of Doraemon, and finds it to be pretty dull. ―  ESPer Mami: Hoshizora no Dancing Doll Even though it's never been particularly popular among anime fans in the West, most people at least have heard of Doraemon, Fujiko F. Fujio's famous magical large blue cat character who's the star of over 2500 episodes of TV anime and 35 movies (not including short...                    column          18 comments       Pile of Shame - Guyver: Out of Control   2014 Jun 11, 03:43 18 comments                 anime    A mildly entertaining, but super-dated OAV incarnation of everyone's favorite superhero/grotesque monster/schoolboy. ―  Guyver: Out of Control Guyver: Out of Control was one of the earliest anime VHS releases in the US, and being an alternate retelling of the same story that the same company, US Renditions, would later release in dubbed form, was one of the first titles to confuse the hell out of peo...                    column          45 comments       Pile of Shame - Full Moon O Sagashite   2014 May 28, 00:00 45 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look back at the oddball Magical-Idol-Singer-With-Cancer Show from the early '00s. Because every little girl loves stories about dying tragically. ―  Full Moon o Sagashite I often joke that I love shows about children suffering. I usually mean that as a joke: anime usually involves young protagonists, but too often their concerns are superficial: being the best at a game, or a sport, o...                    column          34 comments       Pile of Shame - 3x3 Eyes   2014 May 14, 02:26 34 comments                 anime    Once a mainstay of anime club video rooms, 3x3 Eyes isn't brought up very often today. Does it stand up? Justin finds out. ―  3x3 EYES Yuzo Takada was never really a big name among American otaku, but back in the 90s his stuff ranked as some of the most popular anime of its day, including Blue Seed, Cat Girl Nuku Nuku, and this -- 3x3 EYES, a dark and gory adventure OAV that once adorned a good numbe...                    column          20 comments       Pile of Shame - Legend of the Dragon Kings   2014 Apr 30, 00:00 20 comments                 anime    A highly mediocre adaptation of a best-selling book series that was illustrated by Yoshitaka Amano and CLAMP. The anime looks nothing like that, of course. ―  Legend of the Dragon Kings(A.K.A. Sohryuden, Legend of the Four Kings) When a much-loved book or manga series gets a TV anime adaptation, fans of the original work hold their breath. Some adaptations improve on the original work. Others take it...                    column          8 comments       Pile of Shame - Nitaboh   2014 Apr 16, 00:00 8 comments                 anime    One of the few anime biographies, Nitaboh is surprisingly formulaic for being a true story. ―  Nitaboh, The Shamisen Master Last year, an old friend of mine asked me to help a non-profit group of radio producers come up with a Kickstarter video for a public radio project called ""Heavenly Sight,"" a multi-part audio documentary and web resource on blind African American blues and jazz musicians. It was...                    column          18 comments       Pile of Shame - Dark Warrior (Makyu Senjo)   2014 Apr  2, 00:00 18 comments                 anime    A non-hentai show from hentai producers that somehow nobody remembers, despite getting two dubs. There's a reason. ―  Dark Warrior (Makyu Senjo) It's pretty rare that an anime gets released in both the US and the UK, and with English dubs no less, and yet hardly anyone even remembers the show exists. Dark Warrior (AKA Makyu Senjo) is one of those, seemingly having made zero impact on fans upon its re...                    column          20 comments       Pile of Shame - Goddamn!!   2014 Mar 19, 06:39 20 comments                 anime    A rally car racing OAV that, aside from the provocative name, doesn't make much of an impact. ―  Goddamn!! Kaoru Shintani has never had much of an American fanbase. His most famous work, the fighter pilot drama series Area 88, landed in the US with a resounding thud in both of its anime adaptations as well as Viz's repeated attempts to publish the manga in English. I lay blame for that mostly in his ...                    column          23 comments       Pile of Shame - Adventures of Hols, Prince of the Sun   2014 Mar  5, 02:24 23 comments                 anime    Isao Takahata's troubled first feature is easily the best anime of the 1960s. ―  Adventures of Hols, Prince of the Sun It's the iron age, somewhere in Scandinavia, and a young boy warrior named Hols is just coming back home from a fierce battle with a pack of wolves. His father, on his deathbed, bids him to return to the Northern village they fled years ago, when an evil sorcerer named Grunwald devas...                    column          8 comments       Pile of Shame - Ai City   2014 Feb 19, 01:00 8 comments                 anime    A sleeper sci-fi film from Koichi Mashimo that might break your brain, but will definitely dazzle your eyes while doing so. ―  Ai City In the opening scenes of Ai City, we are dropped into the middle of a car chase in what is possibly New York City. In the back seat is a former cop, who was fired and is now a private investigator. He doesn't know why he's there, and neither do we. In the front seat a...                    column          14 comments       Pile of Shame - Natsuki Crisis   2014 Feb  5, 01:00 14 comments                 anime    A fun two-part girls-fighting-in-high-school OAV that doesn't take itself too seriously... until it does. ―  Natsuki Crisis When we first meet Kitsumi Natsuki, she's in her school dojo, gleefully trying to find a sparring partner. The rest of the team is all guys, but they don't stand a chance against the tomboy, and politely bow out. In addition to being fearfullly strong, Natsuki is also the protog...                    column          13 comments       Pile of Shame - Seven Cities Story   2014 Jan 22, 01:00 13 comments                 anime    A two-part OAV that tries to transplant Legend of Galactic Heroes onto a sideways-rotated Earth, and succeeds only in being dull and confusing. ―  Seven Cities Story One day, with no warning, the Earth's polar axis shifts 90 degrees, shaking up human civilization like an Etch-A-Sketch and killing everybody. Luckily by this time, humanity had a pretty decent settlement going on the moon, and once thin...                    column          23 comments       Pile of Shame - After School Tinker Bell   2014 Jan  8, 01:00 23 comments                 anime    This week, an OAV based on a light novel series about a romantic couple that solves mysteries around their school. ―  After School Tinker Bell In the last few years there have been a ton of anime adapted from light novels: those small, pulpy, simply written and easy-to-read populist books that lie somewhere between young adult novels and manga. But light novels have been around for a very long time, ...                    column          12 comments       Pile of Shame - Handsome Girl   2013 Dec 25, 01:00 12 comments                 anime    Justin revisits an old one-shot OAV by the creator of Marmalade Boy... and is a little underwhelmed. ―  Handsome Girl When I was in high school, I loved the show Marmalade Boy. A lot. In fact, I wrote an article about it! A perfectly addictive confectionary of chaste teenaged yearning and romance, and undiluted raw crippling angst, I lost many an evening to the adventures of the lovelorn protagonists...                    column          11 comments       Pile of Shame - The Sensualist   2013 Dec 11, 02:10 11 comments                 anime    This week, a unique erotic historical fiction film that has completely slipped through the cracks. ―  The Sensualist (A.K.A. The Life of an Amorous Man) I first saw The Sensualist as a fuzzy VHS tape when I was a teenager. While it's ostensibly an adult work, it never seemed lurid or arousing to me. Rather, it held this strange transcendent beauty. It felt like a piece of another person's life, so fo...                    column          16 comments       Pile of Shame - Emblem Take 2   2013 Nov 27, 02:02 16 comments                 anime    This week, a rare yakuza time travel comedy. Perhaps the ONLY yakuza time travel comedy. ―  Emblem Take 2 Yakuza aren't a pleasant topic. Japan's fully-entrenched organized crime families and organizations, and their connections with everything from banking to entertainment to politics show us Japan at its most corrupt and embarrassing. Unless you go looking for trouble in Tokyo, it's unlikely that a...                    column          17 comments       Pile of Shame: Ai Monogatari: 9 Love Stories   2013 Nov 13, 01:13 17 comments                 anime    Trying to watch this OAV like biting into a large wad of wet cotton: it's not offensive or unpleasant, but you want to end the experience as fast as humanly possible. ―  Ai Monogatari: 9 Love Stories If there's anything that anime lacks, it's real, adult love stories. We have enough yearning, angsty teen romance to sink a battleship, but realistic love stories about people whose frontal lobes are fir...                    column          23 comments       Pile of Shame - Wanna-Be's   2013 Oct 30, 00:01 23 comments     Did anyone say ""I want more women's wrestling anime?"" ....

Tokyo Metro Explorers: The Next Anime fans who were around back in 2007 might remember a company briefly appearing on the scene known as Bandai Visual USA.

That's definitely the case with Dead Heat, an obscure 1987 OAV from Sunrise that runs only a half hour.

They connect with us at the time, but humor is just so particular and fickle -- what made y...                    column          31 comments       Pile of Shame - Bite Me!

Chameleon There are at least four genres of anime that, no matter what anybody does, always seem to completely fall on their face when released in the West: sports, realistic military, yakuza and yankee (juvenile delinquent) shows. These were discovered through a lot of trial and error in the early...                    column          18 comments       Pile of Shame - The Tibetan Dog   2014 Sep  3, 00:21 18 comments                 anime    An underappreciated Madhouse feature from 2011 featuring a boy and his dog in the harsh terrain of Tibet. ―  The Tibetan Dog Japanese/Chinese co-productions don't happen very often. The last one I can think of would be 1997's anime adaptation of Tsui Hark's Chinese Ghost Story, which was charming in appearance but kind of a plodding, pointless affair.

Because every little girl loves stories about dying tragically. ―  Full Moon o Sagashite I often joke that I love shows about children suffering. I usually mean that as a joke: anime usually involves young protagonists, but too often their concerns are superficial: being the best at a game, or a sport, o...                    column          34 comments       Pile of Shame - 3x3 Eyes   2014 May 14, 02:26 34 comments                 anime    Once a mainstay of anime club video rooms, 3x3 Eyes isn't brought up very often today. Does it stand up? Justin finds out. ―  3x3 EYES Yuzo Takada was never really a big name among American otaku, but back in the 90s his stuff ranked as some of the most popular anime of its day, including Blue Seed, Cat Girl Nuku Nuku, and this -- 3x3 EYES, a dark and gory adventure OAV that once adorned a good numbe...                    column          20 comments       Pile of Shame - Legend of the Dragon Kings   2014 Apr 30, 00:00 20 comments                 anime    A highly mediocre adaptation of a best-selling book series that was illustrated by Yoshitaka Amano and CLAMP. The anime looks nothing like that, of course. ―  Legend of the Dragon Kings(A.K.A.

Dark Warrior (AKA Makyu Senjo) is one of those, seemingly having made zero impact on fans upon its re...                    column          20 comments       Pile of Shame - Goddamn!!   2014 Mar 19, 06:39 20 comments                 anime    A rally car racing OAV that, aside from the provocative name, doesn't make much of an impact. ―  Goddamn!! Kaoru Shintani has never had much of an American fanbase. His most famous work, the fighter pilot drama series Area 88, landed in the US with a resounding thud in both of its anime adaptations as well as Viz's repeated attempts to publish the manga in English.

His father, on his deathbed, bids him to return to the Northern village they fled years ago, when an evil sorcerer named Grunwald devas...                    column          8 comments       Pile of Shame - Ai City   2014 Feb 19, 01:00 8 comments                 anime    A sleeper sci-fi film from Koichi Mashimo that might break your brain, but will definitely dazzle your eyes while doing so. ―  Ai City In the opening scenes of Ai City, we are dropped into the middle of a car chase in what is possibly New York City. In the back seat is a former cop, who was fired and is now a private investigator. He doesn't know why he's there, and neither do we.

The Life of an Amorous Man) I first saw The Sensualist as a fuzzy VHS tape when I was a teenager. While it's ostensibly an adult work, it never seemed lurid or arousing to me. Rather, it held this strange transcendent beauty.

Perhaps the ONLY yakuza time travel comedy. ―  Emblem Take 2 Yakuza aren't a pleasant topic. Japan's fully-entrenched organized crime families and organizations, and their connections with everything from banking to entertainment to politics show us Japan at its most corrupt and embarrassing.

That's definitely the case with Dead Heat, an obscure 1987 OAV from Sunrise that runs only a half hour. Back in the wild days of the nascent 80s home video market, there...                    column          49 comments       Pile of Shame - Special Duty Combat Unit Shinesman   2014 Oct  1, 00:06 49 comments                 anime    Justin revisits what was once considered the finest sentai parody in the land.

Many of them, comedies in particular, tend to age very poorly. They connect with us at the time, but humor is just so particular and fickle -- what made y...                    column          31 comments       Pile of Shame - Bite Me!

Chameleon There are at least four genres of anime that, no matter what anybody does, always seem to completely fall on their face when released in the West: sports, realistic military, yakuza and yankee (juvenile delinquent) shows. These were discovered through a lot of trial and error in the early...                    column          18 comments       Pile of Shame - The Tibetan Dog   2014 Sep  3, 00:21 18 comments                 anime    An underappreciated Madhouse feature from 2011 featuring a boy and his dog in the harsh terrain of Tibet. ―  The Tibetan Dog Japanese/Chinese co-productions don't happen very often. The last one I can think of would be 1997's anime adaptation of Tsui Hark's Chinese Ghost Story, which was charming in appearance but kind of a plodding, pointless affair.

Manzai routines are high-speed, rapid-fire conversations between one person, who's an idiot or a weirdo of some kind (boke), and a straight man (tsukkomi), who's constantly mut...                    column          32 comments       Pile of Shame - MARCO: 3,000 Leagues in Search of Mother   2014 Aug  6, 02:40 32 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look at a remake of Takahata's World Masterpiece Theater classic. Does it hold up? Ehh... ―  MARCO: 3,000 Leagues in Search of Mother We need to declare a new genre of anime, right here and now.

As an illustrator and manga artist, he's designed characters for such anime as Roujin Z and Spriggan, heavily influenced the look of Satoshi Kon's characters (Perfect Blue's final look was based on...                    column          33 comments       Pile of Shame - Mermaid's Scar   2014 Jul  9, 01:15 33 comments                 anime    Rumiko Takahashi's macabre OAV still holds up, and is still creepy, but the dub is really weird sounding. ―  Mermaid's Scar Mermaid's Scar is one of those early stocked-at-every-Blockbuster-Video-in-the-country hits of the VHS era that almost every fan that came of age in the mid-90s saw at one time or another. Colorful, violent, and hypnotic in its own way, it made a big impression on 13-year-old Ju...                    column          10 comments       Pile of Shame - ESPer Mami: Hoshizora no Dancing Doll   2014 Jun 25, 00:00 10 comments                 anime    Justin discovers a once-loved series by the creator of Doraemon, and finds it to be pretty dull. ―  ESPer Mami: Hoshizora no Dancing Doll Even though it's never been particularly popular among anime fans in the West, most people at least have heard of Doraemon, Fujiko F.

Because every little girl loves stories about dying tragically. ―  Full Moon o Sagashite I often joke that I love shows about children suffering. I usually mean that as a joke: anime usually involves young protagonists, but too often their concerns are superficial: being the best at a game, or a sport, o...                    column          34 comments       Pile of Shame - 3x3 Eyes   2014 May 14, 02:26 34 comments                 anime    Once a mainstay of anime club video rooms, 3x3 Eyes isn't brought up very often today. Does it stand up? Justin finds out. ―  3x3 EYES Yuzo Takada was never really a big name among American otaku, but back in the 90s his stuff ranked as some of the most popular anime of its day, including Blue Seed, Cat Girl Nuku Nuku, and this -- 3x3 EYES, a dark and gory adventure OAV that once adorned a good numbe...                    column          20 comments       Pile of Shame - Legend of the Dragon Kings   2014 Apr 30, 00:00 20 comments                 anime    A highly mediocre adaptation of a best-selling book series that was illustrated by Yoshitaka Amano and CLAMP. The anime looks nothing like that, of course. ―  Legend of the Dragon Kings(A.K.A. Sohryuden, Legend of the Four Kings) When a much-loved book or manga series gets a TV anime adaptation, fans of the original work hold their breath. Some adaptations improve on the original work. Others take it...                    column          8 comments       Pile of Shame - Nitaboh   2014 Apr 16, 00:00 8 comments                 anime    One of the few anime biographies, Nitaboh is surprisingly formulaic for being a true story. ―  Nitaboh, The Shamisen Master Last year, an old friend of mine asked me to help a non-profit group of radio producers come up with a Kickstarter video for a public radio project called ""Heavenly Sight,"" a multi-part audio documentary and web resource on blind African American blues and jazz musicians. It was...                    column          18 comments       Pile of Shame - Dark Warrior (Makyu Senjo)   2014 Apr  2, 00:00 18 comments                 anime    A non-hentai show from hentai producers that somehow nobody remembers, despite getting two dubs. There's a reason. ―  Dark Warrior (Makyu Senjo) It's pretty rare that an anime gets released in both the US and the UK, and with English dubs no less, and yet hardly anyone even remembers the show exists. Dark Warrior (AKA Makyu Senjo) is one of those, seemingly having made zero impact on fans upon its re...                    column          20 comments       Pile of Shame - Goddamn!!   2014 Mar 19, 06:39 20 comments                 anime    A rally car racing OAV that, aside from the provocative name, doesn't make much of an impact. ―  Goddamn!! Kaoru Shintani has never had much of an American fanbase. His most famous work, the fighter pilot drama series Area 88, landed in the US with a resounding thud in both of its anime adaptations as well as Viz's repeated attempts to publish the manga in English. I lay blame for that mostly in his ...                    column          23 comments       Pile of Shame - Adventures of Hols, Prince of the Sun   2014 Mar  5, 02:24 23 comments                 anime    Isao Takahata's troubled first feature is easily the best anime of the 1960s. ―  Adventures of Hols, Prince of the Sun It's the iron age, somewhere in Scandinavia, and a young boy warrior named Hols is just coming back home from a fierce battle with a pack of wolves. His father, on his deathbed, bids him to return to the Northern village they fled years ago, when an evil sorcerer named Grunwald devas...                    column          8 comments       Pile of Shame - Ai City   2014 Feb 19, 01:00 8 comments                 anime    A sleeper sci-fi film from Koichi Mashimo that might break your brain, but will definitely dazzle your eyes while doing so. ―  Ai City In the opening scenes of Ai City, we are dropped into the middle of a car chase in what is possibly New York City. In the back seat is a former cop, who was fired and is now a private investigator. He doesn't know why he's there, and neither do we. In the front seat a...                    column          14 comments       Pile of Shame - Natsuki Crisis   2014 Feb  5, 01:00 14 comments                 anime    A fun two-part girls-fighting-in-high-school OAV that doesn't take itself too seriously... until it does. ―  Natsuki Crisis When we first meet Kitsumi Natsuki, she's in her school dojo, gleefully trying to find a sparring partner. The rest of the team is all guys, but they don't stand a chance against the tomboy, and politely bow out. In addition to being fearfullly strong, Natsuki is also the protog...                    column          13 comments       Pile of Shame - Seven Cities Story   2014 Jan 22, 01:00 13 comments                 anime    A two-part OAV that tries to transplant Legend of Galactic Heroes onto a sideways-rotated Earth, and succeeds only in being dull and confusing. ―  Seven Cities Story One day, with no warning, the Earth's polar axis shifts 90 degrees, shaking up human civilization like an Etch-A-Sketch and killing everybody. Luckily by this time, humanity had a pretty decent settlement going on the moon, and once thin...                    column          23 comments       Pile of Shame - After School Tinker Bell   2014 Jan  8, 01:00 23 comments                 anime    This week, an OAV based on a light novel series about a romantic couple that solves mysteries around their school. ―  After School Tinker Bell In the last few years there have been a ton of anime adapted from light novels: those small, pulpy, simply written and easy-to-read populist books that lie somewhere between young adult novels and manga. But light novels have been around for a very long time, ...                    column          12 comments       Pile of Shame - Handsome Girl   2013 Dec 25, 01:00 12 comments                 anime    Justin revisits an old one-shot OAV by the creator of Marmalade Boy... and is a little underwhelmed. ―  Handsome Girl When I was in high school, I loved the show Marmalade Boy. A lot. In fact, I wrote an article about it! A perfectly addictive confectionary of chaste teenaged yearning and romance, and undiluted raw crippling angst, I lost many an evening to the adventures of the lovelorn protagonists...                    column          11 comments       Pile of Shame - The Sensualist   2013 Dec 11, 02:10 11 comments                 anime    This week, a unique erotic historical fiction film that has completely slipped through the cracks. ―  The Sensualist (A.K.A. The Life of an Amorous Man) I first saw The Sensualist as a fuzzy VHS tape when I was a teenager. While it's ostensibly an adult work, it never seemed lurid or arousing to me. Rather, it held this strange transcendent beauty. It felt like a piece of another person's life, so fo...                    column          16 comments       Pile of Shame - Emblem Take 2   2013 Nov 27, 02:02 16 comments                 anime    This week, a rare yakuza time travel comedy. Perhaps the ONLY yakuza time travel comedy. ―  Emblem Take 2 Yakuza aren't a pleasant topic. Japan's fully-entrenched organized crime families and organizations, and their connections with everything from banking to entertainment to politics show us Japan at its most corrupt and embarrassing. Unless you go looking for trouble in Tokyo, it's unlikely that a...                    column          17 comments       Pile of Shame: Ai Monogatari: 9 Love Stories   2013 Nov 13, 01:13 17 comments                 anime    Trying to watch this OAV like biting into a large wad of wet cotton: it's not offensive or unpleasant, but you want to end the experience as fast as humanly possible. ―  Ai Monogatari: 9 Love Stories If there's anything that anime lacks, it's real, adult love stories. We have enough yearning, angsty teen romance to sink a battleship, but realistic love stories about people whose frontal lobes are fir...                    column          23 comments       Pile of Shame - Wanna-Be's   2013 Oct 30, 00:01 23 comments     Did anyone say ""I want more women's wrestling anime?"" .... No? Didn't think so. ―  Wanna-Be's Lately there's been a lot of chatter about the girls' wrestling TV series, Wanna Be The Strongest In The World. Given that virtually none of the chatter is positive, I'm not really making plans to check out the show for myself. But hearing about a mediocre girls' wresting anime did jog my memory about anothe...                    column          5 comments       Pile of Shame - Grandeek: The Alternative   2013 Sep 18, 00:56 5 comments                 anime    An early digipaint OAV that has a lot of potential, but is so awkwardly made that the storytelling really suffers. ―  Grandeek: The Alternative When visiting Japan, one of my favorite things to do is explore the DVD sections of every Book Off location I can find. Usually I can identify and easily dismiss pretty much everything on the shelf, but every once in a while I happen upon something that I hav...                    column          17 comments       Pile of Shame - Butt Attack Punisher Girl Gautaman   2013 Sep  4, 00:00 17 comments                 anime                manga    It could've been offensive, bawdy, witty and hilarious. Instead, it's just sort of lazy and crappy. ―  Butt Attack Punisher Girl Gautaman One thing you can say about Butt Attack Girl Punisher Gautaman (and its sequel OAV, Butt Attack Punisher Girl Gautaman R), you know pretty much exactly what you're getting: a cut-rate early-90s dirty comedy OAV about a girl that beats dudes down with her butt.

I mean that honestly. There was a time not long ago, even in otaku circles, when the idea of incest was odd and outré enough to elicit giggles from the less mature parts of ourselves, and maybe even an ""oh god.""

I believe I laughed and said, ""Oh, Japan."" Because really, what other response i...                    column          22 comments       Pile of Shame - Kenya Boy   2013 Jul 24, 01:00 22 comments                 anime    Adjectives fail Justin has he tries to describe the absolute insanity contained in a 1984 feature film retelling of a popular 1950s manga series. ― One of the benefits to writing a column on obscure anime for so long is that occasionally friends hand you things that they think would inspire a good column.

I mean that honestly.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Dawn of the Witch   Apr  8th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Dawn of the Witch ?                     Community score: 3.6              What is this?   The world is now at peace after having endured a conflict between the church and witches for 500 years. However, embers of war still burn in some regions of the world. Cervil is a hopeless student at the Kingdom of Wenias' College of Magic. Cervil has somehow lost all memory of his time before attending the college. The school's headmaster Albus sends him for special training to the southern part of the continent, where persecution against witches runs strong.    The Dawn of the Witch is based on Kakeru Kobashiri's light novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Dawn of the Witch did not make the best first impression on me. We're deep into premiere season, it's late, I'm tired, etc, and I'm out of patience for shows that introduces its female characters either thighs/crotch first or tits first. I have zero familiarity with Grimoire of Zero, and while this is a standalone spinoff, I definitely got the nagging feeling I was supposed to be familiar with at least a few of these faces.    Once I was ready to forgive the show its trespasses, I did actually find a lot to draw me in. The story starts at a magic academy in a region where magic is accepted, thanks to the end of a war several centuries ago. However, since there are still places where mages are treated as other, the academy's best student, worst student, and a 300-year-old witch with the body of a ten-year-old and garter-clad thighs are going on what boils down to a humanitarian mission to build a safe home for them. Oh, and Saybil, the worst student, needs this mission to be successful, or else he'll lose what memories he's accumulated since developing amnesia three years ago.    It's a decent sentiment with a good heart, and I was surprised by a clunky-but-well-intentioned moment when Saybil called his travel companion out on her microaggressions against their beastfallen classmate. And yet, it just doesn't quite gel. Not because the fan service was particularly obtrusive—other than those crotch-first and boob-first intros, it was actually quite low-key—but because there's just no chemistry between the characters. There was a lot of walking and talking, camping and talking, and so on, and I just wasn't having fun watching them banter. There wasn't much sense of a connection and any playfulness felt forced.    Maybe someone who already knows and likes Grimoire of Zero will get more out of Dawn of the Witch. For me, it feels like wasted potential.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                While I've never felt the need to go back and rewatch the Grimoire of Zero, I do have fond memories of the little witch and her giant teddy bear of a mercenary. So returning to this world, with or without Zero in the drivers seat, is a lot of fun. There are a lot of familiar faces (it's great to see Albus all grown up) and it's interesting to see how everything has progressed since the last time we were here.    As fun as all the connections are, the basic story is perfectly understandable even if you've never seen Grimoire of Zero. Our viewpoint character, Saybil, is an amnesic magic student (though, in a twist on the trope, the memory loss happened three years previously). His personal conflict is simple: he's the school's worst mage and if he can't improve he'll be kicked out of the academy. If this happens, his knowledge of magic will be erased from his mind—basically reverting him right back to his post-amnesia state.    Then we have the titular Dawn Witch herself, a 300-year-old with the body of a little girl. While I could do without the constant panty shots, she is an intriguing character. Though egotistical and entitled, she seems to have the wisdom to match. Her connection to her staff is likewise interesting—as is everyone's reactions to how she uses a witch-killing weapon for everyday menial tasks.    The only issue I had with the show is that it really needs to lay out some of its proper nouns and a bit more of its history. While terms like “mage” and “witch” are thrown about, we don't get any clear answer on the difference between them (if any exists). And while we know there was a war between witches and the church, a bit more of the specifics would help us understand the trouble our heroes have already found themselves in with the Witch Hunters. But, all in all, this episode lays some solid ground work and makes me want to see not only what is to come for Sable and Loux but how Zero is connected to everything as well.      James Beckett  Rating:                I feel a little embarrassed, because it wasn't more than a week ago that I suddenly found myself thinking, “Man, remember Grimoire of Zero?” I hadn't thought about the show in years, not since I reviewed it, but for some reason I found myself feeling ever so slightly nostalgic for the flawed but fun fantasy adventure. “I wonder whatever happened to that big ol' cat-man and his tiny witch girlfriend?” And yet, I was completely unaware going into Dawn of the Witch that this was actually a sequel to Grimoire of Zero, and it took me a minute to even realize it. I must have zoned out a little during the OP, since Zero and Mercenary make very clear and obvious appearances in it, but it was right around the part where a wolf-man named Holdem was yelling about a woman named Albus that I started to connect the dots.    Dawn of the Witch is a really direct sequel, as it turns out, despite jumping ahead a number of years in the timeline, not to mention the major shakeup in visual style on account of the new production team. I had to go back to watch the end of GoZ to refresh my memory, but that series does indeed end with young Albus starting up a brand-new magic academy in Wenias, and promising to build a world where witches and humans can live in peace. At the start of Dawn of the Witch, it seems like she's making headway on that goal, too, though there's still a long way to go. This is what gets our four main characters started on their journey, and it's also where my issues with Dawn of the Witch really take hold.    While it was surprisingly fun to catch up with this universe and see what's become of some of the characters since Grimoire ended, this premiere just doesn't do a great job of getting me to give a damn about its own story and cast. Saybil is a total nothing of a protagonist, and Loux is the grating and unlikable inverse of Zero. It doesn't help that the camera goes out of its way to zoom in on her crotch with absolutely no shame, or even a sense of proper framing. Holt and Kudo are barely developed outside of the fact that Holt is very busty and flirtatious with Saybil, which is odd considering that Saybil has no discernable personality whatsoever. Kudo is…a lizard. That's about it.    Nobody will ever mistake Grimoire of Zero for great television, and it says something that I went nearly five years before remembering that I spent a whole season watching and reviewing the show, but it was a decent fantasy anime all things considered. Dawn of the Witch hasn't elicited any reaction from me whatsoever, which is a very poor place for a series premiere to find itself in. Maybe the show will pick up once the new cast finds its footing, or if Zero and Mercenary return to liven up the proceedings. If that isn't the case, though, then Dawn of the Witch seems destined to be overshadowed by its older sibling, and it isn't like GoZ cast all that large of a shadow in the first place.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                If you weren't aware, The Dawn of the Witch is set in the same world as Grimoire of Zero, although I don't think that's any impediment to just jumping in here. There are probably some world-building elements that work better if you're familiar with Grimoire of Zero, and that particular book does get a mention in this episode, but it's otherwise a pretty standard sword-and-sorcery setup, with beastpeople (known as beastfallen), magic users, witch hunters, and a vaguely Medieval sensibility. Well, and there's the headmaster of a magic school named Albus, but maybe we won't dwell on that.    This episode suffers most from two things: being very much about setting the stage for the more interesting things to come and Loux being kind of annoying. Loux could be Beatrice's cousin from Re: Zero in some ways, and I do think the choice to use the archaic informal second person (thee/thou/thy) largely works for her attitude of superiority. She's absolutely the kind of person who would deliberately speak informally to everyone just to show that she considers herself above them, something that Hort and Saybil notice when she leaves them behind to go chase witch hunters. But she's the sort of character who could wear with length of use, which could be an issue if she's got too much time in the spotlight.    The fact that Loux is also used for the bottom half of the fanservice may also rub some people the wrong way. We get plenty of shots of her crotch as she sits with her legs splayed, which is mostly noticeable because of how ridiculous her skirt's design is. Hort takes over the top half of the fanservice with her shirt that's patterned so that her breasts look like a wrapped present, and it is kind of amusing how obviously the art is trying to have it all by the way Hort is always shown boobs-first while Loux is shown thighs-first. Mostly the issue is that Loux, despite being 300 years old, looks pretty darn prepubescent, because really, she can sit however is most comfortable for her. Not that Saybil notices any of this, being about as blank a slate as you can get and having no discernable personality whatsoever. It's frankly the least believable part of the episode that Hort likes him so much.    Mostly this episode just sort of exists. There are some hints that the story could improve once the tedious set up is finished, so this probably isn't one to just write off immediately. But on the other hand, Goodreads assures me that I've read the first volume of the manga version and I can't remember a darn thing about it. Make of that what you will.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               This show exists in a weird bit of adaptation limbo. It's based on a series of light novels that are themselves a sequel to the Grimoire of Zero novel series. I'm one of the 10 people who watched and still vaguely remember the 2017 Grimoire anime, but that show only covered the first couple volumes of a much longer story. So while I recognize some returning characters and understand the basic makeup of this particular fantasy world, I could not tell you how we got from the adventures of Tony the Tiger and his pint-sized witch gremlin to this new status quo. The good news is this is largely a new story, and anything immediately important is explained pretty quickly in this episode, so newcomers and non-LN readers alike should be able to follow along. The bad news is that doesn't make this episode any more interesting or entertaining.    The big issue with this new series is that it's centered on, by far, its least engaging character. Saybil's amnesia and mysterious past are supposed to entice you to learn more about him, but in practice he's a dead-eyed cipher who intakes exposition and outputs nothing of interest. Nearly any other character introduced here would be more engaging to follow as a protagonist, with the possible exception of the titular Witch of the Dawn, Loux. On top of being a 300-year-old little girl who can't stop flashing her panties to the camera, she's just an annoying presence who's only tolerable when she's acting her age instead of playing up her miniscule appearance. So the thought of watching her mentor our deadweight lead is deathly unappealing. That stands in stark contrast to Mercenary and Zero's dynamic in the first series, and it makes me question why these two are our leads when there's some perfectly engaging characters right next to them.    Maybe that's just because we barely get any time with Holt or Kudo so they don't have a chance to disappoint us, but just on the surface they both strike me as way more active, layered characters to build your story around. Holt is a star magic pupil who seemingly comes from a harsh background where she learned to put on a kind smile to avoid confrontation, which raises questions about her past that actually make her more interesting, unlike Saybil. Kudo, meanwhile, is a rough-mannered beast-man who nonetheless has a strong sense of justice and acts selflessly in his own way. Hell, just in this episode it's brought up that witches used to sacrifice beast-people, so the idea of one studying magic to become a witch is a rock-solid concept that all but begs for further exploration. Why, then, is his entire story this episode offscreen? Is has to be more interesting than watching our amnesiac sadboi hero vomit on a cart ride.    That's what really makes this premiere frustrating, on its own and as a follow-up to Grimoire of Zero. I know there's an interesting fantasy world behind all this, with a rich history just waiting to be explored, and presumably even more new things that have happened since the first anime wrapped up. If this were just some generic isekai world I could write it off as a dull waste of time and be done, but there's so much potential here that is just being left to rot. I might stick around for another episode or two, just to see if the elements I liked get some actual focus, but I can't give this much of a recommendation right now.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review          1 comment       Hello, Melancholic!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Dawn of the Witch   Apr  8th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Dawn of the Witch ?                     Community score: 3.6              What is this?   The world is now at peace after having endured a conflict between the church and witches for 500 years. However, embers of war still burn in some regions of the world. Cervil is a hopeless student at the Kingdom of Wenias' College of Magic. Cervil has somehow lost all memory of his time before attending the college. The school's headmaster Albus sends him for special training to the southern part of the continent, where persecution against witches runs strong.    The Dawn of the Witch is based on Kakeru Kobashiri's light novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Dawn of the Witch did not make the best first impression on me. We're deep into premiere season, it's late, I'm tired, etc, and I'm out of patience for shows that introduces its female characters either thighs/crotch first or tits first. I have zero familiarity with Grimoire of Zero, and while this is a standalone spinoff, I definitely got the nagging feeling I was supposed to be familiar with at least a few of these faces.    Once I was ready to forgive the show its trespasses, I did actually find a lot to draw me in. The story starts at a magic academy in a region where magic is accepted, thanks to the end of a war several centuries ago. However, since there are still places where mages are treated as other, the academy's best student, worst student, and a 300-year-old witch with the body of a ten-year-old and garter-clad thighs are going on what boils down to a humanitarian mission to build a safe home for them. Oh, and Saybil, the worst student, needs this mission to be successful, or else he'll lose what memories he's accumulated since developing amnesia three years ago.    It's a decent sentiment with a good heart, and I was surprised by a clunky-but-well-intentioned moment when Saybil called his travel companion out on her microaggressions against their beastfallen classmate. And yet, it just doesn't quite gel. Not because the fan service was particularly obtrusive—other than those crotch-first and boob-first intros, it was actually quite low-key—but because there's just no chemistry between the characters. There was a lot of walking and talking, camping and talking, and so on, and I just wasn't having fun watching them banter. There wasn't much sense of a connection and any playfulness felt forced.    Maybe someone who already knows and likes Grimoire of Zero will get more out of Dawn of the Witch. For me, it feels like wasted potential.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                While I've never felt the need to go back and rewatch the Grimoire of Zero, I do have fond memories of the little witch and her giant teddy bear of a mercenary. So returning to this world, with or without Zero in the drivers seat, is a lot of fun. There are a lot of familiar faces (it's great to see Albus all grown up) and it's interesting to see how everything has progressed since the last time we were here.    As fun as all the connections are, the basic story is perfectly understandable even if you've never seen Grimoire of Zero. Our viewpoint character, Saybil, is an amnesic magic student (though, in a twist on the trope, the memory loss happened three years previously). His personal conflict is simple: he's the school's worst mage and if he can't improve he'll be kicked out of the academy. If this happens, his knowledge of magic will be erased from his mind—basically reverting him right back to his post-amnesia state.    Then we have the titular Dawn Witch herself, a 300-year-old with the body of a little girl. While I could do without the constant panty shots, she is an intriguing character. Though egotistical and entitled, she seems to have the wisdom to match. Her connection to her staff is likewise interesting—as is everyone's reactions to how she uses a witch-killing weapon for everyday menial tasks.    The only issue I had with the show is that it really needs to lay out some of its proper nouns and a bit more of its history. While terms like “mage” and “witch” are thrown about, we don't get any clear answer on the difference between them (if any exists). And while we know there was a war between witches and the church, a bit more of the specifics would help us understand the trouble our heroes have already found themselves in with the Witch Hunters. But, all in all, this episode lays some solid ground work and makes me want to see not only what is to come for Sable and Loux but how Zero is connected to everything as well.      James Beckett  Rating:                I feel a little embarrassed, because it wasn't more than a week ago that I suddenly found myself thinking, “Man, remember Grimoire of Zero?” I hadn't thought about the show in years, not since I reviewed it, but for some reason I found myself feeling ever so slightly nostalgic for the flawed but fun fantasy adventure. “I wonder whatever happened to that big ol' cat-man and his tiny witch girlfriend?” And yet, I was completely unaware going into Dawn of the Witch that this was actually a sequel to Grimoire of Zero, and it took me a minute to even realize it. I must have zoned out a little during the OP, since Zero and Mercenary make very clear and obvious appearances in it, but it was right around the part where a wolf-man named Holdem was yelling about a woman named Albus that I started to connect the dots.    Dawn of the Witch is a really direct sequel, as it turns out, despite jumping ahead a number of years in the timeline, not to mention the major shakeup in visual style on account of the new production team. I had to go back to watch the end of GoZ to refresh my memory, but that series does indeed end with young Albus starting up a brand-new magic academy in Wenias, and promising to build a world where witches and humans can live in peace. At the start of Dawn of the Witch, it seems like she's making headway on that goal, too, though there's still a long way to go. This is what gets our four main characters started on their journey, and it's also where my issues with Dawn of the Witch really take hold.    While it was surprisingly fun to catch up with this universe and see what's become of some of the characters since Grimoire ended, this premiere just doesn't do a great job of getting me to give a damn about its own story and cast. Saybil is a total nothing of a protagonist, and Loux is the grating and unlikable inverse of Zero. It doesn't help that the camera goes out of its way to zoom in on her crotch with absolutely no shame, or even a sense of proper framing. Holt and Kudo are barely developed outside of the fact that Holt is very busty and flirtatious with Saybil, which is odd considering that Saybil has no discernable personality whatsoever. Kudo is…a lizard. That's about it.    Nobody will ever mistake Grimoire of Zero for great television, and it says something that I went nearly five years before remembering that I spent a whole season watching and reviewing the show, but it was a decent fantasy anime all things considered. Dawn of the Witch hasn't elicited any reaction from me whatsoever, which is a very poor place for a series premiere to find itself in. Maybe the show will pick up once the new cast finds its footing, or if Zero and Mercenary return to liven up the proceedings. If that isn't the case, though, then Dawn of the Witch seems destined to be overshadowed by its older sibling, and it isn't like GoZ cast all that large of a shadow in the first place.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                If you weren't aware, The Dawn of the Witch is set in the same world as Grimoire of Zero, although I don't think that's any impediment to just jumping in here. There are probably some world-building elements that work better if you're familiar with Grimoire of Zero, and that particular book does get a mention in this episode, but it's otherwise a pretty standard sword-and-sorcery setup, with beastpeople (known as beastfallen), magic users, witch hunters, and a vaguely Medieval sensibility. Well, and there's the headmaster of a magic school named Albus, but maybe we won't dwell on that.    This episode suffers most from two things: being very much about setting the stage for the more interesting things to come and Loux being kind of annoying. Loux could be Beatrice's cousin from Re: Zero in some ways, and I do think the choice to use the archaic informal second person (thee/thou/thy) largely works for her attitude of superiority. She's absolutely the kind of person who would deliberately speak informally to everyone just to show that she considers herself above them, something that Hort and Saybil notice when she leaves them behind to go chase witch hunters. But she's the sort of character who could wear with length of use, which could be an issue if she's got too much time in the spotlight.    The fact that Loux is also used for the bottom half of the fanservice may also rub some people the wrong way. We get plenty of shots of her crotch as she sits with her legs splayed, which is mostly noticeable because of how ridiculous her skirt's design is. Hort takes over the top half of the fanservice with her shirt that's patterned so that her breasts look like a wrapped present, and it is kind of amusing how obviously the art is trying to have it all by the way Hort is always shown boobs-first while Loux is shown thighs-first. Mostly the issue is that Loux, despite being 300 years old, looks pretty darn prepubescent, because really, she can sit however is most comfortable for her. Not that Saybil notices any of this, being about as blank a slate as you can get and having no discernable personality whatsoever. It's frankly the least believable part of the episode that Hort likes him so much.    Mostly this episode just sort of exists. There are some hints that the story could improve once the tedious set up is finished, so this probably isn't one to just write off immediately. But on the other hand, Goodreads assures me that I've read the first volume of the manga version and I can't remember a darn thing about it. Make of that what you will.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               This show exists in a weird bit of adaptation limbo. It's based on a series of light novels that are themselves a sequel to the Grimoire of Zero novel series. I'm one of the 10 people who watched and still vaguely remember the 2017 Grimoire anime, but that show only covered the first couple volumes of a much longer story. So while I recognize some returning characters and understand the basic makeup of this particular fantasy world, I could not tell you how we got from the adventures of Tony the Tiger and his pint-sized witch gremlin to this new status quo. The good news is this is largely a new story, and anything immediately important is explained pretty quickly in this episode, so newcomers and non-LN readers alike should be able to follow along. The bad news is that doesn't make this episode any more interesting or entertaining.    The big issue with this new series is that it's centered on, by far, its least engaging character. Saybil's amnesia and mysterious past are supposed to entice you to learn more about him, but in practice he's a dead-eyed cipher who intakes exposition and outputs nothing of interest. Nearly any other character introduced here would be more engaging to follow as a protagonist, with the possible exception of the titular Witch of the Dawn, Loux. On top of being a 300-year-old little girl who can't stop flashing her panties to the camera, she's just an annoying presence who's only tolerable when she's acting her age instead of playing up her miniscule appearance. So the thought of watching her mentor our deadweight lead is deathly unappealing. That stands in stark contrast to Mercenary and Zero's dynamic in the first series, and it makes me question why these two are our leads when there's some perfectly engaging characters right next to them.    Maybe that's just because we barely get any time with Holt or Kudo so they don't have a chance to disappoint us, but just on the surface they both strike me as way more active, layered characters to build your story around. Holt is a star magic pupil who seemingly comes from a harsh background where she learned to put on a kind smile to avoid confrontation, which raises questions about her past that actually make her more interesting, unlike Saybil. Kudo, meanwhile, is a rough-mannered beast-man who nonetheless has a strong sense of justice and acts selflessly in his own way. Hell, just in this episode it's brought up that witches used to sacrifice beast-people, so the idea of one studying magic to become a witch is a rock-solid concept that all but begs for further exploration. Why, then, is his entire story this episode offscreen? Is has to be more interesting than watching our amnesiac sadboi hero vomit on a cart ride.    That's what really makes this premiere frustrating, on its own and as a follow-up to Grimoire of Zero. I know there's an interesting fantasy world behind all this, with a rich history just waiting to be explored, and presumably even more new things that have happened since the first anime wrapped up. If this were just some generic isekai world I could write it off as a dull waste of time and be done, but there's so much potential here that is just being left to rot. I might stick around for another episode or two, just to see if the elements I liked get some actual focus, but I can't give this much of a recommendation right now.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review          1 comment       Hello, Melancholic!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Dawn of the Witch   Apr  8th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Dawn of the Witch ?                     Community score: 3.6              What is this?   The world is now at peace after having endured a conflict between the church and witches for 500 years. However, embers of war still burn in some regions of the world. Cervil is a hopeless student at the Kingdom of Wenias' College of Magic. Cervil has somehow lost all memory of his time before attending the college. The school's headmaster Albus sends him for special training to the southern part of the continent, where persecution against witches runs strong.    The Dawn of the Witch is based on Kakeru Kobashiri's light novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Dawn of the Witch did not make the best first impression on me. We're deep into premiere season, it's late, I'm tired, etc, and I'm out of patience for shows that introduces its female characters either thighs/crotch first or tits first. I have zero familiarity with Grimoire of Zero, and while this is a standalone spinoff, I definitely got the nagging feeling I was supposed to be familiar with at least a few of these faces.    Once I was ready to forgive the show its trespasses, I did actually find a lot to draw me in. The story starts at a magic academy in a region where magic is accepted, thanks to the end of a war several centuries ago. However, since there are still places where mages are treated as other, the academy's best student, worst student, and a 300-year-old witch with the body of a ten-year-old and garter-clad thighs are going on what boils down to a humanitarian mission to build a safe home for them. Oh, and Saybil, the worst student, needs this mission to be successful, or else he'll lose what memories he's accumulated since developing amnesia three years ago.    It's a decent sentiment with a good heart, and I was surprised by a clunky-but-well-intentioned moment when Saybil called his travel companion out on her microaggressions against their beastfallen classmate. And yet, it just doesn't quite gel. Not because the fan service was particularly obtrusive—other than those crotch-first and boob-first intros, it was actually quite low-key—but because there's just no chemistry between the characters. There was a lot of walking and talking, camping and talking, and so on, and I just wasn't having fun watching them banter. There wasn't much sense of a connection and any playfulness felt forced.    Maybe someone who already knows and likes Grimoire of Zero will get more out of Dawn of the Witch. For me, it feels like wasted potential.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                While I've never felt the need to go back and rewatch the Grimoire of Zero, I do have fond memories of the little witch and her giant teddy bear of a mercenary. So returning to this world, with or without Zero in the drivers seat, is a lot of fun. There are a lot of familiar faces (it's great to see Albus all grown up) and it's interesting to see how everything has progressed since the last time we were here.    As fun as all the connections are, the basic story is perfectly understandable even if you've never seen Grimoire of Zero. Our viewpoint character, Saybil, is an amnesic magic student (though, in a twist on the trope, the memory loss happened three years previously). His personal conflict is simple: he's the school's worst mage and if he can't improve he'll be kicked out of the academy. If this happens, his knowledge of magic will be erased from his mind—basically reverting him right back to his post-amnesia state.    Then we have the titular Dawn Witch herself, a 300-year-old with the body of a little girl. While I could do without the constant panty shots, she is an intriguing character. Though egotistical and entitled, she seems to have the wisdom to match. Her connection to her staff is likewise interesting—as is everyone's reactions to how she uses a witch-killing weapon for everyday menial tasks.    The only issue I had with the show is that it really needs to lay out some of its proper nouns and a bit more of its history. While terms like “mage” and “witch” are thrown about, we don't get any clear answer on the difference between them (if any exists). And while we know there was a war between witches and the church, a bit more of the specifics would help us understand the trouble our heroes have already found themselves in with the Witch Hunters. But, all in all, this episode lays some solid ground work and makes me want to see not only what is to come for Sable and Loux but how Zero is connected to everything as well.      James Beckett  Rating:                I feel a little embarrassed, because it wasn't more than a week ago that I suddenly found myself thinking, “Man, remember Grimoire of Zero?” I hadn't thought about the show in years, not since I reviewed it, but for some reason I found myself feeling ever so slightly nostalgic for the flawed but fun fantasy adventure. “I wonder whatever happened to that big ol' cat-man and his tiny witch girlfriend?” And yet, I was completely unaware going into Dawn of the Witch that this was actually a sequel to Grimoire of Zero, and it took me a minute to even realize it. I must have zoned out a little during the OP, since Zero and Mercenary make very clear and obvious appearances in it, but it was right around the part where a wolf-man named Holdem was yelling about a woman named Albus that I started to connect the dots.    Dawn of the Witch is a really direct sequel, as it turns out, despite jumping ahead a number of years in the timeline, not to mention the major shakeup in visual style on account of the new production team. I had to go back to watch the end of GoZ to refresh my memory, but that series does indeed end with young Albus starting up a brand-new magic academy in Wenias, and promising to build a world where witches and humans can live in peace. At the start of Dawn of the Witch, it seems like she's making headway on that goal, too, though there's still a long way to go. This is what gets our four main characters started on their journey, and it's also where my issues with Dawn of the Witch really take hold.    While it was surprisingly fun to catch up with this universe and see what's become of some of the characters since Grimoire ended, this premiere just doesn't do a great job of getting me to give a damn about its own story and cast. Saybil is a total nothing of a protagonist, and Loux is the grating and unlikable inverse of Zero. It doesn't help that the camera goes out of its way to zoom in on her crotch with absolutely no shame, or even a sense of proper framing. Holt and Kudo are barely developed outside of the fact that Holt is very busty and flirtatious with Saybil, which is odd considering that Saybil has no discernable personality whatsoever. Kudo is…a lizard. That's about it.    Nobody will ever mistake Grimoire of Zero for great television, and it says something that I went nearly five years before remembering that I spent a whole season watching and reviewing the show, but it was a decent fantasy anime all things considered. Dawn of the Witch hasn't elicited any reaction from me whatsoever, which is a very poor place for a series premiere to find itself in. Maybe the show will pick up once the new cast finds its footing, or if Zero and Mercenary return to liven up the proceedings. If that isn't the case, though, then Dawn of the Witch seems destined to be overshadowed by its older sibling, and it isn't like GoZ cast all that large of a shadow in the first place.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                If you weren't aware, The Dawn of the Witch is set in the same world as Grimoire of Zero, although I don't think that's any impediment to just jumping in here. There are probably some world-building elements that work better if you're familiar with Grimoire of Zero, and that particular book does get a mention in this episode, but it's otherwise a pretty standard sword-and-sorcery setup, with beastpeople (known as beastfallen), magic users, witch hunters, and a vaguely Medieval sensibility. Well, and there's the headmaster of a magic school named Albus, but maybe we won't dwell on that.    This episode suffers most from two things: being very much about setting the stage for the more interesting things to come and Loux being kind of annoying. Loux could be Beatrice's cousin from Re: Zero in some ways, and I do think the choice to use the archaic informal second person (thee/thou/thy) largely works for her attitude of superiority. She's absolutely the kind of person who would deliberately speak informally to everyone just to show that she considers herself above them, something that Hort and Saybil notice when she leaves them behind to go chase witch hunters. But she's the sort of character who could wear with length of use, which could be an issue if she's got too much time in the spotlight.    The fact that Loux is also used for the bottom half of the fanservice may also rub some people the wrong way. We get plenty of shots of her crotch as she sits with her legs splayed, which is mostly noticeable because of how ridiculous her skirt's design is. Hort takes over the top half of the fanservice with her shirt that's patterned so that her breasts look like a wrapped present, and it is kind of amusing how obviously the art is trying to have it all by the way Hort is always shown boobs-first while Loux is shown thighs-first. Mostly the issue is that Loux, despite being 300 years old, looks pretty darn prepubescent, because really, she can sit however is most comfortable for her. Not that Saybil notices any of this, being about as blank a slate as you can get and having no discernable personality whatsoever. It's frankly the least believable part of the episode that Hort likes him so much.    Mostly this episode just sort of exists. There are some hints that the story could improve once the tedious set up is finished, so this probably isn't one to just write off immediately. But on the other hand, Goodreads assures me that I've read the first volume of the manga version and I can't remember a darn thing about it. Make of that what you will.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               This show exists in a weird bit of adaptation limbo. It's based on a series of light novels that are themselves a sequel to the Grimoire of Zero novel series. I'm one of the 10 people who watched and still vaguely remember the 2017 Grimoire anime, but that show only covered the first couple volumes of a much longer story. So while I recognize some returning characters and understand the basic makeup of this particular fantasy world, I could not tell you how we got from the adventures of Tony the Tiger and his pint-sized witch gremlin to this new status quo. The good news is this is largely a new story, and anything immediately important is explained pretty quickly in this episode, so newcomers and non-LN readers alike should be able to follow along. The bad news is that doesn't make this episode any more interesting or entertaining.    The big issue with this new series is that it's centered on, by far, its least engaging character. Saybil's amnesia and mysterious past are supposed to entice you to learn more about him, but in practice he's a dead-eyed cipher who intakes exposition and outputs nothing of interest. Nearly any other character introduced here would be more engaging to follow as a protagonist, with the possible exception of the titular Witch of the Dawn, Loux. On top of being a 300-year-old little girl who can't stop flashing her panties to the camera, she's just an annoying presence who's only tolerable when she's acting her age instead of playing up her miniscule appearance. So the thought of watching her mentor our deadweight lead is deathly unappealing. That stands in stark contrast to Mercenary and Zero's dynamic in the first series, and it makes me question why these two are our leads when there's some perfectly engaging characters right next to them.    Maybe that's just because we barely get any time with Holt or Kudo so they don't have a chance to disappoint us, but just on the surface they both strike me as way more active, layered characters to build your story around. Holt is a star magic pupil who seemingly comes from a harsh background where she learned to put on a kind smile to avoid confrontation, which raises questions about her past that actually make her more interesting, unlike Saybil. Kudo, meanwhile, is a rough-mannered beast-man who nonetheless has a strong sense of justice and acts selflessly in his own way. Hell, just in this episode it's brought up that witches used to sacrifice beast-people, so the idea of one studying magic to become a witch is a rock-solid concept that all but begs for further exploration. Why, then, is his entire story this episode offscreen? Is has to be more interesting than watching our amnesiac sadboi hero vomit on a cart ride.    That's what really makes this premiere frustrating, on its own and as a follow-up to Grimoire of Zero. I know there's an interesting fantasy world behind all this, with a rich history just waiting to be explored, and presumably even more new things that have happened since the first anime wrapped up. If this were just some generic isekai world I could write it off as a dull waste of time and be done, but there's so much potential here that is just being left to rot. I might stick around for another episode or two, just to see if the elements I liked get some actual focus, but I can't give this much of a recommendation right now.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review          1 comment       Hello, Melancholic!

However, since there are still places where mages are treated as other, the academy's best student, worst student, and a 300-year-old witch with the body of a ten-year-old and garter-clad thighs are going on what boils down to a humanitarian mission to build a safe home for them. Oh, and Saybil, the worst student, needs this mission to be successful, or else he'll lose what memories he's accumulated since developing amnesia three years ago.    It's a decent sentiment with a good heart, and I was surprised by a clunky-but-well-intentioned moment when Saybil called his travel companion out on her microaggressions against their beastfallen classmate. And yet, it just doesn't quite gel. Not because the fan service was particularly obtrusive—other than those crotch-first and boob-first intros, it was actually quite low-key—but because there's just no chemistry between the characters. There was a lot of walking and talking, camping and talking, and so on, and I just wasn't having fun watching them banter. There wasn't much sense of a connection and any playfulness felt forced.    Maybe someone who already knows and likes Grimoire of Zero will get more out of Dawn of the Witch. For me, it feels like wasted potential.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                While I've never felt the need to go back and rewatch the Grimoire of Zero, I do have fond memories of the little witch and her giant teddy bear of a mercenary. So returning to this world, with or without Zero in the drivers seat, is a lot of fun. There are a lot of familiar faces (it's great to see Albus all grown up) and it's interesting to see how everything has progressed since the last time we were here.    As fun as all the connections are, the basic story is perfectly understandable even if you've never seen Grimoire of Zero. Our viewpoint character, Saybil, is an amnesic magic student (though, in a twist on the trope, the memory loss happened three years previously). His personal conflict is simple: he's the school's worst mage and if he can't improve he'll be kicked out of the academy. If this happens, his knowledge of magic will be erased from his mind—basically reverting him right back to his post-amnesia state.    Then we have the titular Dawn Witch herself, a 300-year-old with the body of a little girl. While I could do without the constant panty shots, she is an intriguing character. Though egotistical and entitled, she seems to have the wisdom to match. Her connection to her staff is likewise interesting—as is everyone's reactions to how she uses a witch-killing weapon for everyday menial tasks.    The only issue I had with the show is that it really needs to lay out some of its proper nouns and a bit more of its history. While terms like “mage” and “witch” are thrown about, we don't get any clear answer on the difference between them (if any exists). And while we know there was a war between witches and the church, a bit more of the specifics would help us understand the trouble our heroes have already found themselves in with the Witch Hunters. But, all in all, this episode lays some solid ground work and makes me want to see not only what is to come for Sable and Loux but how Zero is connected to everything as well.      James Beckett  Rating:                I feel a little embarrassed, because it wasn't more than a week ago that I suddenly found myself thinking, “Man, remember Grimoire of Zero?” I hadn't thought about the show in years, not since I reviewed it, but for some reason I found myself feeling ever so slightly nostalgic for the flawed but fun fantasy adventure. “I wonder whatever happened to that big ol' cat-man and his tiny witch girlfriend?” And yet, I was completely unaware going into Dawn of the Witch that this was actually a sequel to Grimoire of Zero, and it took me a minute to even realize it. I must have zoned out a little during the OP, since Zero and Mercenary make very clear and obvious appearances in it, but it was right around the part where a wolf-man named Holdem was yelling about a woman named Albus that I started to connect the dots.    Dawn of the Witch is a really direct sequel, as it turns out, despite jumping ahead a number of years in the timeline, not to mention the major shakeup in visual style on account of the new production team. I had to go back to watch the end of GoZ to refresh my memory, but that series does indeed end with young Albus starting up a brand-new magic academy in Wenias, and promising to build a world where witches and humans can live in peace. At the start of Dawn of the Witch, it seems like she's making headway on that goal, too, though there's still a long way to go. This is what gets our four main characters started on their journey, and it's also where my issues with Dawn of the Witch really take hold.    While it was surprisingly fun to catch up with this universe and see what's become of some of the characters since Grimoire ended, this premiere just doesn't do a great job of getting me to give a damn about its own story and cast. Saybil is a total nothing of a protagonist, and Loux is the grating and unlikable inverse of Zero. It doesn't help that the camera goes out of its way to zoom in on her crotch with absolutely no shame, or even a sense of proper framing. Holt and Kudo are barely developed outside of the fact that Holt is very busty and flirtatious with Saybil, which is odd considering that Saybil has no discernable personality whatsoever. Kudo is…a lizard. That's about it.    Nobody will ever mistake Grimoire of Zero for great television, and it says something that I went nearly five years before remembering that I spent a whole season watching and reviewing the show, but it was a decent fantasy anime all things considered. Dawn of the Witch hasn't elicited any reaction from me whatsoever, which is a very poor place for a series premiere to find itself in. Maybe the show will pick up once the new cast finds its footing, or if Zero and Mercenary return to liven up the proceedings. If that isn't the case, though, then Dawn of the Witch seems destined to be overshadowed by its older sibling, and it isn't like GoZ cast all that large of a shadow in the first place.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                If you weren't aware, The Dawn of the Witch is set in the same world as Grimoire of Zero, although I don't think that's any impediment to just jumping in here. There are probably some world-building elements that work better if you're familiar with Grimoire of Zero, and that particular book does get a mention in this episode, but it's otherwise a pretty standard sword-and-sorcery setup, with beastpeople (known as beastfallen), magic users, witch hunters, and a vaguely Medieval sensibility. Well, and there's the headmaster of a magic school named Albus, but maybe we won't dwell on that.    This episode suffers most from two things: being very much about setting the stage for the more interesting things to come and Loux being kind of annoying. Loux could be Beatrice's cousin from Re: Zero in some ways, and I do think the choice to use the archaic informal second person (thee/thou/thy) largely works for her attitude of superiority. She's absolutely the kind of person who would deliberately speak informally to everyone just to show that she considers herself above them, something that Hort and Saybil notice when she leaves them behind to go chase witch hunters. But she's the sort of character who could wear with length of use, which could be an issue if she's got too much time in the spotlight.    The fact that Loux is also used for the bottom half of the fanservice may also rub some people the wrong way. We get plenty of shots of her crotch as she sits with her legs splayed, which is mostly noticeable because of how ridiculous her skirt's design is. Hort takes over the top half of the fanservice with her shirt that's patterned so that her breasts look like a wrapped present, and it is kind of amusing how obviously the art is trying to have it all by the way Hort is always shown boobs-first while Loux is shown thighs-first. Mostly the issue is that Loux, despite being 300 years old, looks pretty darn prepubescent, because really, she can sit however is most comfortable for her. Not that Saybil notices any of this, being about as blank a slate as you can get and having no discernable personality whatsoever. It's frankly the least believable part of the episode that Hort likes him so much.    Mostly this episode just sort of exists. There are some hints that the story could improve once the tedious set up is finished, so this probably isn't one to just write off immediately. But on the other hand, Goodreads assures me that I've read the first volume of the manga version and I can't remember a darn thing about it. Make of that what you will.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               This show exists in a weird bit of adaptation limbo. It's based on a series of light novels that are themselves a sequel to the Grimoire of Zero novel series. I'm one of the 10 people who watched and still vaguely remember the 2017 Grimoire anime, but that show only covered the first couple volumes of a much longer story. So while I recognize some returning characters and understand the basic makeup of this particular fantasy world, I could not tell you how we got from the adventures of Tony the Tiger and his pint-sized witch gremlin to this new status quo. The good news is this is largely a new story, and anything immediately important is explained pretty quickly in this episode, so newcomers and non-LN readers alike should be able to follow along. The bad news is that doesn't make this episode any more interesting or entertaining.    The big issue with this new series is that it's centered on, by far, its least engaging character. Saybil's amnesia and mysterious past are supposed to entice you to learn more about him, but in practice he's a dead-eyed cipher who intakes exposition and outputs nothing of interest. Nearly any other character introduced here would be more engaging to follow as a protagonist, with the possible exception of the titular Witch of the Dawn, Loux. On top of being a 300-year-old little girl who can't stop flashing her panties to the camera, she's just an annoying presence who's only tolerable when she's acting her age instead of playing up her miniscule appearance. So the thought of watching her mentor our deadweight lead is deathly unappealing. That stands in stark contrast to Mercenary and Zero's dynamic in the first series, and it makes me question why these two are our leads when there's some perfectly engaging characters right next to them.    Maybe that's just because we barely get any time with Holt or Kudo so they don't have a chance to disappoint us, but just on the surface they both strike me as way more active, layered characters to build your story around. Holt is a star magic pupil who seemingly comes from a harsh background where she learned to put on a kind smile to avoid confrontation, which raises questions about her past that actually make her more interesting, unlike Saybil. Kudo, meanwhile, is a rough-mannered beast-man who nonetheless has a strong sense of justice and acts selflessly in his own way. Hell, just in this episode it's brought up that witches used to sacrifice beast-people, so the idea of one studying magic to become a witch is a rock-solid concept that all but begs for further exploration. Why, then, is his entire story this episode offscreen? Is has to be more interesting than watching our amnesiac sadboi hero vomit on a cart ride.    That's what really makes this premiere frustrating, on its own and as a follow-up to Grimoire of Zero. I know there's an interesting fantasy world behind all this, with a rich history just waiting to be explored, and presumably even more new things that have happened since the first anime wrapped up. If this were just some generic isekai world I could write it off as a dull waste of time and be done, but there's so much potential here that is just being left to rot. I might stick around for another episode or two, just to see if the elements I liked get some actual focus, but I can't give this much of a recommendation right now.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            review          1 comment       Hello, Melancholic!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Dawn of the Witch   Apr  8th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Dawn of the Witch ?                     Community score: 3.6              What is this?   The world is now at peace after having endured a conflict between the church and witches for 500 years. However, embers of war still burn in some regions of the world. Cervil is a hopeless student at the Kingdom of Wenias' College of Magic. Cervil has somehow lost all memory of his time before attending the college. The school's headmaster Albus sends him for special training to the southern part of the continent, where persecution against witches runs strong.    The Dawn of the Witch is based on Kakeru Kobashiri's light novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Dawn of the Witch did not make the best first impression on me. We're deep into premiere season, it's late, I'm tired, etc, and I'm out of patience for shows that introduces its female characters either thighs/crotch first or tits first. I have zero familiarity with Grimoire of Zero, and while this is a standalone spinoff, I definitely got the nagging feeling I was supposed to be familiar with at least a few of these faces.    Once I was ready to forgive the show its trespasses, I did actually find a lot to draw me in. The story starts at a magic academy in a region where magic is accepted, thanks to the end of a war several centuries ago. However, since there are still places where mages are treated as other, the academy's best student, worst student, and a 300-year-old witch with the body of a ten-year-old and garter-clad thighs are going on what boils down to a humanitarian mission to build a safe home for them. Oh, and Saybil, the worst student, needs this mission to be successful, or else he'll lose what memories he's accumulated since developing amnesia three years ago.    It's a decent sentiment with a good heart, and I was surprised by a clunky-but-well-intentioned moment when Saybil called his travel companion out on her microaggressions against their beastfallen classmate. And yet, it just doesn't quite gel. Not because the fan service was particularly obtrusive—other than those crotch-first and boob-first intros, it was actually quite low-key—but because there's just no chemistry between the characters. There was a lot of walking and talking, camping and talking, and so on, and I just wasn't having fun watching them banter. There wasn't much sense of a connection and any playfulness felt forced.    Maybe someone who already knows and likes Grimoire of Zero will get more out of Dawn of the Witch. For me, it feels like wasted potential.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                While I've never felt the need to go back and rewatch the Grimoire of Zero, I do have fond memories of the little witch and her giant teddy bear of a mercenary.

Hort takes over the top half of the fanservice with her shirt that's patterned so that her breasts look like a wrapped present, and it is kind of amusing how obviously the art is trying to have it all by the way Hort is always shown boobs-first while Loux is shown thighs-first. Mostly the issue is that Loux, despite being 300 years old, looks pretty darn prepubescent, because really, she can sit however is most comfortable for her. Not that Saybil notices any of this, being about as blank a slate as you can get and having no discernable personality whatsoever. It's frankly the least believable part of the episode that Hort likes him so much.    Mostly this episode just sort of exists. There are some hints that the story could improve once the tedious set up is finished, so this probably isn't one to just write off immediately. But on the other hand, Goodreads assures me that I've read the first volume of the manga version and I can't remember a darn thing about it. Make of that what you will.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               This show exists in a weird bit of adaptation limbo. It's based on a series of light novels that are themselves a sequel to the Grimoire of Zero novel series. I'm one of the 10 people who watched and still vaguely remember the 2017 Grimoire anime, but that show only covered the first couple volumes of a much longer story. So while I recognize some returning characters and understand the basic makeup of this particular fantasy world, I could not tell you how we got from the adventures of Tony the Tiger and his pint-sized witch gremlin to this new status quo. The good news is this is largely a new story, and anything immediately important is explained pretty quickly in this episode, so newcomers and non-LN readers alike should be able to follow along. The bad news is that doesn't make this episode any more interesting or entertaining.    The big issue with this new series is that it's centered on, by far, its least engaging character. Saybil's amnesia and mysterious past are supposed to entice you to learn more about him, but in practice he's a dead-eyed cipher who intakes exposition and outputs nothing of interest. Nearly any other character introduced here would be more engaging to follow as a protagonist, with the possible exception of the titular Witch of the Dawn, Loux. On top of being a 300-year-old little girl who can't stop flashing her panties to the camera, she's just an annoying presence who's only tolerable when she's acting her age instead of playing up her miniscule appearance. So the thought of watching her mentor our deadweight lead is deathly unappealing. That stands in stark contrast to Mercenary and Zero's dynamic in the first series, and it makes me question why these two are our leads when there's some perfectly engaging characters right next to them.    Maybe that's just because we barely get any time with Holt or Kudo so they don't have a chance to disappoint us, but just on the surface they both strike me as way more active, layered characters to build your story around. Holt is a star magic pupil who seemingly comes from a harsh background where she learned to put on a kind smile to avoid confrontation, which raises questions about her past that actually make her more interesting, unlike Saybil. Kudo, meanwhile, is a rough-mannered beast-man who nonetheless has a strong sense of justice and acts selflessly in his own way. Hell, just in this episode it's brought up that witches used to sacrifice beast-people, so the idea of one studying magic to become a witch is a rock-solid concept that all but begs for further exploration. Why, then, is his entire story this episode offscreen? Is has to be more interesting than watching our amnesiac sadboi hero vomit on a cart ride.    That's what really makes this premiere frustrating, on its own and as a follow-up to Grimoire of Zero. I know there's an interesting fantasy world behind all this, with a rich history just waiting to be explored, and presumably even more new things that have happened since the first anime wrapped up. If this were just some generic isekai world I could write it off as a dull waste of time and be done, but there's so much potential here that is just being left to rot. I might stick around for another episode or two, just to see if the elements I liked get some actual focus, but I can't give this much of a recommendation right now.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Dawn of the Witch   Apr  8th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Dawn of the Witch ?                     Community score: 3.6              What is this?   The world is now at peace after having endured a conflict between the church and witches for 500 years. However, embers of war still burn in some regions of the world. Cervil is a hopeless student at the Kingdom of Wenias' College of Magic. Cervil has somehow lost all memory of his time before attending the college. The school's headmaster Albus sends him for special training to the southern part of the continent, where persecution against witches runs strong.    The Dawn of the Witch is based on Kakeru Kobashiri's light novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Dawn of the Witch did not make the best first impression on me. We're deep into premiere season, it's late, I'm tired, etc, and I'm out of patience for shows that introduces its female characters either thighs/crotch first or tits first. I have zero familiarity with Grimoire of Zero, and while this is a standalone spinoff, I definitely got the nagging feeling I was supposed to be familiar with at least a few of these faces.    Once I was ready to forgive the show its trespasses, I did actually find a lot to draw me in. The story starts at a magic academy in a region where magic is accepted, thanks to the end of a war several centuries ago. However, since there are still places where mages are treated as other, the academy's best student, worst student, and a 300-year-old witch with the body of a ten-year-old and garter-clad thighs are going on what boils down to a humanitarian mission to build a safe home for them. Oh, and Saybil, the worst student, needs this mission to be successful, or else he'll lose what memories he's accumulated since developing amnesia three years ago.    It's a decent sentiment with a good heart, and I was surprised by a clunky-but-well-intentioned moment when Saybil called his travel companion out on her microaggressions against their beastfallen classmate. And yet, it just doesn't quite gel. Not because the fan service was particularly obtrusive—other than those crotch-first and boob-first intros, it was actually quite low-key—but because there's just no chemistry between the characters. There was a lot of walking and talking, camping and talking, and so on, and I just wasn't having fun watching them banter. There wasn't much sense of a connection and any playfulness felt forced.    Maybe someone who already knows and likes Grimoire of Zero will get more out of Dawn of the Witch. For me, it feels like wasted potential.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                While I've never felt the need to go back and rewatch the Grimoire of Zero, I do have fond memories of the little witch and her giant teddy bear of a mercenary. So returning to this world, with or without Zero in the drivers seat, is a lot of fun. There are a lot of familiar faces (it's great to see Albus all grown up) and it's interesting to see how everything has progressed since the last time we were here.    As fun as all the connections are, the basic story is perfectly understandable even if you've never seen Grimoire of Zero. Our viewpoint character, Saybil, is an amnesic magic student (though, in a twist on the trope, the memory loss happened three years previously). His personal conflict is simple: he's the school's worst mage and if he can't improve he'll be kicked out of the academy. If this happens, his knowledge of magic will be erased from his mind—basically reverting him right back to his post-amnesia state.    Then we have the titular Dawn Witch herself, a 300-year-old with the body of a little girl. While I could do without the constant panty shots, she is an intriguing character. Though egotistical and entitled, she seems to have the wisdom to match. Her connection to her staff is likewise interesting—as is everyone's reactions to how she uses a witch-killing weapon for everyday menial tasks.    The only issue I had with the show is that it really needs to lay out some of its proper nouns and a bit more of its history. While terms like “mage” and “witch” are thrown about, we don't get any clear answer on the difference between them (if any exists). And while we know there was a war between witches and the church, a bit more of the specifics would help us understand the trouble our heroes have already found themselves in with the Witch Hunters. But, all in all, this episode lays some solid ground work and makes me want to see not only what is to come for Sable and Loux but how Zero is connected to everything as well.      James Beckett  Rating:                I feel a little embarrassed, because it wasn't more than a week ago that I suddenly found myself thinking, “Man, remember Grimoire of Zero?” I hadn't thought about the show in years, not since I reviewed it, but for some reason I found myself feeling ever so slightly nostalgic for the flawed but fun fantasy adventure. “I wonder whatever happened to that big ol' cat-man and his tiny witch girlfriend?” And yet, I was completely unaware going into Dawn of the Witch that this was actually a sequel to Grimoire of Zero, and it took me a minute to even realize it. I must have zoned out a little during the OP, since Zero and Mercenary make very clear and obvious appearances in it, but it was right around the part where a wolf-man named Holdem was yelling about a woman named Albus that I started to connect the dots.    Dawn of the Witch is a really direct sequel, as it turns out, despite jumping ahead a number of years in the timeline, not to mention the major shakeup in visual style on account of the new production team. I had to go back to watch the end of GoZ to refresh my memory, but that series does indeed end with young Albus starting up a brand-new magic academy in Wenias, and promising to build a world where witches and humans can live in peace. At the start of Dawn of the Witch, it seems like she's making headway on that goal, too, though there's still a long way to go. This is what gets our four main characters started on their journey, and it's also where my issues with Dawn of the Witch really take hold.    While it was surprisingly fun to catch up with this universe and see what's become of some of the characters since Grimoire ended, this premiere just doesn't do a great job of getting me to give a damn about its own story and cast. Saybil is a total nothing of a protagonist, and Loux is the grating and unlikable inverse of Zero. It doesn't help that the camera goes out of its way to zoom in on her crotch with absolutely no shame, or even a sense of proper framing. Holt and Kudo are barely developed outside of the fact that Holt is very busty and flirtatious with Saybil, which is odd considering that Saybil has no discernable personality whatsoever. Kudo is…a lizard. That's about it.    Nobody will ever mistake Grimoire of Zero for great television, and it says something that I went nearly five years before remembering that I spent a whole season watching and reviewing the show, but it was a decent fantasy anime all things considered. Dawn of the Witch hasn't elicited any reaction from me whatsoever, which is a very poor place for a series premiere to find itself in. Maybe the show will pick up once the new cast finds its footing, or if Zero and Mercenary return to liven up the proceedings. If that isn't the case, though, then Dawn of the Witch seems destined to be overshadowed by its older sibling, and it isn't like GoZ cast all that large of a shadow in the first place.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                If you weren't aware, The Dawn of the Witch is set in the same world as Grimoire of Zero, although I don't think that's any impediment to just jumping in here. There are probably some world-building elements that work better if you're familiar with Grimoire of Zero, and that particular book does get a mention in this episode, but it's otherwise a pretty standard sword-and-sorcery setup, with beastpeople (known as beastfallen), magic users, witch hunters, and a vaguely Medieval sensibility. Well, and there's the headmaster of a magic school named Albus, but maybe we won't dwell on that.    This episode suffers most from two things: being very much about setting the stage for the more interesting things to come and Loux being kind of annoying. Loux could be Beatrice's cousin from Re: Zero in some ways, and I do think the choice to use the archaic informal second person (thee/thou/thy) largely works for her attitude of superiority. She's absolutely the kind of person who would deliberately speak informally to everyone just to show that she considers herself above them, something that Hort and Saybil notice when she leaves them behind to go chase witch hunters. But she's the sort of character who could wear with length of use, which could be an issue if she's got too much time in the spotlight.    The fact that Loux is also used for the bottom half of the fanservice may also rub some people the wrong way. We get plenty of shots of her crotch as she sits with her legs splayed, which is mostly noticeable because of how ridiculous her skirt's design is.

That stands in stark contrast to Mercenary and Zero's dynamic in the first series, and it makes me question why these two are our leads when there's some perfectly engaging characters right next to them.    Maybe that's just because we barely get any time with Holt or Kudo so they don't have a chance to disappoint us, but just on the surface they both strike me as way more active, layered characters to build your story around. Holt is a star magic pupil who seemingly comes from a harsh background where she learned to put on a kind smile to avoid confrontation, which raises questions about her past that actually make her more interesting, unlike Saybil. Kudo, meanwhile, is a rough-mannered beast-man who nonetheless has a strong sense of justice and acts selflessly in his own way. Hell, just in this episode it's brought up that witches used to sacrifice beast-people, so the idea of one studying magic to become a witch is a rock-solid concept that all but begs for further exploration. Why, then, is his entire story this episode offscreen? Is has to be more interesting than watching our amnesiac sadboi hero vomit on a cart ride.    That's what really makes this premiere frustrating, on its own and as a follow-up to Grimoire of Zero. I know there's an interesting fantasy world behind all this, with a rich history just waiting to be explored, and presumably even more new things that have happened since the first anime wrapped up. If this were just some generic isekai world I could write it off as a dull waste of time and be done, but there's so much potential here that is just being left to rot. I might stick around for another episode or two, just to see if the elements I liked get some actual focus, but I can't give this much of a recommendation right now.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 3.6              What is this?   The world is now at peace after having endured a conflict between the church and witches for 500 years. However, embers of war still burn in some regions of the world. Cervil is a hopeless student at the Kingdom of Wenias' College of Magic. Cervil has somehow lost all memory of his time before attending the college. The school's headmaster Albus sends him for special training to the southern part of the continent, where persecution against witches runs strong.    The Dawn of the Witch is based on Kakeru Kobashiri's light novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Dawn of the Witch did not make the best first impression on me. We're deep into premiere season, it's late, I'm tired, etc, and I'm out of patience for shows that introduces its female characters either thighs/crotch first or tits first. I have zero familiarity with Grimoire of Zero, and while this is a standalone spinoff, I definitely got the nagging feeling I was supposed to be familiar with at least a few of these faces.    Once I was ready to forgive the show its trespasses, I did actually find a lot to draw me in. The story starts at a magic academy in a region where magic is accepted, thanks to the end of a war several centuries ago. However, since there are still places where mages are treated as other, the academy's best student, worst student, and a 300-year-old witch with the body of a ten-year-old and garter-clad thighs are going on what boils down to a humanitarian mission to build a safe home for them. Oh, and Saybil, the worst student, needs this mission to be successful, or else he'll lose what memories he's accumulated since developing amnesia three years ago.    It's a decent sentiment with a good heart, and I was surprised by a clunky-but-well-intentioned moment when Saybil called his travel companion out on her microaggressions against their beastfallen classmate. And yet, it just doesn't quite gel. Not because the fan service was particularly obtrusive—other than those crotch-first and boob-first intros, it was actually quite low-key—but because there's just no chemistry between the characters. There was a lot of walking and talking, camping and talking, and so on, and I just wasn't having fun watching them banter. There wasn't much sense of a connection and any playfulness felt forced.    Maybe someone who already knows and likes Grimoire of Zero will get more out of Dawn of the Witch. For me, it feels like wasted potential.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                While I've never felt the need to go back and rewatch the Grimoire of Zero, I do have fond memories of the little witch and her giant teddy bear of a mercenary. So returning to this world, with or without Zero in the drivers seat, is a lot of fun. There are a lot of familiar faces (it's great to see Albus all grown up) and it's interesting to see how everything has progressed since the last time we were here.    As fun as all the connections are, the basic story is perfectly understandable even if you've never seen Grimoire of Zero. Our viewpoint character, Saybil, is an amnesic magic student (though, in a twist on the trope, the memory loss happened three years previously). His personal conflict is simple: he's the school's worst mage and if he can't improve he'll be kicked out of the academy. If this happens, his knowledge of magic will be erased from his mind—basically reverting him right back to his post-amnesia state.    Then we have the titular Dawn Witch herself, a 300-year-old with the body of a little girl. While I could do without the constant panty shots, she is an intriguing character. Though egotistical and entitled, she seems to have the wisdom to match. Her connection to her staff is likewise interesting—as is everyone's reactions to how she uses a witch-killing weapon for everyday menial tasks.    The only issue I had with the show is that it really needs to lay out some of its proper nouns and a bit more of its history. While terms like “mage” and “witch” are thrown about, we don't get any clear answer on the difference between them (if any exists). And while we know there was a war between witches and the church, a bit more of the specifics would help us understand the trouble our heroes have already found themselves in with the Witch Hunters. But, all in all, this episode lays some solid ground work and makes me want to see not only what is to come for Sable and Loux but how Zero is connected to everything as well.      James Beckett  Rating:                I feel a little embarrassed, because it wasn't more than a week ago that I suddenly found myself thinking, “Man, remember Grimoire of Zero?” I hadn't thought about the show in years, not since I reviewed it, but for some reason I found myself feeling ever so slightly nostalgic for the flawed but fun fantasy adventure. “I wonder whatever happened to that big ol' cat-man and his tiny witch girlfriend?” And yet, I was completely unaware going into Dawn of the Witch that this was actually a sequel to Grimoire of Zero, and it took me a minute to even realize it. I must have zoned out a little during the OP, since Zero and Mercenary make very clear and obvious appearances in it, but it was right around the part where a wolf-man named Holdem was yelling about a woman named Albus that I started to connect the dots.    Dawn of the Witch is a really direct sequel, as it turns out, despite jumping ahead a number of years in the timeline, not to mention the major shakeup in visual style on account of the new production team. I had to go back to watch the end of GoZ to refresh my memory, but that series does indeed end with young Albus starting up a brand-new magic academy in Wenias, and promising to build a world where witches and humans can live in peace. At the start of Dawn of the Witch, it seems like she's making headway on that goal, too, though there's still a long way to go. This is what gets our four main characters started on their journey, and it's also where my issues with Dawn of the Witch really take hold.    While it was surprisingly fun to catch up with this universe and see what's become of some of the characters since Grimoire ended, this premiere just doesn't do a great job of getting me to give a damn about its own story and cast. Saybil is a total nothing of a protagonist, and Loux is the grating and unlikable inverse of Zero. It doesn't help that the camera goes out of its way to zoom in on her crotch with absolutely no shame, or even a sense of proper framing. Holt and Kudo are barely developed outside of the fact that Holt is very busty and flirtatious with Saybil, which is odd considering that Saybil has no discernable personality whatsoever. Kudo is…a lizard. That's about it.    Nobody will ever mistake Grimoire of Zero for great television, and it says something that I went nearly five years before remembering that I spent a whole season watching and reviewing the show, but it was a decent fantasy anime all things considered. Dawn of the Witch hasn't elicited any reaction from me whatsoever, which is a very poor place for a series premiere to find itself in. Maybe the show will pick up once the new cast finds its footing, or if Zero and Mercenary return to liven up the proceedings. If that isn't the case, though, then Dawn of the Witch seems destined to be overshadowed by its older sibling, and it isn't like GoZ cast all that large of a shadow in the first place.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                If you weren't aware, The Dawn of the Witch is set in the same world as Grimoire of Zero, although I don't think that's any impediment to just jumping in here. There are probably some world-building elements that work better if you're familiar with Grimoire of Zero, and that particular book does get a mention in this episode, but it's otherwise a pretty standard sword-and-sorcery setup, with beastpeople (known as beastfallen), magic users, witch hunters, and a vaguely Medieval sensibility. Well, and there's the headmaster of a magic school named Albus, but maybe we won't dwell on that.    This episode suffers most from two things: being very much about setting the stage for the more interesting things to come and Loux being kind of annoying. Loux could be Beatrice's cousin from Re: Zero in some ways, and I do think the choice to use the archaic informal second person (thee/thou/thy) largely works for her attitude of superiority. She's absolutely the kind of person who would deliberately speak informally to everyone just to show that she considers herself above them, something that Hort and Saybil notice when she leaves them behind to go chase witch hunters. But she's the sort of character who could wear with length of use, which could be an issue if she's got too much time in the spotlight.    The fact that Loux is also used for the bottom half of the fanservice may also rub some people the wrong way. We get plenty of shots of her crotch as she sits with her legs splayed, which is mostly noticeable because of how ridiculous her skirt's design is. Hort takes over the top half of the fanservice with her shirt that's patterned so that her breasts look like a wrapped present, and it is kind of amusing how obviously the art is trying to have it all by the way Hort is always shown boobs-first while Loux is shown thighs-first. Mostly the issue is that Loux, despite being 300 years old, looks pretty darn prepubescent, because really, she can sit however is most comfortable for her. Not that Saybil notices any of this, being about as blank a slate as you can get and having no discernable personality whatsoever. It's frankly the least believable part of the episode that Hort likes him so much.    Mostly this episode just sort of exists. There are some hints that the story could improve once the tedious set up is finished, so this probably isn't one to just write off immediately. But on the other hand, Goodreads assures me that I've read the first volume of the manga version and I can't remember a darn thing about it. Make of that what you will.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               This show exists in a weird bit of adaptation limbo. It's based on a series of light novels that are themselves a sequel to the Grimoire of Zero novel series. I'm one of the 10 people who watched and still vaguely remember the 2017 Grimoire anime, but that show only covered the first couple volumes of a much longer story. So while I recognize some returning characters and understand the basic makeup of this particular fantasy world, I could not tell you how we got from the adventures of Tony the Tiger and his pint-sized witch gremlin to this new status quo. The good news is this is largely a new story, and anything immediately important is explained pretty quickly in this episode, so newcomers and non-LN readers alike should be able to follow along. The bad news is that doesn't make this episode any more interesting or entertaining.    The big issue with this new series is that it's centered on, by far, its least engaging character. Saybil's amnesia and mysterious past are supposed to entice you to learn more about him, but in practice he's a dead-eyed cipher who intakes exposition and outputs nothing of interest. Nearly any other character introduced here would be more engaging to follow as a protagonist, with the possible exception of the titular Witch of the Dawn, Loux. On top of being a 300-year-old little girl who can't stop flashing her panties to the camera, she's just an annoying presence who's only tolerable when she's acting her age instead of playing up her miniscule appearance. So the thought of watching her mentor our deadweight lead is deathly unappealing.

The school's headmaster Albus sends him for special training to the southern part of the continent, where persecution against witches runs strong.    The Dawn of the Witch is based on Kakeru Kobashiri's light novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Dawn of the Witch did not make the best first impression on me. We're deep into premiere season, it's late, I'm tired, etc, and I'm out of patience for shows that introduces its female characters either thighs/crotch first or tits first. I have zero familiarity with Grimoire of Zero, and while this is a standalone spinoff, I definitely got the nagging feeling I was supposed to be familiar with at least a few of these faces.    Once I was ready to forgive the show its trespasses, I did actually find a lot to draw me in. The story starts at a magic academy in a region where magic is accepted, thanks to the end of a war several centuries ago. However, since there are still places where mages are treated as other, the academy's best student, worst student, and a 300-year-old witch with the body of a ten-year-old and garter-clad thighs are going on what boils down to a humanitarian mission to build a safe home for them. Oh, and Saybil, the worst student, needs this mission to be successful, or else he'll lose what memories he's accumulated since developing amnesia three years ago.    It's a decent sentiment with a good heart, and I was surprised by a clunky-but-well-intentioned moment when Saybil called his travel companion out on her microaggressions against their beastfallen classmate. And yet, it just doesn't quite gel. Not because the fan service was particularly obtrusive—other than those crotch-first and boob-first intros, it was actually quite low-key—but because there's just no chemistry between the characters. There was a lot of walking and talking, camping and talking, and so on, and I just wasn't having fun watching them banter. There wasn't much sense of a connection and any playfulness felt forced.    Maybe someone who already knows and likes Grimoire of Zero will get more out of Dawn of the Witch. For me, it feels like wasted potential.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                While I've never felt the need to go back and rewatch the Grimoire of Zero, I do have fond memories of the little witch and her giant teddy bear of a mercenary. So returning to this world, with or without Zero in the drivers seat, is a lot of fun. There are a lot of familiar faces (it's great to see Albus all grown up) and it's interesting to see how everything has progressed since the last time we were here.    As fun as all the connections are, the basic story is perfectly understandable even if you've never seen Grimoire of Zero. Our viewpoint character, Saybil, is an amnesic magic student (though, in a twist on the trope, the memory loss happened three years previously). His personal conflict is simple: he's the school's worst mage and if he can't improve he'll be kicked out of the academy. If this happens, his knowledge of magic will be erased from his mind—basically reverting him right back to his post-amnesia state.    Then we have the titular Dawn Witch herself, a 300-year-old with the body of a little girl. While I could do without the constant panty shots, she is an intriguing character. Though egotistical and entitled, she seems to have the wisdom to match. Her connection to her staff is likewise interesting—as is everyone's reactions to how she uses a witch-killing weapon for everyday menial tasks.    The only issue I had with the show is that it really needs to lay out some of its proper nouns and a bit more of its history. While terms like “mage” and “witch” are thrown about, we don't get any clear answer on the difference between them (if any exists). And while we know there was a war between witches and the church, a bit more of the specifics would help us understand the trouble our heroes have already found themselves in with the Witch Hunters. But, all in all, this episode lays some solid ground work and makes me want to see not only what is to come for Sable and Loux but how Zero is connected to everything as well.      James Beckett  Rating:                I feel a little embarrassed, because it wasn't more than a week ago that I suddenly found myself thinking, “Man, remember Grimoire of Zero?” I hadn't thought about the show in years, not since I reviewed it, but for some reason I found myself feeling ever so slightly nostalgic for the flawed but fun fantasy adventure. “I wonder whatever happened to that big ol' cat-man and his tiny witch girlfriend?” And yet, I was completely unaware going into Dawn of the Witch that this was actually a sequel to Grimoire of Zero, and it took me a minute to even realize it. I must have zoned out a little during the OP, since Zero and Mercenary make very clear and obvious appearances in it, but it was right around the part where a wolf-man named Holdem was yelling about a woman named Albus that I started to connect the dots.    Dawn of the Witch is a really direct sequel, as it turns out, despite jumping ahead a number of years in the timeline, not to mention the major shakeup in visual style on account of the new production team. I had to go back to watch the end of GoZ to refresh my memory, but that series does indeed end with young Albus starting up a brand-new magic academy in Wenias, and promising to build a world where witches and humans can live in peace. At the start of Dawn of the Witch, it seems like she's making headway on that goal, too, though there's still a long way to go. This is what gets our four main characters started on their journey, and it's also where my issues with Dawn of the Witch really take hold.    While it was surprisingly fun to catch up with this universe and see what's become of some of the characters since Grimoire ended, this premiere just doesn't do a great job of getting me to give a damn about its own story and cast. Saybil is a total nothing of a protagonist, and Loux is the grating and unlikable inverse of Zero. It doesn't help that the camera goes out of its way to zoom in on her crotch with absolutely no shame, or even a sense of proper framing. Holt and Kudo are barely developed outside of the fact that Holt is very busty and flirtatious with Saybil, which is odd considering that Saybil has no discernable personality whatsoever. Kudo is…a lizard. That's about it.    Nobody will ever mistake Grimoire of Zero for great television, and it says something that I went nearly five years before remembering that I spent a whole season watching and reviewing the show, but it was a decent fantasy anime all things considered. Dawn of the Witch hasn't elicited any reaction from me whatsoever, which is a very poor place for a series premiere to find itself in. Maybe the show will pick up once the new cast finds its footing, or if Zero and Mercenary return to liven up the proceedings. If that isn't the case, though, then Dawn of the Witch seems destined to be overshadowed by its older sibling, and it isn't like GoZ cast all that large of a shadow in the first place.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                If you weren't aware, The Dawn of the Witch is set in the same world as Grimoire of Zero, although I don't think that's any impediment to just jumping in here. There are probably some world-building elements that work better if you're familiar with Grimoire of Zero, and that particular book does get a mention in this episode, but it's otherwise a pretty standard sword-and-sorcery setup, with beastpeople (known as beastfallen), magic users, witch hunters, and a vaguely Medieval sensibility. Well, and there's the headmaster of a magic school named Albus, but maybe we won't dwell on that.    This episode suffers most from two things: being very much about setting the stage for the more interesting things to come and Loux being kind of annoying. Loux could be Beatrice's cousin from Re: Zero in some ways, and I do think the choice to use the archaic informal second person (thee/thou/thy) largely works for her attitude of superiority. She's absolutely the kind of person who would deliberately speak informally to everyone just to show that she considers herself above them, something that Hort and Saybil notice when she leaves them behind to go chase witch hunters. But she's the sort of character who could wear with length of use, which could be an issue if she's got too much time in the spotlight.    The fact that Loux is also used for the bottom half of the fanservice may also rub some people the wrong way. We get plenty of shots of her crotch as she sits with her legs splayed, which is mostly noticeable because of how ridiculous her skirt's design is. Hort takes over the top half of the fanservice with her shirt that's patterned so that her breasts look like a wrapped present, and it is kind of amusing how obviously the art is trying to have it all by the way Hort is always shown boobs-first while Loux is shown thighs-first. Mostly the issue is that Loux, despite being 300 years old, looks pretty darn prepubescent, because really, she can sit however is most comfortable for her. Not that Saybil notices any of this, being about as blank a slate as you can get and having no discernable personality whatsoever. It's frankly the least believable part of the episode that Hort likes him so much.    Mostly this episode just sort of exists. There are some hints that the story could improve once the tedious set up is finished, so this probably isn't one to just write off immediately. But on the other hand, Goodreads assures me that I've read the first volume of the manga version and I can't remember a darn thing about it. Make of that what you will.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               This show exists in a weird bit of adaptation limbo. It's based on a series of light novels that are themselves a sequel to the Grimoire of Zero novel series. I'm one of the 10 people who watched and still vaguely remember the 2017 Grimoire anime, but that show only covered the first couple volumes of a much longer story. So while I recognize some returning characters and understand the basic makeup of this particular fantasy world, I could not tell you how we got from the adventures of Tony the Tiger and his pint-sized witch gremlin to this new status quo. The good news is this is largely a new story, and anything immediately important is explained pretty quickly in this episode, so newcomers and non-LN readers alike should be able to follow along. The bad news is that doesn't make this episode any more interesting or entertaining.    The big issue with this new series is that it's centered on, by far, its least engaging character. Saybil's amnesia and mysterious past are supposed to entice you to learn more about him, but in practice he's a dead-eyed cipher who intakes exposition and outputs nothing of interest. Nearly any other character introduced here would be more engaging to follow as a protagonist, with the possible exception of the titular Witch of the Dawn, Loux. On top of being a 300-year-old little girl who can't stop flashing her panties to the camera, she's just an annoying presence who's only tolerable when she's acting her age instead of playing up her miniscule appearance. So the thought of watching her mentor our deadweight lead is deathly unappealing. That stands in stark contrast to Mercenary and Zero's dynamic in the first series, and it makes me question why these two are our leads when there's some perfectly engaging characters right next to them.    Maybe that's just because we barely get any time with Holt or Kudo so they don't have a chance to disappoint us, but just on the surface they both strike me as way more active, layered characters to build your story around. Holt is a star magic pupil who seemingly comes from a harsh background where she learned to put on a kind smile to avoid confrontation, which raises questions about her past that actually make her more interesting, unlike Saybil. Kudo, meanwhile, is a rough-mannered beast-man who nonetheless has a strong sense of justice and acts selflessly in his own way. Hell, just in this episode it's brought up that witches used to sacrifice beast-people, so the idea of one studying magic to become a witch is a rock-solid concept that all but begs for further exploration. Why, then, is his entire story this episode offscreen? Is has to be more interesting than watching our amnesiac sadboi hero vomit on a cart ride.    That's what really makes this premiere frustrating, on its own and as a follow-up to Grimoire of Zero. I know there's an interesting fantasy world behind all this, with a rich history just waiting to be explored, and presumably even more new things that have happened since the first anime wrapped up. If this were just some generic isekai world I could write it off as a dull waste of time and be done, but there's so much potential here that is just being left to rot. I might stick around for another episode or two, just to see if the elements I liked get some actual focus, but I can't give this much of a recommendation right now.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives   ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

And while we know there was a war between witches and the church, a bit more of the specifics would help us understand the trouble our heroes have already found themselves in with the Witch Hunters. But, all in all, this episode lays some solid ground work and makes me want to see not only what is to come for Sable and Loux but how Zero is connected to everything as well.      James Beckett  Rating:                I feel a little embarrassed, because it wasn't more than a week ago that I suddenly found myself thinking, “Man, remember Grimoire of Zero?” I hadn't thought about the show in years, not since I reviewed it, but for some reason I found myself feeling ever so slightly nostalgic for the flawed but fun fantasy adventure. “I wonder whatever happened to that big ol' cat-man and his tiny witch girlfriend?” And yet, I was completely unaware going into Dawn of the Witch that this was actually a sequel to Grimoire of Zero, and it took me a minute to even realize it. I must have zoned out a little during the OP, since Zero and Mercenary make very clear and obvious appearances in it, but it was right around the part where a wolf-man named Holdem was yelling about a woman named Albus that I started to connect the dots.    Dawn of the Witch is a really direct sequel, as it turns out, despite jumping ahead a number of years in the timeline, not to mention the major shakeup in visual style on account of the new production team. I had to go back to watch the end of GoZ to refresh my memory, but that series does indeed end with young Albus starting up a brand-new magic academy in Wenias, and promising to build a world where witches and humans can live in peace. At the start of Dawn of the Witch, it seems like she's making headway on that goal, too, though there's still a long way to go. This is what gets our four main characters started on their journey, and it's also where my issues with Dawn of the Witch really take hold.    While it was surprisingly fun to catch up with this universe and see what's become of some of the characters since Grimoire ended, this premiere just doesn't do a great job of getting me to give a damn about its own story and cast. Saybil is a total nothing of a protagonist, and Loux is the grating and unlikable inverse of Zero. It doesn't help that the camera goes out of its way to zoom in on her crotch with absolutely no shame, or even a sense of proper framing. Holt and Kudo are barely developed outside of the fact that Holt is very busty and flirtatious with Saybil, which is odd considering that Saybil has no discernable personality whatsoever. Kudo is…a lizard. That's about it.    Nobody will ever mistake Grimoire of Zero for great television, and it says something that I went nearly five years before remembering that I spent a whole season watching and reviewing the show, but it was a decent fantasy anime all things considered. Dawn of the Witch hasn't elicited any reaction from me whatsoever, which is a very poor place for a series premiere to find itself in. Maybe the show will pick up once the new cast finds its footing, or if Zero and Mercenary return to liven up the proceedings. If that isn't the case, though, then Dawn of the Witch seems destined to be overshadowed by its older sibling, and it isn't like GoZ cast all that large of a shadow in the first place.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                If you weren't aware, The Dawn of the Witch is set in the same world as Grimoire of Zero, although I don't think that's any impediment to just jumping in here. There are probably some world-building elements that work better if you're familiar with Grimoire of Zero, and that particular book does get a mention in this episode, but it's otherwise a pretty standard sword-and-sorcery setup, with beastpeople (known as beastfallen), magic users, witch hunters, and a vaguely Medieval sensibility. Well, and there's the headmaster of a magic school named Albus, but maybe we won't dwell on that.    This episode suffers most from two things: being very much about setting the stage for the more interesting things to come and Loux being kind of annoying. Loux could be Beatrice's cousin from Re: Zero in some ways, and I do think the choice to use the archaic informal second person (thee/thou/thy) largely works for her attitude of superiority. She's absolutely the kind of person who would deliberately speak informally to everyone just to show that she considers herself above them, something that Hort and Saybil notice when she leaves them behind to go chase witch hunters. But she's the sort of character who could wear with length of use, which could be an issue if she's got too much time in the spotlight.    The fact that Loux is also used for the bottom half of the fanservice may also rub some people the wrong way. We get plenty of shots of her crotch as she sits with her legs splayed, which is mostly noticeable because of how ridiculous her skirt's design is. Hort takes over the top half of the fanservice with her shirt that's patterned so that her breasts look like a wrapped present, and it is kind of amusing how obviously the art is trying to have it all by the way Hort is always shown boobs-first while Loux is shown thighs-first. Mostly the issue is that Loux, despite being 300 years old, looks pretty darn prepubescent, because really, she can sit however is most comfortable for her. Not that Saybil notices any of this, being about as blank a slate as you can get and having no discernable personality whatsoever. It's frankly the least believable part of the episode that Hort likes him so much.    Mostly this episode just sort of exists. There are some hints that the story could improve once the tedious set up is finished, so this probably isn't one to just write off immediately. But on the other hand, Goodreads assures me that I've read the first volume of the manga version and I can't remember a darn thing about it. Make of that what you will.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               This show exists in a weird bit of adaptation limbo. It's based on a series of light novels that are themselves a sequel to the Grimoire of Zero novel series. I'm one of the 10 people who watched and still vaguely remember the 2017 Grimoire anime, but that show only covered the first couple volumes of a much longer story. So while I recognize some returning characters and understand the basic makeup of this particular fantasy world, I could not tell you how we got from the adventures of Tony the Tiger and his pint-sized witch gremlin to this new status quo. The good news is this is largely a new story, and anything immediately important is explained pretty quickly in this episode, so newcomers and non-LN readers alike should be able to follow along. The bad news is that doesn't make this episode any more interesting or entertaining.    The big issue with this new series is that it's centered on, by far, its least engaging character. Saybil's amnesia and mysterious past are supposed to entice you to learn more about him, but in practice he's a dead-eyed cipher who intakes exposition and outputs nothing of interest. Nearly any other character introduced here would be more engaging to follow as a protagonist, with the possible exception of the titular Witch of the Dawn, Loux. On top of being a 300-year-old little girl who can't stop flashing her panties to the camera, she's just an annoying presence who's only tolerable when she's acting her age instead of playing up her miniscule appearance. So the thought of watching her mentor our deadweight lead is deathly unappealing. That stands in stark contrast to Mercenary and Zero's dynamic in the first series, and it makes me question why these two are our leads when there's some perfectly engaging characters right next to them.    Maybe that's just because we barely get any time with Holt or Kudo so they don't have a chance to disappoint us, but just on the surface they both strike me as way more active, layered characters to build your story around. Holt is a star magic pupil who seemingly comes from a harsh background where she learned to put on a kind smile to avoid confrontation, which raises questions about her past that actually make her more interesting, unlike Saybil. Kudo, meanwhile, is a rough-mannered beast-man who nonetheless has a strong sense of justice and acts selflessly in his own way. Hell, just in this episode it's brought up that witches used to sacrifice beast-people, so the idea of one studying magic to become a witch is a rock-solid concept that all but begs for further exploration. Why, then, is his entire story this episode offscreen? Is has to be more interesting than watching our amnesiac sadboi hero vomit on a cart ride.    That's what really makes this premiere frustrating, on its own and as a follow-up to Grimoire of Zero. I know there's an interesting fantasy world behind all this, with a rich history just waiting to be explored, and presumably even more new things that have happened since the first anime wrapped up. If this were just some generic isekai world I could write it off as a dull waste of time and be done, but there's so much potential here that is just being left to rot. I might stick around for another episode or two, just to see if the elements I liked get some actual focus, but I can't give this much of a recommendation right now.

News Code Geass Lost Stories Game's Anime Opening, Gameplay Videos Streamed   posted on 2022-04-18 17:47 UTC-8 by Crystalyn Hodgkins         Sunrise animates opening video for game launches on May 17    DMM Games began streaming an opening anime video and a gameplay video for its Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion Lost Stories social game on Monday. The opening anime video features animation from Sunrise and FLOW's theme song ""Pendulum.""      The gameplay video outlines the game's battle system and organization, and reveals the game will launch for smartphones as well as on PC via the DMM Game Player on May 17.      DMM Games had announced in November that it was restarting the game's development process with f4samurai as the developers.    The game will feature a new story with full voice acting. Segments with Knightmare Frames will be in full 3D.    The main character (players can choose between male or female designs, designed by Shirabi) works with Lelouch and the Order of the Black Knights at the beginning of the game. The Pendulum is an original Knightmare Frame design by Astrays for the game. The main character pilots the Pendulum in the game's original story.    The action role-playing game was originally slated to launch in winter 2018 as a PC browser game, but was then listed with no release window. The game will be free to play, with optional in-game purchases available.    Sources: DMM Games' YouTube channel (link 2)   Disclosure: Bandai Namco Filmworks Inc.

News Code Geass Lost Stories Game's Anime Opening, Gameplay Videos Streamed   posted on 2022-04-18 17:47 UTC-8 by Crystalyn Hodgkins         Sunrise animates opening video for game launches on May 17    DMM Games began streaming an opening anime video and a gameplay video for its Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion Lost Stories social game on Monday. The opening anime video features animation from Sunrise and FLOW's theme song ""Pendulum.""      The gameplay video outlines the game's battle system and organization, and reveals the game will launch for smartphones as well as on PC via the DMM Game Player on May 17.      DMM Games had announced in November that it was restarting the game's development process with f4samurai as the developers.    The game will feature a new story with full voice acting. Segments with Knightmare Frames will be in full 3D.    The main character (players can choose between male or female designs, designed by Shirabi) works with Lelouch and the Order of the Black Knights at the beginning of the game. The Pendulum is an original Knightmare Frame design by Astrays for the game. The main character pilots the Pendulum in the game's original story.    The action role-playing game was originally slated to launch in winter 2018 as a PC browser game, but was then listed with no release window. The game will be free to play, with optional in-game purchases available.    Sources: DMM Games' YouTube channel (link 2)   Disclosure: Bandai Namco Filmworks Inc.

The opening anime video features animation from Sunrise and FLOW's theme song ""Pendulum.""      The gameplay video outlines the game's battle system and organization, and reveals the game will launch for smartphones as well as on PC via the DMM Game Player on May 17.      DMM Games had announced in November that it was restarting the game's development process with f4samurai as the developers.    The game will feature a new story with full voice acting. Segments with Knightmare Frames will be in full 3D.    The main character (players can choose between male or female designs, designed by Shirabi) works with Lelouch and the Order of the Black Knights at the beginning of the game. The Pendulum is an original Knightmare Frame design by Astrays for the game. The main character pilots the Pendulum in the game's original story.    The action role-playing game was originally slated to launch in winter 2018 as a PC browser game, but was then listed with no release window.

Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision Episodes 25-27  by Christopher Farris, Apr 16th 2022                   How would you rate episode 25 of Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision (movies) ?                     Community score: 4.5                  How would you rate episode 26 of Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision (movies) ?                     Community score: 4.4                  How would you rate episode 27 of Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision (movies) ?                     Community score: 4.3            My thoughts on the opening episode of Collision were covered back at  the beginning of the preview guide, but to summarize, I regarded it as effectively a thematic opener for this season, less connected to the dense plotting we all really keep coming back to Legend of the Galactic Heroes for. But that might turn out to be a harbinger of the more roundabout approach to storytelling this season might overall be taking, as the following pair of episodes aren't overly concerned with advancing any major battle plans on either side of the conflict either. Instead, they are about two specific dudes: Wolfgang Mittermeyer and Oskar von Reuenthal. If you're a fan of LOGH from its previous incarnations, then these two need no introduction, but if you're a newcomer, this duology serves as a pretty effective one.    Of course, Mittermeyer and Reuenthal have been around Die Neue These for a while at this point; it's just now that the show is deciding to detail exactly who these two are, and how they got so close with each other and so trusted with Reinhard.  As with the first episode's Julian-focused aside prologue, this pair of backstory-based episodes uses the flashbacks for Mittermeyer and Reuenthal as vectors for overall thematic worldbuilding in laying out what their deal is. As well, getting two episodes in a row about these guys shows early on that Collision might be less beholden to the previous seasons' rigid alternating Alliance/Empire story focus structure; that also makes sense, given that, as this season's title implies, the two sides will be more directly clashing again as it goes on, as opposed to the more isolated plots they were dealing with in the last batch.    All that's structural setup for the season as it goes on, however, with Episodes 26 and 27 rooted firmly in the past, and entirely on the Empire's side of things to boot. The initial recounting of the more personal circumstances of Mittermeyer and Reuenthal's contrasting upbringings are more about establishing the men personally before the past's plot-heavy stuff rears its head. Stuff like Mittermeyer's courtship with his eventual wife Evangelin is pretty basic (though his dad's little fist-pump as his son's proposal is accepted is a cute detail), while Reuenthal's drunken confession of his distrust of all women stemming from his problems with his mother is as comparatively melodramatic as you would expect from this series. Beyond the actual context of the content, these beats are mainly here to impart to us the trust in the bond these two men forged. Mittermeyer acknowledges the irrationality of Reuenthal's issues, sure, but you can't not be heartened at his no-hesitance response the morning after when his bro asks him to act like he didn't hear anything.    It's basically all flavor, but it at least makes for a properly engaging opener for a season that's seemingly going to be heavy on featuring these guys. It gets them out in front of the audience, and makes clear what their dynamic is and why it's supposed to be appealing. The next step is showing that dynamic in more of a story-based context, in this case via a plotline that got shuffled around compared to the previous LOGH anime: The Klopstock Incident. Doing this story as a flashback has a few advantages, like getting to see more of Sieg even after his death at the end of last season. But there is still a sense of the post-hoc about the placement here, since a large part of this story is showing earlier interactions between our main Imperial heroes with aristocratic characters like Braunschweig and Ansbach, who you'll remember from the Empire's civil war plot from last season. It's dotted with a lot of signs of how things will lead into that story, particularly the establishment of how Mittermeyer and Reuenthal wound up courting the animosity of this particular group. But given how all those rich jerks have since been killed and their whole story wrapped up, it can feel like a retroactive thematic inclusion to something that finished nearly three years ago, which isn't great as far as pertinent storytelling goes.    That said, as a piece of storytelling on its own, this is still a tight little flashback arc that expounds on the themes of LOGH while at least keeping the energy of the series up. Mittermeyer and Reuenthal prove that they are still an appealing pair of characters that can carry a story that's largely a forgone conclusion by this point. And the thematics remain well-aligned, both in terms of where this season's story will ultimately go (let's just say the discussion of a potential military tribunal is something of a dry run), as well as the overarching ideas that have always been part of LOGH. Sure, we already knew that Mittermeyer and Reuenthal were aligned with Reinhard's beliefs about the corruption at the heart of the royalty running the Empire at the time, but seeing them demonstrate those principles, against the kind of barbarous bastard who would cut open a woman's throat just to steal a ring, unflinchingly shows how these guys are the 'Heroes' of this story even on this side of the conflict (Also if that scene of him shooting the guy doesn't convince you that Mittermeyer rules, I don't think anything will). The procession of events fits with the always-present historical stylings of LOGH, demonstrating that things rarely happen in neat, contained arcs in reality; instead, it's often a sequence of interactions that lead to connections and changes that continuously occur through time. By the end of Episode 27, the implication is that each of the commanders Reinhard has assembled under him have as rich personal histories connecting them to the new Prime Minister as Mittermeyer and Reuenthal do, as if all of these galactic heroes have their own legends. Or something like that.    I'd also be remiss if I didn't comment on the stylizations this sequence of episodes takes us through. Production I.G's Legend of the Galactic Heroes has always had a fair bit of gloss on it, but these episodes go hard on some of the more colorful elements of the presentation: The contrasting palette on the flashback to Reuenthal's mommy issues, the striking orange of the sun over Mittermeyer's gunning down of the noble, or the brief flash of lightning illuminating the conversation with Reinhard and Sieg. It all does a good job of reminding you that, oh right, these episodes are part of a Capital-M Movie in their original release. Things still get a little rote at the end when we're being introduced to the rest of Reinhard's commanders and DNT does that thing where it just keeps naming dudes. That means that even in an extended flashback of questionable relevance to the primary story, LOGH is still LOGH, for better and for worse. It can almost make these episodes feel entirely like fanservice for the established viewers at this point, spending time presenting a polished piece about a pair of popular players. It's an interesting choice three seasons in, to be sure, but it's also hard to argue with the pure entertainment that results.

Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision Episodes 25-27  by Christopher Farris, Apr 16th 2022                   How would you rate episode 25 of Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision (movies) ?                     Community score: 4.5                  How would you rate episode 26 of Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision (movies) ?                     Community score: 4.4                  How would you rate episode 27 of Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision (movies) ?                     Community score: 4.3            My thoughts on the opening episode of Collision were covered back at  the beginning of the preview guide, but to summarize, I regarded it as effectively a thematic opener for this season, less connected to the dense plotting we all really keep coming back to Legend of the Galactic Heroes for. But that might turn out to be a harbinger of the more roundabout approach to storytelling this season might overall be taking, as the following pair of episodes aren't overly concerned with advancing any major battle plans on either side of the conflict either. Instead, they are about two specific dudes: Wolfgang Mittermeyer and Oskar von Reuenthal. If you're a fan of LOGH from its previous incarnations, then these two need no introduction, but if you're a newcomer, this duology serves as a pretty effective one.    Of course, Mittermeyer and Reuenthal have been around Die Neue These for a while at this point; it's just now that the show is deciding to detail exactly who these two are, and how they got so close with each other and so trusted with Reinhard.  As with the first episode's Julian-focused aside prologue, this pair of backstory-based episodes uses the flashbacks for Mittermeyer and Reuenthal as vectors for overall thematic worldbuilding in laying out what their deal is. As well, getting two episodes in a row about these guys shows early on that Collision might be less beholden to the previous seasons' rigid alternating Alliance/Empire story focus structure; that also makes sense, given that, as this season's title implies, the two sides will be more directly clashing again as it goes on, as opposed to the more isolated plots they were dealing with in the last batch.    All that's structural setup for the season as it goes on, however, with Episodes 26 and 27 rooted firmly in the past, and entirely on the Empire's side of things to boot. The initial recounting of the more personal circumstances of Mittermeyer and Reuenthal's contrasting upbringings are more about establishing the men personally before the past's plot-heavy stuff rears its head. Stuff like Mittermeyer's courtship with his eventual wife Evangelin is pretty basic (though his dad's little fist-pump as his son's proposal is accepted is a cute detail), while Reuenthal's drunken confession of his distrust of all women stemming from his problems with his mother is as comparatively melodramatic as you would expect from this series. Beyond the actual context of the content, these beats are mainly here to impart to us the trust in the bond these two men forged. Mittermeyer acknowledges the irrationality of Reuenthal's issues, sure, but you can't not be heartened at his no-hesitance response the morning after when his bro asks him to act like he didn't hear anything.    It's basically all flavor, but it at least makes for a properly engaging opener for a season that's seemingly going to be heavy on featuring these guys. It gets them out in front of the audience, and makes clear what their dynamic is and why it's supposed to be appealing. The next step is showing that dynamic in more of a story-based context, in this case via a plotline that got shuffled around compared to the previous LOGH anime: The Klopstock Incident. Doing this story as a flashback has a few advantages, like getting to see more of Sieg even after his death at the end of last season. But there is still a sense of the post-hoc about the placement here, since a large part of this story is showing earlier interactions between our main Imperial heroes with aristocratic characters like Braunschweig and Ansbach, who you'll remember from the Empire's civil war plot from last season. It's dotted with a lot of signs of how things will lead into that story, particularly the establishment of how Mittermeyer and Reuenthal wound up courting the animosity of this particular group. But given how all those rich jerks have since been killed and their whole story wrapped up, it can feel like a retroactive thematic inclusion to something that finished nearly three years ago, which isn't great as far as pertinent storytelling goes.    That said, as a piece of storytelling on its own, this is still a tight little flashback arc that expounds on the themes of LOGH while at least keeping the energy of the series up. Mittermeyer and Reuenthal prove that they are still an appealing pair of characters that can carry a story that's largely a forgone conclusion by this point. And the thematics remain well-aligned, both in terms of where this season's story will ultimately go (let's just say the discussion of a potential military tribunal is something of a dry run), as well as the overarching ideas that have always been part of LOGH. Sure, we already knew that Mittermeyer and Reuenthal were aligned with Reinhard's beliefs about the corruption at the heart of the royalty running the Empire at the time, but seeing them demonstrate those principles, against the kind of barbarous bastard who would cut open a woman's throat just to steal a ring, unflinchingly shows how these guys are the 'Heroes' of this story even on this side of the conflict (Also if that scene of him shooting the guy doesn't convince you that Mittermeyer rules, I don't think anything will). The procession of events fits with the always-present historical stylings of LOGH, demonstrating that things rarely happen in neat, contained arcs in reality; instead, it's often a sequence of interactions that lead to connections and changes that continuously occur through time. By the end of Episode 27, the implication is that each of the commanders Reinhard has assembled under him have as rich personal histories connecting them to the new Prime Minister as Mittermeyer and Reuenthal do, as if all of these galactic heroes have their own legends. Or something like that.    I'd also be remiss if I didn't comment on the stylizations this sequence of episodes takes us through. Production I.G's Legend of the Galactic Heroes has always had a fair bit of gloss on it, but these episodes go hard on some of the more colorful elements of the presentation: The contrasting palette on the flashback to Reuenthal's mommy issues, the striking orange of the sun over Mittermeyer's gunning down of the noble, or the brief flash of lightning illuminating the conversation with Reinhard and Sieg. It all does a good job of reminding you that, oh right, these episodes are part of a Capital-M Movie in their original release. Things still get a little rote at the end when we're being introduced to the rest of Reinhard's commanders and DNT does that thing where it just keeps naming dudes. That means that even in an extended flashback of questionable relevance to the primary story, LOGH is still LOGH, for better and for worse. It can almost make these episodes feel entirely like fanservice for the established viewers at this point, spending time presenting a polished piece about a pair of popular players. It's an interesting choice three seasons in, to be sure, but it's also hard to argue with the pure entertainment that results.

Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision Episodes 25-27  by Christopher Farris, Apr 16th 2022                   How would you rate episode 25 of Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision (movies) ?                     Community score: 4.5                  How would you rate episode 26 of Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision (movies) ?                     Community score: 4.4                  How would you rate episode 27 of Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision (movies) ?                     Community score: 4.3            My thoughts on the opening episode of Collision were covered back at  the beginning of the preview guide, but to summarize, I regarded it as effectively a thematic opener for this season, less connected to the dense plotting we all really keep coming back to Legend of the Galactic Heroes for. But that might turn out to be a harbinger of the more roundabout approach to storytelling this season might overall be taking, as the following pair of episodes aren't overly concerned with advancing any major battle plans on either side of the conflict either. Instead, they are about two specific dudes: Wolfgang Mittermeyer and Oskar von Reuenthal. If you're a fan of LOGH from its previous incarnations, then these two need no introduction, but if you're a newcomer, this duology serves as a pretty effective one.    Of course, Mittermeyer and Reuenthal have been around Die Neue These for a while at this point; it's just now that the show is deciding to detail exactly who these two are, and how they got so close with each other and so trusted with Reinhard.  As with the first episode's Julian-focused aside prologue, this pair of backstory-based episodes uses the flashbacks for Mittermeyer and Reuenthal as vectors for overall thematic worldbuilding in laying out what their deal is. As well, getting two episodes in a row about these guys shows early on that Collision might be less beholden to the previous seasons' rigid alternating Alliance/Empire story focus structure; that also makes sense, given that, as this season's title implies, the two sides will be more directly clashing again as it goes on, as opposed to the more isolated plots they were dealing with in the last batch.    All that's structural setup for the season as it goes on, however, with Episodes 26 and 27 rooted firmly in the past, and entirely on the Empire's side of things to boot. The initial recounting of the more personal circumstances of Mittermeyer and Reuenthal's contrasting upbringings are more about establishing the men personally before the past's plot-heavy stuff rears its head. Stuff like Mittermeyer's courtship with his eventual wife Evangelin is pretty basic (though his dad's little fist-pump as his son's proposal is accepted is a cute detail), while Reuenthal's drunken confession of his distrust of all women stemming from his problems with his mother is as comparatively melodramatic as you would expect from this series. Beyond the actual context of the content, these beats are mainly here to impart to us the trust in the bond these two men forged. Mittermeyer acknowledges the irrationality of Reuenthal's issues, sure, but you can't not be heartened at his no-hesitance response the morning after when his bro asks him to act like he didn't hear anything.    It's basically all flavor, but it at least makes for a properly engaging opener for a season that's seemingly going to be heavy on featuring these guys. It gets them out in front of the audience, and makes clear what their dynamic is and why it's supposed to be appealing. The next step is showing that dynamic in more of a story-based context, in this case via a plotline that got shuffled around compared to the previous LOGH anime: The Klopstock Incident. Doing this story as a flashback has a few advantages, like getting to see more of Sieg even after his death at the end of last season. But there is still a sense of the post-hoc about the placement here, since a large part of this story is showing earlier interactions between our main Imperial heroes with aristocratic characters like Braunschweig and Ansbach, who you'll remember from the Empire's civil war plot from last season. It's dotted with a lot of signs of how things will lead into that story, particularly the establishment of how Mittermeyer and Reuenthal wound up courting the animosity of this particular group. But given how all those rich jerks have since been killed and their whole story wrapped up, it can feel like a retroactive thematic inclusion to something that finished nearly three years ago, which isn't great as far as pertinent storytelling goes.    That said, as a piece of storytelling on its own, this is still a tight little flashback arc that expounds on the themes of LOGH while at least keeping the energy of the series up. Mittermeyer and Reuenthal prove that they are still an appealing pair of characters that can carry a story that's largely a forgone conclusion by this point. And the thematics remain well-aligned, both in terms of where this season's story will ultimately go (let's just say the discussion of a potential military tribunal is something of a dry run), as well as the overarching ideas that have always been part of LOGH. Sure, we already knew that Mittermeyer and Reuenthal were aligned with Reinhard's beliefs about the corruption at the heart of the royalty running the Empire at the time, but seeing them demonstrate those principles, against the kind of barbarous bastard who would cut open a woman's throat just to steal a ring, unflinchingly shows how these guys are the 'Heroes' of this story even on this side of the conflict (Also if that scene of him shooting the guy doesn't convince you that Mittermeyer rules, I don't think anything will). The procession of events fits with the always-present historical stylings of LOGH, demonstrating that things rarely happen in neat, contained arcs in reality; instead, it's often a sequence of interactions that lead to connections and changes that continuously occur through time. By the end of Episode 27, the implication is that each of the commanders Reinhard has assembled under him have as rich personal histories connecting them to the new Prime Minister as Mittermeyer and Reuenthal do, as if all of these galactic heroes have their own legends. Or something like that.    I'd also be remiss if I didn't comment on the stylizations this sequence of episodes takes us through. Production I.G's Legend of the Galactic Heroes has always had a fair bit of gloss on it, but these episodes go hard on some of the more colorful elements of the presentation: The contrasting palette on the flashback to Reuenthal's mommy issues, the striking orange of the sun over Mittermeyer's gunning down of the noble, or the brief flash of lightning illuminating the conversation with Reinhard and Sieg. It all does a good job of reminding you that, oh right, these episodes are part of a Capital-M Movie in their original release. Things still get a little rote at the end when we're being introduced to the rest of Reinhard's commanders and DNT does that thing where it just keeps naming dudes. That means that even in an extended flashback of questionable relevance to the primary story, LOGH is still LOGH, for better and for worse. It can almost make these episodes feel entirely like fanservice for the established viewers at this point, spending time presenting a polished piece about a pair of popular players. It's an interesting choice three seasons in, to be sure, but it's also hard to argue with the pure entertainment that results.

Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision Episodes 25-27  by Christopher Farris, Apr 16th 2022                   How would you rate episode 25 of Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision (movies) ?                     Community score: 4.5                  How would you rate episode 26 of Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision (movies) ?                     Community score: 4.4                  How would you rate episode 27 of Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision (movies) ?                     Community score: 4.3            My thoughts on the opening episode of Collision were covered back at  the beginning of the preview guide, but to summarize, I regarded it as effectively a thematic opener for this season, less connected to the dense plotting we all really keep coming back to Legend of the Galactic Heroes for. But that might turn out to be a harbinger of the more roundabout approach to storytelling this season might overall be taking, as the following pair of episodes aren't overly concerned with advancing any major battle plans on either side of the conflict either. Instead, they are about two specific dudes: Wolfgang Mittermeyer and Oskar von Reuenthal. If you're a fan of LOGH from its previous incarnations, then these two need no introduction, but if you're a newcomer, this duology serves as a pretty effective one.    Of course, Mittermeyer and Reuenthal have been around Die Neue These for a while at this point; it's just now that the show is deciding to detail exactly who these two are, and how they got so close with each other and so trusted with Reinhard.  As with the first episode's Julian-focused aside prologue, this pair of backstory-based episodes uses the flashbacks for Mittermeyer and Reuenthal as vectors for overall thematic worldbuilding in laying out what their deal is. As well, getting two episodes in a row about these guys shows early on that Collision might be less beholden to the previous seasons' rigid alternating Alliance/Empire story focus structure; that also makes sense, given that, as this season's title implies, the two sides will be more directly clashing again as it goes on, as opposed to the more isolated plots they were dealing with in the last batch.    All that's structural setup for the season as it goes on, however, with Episodes 26 and 27 rooted firmly in the past, and entirely on the Empire's side of things to boot. The initial recounting of the more personal circumstances of Mittermeyer and Reuenthal's contrasting upbringings are more about establishing the men personally before the past's plot-heavy stuff rears its head. Stuff like Mittermeyer's courtship with his eventual wife Evangelin is pretty basic (though his dad's little fist-pump as his son's proposal is accepted is a cute detail), while Reuenthal's drunken confession of his distrust of all women stemming from his problems with his mother is as comparatively melodramatic as you would expect from this series. Beyond the actual context of the content, these beats are mainly here to impart to us the trust in the bond these two men forged. Mittermeyer acknowledges the irrationality of Reuenthal's issues, sure, but you can't not be heartened at his no-hesitance response the morning after when his bro asks him to act like he didn't hear anything.    It's basically all flavor, but it at least makes for a properly engaging opener for a season that's seemingly going to be heavy on featuring these guys. It gets them out in front of the audience, and makes clear what their dynamic is and why it's supposed to be appealing. The next step is showing that dynamic in more of a story-based context, in this case via a plotline that got shuffled around compared to the previous LOGH anime: The Klopstock Incident. Doing this story as a flashback has a few advantages, like getting to see more of Sieg even after his death at the end of last season. But there is still a sense of the post-hoc about the placement here, since a large part of this story is showing earlier interactions between our main Imperial heroes with aristocratic characters like Braunschweig and Ansbach, who you'll remember from the Empire's civil war plot from last season. It's dotted with a lot of signs of how things will lead into that story, particularly the establishment of how Mittermeyer and Reuenthal wound up courting the animosity of this particular group. But given how all those rich jerks have since been killed and their whole story wrapped up, it can feel like a retroactive thematic inclusion to something that finished nearly three years ago, which isn't great as far as pertinent storytelling goes.    That said, as a piece of storytelling on its own, this is still a tight little flashback arc that expounds on the themes of LOGH while at least keeping the energy of the series up. Mittermeyer and Reuenthal prove that they are still an appealing pair of characters that can carry a story that's largely a forgone conclusion by this point. And the thematics remain well-aligned, both in terms of where this season's story will ultimately go (let's just say the discussion of a potential military tribunal is something of a dry run), as well as the overarching ideas that have always been part of LOGH. Sure, we already knew that Mittermeyer and Reuenthal were aligned with Reinhard's beliefs about the corruption at the heart of the royalty running the Empire at the time, but seeing them demonstrate those principles, against the kind of barbarous bastard who would cut open a woman's throat just to steal a ring, unflinchingly shows how these guys are the 'Heroes' of this story even on this side of the conflict (Also if that scene of him shooting the guy doesn't convince you that Mittermeyer rules, I don't think anything will). The procession of events fits with the always-present historical stylings of LOGH, demonstrating that things rarely happen in neat, contained arcs in reality; instead, it's often a sequence of interactions that lead to connections and changes that continuously occur through time. By the end of Episode 27, the implication is that each of the commanders Reinhard has assembled under him have as rich personal histories connecting them to the new Prime Minister as Mittermeyer and Reuenthal do, as if all of these galactic heroes have their own legends. Or something like that.    I'd also be remiss if I didn't comment on the stylizations this sequence of episodes takes us through. Production I.G's Legend of the Galactic Heroes has always had a fair bit of gloss on it, but these episodes go hard on some of the more colorful elements of the presentation: The contrasting palette on the flashback to Reuenthal's mommy issues, the striking orange of the sun over Mittermeyer's gunning down of the noble, or the brief flash of lightning illuminating the conversation with Reinhard and Sieg. It all does a good job of reminding you that, oh right, these episodes are part of a Capital-M Movie in their original release. Things still get a little rote at the end when we're being introduced to the rest of Reinhard's commanders and DNT does that thing where it just keeps naming dudes. That means that even in an extended flashback of questionable relevance to the primary story, LOGH is still LOGH, for better and for worse. It can almost make these episodes feel entirely like fanservice for the established viewers at this point, spending time presenting a polished piece about a pair of popular players. It's an interesting choice three seasons in, to be sure, but it's also hard to argue with the pure entertainment that results.
