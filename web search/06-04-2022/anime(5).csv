Titles with less than 4 votes are removed from the list but are still counted in the ranking. This explains why there may be gaps in the ""#"" column.

Titles with many votes will tend to be at the top, but this is modified a little by the ratings. In other words, the popularity is the straight average score of a title (the value in the rating column) multiplied by the number of votes.

The rating displayed here is the same weighted average as the Top 10 Best Rated by weighted average, but is only displayed for reference and doesn't have anything to do with the order of the titles.

Titles with less than 4 votes are removed from the list but are still counted in the ranking. This explains why there may be gaps in the ""#"" column.

Titles with many votes will tend to be at the top, but this is modified a little by the ratings. In other words, the popularity is the straight average score of a title (the value in the rating column) multiplied by the number of votes.

The rating displayed here is the same weighted average as the Top 10 Best Rated by weighted average, but is only displayed for reference and doesn't have anything to do with the order of the titles.

Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest Season 2 Episode 12  by Christopher Farris, Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.4            I'd hardly call it the comeback of the century or anything, but it still seems pretty impressive how far the Arifureta anime has come since its incredibly iffy inception. After multiple studio switchovers and a first-season opening that seemed to misrepresent the tonal appeal of the series, here we've arrived at the wrap party for its second season, finishing in a mostly satisfying, effective way. While it's fine for me, I guess I mostly find myself hoping this has worked well for fans of the original work, ending up with a solid adaptation that supplements their appreciation for the novel after all. This isn't even the actual end for Arifureta either, as we've already got confirmation that there's an OVA coming later this year. Which makes sense, given that the story is hardly over by the point of this season finale. But much like Hajime's growth from a 'commonplace' weakling to an overpowered edgelord badass, the anime's glow-up from the murky, shambling mess it originally was into a perfectly serviceable little fantasy cartoon makes for an appreciable journey all its own.    Simply taking stock of the state of the product is appropriate enough at this stopping point, since so much of this season finale similarly spends its time consolidating the leftover pieces of the big blowout of the last few episodes. The biggest dangling thread is almost certainly the fate of Kaori, but as I was last week, the storyline is so assured that she'll be 'fine' that the characters straight-up turn to the camera and tell us that before sending Hajime over on a few other personal diversions. Instead, the actual biggest return on an emotional investment comes from Ai-Chan-Sensei, which probably isn't that surprising to anyone who's been paying attention through this arc, but is still nice to see just for a sense of completion.    Part of Ai-Sensei's focus here is necessarily on her processing the guilt over the people killed around and as a result of her in this battle. So she's got to come to terms with the church full of people she leveled, or the fact that Hiyama's demise, played somewhat flippantly as it occurred last episode, was still an instance of one of her students dying, so she's a bit tore up by that as well. What's nice here is that Hajime's contribution to talking Sensei through these feelings isn't to insist on his personal method of burying any trauma beneath a badass facade, but instead advising her to hold onto the weight and importance of that guilt. The association he asks for on it could come off like Hajime basically asking Sensei to perform emotional labor for him, but to hear him tell it, his experiences thus far have left him unsure if he even can still experience those human extremes of emotions anymore. Of course, our boy's actions regarding his teammates, friends, and the likes of Myu indicate that he's handling things more healthily than he's giving himself credit for, but the concern being there at all still rings true, and fits with Hajime's desire to have a 'way back' for himself, both in terms of physically returning to Japan and living therein apart from his current vengeful disposition.    It's that long-term mission statement I've always appreciated about Arifureta, a power-fantasy makeover isekai that nonetheless sets its hero's ultimate goal of getting back to his original life after all. And given Sensei's long-standing willingness to shoulder these kinds of burdens for all her students, it fits, and continues the unique reciprocal relationship between her and Hajime. Where her presence and faith in him has comforted Hajime in the background of his struggles so far, he gets to return the favor here by turning his back on her only to allow her to cry into it in the event of being overwhelmed by her own struggles. That alone speaks to Hajime not being as callous as he'd like everyone to think he is. How moe.    I'm glad this closer can provide that kind of emotional closure, as the rest is more mechanical plot stuff getting sorted out for future stories. Kaori does indeed survive, with the outlandish side-effect of having her soul moved into the defeated Noint's body in the process, in a power-up acquisition so out there I absolutely didn't see it coming from this story. They even expressly detail that the move was entirely Kaori's desire and her old body is fine in stasis and ready for her to migrate back to once everything's taken care of. I kind of appreciate how buck-wild this is just as an expression of the lengths Kaori is now willing to go to in service of Hajime's adventuring harem. Something to be said for conviction, I suppose, and the animation here does a decent job of communicating it's still Kaori through facial expressions and the like, so it mostly works.    The other big shift that happens at this stage in the story comes from Hajime finally bringing everyone else up on that whole ""The gods are evil jerks"" thing, and a huge collection of the classmate crew resultantly deciding to tag along with him on the next leg of his adventures. I'm rather more apprehensive about this development, least of all because of the crowd factor involved (how are they all going to fit in the Hummvee?!), even if I can see the reasoning for it within the storytelling. For one thing, most of these people are going to have way more basis to interact with Eri the next time she pops up as a dedicated villain. Plus it's another point that acts with Hajime's arc from his original forced ousting from the group. Yes there's something a bit obvious about him suddenly finding that everyone thinks he is cool and wants to be his friend, but so long as the story isn't leaning too hard on Hajime reveling in vengeful vindication over the turnaround and is instead simply acting adorably tsundere over the whole affair, I think it's fine. I guess we'll just have to wait until that OVA (and who knows what other anime extensions) to see how this setup is actually going to shake out.    To the end, Arifureta is still Arifureta, so even among all its emotional satisfaction and interesting status-quo shakeups, this finale still can't finish without, say, a scene where all of Hajime's wives feed him or Tio, as she always does, returning to the bit about dragon sodomy. ""I've never been so uncomfortable"" indeed. But while I don't know if 'respectable' is a term I'd associate with all of that, it still all feels assured enough. I left the first season of Arifureta with a surprising amount of hope for its future, and I now leave the second season reasonably satisfied with the fulfillment of that hope. It's hardly the ""World's Strongest"", but I don't think there's any shame in going from Commonplace to Decently Entertaining.

Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest Season 2 Episode 12  by Christopher Farris, Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.4            I'd hardly call it the comeback of the century or anything, but it still seems pretty impressive how far the Arifureta anime has come since its incredibly iffy inception. After multiple studio switchovers and a first-season opening that seemed to misrepresent the tonal appeal of the series, here we've arrived at the wrap party for its second season, finishing in a mostly satisfying, effective way. While it's fine for me, I guess I mostly find myself hoping this has worked well for fans of the original work, ending up with a solid adaptation that supplements their appreciation for the novel after all. This isn't even the actual end for Arifureta either, as we've already got confirmation that there's an OVA coming later this year. Which makes sense, given that the story is hardly over by the point of this season finale. But much like Hajime's growth from a 'commonplace' weakling to an overpowered edgelord badass, the anime's glow-up from the murky, shambling mess it originally was into a perfectly serviceable little fantasy cartoon makes for an appreciable journey all its own.    Simply taking stock of the state of the product is appropriate enough at this stopping point, since so much of this season finale similarly spends its time consolidating the leftover pieces of the big blowout of the last few episodes. The biggest dangling thread is almost certainly the fate of Kaori, but as I was last week, the storyline is so assured that she'll be 'fine' that the characters straight-up turn to the camera and tell us that before sending Hajime over on a few other personal diversions.

Part of Ai-Sensei's focus here is necessarily on her processing the guilt over the people killed around and as a result of her in this battle. So she's got to come to terms with the church full of people she leveled, or the fact that Hiyama's demise, played somewhat flippantly as it occurred last episode, was still an instance of one of her students dying, so she's a bit tore up by that as well. What's nice here is that Hajime's contribution to talking Sensei through these feelings isn't to insist on his personal method of burying any trauma beneath a badass facade, but instead advising her to hold onto the weight and importance of that guilt. The association he asks for on it could come off like Hajime basically asking Sensei to perform emotional labor for him, but to hear him tell it, his experiences thus far have left him unsure if he even can still experience those human extremes of emotions anymore.

Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest Season 2 Episode 12  by Christopher Farris, Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.4            I'd hardly call it the comeback of the century or anything, but it still seems pretty impressive how far the Arifureta anime has come since its incredibly iffy inception. After multiple studio switchovers and a first-season opening that seemed to misrepresent the tonal appeal of the series, here we've arrived at the wrap party for its second season, finishing in a mostly satisfying, effective way. While it's fine for me, I guess I mostly find myself hoping this has worked well for fans of the original work, ending up with a solid adaptation that supplements their appreciation for the novel after all. This isn't even the actual end for Arifureta either, as we've already got confirmation that there's an OVA coming later this year. Which makes sense, given that the story is hardly over by the point of this season finale. But much like Hajime's growth from a 'commonplace' weakling to an overpowered edgelord badass, the anime's glow-up from the murky, shambling mess it originally was into a perfectly serviceable little fantasy cartoon makes for an appreciable journey all its own.    Simply taking stock of the state of the product is appropriate enough at this stopping point, since so much of this season finale similarly spends its time consolidating the leftover pieces of the big blowout of the last few episodes. The biggest dangling thread is almost certainly the fate of Kaori, but as I was last week, the storyline is so assured that she'll be 'fine' that the characters straight-up turn to the camera and tell us that before sending Hajime over on a few other personal diversions. Instead, the actual biggest return on an emotional investment comes from Ai-Chan-Sensei, which probably isn't that surprising to anyone who's been paying attention through this arc, but is still nice to see just for a sense of completion.    Part of Ai-Sensei's focus here is necessarily on her processing the guilt over the people killed around and as a result of her in this battle. So she's got to come to terms with the church full of people she leveled, or the fact that Hiyama's demise, played somewhat flippantly as it occurred last episode, was still an instance of one of her students dying, so she's a bit tore up by that as well. What's nice here is that Hajime's contribution to talking Sensei through these feelings isn't to insist on his personal method of burying any trauma beneath a badass facade, but instead advising her to hold onto the weight and importance of that guilt. The association he asks for on it could come off like Hajime basically asking Sensei to perform emotional labor for him, but to hear him tell it, his experiences thus far have left him unsure if he even can still experience those human extremes of emotions anymore. Of course, our boy's actions regarding his teammates, friends, and the likes of Myu indicate that he's handling things more healthily than he's giving himself credit for, but the concern being there at all still rings true, and fits with Hajime's desire to have a 'way back' for himself, both in terms of physically returning to Japan and living therein apart from his current vengeful disposition.    It's that long-term mission statement I've always appreciated about Arifureta, a power-fantasy makeover isekai that nonetheless sets its hero's ultimate goal of getting back to his original life after all. And given Sensei's long-standing willingness to shoulder these kinds of burdens for all her students, it fits, and continues the unique reciprocal relationship between her and Hajime. Where her presence and faith in him has comforted Hajime in the background of his struggles so far, he gets to return the favor here by turning his back on her only to allow her to cry into it in the event of being overwhelmed by her own struggles. That alone speaks to Hajime not being as callous as he'd like everyone to think he is. How moe.    I'm glad this closer can provide that kind of emotional closure, as the rest is more mechanical plot stuff getting sorted out for future stories. Kaori does indeed survive, with the outlandish side-effect of having her soul moved into the defeated Noint's body in the process, in a power-up acquisition so out there I absolutely didn't see it coming from this story. They even expressly detail that the move was entirely Kaori's desire and her old body is fine in stasis and ready for her to migrate back to once everything's taken care of. I kind of appreciate how buck-wild this is just as an expression of the lengths Kaori is now willing to go to in service of Hajime's adventuring harem. Something to be said for conviction, I suppose, and the animation here does a decent job of communicating it's still Kaori through facial expressions and the like, so it mostly works.    The other big shift that happens at this stage in the story comes from Hajime finally bringing everyone else up on that whole ""The gods are evil jerks"" thing, and a huge collection of the classmate crew resultantly deciding to tag along with him on the next leg of his adventures. I'm rather more apprehensive about this development, least of all because of the crowd factor involved (how are they all going to fit in the Hummvee?!), even if I can see the reasoning for it within the storytelling. For one thing, most of these people are going to have way more basis to interact with Eri the next time she pops up as a dedicated villain. Plus it's another point that acts with Hajime's arc from his original forced ousting from the group. Yes there's something a bit obvious about him suddenly finding that everyone thinks he is cool and wants to be his friend, but so long as the story isn't leaning too hard on Hajime reveling in vengeful vindication over the turnaround and is instead simply acting adorably tsundere over the whole affair, I think it's fine. I guess we'll just have to wait until that OVA (and who knows what other anime extensions) to see how this setup is actually going to shake out.    To the end, Arifureta is still Arifureta, so even among all its emotional satisfaction and interesting status-quo shakeups, this finale still can't finish without, say, a scene where all of Hajime's wives feed him or Tio, as she always does, returning to the bit about dragon sodomy. ""I've never been so uncomfortable"" indeed. But while I don't know if 'respectable' is a term I'd associate with all of that, it still all feels assured enough. I left the first season of Arifureta with a surprising amount of hope for its future, and I now leave the second season reasonably satisfied with the fulfillment of that hope. It's hardly the ""World's Strongest"", but I don't think there's any shame in going from Commonplace to Decently Entertaining.

They even expressly detail that the move was entirely Kaori's desire and her old body is fine in stasis and ready for her to migrate back to once everything's taken care of. I kind of appreciate how buck-wild this is just as an expression of the lengths Kaori is now willing to go to in service of Hajime's adventuring harem. Something to be said for conviction, I suppose, and the animation here does a decent job of communicating it's still Kaori through facial expressions and the like, so it mostly works.    The other big shift that happens at this stage in the story comes from Hajime finally bringing everyone else up on that whole ""The gods are evil jerks"" thing, and a huge collection of the classmate crew resultantly deciding to tag along with him on the next leg of his adventures. I'm rather more apprehensive about this development, least of all because of the crowd factor involved (how are they all going to fit in the Hummvee?!), even if I can see the reasoning for it within the storytelling. For one thing, most of these people are going to have way more basis to interact with Eri the next time she pops up as a dedicated villain. Plus it's another point that acts with Hajime's arc from his original forced ousting from the group. Yes there's something a bit obvious about him suddenly finding that everyone thinks he is cool and wants to be his friend, but so long as the story isn't leaning too hard on Hajime reveling in vengeful vindication over the turnaround and is instead simply acting adorably tsundere over the whole affair, I think it's fine. I guess we'll just have to wait until that OVA (and who knows what other anime extensions) to see how this setup is actually going to shake out.    To the end, Arifureta is still Arifureta, so even among all its emotional satisfaction and interesting status-quo shakeups, this finale still can't finish without, say, a scene where all of Hajime's wives feed him or Tio, as she always does, returning to the bit about dragon sodomy. ""I've never been so uncomfortable"" indeed. But while I don't know if 'respectable' is a term I'd associate with all of that, it still all feels assured enough. I left the first season of Arifureta with a surprising amount of hope for its future, and I now leave the second season reasonably satisfied with the fulfillment of that hope. It's hardly the ""World's Strongest"", but I don't think there's any shame in going from Commonplace to Decently Entertaining.

Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest Season 2 Episode 12  by Christopher Farris, Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.4            I'd hardly call it the comeback of the century or anything, but it still seems pretty impressive how far the Arifureta anime has come since its incredibly iffy inception. After multiple studio switchovers and a first-season opening that seemed to misrepresent the tonal appeal of the series, here we've arrived at the wrap party for its second season, finishing in a mostly satisfying, effective way. While it's fine for me, I guess I mostly find myself hoping this has worked well for fans of the original work, ending up with a solid adaptation that supplements their appreciation for the novel after all. This isn't even the actual end for Arifureta either, as we've already got confirmation that there's an OVA coming later this year. Which makes sense, given that the story is hardly over by the point of this season finale. But much like Hajime's growth from a 'commonplace' weakling to an overpowered edgelord badass, the anime's glow-up from the murky, shambling mess it originally was into a perfectly serviceable little fantasy cartoon makes for an appreciable journey all its own.    Simply taking stock of the state of the product is appropriate enough at this stopping point, since so much of this season finale similarly spends its time consolidating the leftover pieces of the big blowout of the last few episodes. The biggest dangling thread is almost certainly the fate of Kaori, but as I was last week, the storyline is so assured that she'll be 'fine' that the characters straight-up turn to the camera and tell us that before sending Hajime over on a few other personal diversions. Instead, the actual biggest return on an emotional investment comes from Ai-Chan-Sensei, which probably isn't that surprising to anyone who's been paying attention through this arc, but is still nice to see just for a sense of completion.    Part of Ai-Sensei's focus here is necessarily on her processing the guilt over the people killed around and as a result of her in this battle. So she's got to come to terms with the church full of people she leveled, or the fact that Hiyama's demise, played somewhat flippantly as it occurred last episode, was still an instance of one of her students dying, so she's a bit tore up by that as well. What's nice here is that Hajime's contribution to talking Sensei through these feelings isn't to insist on his personal method of burying any trauma beneath a badass facade, but instead advising her to hold onto the weight and importance of that guilt. The association he asks for on it could come off like Hajime basically asking Sensei to perform emotional labor for him, but to hear him tell it, his experiences thus far have left him unsure if he even can still experience those human extremes of emotions anymore. Of course, our boy's actions regarding his teammates, friends, and the likes of Myu indicate that he's handling things more healthily than he's giving himself credit for, but the concern being there at all still rings true, and fits with Hajime's desire to have a 'way back' for himself, both in terms of physically returning to Japan and living therein apart from his current vengeful disposition.    It's that long-term mission statement I've always appreciated about Arifureta, a power-fantasy makeover isekai that nonetheless sets its hero's ultimate goal of getting back to his original life after all. And given Sensei's long-standing willingness to shoulder these kinds of burdens for all her students, it fits, and continues the unique reciprocal relationship between her and Hajime. Where her presence and faith in him has comforted Hajime in the background of his struggles so far, he gets to return the favor here by turning his back on her only to allow her to cry into it in the event of being overwhelmed by her own struggles. That alone speaks to Hajime not being as callous as he'd like everyone to think he is. How moe.    I'm glad this closer can provide that kind of emotional closure, as the rest is more mechanical plot stuff getting sorted out for future stories.

""I've never been so uncomfortable"" indeed. But while I don't know if 'respectable' is a term I'd associate with all of that, it still all feels assured enough. I left the first season of Arifureta with a surprising amount of hope for its future, and I now leave the second season reasonably satisfied with the fulfillment of that hope. It's hardly the ""World's Strongest"", but I don't think there's any shame in going from Commonplace to Decently Entertaining.

Community score: 4.4            I'd hardly call it the comeback of the century or anything, but it still seems pretty impressive how far the Arifureta anime has come since its incredibly iffy inception. After multiple studio switchovers and a first-season opening that seemed to misrepresent the tonal appeal of the series, here we've arrived at the wrap party for its second season, finishing in a mostly satisfying, effective way. While it's fine for me, I guess I mostly find myself hoping this has worked well for fans of the original work, ending up with a solid adaptation that supplements their appreciation for the novel after all. This isn't even the actual end for Arifureta either, as we've already got confirmation that there's an OVA coming later this year. Which makes sense, given that the story is hardly over by the point of this season finale. But much like Hajime's growth from a 'commonplace' weakling to an overpowered edgelord badass, the anime's glow-up from the murky, shambling mess it originally was into a perfectly serviceable little fantasy cartoon makes for an appreciable journey all its own.    Simply taking stock of the state of the product is appropriate enough at this stopping point, since so much of this season finale similarly spends its time consolidating the leftover pieces of the big blowout of the last few episodes. The biggest dangling thread is almost certainly the fate of Kaori, but as I was last week, the storyline is so assured that she'll be 'fine' that the characters straight-up turn to the camera and tell us that before sending Hajime over on a few other personal diversions. Instead, the actual biggest return on an emotional investment comes from Ai-Chan-Sensei, which probably isn't that surprising to anyone who's been paying attention through this arc, but is still nice to see just for a sense of completion.    Part of Ai-Sensei's focus here is necessarily on her processing the guilt over the people killed around and as a result of her in this battle. So she's got to come to terms with the church full of people she leveled, or the fact that Hiyama's demise, played somewhat flippantly as it occurred last episode, was still an instance of one of her students dying, so she's a bit tore up by that as well. What's nice here is that Hajime's contribution to talking Sensei through these feelings isn't to insist on his personal method of burying any trauma beneath a badass facade, but instead advising her to hold onto the weight and importance of that guilt. The association he asks for on it could come off like Hajime basically asking Sensei to perform emotional labor for him, but to hear him tell it, his experiences thus far have left him unsure if he even can still experience those human extremes of emotions anymore. Of course, our boy's actions regarding his teammates, friends, and the likes of Myu indicate that he's handling things more healthily than he's giving himself credit for, but the concern being there at all still rings true, and fits with Hajime's desire to have a 'way back' for himself, both in terms of physically returning to Japan and living therein apart from his current vengeful disposition.    It's that long-term mission statement I've always appreciated about Arifureta, a power-fantasy makeover isekai that nonetheless sets its hero's ultimate goal of getting back to his original life after all. And given Sensei's long-standing willingness to shoulder these kinds of burdens for all her students, it fits, and continues the unique reciprocal relationship between her and Hajime. Where her presence and faith in him has comforted Hajime in the background of his struggles so far, he gets to return the favor here by turning his back on her only to allow her to cry into it in the event of being overwhelmed by her own struggles. That alone speaks to Hajime not being as callous as he'd like everyone to think he is. How moe.    I'm glad this closer can provide that kind of emotional closure, as the rest is more mechanical plot stuff getting sorted out for future stories. Kaori does indeed survive, with the outlandish side-effect of having her soul moved into the defeated Noint's body in the process, in a power-up acquisition so out there I absolutely didn't see it coming from this story. They even expressly detail that the move was entirely Kaori's desire and her old body is fine in stasis and ready for her to migrate back to once everything's taken care of. I kind of appreciate how buck-wild this is just as an expression of the lengths Kaori is now willing to go to in service of Hajime's adventuring harem. Something to be said for conviction, I suppose, and the animation here does a decent job of communicating it's still Kaori through facial expressions and the like, so it mostly works.    The other big shift that happens at this stage in the story comes from Hajime finally bringing everyone else up on that whole ""The gods are evil jerks"" thing, and a huge collection of the classmate crew resultantly deciding to tag along with him on the next leg of his adventures. I'm rather more apprehensive about this development, least of all because of the crowd factor involved (how are they all going to fit in the Hummvee?!), even if I can see the reasoning for it within the storytelling. For one thing, most of these people are going to have way more basis to interact with Eri the next time she pops up as a dedicated villain. Plus it's another point that acts with Hajime's arc from his original forced ousting from the group. Yes there's something a bit obvious about him suddenly finding that everyone thinks he is cool and wants to be his friend, but so long as the story isn't leaning too hard on Hajime reveling in vengeful vindication over the turnaround and is instead simply acting adorably tsundere over the whole affair, I think it's fine. I guess we'll just have to wait until that OVA (and who knows what other anime extensions) to see how this setup is actually going to shake out.

06-04-2022,anime,2,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/arifureta-from-commonplace-to-world-strongest-season-2/episode-12/.184247,Episode 12 - Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest Season 2 - Anime News Network:SEA,"            How would you rate episode 12 of Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.4            I'd hardly call it the comeback of the century or anything, but it still seems pretty impressive how far the Arifureta anime has come since its incredibly iffy inception. After multiple studio switchovers and a first-season opening that seemed to misrepresent the tonal appeal of the series, here we've arrived at the wrap party for its second season, finishing in a mostly satisfying, effective way. While it's fine for me, I guess I mostly find myself hoping this has worked well for fans of the original work, ending up with a solid adaptation that supplements their appreciation for the novel after all. This isn't even the actual end for Arifureta either, as we've already got confirmation that there's an OVA coming later this year. Which makes sense, given that the story is hardly over by the point of this season finale. But much like Hajime's growth from a 'commonplace' weakling to an overpowered edgelord badass, the anime's glow-up from the murky, shambling mess it originally was into a perfectly serviceable little fantasy cartoon makes for an appreciable journey all its own.    Simply taking stock of the state of the product is appropriate enough at this stopping point, since so much of this season finale similarly spends its time consolidating the leftover pieces of the big blowout of the last few episodes. The biggest dangling thread is almost certainly the fate of Kaori, but as I was last week, the storyline is so assured that she'll be 'fine' that the characters straight-up turn to the camera and tell us that before sending Hajime over on a few other personal diversions. Instead, the actual biggest return on an emotional investment comes from Ai-Chan-Sensei, which probably isn't that surprising to anyone who's been paying attention through this arc, but is still nice to see just for a sense of completion.    Part of Ai-Sensei's focus here is necessarily on her processing the guilt over the people killed around and as a result of her in this battle. So she's got to come to terms with the church full of people she leveled, or the fact that Hiyama's demise, played somewhat flippantly as it occurred last episode, was still an instance of one of her students dying, so she's a bit tore up by that as well. What's nice here is that Hajime's contribution to talking Sensei through these feelings isn't to insist on his personal method of burying any trauma beneath a badass facade, but instead advising her to hold onto the weight and importance of that guilt. The association he asks for on it could come off like Hajime basically asking Sensei to perform emotional labor for him, but to hear him tell it, his experiences thus far have left him unsure if he even can still experience those human extremes of emotions anymore. Of course, our boy's actions regarding his teammates, friends, and the likes of Myu indicate that he's handling things more healthily than he's giving himself credit for, but the concern being there at all still rings true, and fits with Hajime's desire to have a 'way back' for himself, both in terms of physically returning to Japan and living therein apart from his current vengeful disposition.    It's that long-term mission statement I've always appreciated about Arifureta, a power-fantasy makeover isekai that nonetheless sets its hero's ultimate goal of getting back to his original life after all. And given Sensei's long-standing willingness to shoulder these kinds of burdens for all her students, it fits, and continues the unique reciprocal relationship between her and Hajime. Where her presence and faith in him has comforted Hajime in the background of his struggles so far, he gets to return the favor here by turning his back on her only to allow her to cry into it in the event of being overwhelmed by her own struggles. That alone speaks to Hajime not being as callous as he'd like everyone to think he is. How moe.    I'm glad this closer can provide that kind of emotional closure, as the rest is more mechanical plot stuff getting sorted out for future stories. Kaori does indeed survive, with the outlandish side-effect of having her soul moved into the defeated Noint's body in the process, in a power-up acquisition so out there I absolutely didn't see it coming from this story. They even expressly detail that the move was entirely Kaori's desire and her old body is fine in stasis and ready for her to migrate back to once everything's taken care of. I kind of appreciate how buck-wild this is just as an expression of the lengths Kaori is now willing to go to in service of Hajime's adventuring harem. Something to be said for conviction, I suppose, and the animation here does a decent job of communicating it's still Kaori through facial expressions and the like, so it mostly works.    The other big shift that happens at this stage in the story comes from Hajime finally bringing everyone else up on that whole ""The gods are evil jerks"" thing, and a huge collection of the classmate crew resultantly deciding to tag along with him on the next leg of his adventures. I'm rather more apprehensive about this development, least of all because of the crowd factor involved (how are they all going to fit in the Hummvee?!), even if I can see the reasoning for it within the storytelling. For one thing, most of these people are going to have way more basis to interact with Eri the next time she pops up as a dedicated villain. Plus it's another point that acts with Hajime's arc from his original forced ousting from the group. Yes there's something a bit obvious about him suddenly finding that everyone thinks he is cool and wants to be his friend, but so long as the story isn't leaning too hard on Hajime reveling in vengeful vindication over the turnaround and is instead simply acting adorably tsundere over the whole affair, I think it's fine. I guess we'll just have to wait until that OVA (and who knows what other anime extensions) to see how this setup is actually going to shake out.    To the end, Arifureta is still Arifureta, so even among all its emotional satisfaction and interesting status-quo shakeups, this finale still can't finish without, say, a scene where all of Hajime's wives feed him or Tio, as she always does, returning to the bit about dragon sodomy. ""I've never been so uncomfortable"" indeed. But while I don't know if 'respectable' is a term I'd associate with all of that, it still all feels assured enough. I left the first season of Arifureta with a surprising amount of hope for its future, and I now leave the second season reasonably satisfied with the fulfillment of that hope. It's hardly the ""World's Strongest"", but I don't think there's any shame in going from Commonplace to Decently Entertaining.

Likely Season 4 Part 2 will end around the equivalent of chapter 131 (out of 139).  For further context, the next episode will start adapting chapter 119.

I was still under the impression that may be they will have everything done this time. But who would pass an opportunity to make more money with a theatrical release for the final finale of this literally titan franchise?

But people will find a way to defend anything.            Meh, pacing is okay as it is now, viewing this part purely on its own merits. Everything is given its proper weight and room to breathe, but nothing feels superfluous. What would be an issue is if the studio rushed the rest, but I don’t see them doing that with how they are treating this part, with basically not a panel’s worth of content being left out.   Instead, they seem committed to not finish during this cour… which would kind of suck if I had not already read the manga, but as far how the finished series will look like, it is irrelevant. Without prior knowledge of the source, as anime-only, I tend to not like watching series weekly anyway, and viewing the whole thing at once tends to smooth out a lot of what people might otherwise experience as pacing issues.

Anyone else feel like his death didn't have much of an impact in the anime?  Not to mention there was no time to process it.  I'd say part of it has to do with the stuff they had to cut back in S4 part 1. Granted, he was never that big of a character, but I always felt he and his rivalry with Reiner left a much more lasting impression in the manga. Meanwhile, in the anime, he was always just... kinda there, and while watching the new episode, my sister asked me what the heck Porco meant when he told Reiner ""I was always better than you""     Still, I always found it interesting how the Jaw Titan seems to be the titan of self-sacrifice. Marcel, Ymir, and Porco all gave up their lives to save someone else.   As for the second half, everything about it was great. They did the Paths justice. Heck, direction-wise, the entire episode was such a treat! I can't wait for next week.   EDIT:   I was rewatching the episode and noticed they actually included goth Mikasa and geek Armin from Attack on School Castes when Eren was entering the Paths  I also saw Reiner and co. in a sauna from that one volume cover      Back to top                Display posts from previous: All Posts 1 Day 7 Days 2 Weeks 1 Month 3 Months 6 Months 1 Year Oldest First Newest First              Anime News Network Forum Index     -> Site-related 	  -> Talkback  All times are GMT - 5 HoursGoto page 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 1, 2, 3 ... 10, 11, 12   Next    Page 1 of 12         	              Powered by phpBB © 2001, 2005 phpBB Group           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +       Forum     Jump to: Select a forum   Site-related ---------------- Announcements & The Rules Talkback Encyclopedia Bugs & Technical Questions ANN Feedback   General ---------------- Anime Series Discussion Manga Music Events Novels Video Games Polls Contests and Games   Industry ---------------- Retail   For Subscribers ---------------- Community Feature requests Collection Spotlight Personal Sales     You cannot post new topics in this forumYou cannot reply to topics in this forumYou cannot edit your posts in this forumYou cannot delete your posts in this forumYou cannot vote in polls in this forum                         feature                The Best and Worst of Winter 2022   Apr  6, 10:10                 anime    With the last few episodes trailing into Spring like an April's fool, it's time to look at the final ranking of the Winter 2022 season.

All I can say to that is that MAPPA and Kodansha both better have a game plan for when its fans inevitably charge them for all of the anti-anxiety medication they'll need to be taking if they end up having to wait a whole extra year or two for that movie to get made.             It comes down to how many episodes this ""final"" Final Season has,as currently we're seeing one chapter per episode (plus the OP's visuals and that song) point towards movie.

Likely Season 4 Part 2 will end around the equivalent of chapter 131 (out of 139).  For further context, the next episode will start adapting chapter 119.

But people will find a way to defend anything.            Meh, pacing is okay as it is now, viewing this part purely on its own merits. Everything is given its proper weight and room to breathe, but nothing feels superfluous. What would be an issue is if the studio rushed the rest, but I don’t see them doing that with how they are treating this part, with basically not a panel’s worth of content being left out.   Instead, they seem committed to not finish during this cour… which would kind of suck if I had not already read the manga, but as far how the finished series will look like, it is irrelevant. Without prior knowledge of the source, as anime-only, I tend to not like watching series weekly anyway, and viewing the whole thing at once tends to smooth out a lot of what people might otherwise experience as pacing issues.

Anyone else feel like his death didn't have much of an impact in the anime?  Not to mention there was no time to process it.  I'd say part of it has to do with the stuff they had to cut back in S4 part 1. Granted, he was never that big of a character, but I always felt he and his rivalry with Reiner left a much more lasting impression in the manga. Meanwhile, in the anime, he was always just... kinda there, and while watching the new episode, my sister asked me what the heck Porco meant when he told Reiner ""I was always better than you""     Still, I always found it interesting how the Jaw Titan seems to be the titan of self-sacrifice. Marcel, Ymir, and Porco all gave up their lives to save someone else.   As for the second half, everything about it was great. They did the Paths justice. Heck, direction-wise, the entire episode was such a treat! I can't wait for next week.   EDIT:   I was rewatching the episode and noticed they actually included goth Mikasa and geek Armin from Attack on School Castes when Eren was entering the Paths  I also saw Reiner and co. in a sauna from that one volume cover      Back to top                Display posts from previous: All Posts 1 Day 7 Days 2 Weeks 1 Month 3 Months 6 Months 1 Year Oldest First Newest First              Anime News Network Forum Index     -> Site-related 	  -> Talkback  All times are GMT - 5 HoursGoto page 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 1, 2, 3 ... 10, 11, 12   Next    Page 1 of 12         	              Powered by phpBB © 2001, 2005 phpBB Group           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +       Forum     Jump to: Select a forum   Site-related ---------------- Announcements & The Rules Talkback Encyclopedia Bugs & Technical Questions ANN Feedback   General ---------------- Anime Series Discussion Manga Music Events Novels Video Games Polls Contests and Games   Industry ---------------- Retail   For Subscribers ---------------- Community Feature requests Collection Spotlight Personal Sales     You cannot post new topics in this forumYou cannot reply to topics in this forumYou cannot edit your posts in this forumYou cannot delete your posts in this forumYou cannot vote in polls in this forum                         feature                The Best and Worst of Winter 2022   Apr  6, 10:10                 anime    With the last few episodes trailing into Spring like an April's fool, it's time to look at the final ranking of the Winter 2022 season.

All I can say to that is that MAPPA and Kodansha both better have a game plan for when its fans inevitably charge them for all of the anti-anxiety medication they'll need to be taking if they end up having to wait a whole extra year or two for that movie to get made.             It comes down to how many episodes this ""final"" Final Season has,as currently we're seeing one chapter per episode (plus the OP's visuals and that song) point towards movie.

Likely Season 4 Part 2 will end around the equivalent of chapter 131 (out of 139).  For further context, the next episode will start adapting chapter 119.

But people will find a way to defend anything.            Meh, pacing is okay as it is now, viewing this part purely on its own merits. Everything is given its proper weight and room to breathe, but nothing feels superfluous. What would be an issue is if the studio rushed the rest, but I don’t see them doing that with how they are treating this part, with basically not a panel’s worth of content being left out.   Instead, they seem committed to not finish during this cour… which would kind of suck if I had not already read the manga, but as far how the finished series will look like, it is irrelevant. Without prior knowledge of the source, as anime-only, I tend to not like watching series weekly anyway, and viewing the whole thing at once tends to smooth out a lot of what people might otherwise experience as pacing issues.

Anyone else feel like his death didn't have much of an impact in the anime?  Not to mention there was no time to process it.  I'd say part of it has to do with the stuff they had to cut back in S4 part 1. Granted, he was never that big of a character, but I always felt he and his rivalry with Reiner left a much more lasting impression in the manga. Meanwhile, in the anime, he was always just... kinda there, and while watching the new episode, my sister asked me what the heck Porco meant when he told Reiner ""I was always better than you""     Still, I always found it interesting how the Jaw Titan seems to be the titan of self-sacrifice. Marcel, Ymir, and Porco all gave up their lives to save someone else.   As for the second half, everything about it was great. They did the Paths justice. Heck, direction-wise, the entire episode was such a treat! I can't wait for next week.   EDIT:   I was rewatching the episode and noticed they actually included goth Mikasa and geek Armin from Attack on School Castes when Eren was entering the Paths  I also saw Reiner and co. in a sauna from that one volume cover      Back to top                Display posts from previous: All Posts 1 Day 7 Days 2 Weeks 1 Month 3 Months 6 Months 1 Year Oldest First Newest First              Anime News Network Forum Index     -> Site-related 	  -> Talkback  All times are GMT - 5 HoursGoto page 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 1, 2, 3 ... 10, 11, 12   Next    Page 1 of 12         	              Powered by phpBB © 2001, 2005 phpBB Group           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +       Forum     Jump to: Select a forum   Site-related ---------------- Announcements & The Rules Talkback Encyclopedia Bugs & Technical Questions ANN Feedback   General ---------------- Anime Series Discussion Manga Music Events Novels Video Games Polls Contests and Games   Industry ---------------- Retail   For Subscribers ---------------- Community Feature requests Collection Spotlight Personal Sales     You cannot post new topics in this forumYou cannot reply to topics in this forumYou cannot edit your posts in this forumYou cannot delete your posts in this forumYou cannot vote in polls in this forum                         feature                The Best and Worst of Winter 2022   Apr  6, 10:10                 anime    With the last few episodes trailing into Spring like an April's fool, it's time to look at the final ranking of the Winter 2022 season.

But people will find a way to defend anything.            Meh, pacing is okay as it is now, viewing this part purely on its own merits. Everything is given its proper weight and room to breathe, but nothing feels superfluous. What would be an issue is if the studio rushed the rest, but I don’t see them doing that with how they are treating this part, with basically not a panel’s worth of content being left out.   Instead, they seem committed to not finish during this cour… which would kind of suck if I had not already read the manga, but as far how the finished series will look like, it is irrelevant. Without prior knowledge of the source, as anime-only, I tend to not like watching series weekly anyway, and viewing the whole thing at once tends to smooth out a lot of what people might otherwise experience as pacing issues.

Anyone else feel like his death didn't have much of an impact in the anime?  Not to mention there was no time to process it.  I'd say part of it has to do with the stuff they had to cut back in S4 part 1. Granted, he was never that big of a character, but I always felt he and his rivalry with Reiner left a much more lasting impression in the manga. Meanwhile, in the anime, he was always just... kinda there, and while watching the new episode, my sister asked me what the heck Porco meant when he told Reiner ""I was always better than you""     Still, I always found it interesting how the Jaw Titan seems to be the titan of self-sacrifice. Marcel, Ymir, and Porco all gave up their lives to save someone else.   As for the second half, everything about it was great. They did the Paths justice. Heck, direction-wise, the entire episode was such a treat! I can't wait for next week.   EDIT:   I was rewatching the episode and noticed they actually included goth Mikasa and geek Armin from Attack on School Castes when Eren was entering the Paths  I also saw Reiner and co. in a sauna from that one volume cover      Back to top                Display posts from previous: All Posts 1 Day 7 Days 2 Weeks 1 Month 3 Months 6 Months 1 Year Oldest First Newest First              Anime News Network Forum Index     -> Site-related 	  -> Talkback  All times are GMT - 5 HoursGoto page 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 1, 2, 3 ... 10, 11, 12   Next    Page 1 of 12         	              Powered by phpBB © 2001, 2005 phpBB Group           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +       Forum     Jump to: Select a forum   Site-related ---------------- Announcements & The Rules Talkback Encyclopedia Bugs & Technical Questions ANN Feedback   General ---------------- Anime Series Discussion Manga Music Events Novels Video Games Polls Contests and Games   Industry ---------------- Retail   For Subscribers ---------------- Community Feature requests Collection Spotlight Personal Sales     You cannot post new topics in this forumYou cannot reply to topics in this forumYou cannot edit your posts in this forumYou cannot delete your posts in this forumYou cannot vote in polls in this forum                         feature                The Best and Worst of Winter 2022   Apr  6, 10:10                 anime    With the last few episodes trailing into Spring like an April's fool, it's time to look at the final ranking of the Winter 2022 season.

Anyone else feel like his death didn't have much of an impact in the anime?  Not to mention there was no time to process it.  I'd say part of it has to do with the stuff they had to cut back in S4 part 1. Granted, he was never that big of a character, but I always felt he and his rivalry with Reiner left a much more lasting impression in the manga. Meanwhile, in the anime, he was always just... kinda there, and while watching the new episode, my sister asked me what the heck Porco meant when he told Reiner ""I was always better than you""     Still, I always found it interesting how the Jaw Titan seems to be the titan of self-sacrifice. Marcel, Ymir, and Porco all gave up their lives to save someone else.   As for the second half, everything about it was great. They did the Paths justice. Heck, direction-wise, the entire episode was such a treat! I can't wait for next week.   EDIT:   I was rewatching the episode and noticed they actually included goth Mikasa and geek Armin from Attack on School Castes when Eren was entering the Paths  I also saw Reiner and co. in a sauna from that one volume cover      Back to top                Display posts from previous: All Posts 1 Day 7 Days 2 Weeks 1 Month 3 Months 6 Months 1 Year Oldest First Newest First              Anime News Network Forum Index     -> Site-related 	  -> Talkback  All times are GMT - 5 HoursGoto page 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 1, 2, 3 ... 10, 11, 12   Next    Page 1 of 12         	              Powered by phpBB © 2001, 2005 phpBB Group      ",positive,en,{}

Anyone else feel like his death didn't have much of an impact in the anime?  Not to mention there was no time to process it.  I'd say part of it has to do with the stuff they had to cut back in S4 part 1. Granted, he was never that big of a character, but I always felt he and his rivalry with Reiner left a much more lasting impression in the manga. Meanwhile, in the anime, he was always just... kinda there, and while watching the new episode, my sister asked me what the heck Porco meant when he told Reiner ""I was always better than you""     Still, I always found it interesting how the Jaw Titan seems to be the titan of self-sacrifice. Marcel, Ymir, and Porco all gave up their lives to save someone else.   As for the second half, everything about it was great. They did the Paths justice. Heck, direction-wise, the entire episode was such a treat! I can't wait for next week.   EDIT:   I was rewatching the episode and noticed they actually included goth Mikasa and geek Armin from Attack on School Castes when Eren was entering the Paths  I also saw Reiner and co. in a sauna from that one volume cover      Back to top                Display posts from previous: All Posts 1 Day 7 Days 2 Weeks 1 Month 3 Months 6 Months 1 Year Oldest First Newest First              Anime News Network Forum Index     -> Site-related 	  -> Talkback  All times are GMT - 5 HoursGoto page 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 1, 2, 3 ... 10, 11, 12   Next    Page 1 of 12         	              Powered by phpBB © 2001, 2005 phpBB Group    ",positive,en,{}

News Witch Hat Atelier Manga Gets Anime   posted on 2022-04-05 23:36 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         Teaser video, commemorative art unveiled    The official website of Kodansha's Morning two magazine announced on Tuesday that Kamome Shirahama's Witch Hat Atelier manga is getting an anime adaptation. A special website opened and unveiled a teaser video:       Shirahama drew an illustration to commemorate the anime's announcement:     The website will reveal more details including the broadcast premiere at a later date.    The manga's story centers on Koko, a girl who lives in a little village, and who has always dreamed of becoming a wizard. But being born without magical aptitude meant that she could never become a wizard, and could never hope to witness magic's spark. She gave up on her dream. But one day, a traveling wizard named Kiefley came to her village, and she happened to see him performing magic.    Shirahama launched the manga in Morning two in July 2016. Kodansha published the manga's ninth compiled book volume in July 2021. Kodansha Comics began releasing the series in English in April 2019.    The manga has over 2.5 million copies in circulation worldwide.    The series was nominated for the Best Comic award at Angoulême International Comics Festival in January 2019. The manga was also nominated for the 11th Manga Taisho awards in 2018. The series ranked in the top 10 on the list of the best manga for male readers in the 2018 edition of Takarajimasha's Kono Manga ga Sugoi! (This Manga Is Amazing!) guidebook. The manga ranked on American Library Association's (ALA's) Young Adult Library Services Association (YALSA) Top Ten Great Graphic Novels for Teens list in 2020. The series won Best Manga at the Harvey Awards in October 2020.

News Witch Hat Atelier Manga Gets Anime   posted on 2022-04-05 23:36 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         Teaser video, commemorative art unveiled    The official website of Kodansha's Morning two magazine announced on Tuesday that Kamome Shirahama's Witch Hat Atelier manga is getting an anime adaptation. A special website opened and unveiled a teaser video:       Shirahama drew an illustration to commemorate the anime's announcement:     The website will reveal more details including the broadcast premiere at a later date.    The manga's story centers on Koko, a girl who lives in a little village, and who has always dreamed of becoming a wizard. But being born without magical aptitude meant that she could never become a wizard, and could never hope to witness magic's spark. She gave up on her dream. But one day, a traveling wizard named Kiefley came to her village, and she happened to see him performing magic.    Shirahama launched the manga in Morning two in July 2016. Kodansha published the manga's ninth compiled book volume in July 2021. Kodansha Comics began releasing the series in English in April 2019.    The manga has over 2.5 million copies in circulation worldwide.    The series was nominated for the Best Comic award at Angoulême International Comics Festival in January 2019. The manga was also nominated for the 11th Manga Taisho awards in 2018. The series ranked in the top 10 on the list of the best manga for male readers in the 2018 edition of Takarajimasha's Kono Manga ga Sugoi! (This Manga Is Amazing!) guidebook. The manga ranked on American Library Association's (ALA's) Young Adult Library Services Association (YALSA) Top Ten Great Graphic Novels for Teens list in 2020. The series won Best Manga at the Harvey Awards in October 2020.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Love All Play   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Love All Play ?                     Community score: 2.8              What is this?   Ryō Mizushima joined his middle school's badminton team full of motivation — but without a proper coach, ended up in obscurity. Nevertheless, he did eventually reach the prefectural tournament on his physical strength. Now he joins the prestigious Yokohama-Minato High School's badminton team under the legendary coach Ebihara and surrounded by talented teammates. He strives to become a top athlete and take his high school team to the inter-high tournament.    Love All Play is based on Asami Koseki's badminton novel and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Love All Play? More like Love No Play! Ha! I crack myself up. So clever. Because for a series about badminton, there sure are no badminton matches in the first episode!! Okay, maybe that wasn't that funny, but what can I say? When as little happens in an entire episode as with this one, my brain has way too much time to come up with corny dad jokes.    One thing I can say about Love All Play is that it is grounded. Very, very grounded. Pretty much every part of the first episode – from the recruiter talking to Ryo about going to play at Yokohama-Minato, to Ryo feeling torn about whether to go to a different school from his friends, to him having to convince his parents – plays out pretty much exactly how something like this would happen in real life. On the one hand, that can be nice; a lot of recent sports series lean on exaggerated personalities or narrative contrivances, so one with both feet firmly set in reality is refreshing, in a way. Ryo is a nice kid with nice friends who care about him, even as they're a bit upset and jealous that he got recruited for such a prestigious school. His parents don't want him to go to school purely on a sports recommendation instead of academic reasons, which is frustrating to him but fair. He has an older sister who supports and sticks up for him. He goes running to clear his head when he has a tough decision to make.    Yep, it's all pretty realistic… which is both a blessing and a curse. The script doesn't elide or exaggerate any of it, turning to neither narrative shorthand nor convenience. It depicts every detail so doggedly that I'm almost surprised it doesn't take place in real-time, or include Ryo attending class, walking home, futzing on his phone while pooping, and so on. There had to be some places to cut without diluting the emotional impact! Instead, it just drags on and on, going so long that the episode ends without Ryo ever actually touching a shuttlecock.    I really did want to see some badminton! The animation is smooth and glossy, lifelike with just the right amount of detail. Ryo's future teammates did seem a bit stock (you know they're teammates because they show up in the theme songs), but I wanted to know what the deal was with their future sempai, a talented semi-celebrity who, based on the way he scowls at the newcomers, probably has a bad attitude. But I can't really see myself watching further, so I guess I'll never find out.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Love All Play is a sports anime focusing on badminton, yet its first episode has very little badminton in it. While it may sound counter-intuitive, this is a great choice. All too many sports anime these days split their first episodes between introducing their main character and the sport itself—doing neither particularly well in the process. Here's the thing I think many creators miss about sports anime: it's not the sport that makes the show interesting, its the people playing the sport that do. The sport is the framework used to explore and resolve human drama. If you don't care about the characters, it doesn't matter how well-animated or tense your sports scenes are.    Love All Play takes this lesson to heart. It spends its time establishing our main character Ryou, his environment, and the fact that he stands at the first major crossroads of his young adult life: choosing his high school. Peer pressure is a real thing that can have an invisible yet significant influence on one's decision, and we see that in full effect as his friends want him to go with them to a mid-level school and continue the status quo—because of course they do. On the other hand, Coach Ebihara wants Ryou at his high-level private school enough that he offers a sports scholarship, but Ryou's father is against Ryou taking it as he had one in college but got injured—and is now forcing his past insecurities onto his son.    Yet, as Ryou tries to sort through all this pressure, there is at least one person who wants to guide him without adding more stress to the pile: his sister. She makes him focus on the real question—i.e., what he wants to do rather than what he feels pressured to do—and intercedes with their family to give him the space to do so. This is solid human drama and the fact that it is not resolved in the most obvious way only makes things better.    All that said, the final scene of the show put a bit of a damper on my excitement. As we watch Ryou be introduced to his new teammates, it's hard not to notice that each of them is very much a walking cliché. We have the energetic guy, the silly twins, the cool/stoic guy, and the over-serious rival. Ending on something so bog-standard after something so above average leaves me worrying that the best is now behind us—but I truly hope that's not the case.        James Beckett  Rating:               By the looks of its premiere, Love All Play is a decent-looking series that showcases a team of likeable boys playing badminton. I was not aware that badminton was such a well-established sports institution that it would demand multiple anime adaptations, but between this, Hanebad!, and that Salaryman's Club show from just earlier this year, I guess fans around the world must be simmering with shuttlecock fever? That's all well and good, so far as I'm concerned, because I figure every sport deserves its day in the anime adaptation spotlight, no matter how niche they might seem to an inside boy like me.    My main issue with Love All Play is that, outside of depicting a unique sport that I'm sure will be interesting to longtime players or interested newcomers, the show doesn't have much else to offer for folks in the audience that want a good story to go along with all of the rackets and volleys. Our main character, Ryo, is defined by his meekness and general lack of ambition, and this whole first episode is focused on the “drama” of him trying to decide whether or not to join the premiere badminton team at the ritzy Yokohama Minato High School. There's some minor, barely addressed conflict concerning Ryo leaving his original badminton buddy behind, but it doesn't go anywhere interesting, and the rest of the dramatics feel forced.    When Ryo's father becomes almost comically angry at the prospect of his son attending a prestigious high school on the strength of his athletic skills, my first thought was “Geez, did a shuttlecock kill his parents in a dark alley, or something?” I wasn't that far off—the guy apparently lost out on a track scholarship because of an injury—but it's never a good sign when your jokey head-canon ends up being more compelling than what's happening on screen. I kind of liked how Ryo's sister stood up to their parents, since I'm always down for wholesome sibling dynamics, but it also serves to emphasize how much of a wet blanket Ryo is.    I get how that's the point of his character arc, and while there's nothing about Ryo's introduction here that is awful, it's nevertheless quite boring, to me. I was especially irritated by the chintzy soundtrack, which kept insisting that Ryo was going through some real intense drama, but c'mon. It's a badminton anime. We all know he's going to play badminton. Let's get on with it. If any of you Sports Boy Anime fans keep up with this one, let me know if it develops any of that missing spark in the coming weeks. Otherwise, I'll be moving on to [insert clever badminton related pun here].        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               There's something...off about this premiere, though not in a particularly intriguing way. Have you ever sat down to type something on your computer, not paying a lot of attention, then suddenly realize your fingers were just off the home row keys, and you've been typing gibberish in the shape of regular words? That's the feeling I got watching this premiere. It wears the form and performs the expected movements of an average high-school sports show, but somewhere in its construction things didn't mesh properly, and the result is an uncomfortably stiff and empty start to what looks to be a perfectly middling badminton show.    Part of the problem is that across this whole premiere, there's maybe a combined 45 seconds of badminton action if you don't count the opening animation. That's just not going to cut it if you want to get the audience invested in your particular sport, and what we get instead is a flat and inert little drama about our nondescript main boy wavering over taking a sports recommendation to a big fancy school. And the scant few moments of sports action we do get are just...not right. For all its flaws, last season's Salaryman's Club was able to capture the impact, speed, and high-octane energy of high-level badminton matches. Here, things are stiff and slow by comparison, and it makes it a lot harder to buy into how our wet noodle protagonist just loves badminton so, so much.    Though those sequences are likely a product of an overall struggling production. Even with the lack of any big set pieces, the rest of this episode struggles with pretty much any movement, up to and including characters talking. There's a stiffness to everyone's body language and faces that prevents them from ever feeling expressive, and a strangely slow pace to the editing that makes any conversation feel more disjointed than it should. Taken together you have a character drama where none of the dialogue feels right, and the result is oddly alienating for such a mundane show. Even if these characters weren't already dull as dirt, that would kill basically any dramatic potential all on its own.    As always, my benchmark for a sports show is if I'd rather watch another episode, or just watch the real-life sport it's showcasing for the same amount of time. I'm by no means a badminton expert, but I would most certainly rather watch a match than sit through another episode of Love All Play going through the motions.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Some first episodes throw you right into the action. This is not one of them. That's not inherently a bad thing, though – Love All Play opts to start by establishing its protagonist and his situation, and since that stands to be a major factor in how he fits in (or doesn't) with the badminton team he's going to be a part of in high school, it feels like the right approach. Ryo only started playing the sport in middle school, and that's only because his best friend got suckered by the cute girls' team, so it really does feel like a shock that he gets scouted by an elite high school for a sports recommendation. If he accepts, he'll get to bypass the entrance exam, which as all seasoned anime viewers know is a lot of stress taken off of his plate.    What I like about this episode is that the recommendation doesn't immediately solve all of Ryo's problems. If anything, it creates more of them, because not only is he at risk of alienating his friends who didn't get offers, but his parents, rather than being happy for him, angrily tell him that he's not accepting the recommendation. This feels like the most surprising element of the episode, and even if his dad has decent reasons for his veto (Mom just seems to be going along with Dad, and that almost makes me angrier), he's still actively crushing his son's opportunities. It's older sister Rika who wins the family MVP award as the only person who's thinking about what Ryo might want and being supportive of his choices.    That feels like foreshadowing, because Ryo's first meeting with his new high school team (as a special invitation for five lucky middle schoolers before they enroll) looks like it could be rocky. There aren't really any surprises with the teammates in terms of character; Ryo's idol, Kenta, looks to be a raging asshole, there's a Kageyama lookalike, bouncy twins, and a kindly team captain to round the whole thing out. The badminton angle is at least a slightly less common sport to use (although last season had Ryman's Club, so it's apparently gaining popularity), but otherwise this episode looks to be setting up a regular old sports show. That said, the very introductory nature of the episode means that this is going to require another episode or two to determine how much you'll enjoy it, because this is very much a bare-bones setup. But it looks pretty good (even if it has a fixation on close-ups of faces) and it isn't hard to get behind a character like Ryo. Simply put, there's nothing overtly wrong with this episode even if there's nothing overtly right either, and if you're hankering for some boys playing sports in shorts, this very well might fit the bill.     discuss this in the forum (112 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature                The Best and Worst of Winter 2022   Apr  6, 10:10                 anime    With the last few episodes trailing into Spring like an April's fool, it's time to look at the final ranking of the Winter 2022 season.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Love All Play   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Love All Play ?                     Community score: 2.8              What is this?   Ryō Mizushima joined his middle school's badminton team full of motivation — but without a proper coach, ended up in obscurity. Nevertheless, he did eventually reach the prefectural tournament on his physical strength. Now he joins the prestigious Yokohama-Minato High School's badminton team under the legendary coach Ebihara and surrounded by talented teammates. He strives to become a top athlete and take his high school team to the inter-high tournament.    Love All Play is based on Asami Koseki's badminton novel and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Love All Play? More like Love No Play! Ha! I crack myself up. So clever. Because for a series about badminton, there sure are no badminton matches in the first episode!! Okay, maybe that wasn't that funny, but what can I say? When as little happens in an entire episode as with this one, my brain has way too much time to come up with corny dad jokes.    One thing I can say about Love All Play is that it is grounded. Very, very grounded. Pretty much every part of the first episode – from the recruiter talking to Ryo about going to play at Yokohama-Minato, to Ryo feeling torn about whether to go to a different school from his friends, to him having to convince his parents – plays out pretty much exactly how something like this would happen in real life. On the one hand, that can be nice; a lot of recent sports series lean on exaggerated personalities or narrative contrivances, so one with both feet firmly set in reality is refreshing, in a way. Ryo is a nice kid with nice friends who care about him, even as they're a bit upset and jealous that he got recruited for such a prestigious school. His parents don't want him to go to school purely on a sports recommendation instead of academic reasons, which is frustrating to him but fair. He has an older sister who supports and sticks up for him. He goes running to clear his head when he has a tough decision to make.    Yep, it's all pretty realistic… which is both a blessing and a curse. The script doesn't elide or exaggerate any of it, turning to neither narrative shorthand nor convenience. It depicts every detail so doggedly that I'm almost surprised it doesn't take place in real-time, or include Ryo attending class, walking home, futzing on his phone while pooping, and so on. There had to be some places to cut without diluting the emotional impact! Instead, it just drags on and on, going so long that the episode ends without Ryo ever actually touching a shuttlecock.    I really did want to see some badminton! The animation is smooth and glossy, lifelike with just the right amount of detail. Ryo's future teammates did seem a bit stock (you know they're teammates because they show up in the theme songs), but I wanted to know what the deal was with their future sempai, a talented semi-celebrity who, based on the way he scowls at the newcomers, probably has a bad attitude. But I can't really see myself watching further, so I guess I'll never find out.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Love All Play is a sports anime focusing on badminton, yet its first episode has very little badminton in it. While it may sound counter-intuitive, this is a great choice. All too many sports anime these days split their first episodes between introducing their main character and the sport itself—doing neither particularly well in the process. Here's the thing I think many creators miss about sports anime: it's not the sport that makes the show interesting, its the people playing the sport that do. The sport is the framework used to explore and resolve human drama. If you don't care about the characters, it doesn't matter how well-animated or tense your sports scenes are.    Love All Play takes this lesson to heart. It spends its time establishing our main character Ryou, his environment, and the fact that he stands at the first major crossroads of his young adult life: choosing his high school. Peer pressure is a real thing that can have an invisible yet significant influence on one's decision, and we see that in full effect as his friends want him to go with them to a mid-level school and continue the status quo—because of course they do. On the other hand, Coach Ebihara wants Ryou at his high-level private school enough that he offers a sports scholarship, but Ryou's father is against Ryou taking it as he had one in college but got injured—and is now forcing his past insecurities onto his son.    Yet, as Ryou tries to sort through all this pressure, there is at least one person who wants to guide him without adding more stress to the pile: his sister. She makes him focus on the real question—i.e., what he wants to do rather than what he feels pressured to do—and intercedes with their family to give him the space to do so. This is solid human drama and the fact that it is not resolved in the most obvious way only makes things better.    All that said, the final scene of the show put a bit of a damper on my excitement. As we watch Ryou be introduced to his new teammates, it's hard not to notice that each of them is very much a walking cliché. We have the energetic guy, the silly twins, the cool/stoic guy, and the over-serious rival. Ending on something so bog-standard after something so above average leaves me worrying that the best is now behind us—but I truly hope that's not the case.        James Beckett  Rating:               By the looks of its premiere, Love All Play is a decent-looking series that showcases a team of likeable boys playing badminton. I was not aware that badminton was such a well-established sports institution that it would demand multiple anime adaptations, but between this, Hanebad!, and that Salaryman's Club show from just earlier this year, I guess fans around the world must be simmering with shuttlecock fever? That's all well and good, so far as I'm concerned, because I figure every sport deserves its day in the anime adaptation spotlight, no matter how niche they might seem to an inside boy like me.    My main issue with Love All Play is that, outside of depicting a unique sport that I'm sure will be interesting to longtime players or interested newcomers, the show doesn't have much else to offer for folks in the audience that want a good story to go along with all of the rackets and volleys. Our main character, Ryo, is defined by his meekness and general lack of ambition, and this whole first episode is focused on the “drama” of him trying to decide whether or not to join the premiere badminton team at the ritzy Yokohama Minato High School. There's some minor, barely addressed conflict concerning Ryo leaving his original badminton buddy behind, but it doesn't go anywhere interesting, and the rest of the dramatics feel forced.    When Ryo's father becomes almost comically angry at the prospect of his son attending a prestigious high school on the strength of his athletic skills, my first thought was “Geez, did a shuttlecock kill his parents in a dark alley, or something?” I wasn't that far off—the guy apparently lost out on a track scholarship because of an injury—but it's never a good sign when your jokey head-canon ends up being more compelling than what's happening on screen. I kind of liked how Ryo's sister stood up to their parents, since I'm always down for wholesome sibling dynamics, but it also serves to emphasize how much of a wet blanket Ryo is.    I get how that's the point of his character arc, and while there's nothing about Ryo's introduction here that is awful, it's nevertheless quite boring, to me. I was especially irritated by the chintzy soundtrack, which kept insisting that Ryo was going through some real intense drama, but c'mon. It's a badminton anime. We all know he's going to play badminton. Let's get on with it. If any of you Sports Boy Anime fans keep up with this one, let me know if it develops any of that missing spark in the coming weeks. Otherwise, I'll be moving on to [insert clever badminton related pun here].        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               There's something...off about this premiere, though not in a particularly intriguing way. Have you ever sat down to type something on your computer, not paying a lot of attention, then suddenly realize your fingers were just off the home row keys, and you've been typing gibberish in the shape of regular words? That's the feeling I got watching this premiere. It wears the form and performs the expected movements of an average high-school sports show, but somewhere in its construction things didn't mesh properly, and the result is an uncomfortably stiff and empty start to what looks to be a perfectly middling badminton show.    Part of the problem is that across this whole premiere, there's maybe a combined 45 seconds of badminton action if you don't count the opening animation. That's just not going to cut it if you want to get the audience invested in your particular sport, and what we get instead is a flat and inert little drama about our nondescript main boy wavering over taking a sports recommendation to a big fancy school. And the scant few moments of sports action we do get are just...not right. For all its flaws, last season's Salaryman's Club was able to capture the impact, speed, and high-octane energy of high-level badminton matches. Here, things are stiff and slow by comparison, and it makes it a lot harder to buy into how our wet noodle protagonist just loves badminton so, so much.    Though those sequences are likely a product of an overall struggling production. Even with the lack of any big set pieces, the rest of this episode struggles with pretty much any movement, up to and including characters talking. There's a stiffness to everyone's body language and faces that prevents them from ever feeling expressive, and a strangely slow pace to the editing that makes any conversation feel more disjointed than it should. Taken together you have a character drama where none of the dialogue feels right, and the result is oddly alienating for such a mundane show. Even if these characters weren't already dull as dirt, that would kill basically any dramatic potential all on its own.    As always, my benchmark for a sports show is if I'd rather watch another episode, or just watch the real-life sport it's showcasing for the same amount of time. I'm by no means a badminton expert, but I would most certainly rather watch a match than sit through another episode of Love All Play going through the motions.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Some first episodes throw you right into the action. This is not one of them. That's not inherently a bad thing, though – Love All Play opts to start by establishing its protagonist and his situation, and since that stands to be a major factor in how he fits in (or doesn't) with the badminton team he's going to be a part of in high school, it feels like the right approach. Ryo only started playing the sport in middle school, and that's only because his best friend got suckered by the cute girls' team, so it really does feel like a shock that he gets scouted by an elite high school for a sports recommendation. If he accepts, he'll get to bypass the entrance exam, which as all seasoned anime viewers know is a lot of stress taken off of his plate.    What I like about this episode is that the recommendation doesn't immediately solve all of Ryo's problems. If anything, it creates more of them, because not only is he at risk of alienating his friends who didn't get offers, but his parents, rather than being happy for him, angrily tell him that he's not accepting the recommendation. This feels like the most surprising element of the episode, and even if his dad has decent reasons for his veto (Mom just seems to be going along with Dad, and that almost makes me angrier), he's still actively crushing his son's opportunities. It's older sister Rika who wins the family MVP award as the only person who's thinking about what Ryo might want and being supportive of his choices.    That feels like foreshadowing, because Ryo's first meeting with his new high school team (as a special invitation for five lucky middle schoolers before they enroll) looks like it could be rocky. There aren't really any surprises with the teammates in terms of character; Ryo's idol, Kenta, looks to be a raging asshole, there's a Kageyama lookalike, bouncy twins, and a kindly team captain to round the whole thing out. The badminton angle is at least a slightly less common sport to use (although last season had Ryman's Club, so it's apparently gaining popularity), but otherwise this episode looks to be setting up a regular old sports show. That said, the very introductory nature of the episode means that this is going to require another episode or two to determine how much you'll enjoy it, because this is very much a bare-bones setup. But it looks pretty good (even if it has a fixation on close-ups of faces) and it isn't hard to get behind a character like Ryo. Simply put, there's nothing overtly wrong with this episode even if there's nothing overtly right either, and if you're hankering for some boys playing sports in shorts, this very well might fit the bill.     discuss this in the forum (112 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature                The Best and Worst of Winter 2022   Apr  6, 10:10                 anime    With the last few episodes trailing into Spring like an April's fool, it's time to look at the final ranking of the Winter 2022 season.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Love All Play   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Love All Play ?                     Community score: 2.8              What is this?   Ryō Mizushima joined his middle school's badminton team full of motivation — but without a proper coach, ended up in obscurity. Nevertheless, he did eventually reach the prefectural tournament on his physical strength. Now he joins the prestigious Yokohama-Minato High School's badminton team under the legendary coach Ebihara and surrounded by talented teammates. He strives to become a top athlete and take his high school team to the inter-high tournament.    Love All Play is based on Asami Koseki's badminton novel and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Love All Play? More like Love No Play! Ha! I crack myself up. So clever. Because for a series about badminton, there sure are no badminton matches in the first episode!! Okay, maybe that wasn't that funny, but what can I say? When as little happens in an entire episode as with this one, my brain has way too much time to come up with corny dad jokes.    One thing I can say about Love All Play is that it is grounded. Very, very grounded. Pretty much every part of the first episode – from the recruiter talking to Ryo about going to play at Yokohama-Minato, to Ryo feeling torn about whether to go to a different school from his friends, to him having to convince his parents – plays out pretty much exactly how something like this would happen in real life. On the one hand, that can be nice; a lot of recent sports series lean on exaggerated personalities or narrative contrivances, so one with both feet firmly set in reality is refreshing, in a way. Ryo is a nice kid with nice friends who care about him, even as they're a bit upset and jealous that he got recruited for such a prestigious school. His parents don't want him to go to school purely on a sports recommendation instead of academic reasons, which is frustrating to him but fair. He has an older sister who supports and sticks up for him. He goes running to clear his head when he has a tough decision to make.    Yep, it's all pretty realistic… which is both a blessing and a curse. The script doesn't elide or exaggerate any of it, turning to neither narrative shorthand nor convenience. It depicts every detail so doggedly that I'm almost surprised it doesn't take place in real-time, or include Ryo attending class, walking home, futzing on his phone while pooping, and so on. There had to be some places to cut without diluting the emotional impact! Instead, it just drags on and on, going so long that the episode ends without Ryo ever actually touching a shuttlecock.    I really did want to see some badminton! The animation is smooth and glossy, lifelike with just the right amount of detail. Ryo's future teammates did seem a bit stock (you know they're teammates because they show up in the theme songs), but I wanted to know what the deal was with their future sempai, a talented semi-celebrity who, based on the way he scowls at the newcomers, probably has a bad attitude. But I can't really see myself watching further, so I guess I'll never find out.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Love All Play is a sports anime focusing on badminton, yet its first episode has very little badminton in it. While it may sound counter-intuitive, this is a great choice. All too many sports anime these days split their first episodes between introducing their main character and the sport itself—doing neither particularly well in the process. Here's the thing I think many creators miss about sports anime: it's not the sport that makes the show interesting, its the people playing the sport that do. The sport is the framework used to explore and resolve human drama. If you don't care about the characters, it doesn't matter how well-animated or tense your sports scenes are.    Love All Play takes this lesson to heart. It spends its time establishing our main character Ryou, his environment, and the fact that he stands at the first major crossroads of his young adult life: choosing his high school. Peer pressure is a real thing that can have an invisible yet significant influence on one's decision, and we see that in full effect as his friends want him to go with them to a mid-level school and continue the status quo—because of course they do. On the other hand, Coach Ebihara wants Ryou at his high-level private school enough that he offers a sports scholarship, but Ryou's father is against Ryou taking it as he had one in college but got injured—and is now forcing his past insecurities onto his son.    Yet, as Ryou tries to sort through all this pressure, there is at least one person who wants to guide him without adding more stress to the pile: his sister. She makes him focus on the real question—i.e., what he wants to do rather than what he feels pressured to do—and intercedes with their family to give him the space to do so. This is solid human drama and the fact that it is not resolved in the most obvious way only makes things better.    All that said, the final scene of the show put a bit of a damper on my excitement. As we watch Ryou be introduced to his new teammates, it's hard not to notice that each of them is very much a walking cliché. We have the energetic guy, the silly twins, the cool/stoic guy, and the over-serious rival. Ending on something so bog-standard after something so above average leaves me worrying that the best is now behind us—but I truly hope that's not the case.        James Beckett  Rating:               By the looks of its premiere, Love All Play is a decent-looking series that showcases a team of likeable boys playing badminton. I was not aware that badminton was such a well-established sports institution that it would demand multiple anime adaptations, but between this, Hanebad!, and that Salaryman's Club show from just earlier this year, I guess fans around the world must be simmering with shuttlecock fever? That's all well and good, so far as I'm concerned, because I figure every sport deserves its day in the anime adaptation spotlight, no matter how niche they might seem to an inside boy like me.    My main issue with Love All Play is that, outside of depicting a unique sport that I'm sure will be interesting to longtime players or interested newcomers, the show doesn't have much else to offer for folks in the audience that want a good story to go along with all of the rackets and volleys. Our main character, Ryo, is defined by his meekness and general lack of ambition, and this whole first episode is focused on the “drama” of him trying to decide whether or not to join the premiere badminton team at the ritzy Yokohama Minato High School. There's some minor, barely addressed conflict concerning Ryo leaving his original badminton buddy behind, but it doesn't go anywhere interesting, and the rest of the dramatics feel forced.    When Ryo's father becomes almost comically angry at the prospect of his son attending a prestigious high school on the strength of his athletic skills, my first thought was “Geez, did a shuttlecock kill his parents in a dark alley, or something?” I wasn't that far off—the guy apparently lost out on a track scholarship because of an injury—but it's never a good sign when your jokey head-canon ends up being more compelling than what's happening on screen. I kind of liked how Ryo's sister stood up to their parents, since I'm always down for wholesome sibling dynamics, but it also serves to emphasize how much of a wet blanket Ryo is.    I get how that's the point of his character arc, and while there's nothing about Ryo's introduction here that is awful, it's nevertheless quite boring, to me. I was especially irritated by the chintzy soundtrack, which kept insisting that Ryo was going through some real intense drama, but c'mon. It's a badminton anime. We all know he's going to play badminton. Let's get on with it. If any of you Sports Boy Anime fans keep up with this one, let me know if it develops any of that missing spark in the coming weeks. Otherwise, I'll be moving on to [insert clever badminton related pun here].        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               There's something...off about this premiere, though not in a particularly intriguing way. Have you ever sat down to type something on your computer, not paying a lot of attention, then suddenly realize your fingers were just off the home row keys, and you've been typing gibberish in the shape of regular words? That's the feeling I got watching this premiere. It wears the form and performs the expected movements of an average high-school sports show, but somewhere in its construction things didn't mesh properly, and the result is an uncomfortably stiff and empty start to what looks to be a perfectly middling badminton show.    Part of the problem is that across this whole premiere, there's maybe a combined 45 seconds of badminton action if you don't count the opening animation. That's just not going to cut it if you want to get the audience invested in your particular sport, and what we get instead is a flat and inert little drama about our nondescript main boy wavering over taking a sports recommendation to a big fancy school. And the scant few moments of sports action we do get are just...not right. For all its flaws, last season's Salaryman's Club was able to capture the impact, speed, and high-octane energy of high-level badminton matches. Here, things are stiff and slow by comparison, and it makes it a lot harder to buy into how our wet noodle protagonist just loves badminton so, so much.    Though those sequences are likely a product of an overall struggling production. Even with the lack of any big set pieces, the rest of this episode struggles with pretty much any movement, up to and including characters talking. There's a stiffness to everyone's body language and faces that prevents them from ever feeling expressive, and a strangely slow pace to the editing that makes any conversation feel more disjointed than it should. Taken together you have a character drama where none of the dialogue feels right, and the result is oddly alienating for such a mundane show. Even if these characters weren't already dull as dirt, that would kill basically any dramatic potential all on its own.    As always, my benchmark for a sports show is if I'd rather watch another episode, or just watch the real-life sport it's showcasing for the same amount of time. I'm by no means a badminton expert, but I would most certainly rather watch a match than sit through another episode of Love All Play going through the motions.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Some first episodes throw you right into the action. This is not one of them. That's not inherently a bad thing, though – Love All Play opts to start by establishing its protagonist and his situation, and since that stands to be a major factor in how he fits in (or doesn't) with the badminton team he's going to be a part of in high school, it feels like the right approach. Ryo only started playing the sport in middle school, and that's only because his best friend got suckered by the cute girls' team, so it really does feel like a shock that he gets scouted by an elite high school for a sports recommendation. If he accepts, he'll get to bypass the entrance exam, which as all seasoned anime viewers know is a lot of stress taken off of his plate.    What I like about this episode is that the recommendation doesn't immediately solve all of Ryo's problems. If anything, it creates more of them, because not only is he at risk of alienating his friends who didn't get offers, but his parents, rather than being happy for him, angrily tell him that he's not accepting the recommendation. This feels like the most surprising element of the episode, and even if his dad has decent reasons for his veto (Mom just seems to be going along with Dad, and that almost makes me angrier), he's still actively crushing his son's opportunities. It's older sister Rika who wins the family MVP award as the only person who's thinking about what Ryo might want and being supportive of his choices.    That feels like foreshadowing, because Ryo's first meeting with his new high school team (as a special invitation for five lucky middle schoolers before they enroll) looks like it could be rocky. There aren't really any surprises with the teammates in terms of character; Ryo's idol, Kenta, looks to be a raging asshole, there's a Kageyama lookalike, bouncy twins, and a kindly team captain to round the whole thing out. The badminton angle is at least a slightly less common sport to use (although last season had Ryman's Club, so it's apparently gaining popularity), but otherwise this episode looks to be setting up a regular old sports show. That said, the very introductory nature of the episode means that this is going to require another episode or two to determine how much you'll enjoy it, because this is very much a bare-bones setup. But it looks pretty good (even if it has a fixation on close-ups of faces) and it isn't hard to get behind a character like Ryo. Simply put, there's nothing overtly wrong with this episode even if there's nothing overtly right either, and if you're hankering for some boys playing sports in shorts, this very well might fit the bill.     discuss this in the forum (112 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature                The Best and Worst of Winter 2022   Apr  6, 10:10                 anime    With the last few episodes trailing into Spring like an April's fool, it's time to look at the final ranking of the Winter 2022 season.

It depicts every detail so doggedly that I'm almost surprised it doesn't take place in real-time, or include Ryo attending class, walking home, futzing on his phone while pooping, and so on. There had to be some places to cut without diluting the emotional impact! Instead, it just drags on and on, going so long that the episode ends without Ryo ever actually touching a shuttlecock.    I really did want to see some badminton! The animation is smooth and glossy, lifelike with just the right amount of detail. Ryo's future teammates did seem a bit stock (you know they're teammates because they show up in the theme songs), but I wanted to know what the deal was with their future sempai, a talented semi-celebrity who, based on the way he scowls at the newcomers, probably has a bad attitude. But I can't really see myself watching further, so I guess I'll never find out.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Love All Play is a sports anime focusing on badminton, yet its first episode has very little badminton in it. While it may sound counter-intuitive, this is a great choice. All too many sports anime these days split their first episodes between introducing their main character and the sport itself—doing neither particularly well in the process. Here's the thing I think many creators miss about sports anime: it's not the sport that makes the show interesting, its the people playing the sport that do. The sport is the framework used to explore and resolve human drama. If you don't care about the characters, it doesn't matter how well-animated or tense your sports scenes are.    Love All Play takes this lesson to heart. It spends its time establishing our main character Ryou, his environment, and the fact that he stands at the first major crossroads of his young adult life: choosing his high school. Peer pressure is a real thing that can have an invisible yet significant influence on one's decision, and we see that in full effect as his friends want him to go with them to a mid-level school and continue the status quo—because of course they do. On the other hand, Coach Ebihara wants Ryou at his high-level private school enough that he offers a sports scholarship, but Ryou's father is against Ryou taking it as he had one in college but got injured—and is now forcing his past insecurities onto his son.    Yet, as Ryou tries to sort through all this pressure, there is at least one person who wants to guide him without adding more stress to the pile: his sister. She makes him focus on the real question—i.e., what he wants to do rather than what he feels pressured to do—and intercedes with their family to give him the space to do so. This is solid human drama and the fact that it is not resolved in the most obvious way only makes things better.    All that said, the final scene of the show put a bit of a damper on my excitement. As we watch Ryou be introduced to his new teammates, it's hard not to notice that each of them is very much a walking cliché. We have the energetic guy, the silly twins, the cool/stoic guy, and the over-serious rival. Ending on something so bog-standard after something so above average leaves me worrying that the best is now behind us—but I truly hope that's not the case.        James Beckett  Rating:               By the looks of its premiere, Love All Play is a decent-looking series that showcases a team of likeable boys playing badminton. I was not aware that badminton was such a well-established sports institution that it would demand multiple anime adaptations, but between this, Hanebad!, and that Salaryman's Club show from just earlier this year, I guess fans around the world must be simmering with shuttlecock fever? That's all well and good, so far as I'm concerned, because I figure every sport deserves its day in the anime adaptation spotlight, no matter how niche they might seem to an inside boy like me.    My main issue with Love All Play is that, outside of depicting a unique sport that I'm sure will be interesting to longtime players or interested newcomers, the show doesn't have much else to offer for folks in the audience that want a good story to go along with all of the rackets and volleys. Our main character, Ryo, is defined by his meekness and general lack of ambition, and this whole first episode is focused on the “drama” of him trying to decide whether or not to join the premiere badminton team at the ritzy Yokohama Minato High School. There's some minor, barely addressed conflict concerning Ryo leaving his original badminton buddy behind, but it doesn't go anywhere interesting, and the rest of the dramatics feel forced.    When Ryo's father becomes almost comically angry at the prospect of his son attending a prestigious high school on the strength of his athletic skills, my first thought was “Geez, did a shuttlecock kill his parents in a dark alley, or something?” I wasn't that far off—the guy apparently lost out on a track scholarship because of an injury—but it's never a good sign when your jokey head-canon ends up being more compelling than what's happening on screen. I kind of liked how Ryo's sister stood up to their parents, since I'm always down for wholesome sibling dynamics, but it also serves to emphasize how much of a wet blanket Ryo is.    I get how that's the point of his character arc, and while there's nothing about Ryo's introduction here that is awful, it's nevertheless quite boring, to me. I was especially irritated by the chintzy soundtrack, which kept insisting that Ryo was going through some real intense drama, but c'mon. It's a badminton anime. We all know he's going to play badminton. Let's get on with it. If any of you Sports Boy Anime fans keep up with this one, let me know if it develops any of that missing spark in the coming weeks. Otherwise, I'll be moving on to [insert clever badminton related pun here].        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               There's something...off about this premiere, though not in a particularly intriguing way. Have you ever sat down to type something on your computer, not paying a lot of attention, then suddenly realize your fingers were just off the home row keys, and you've been typing gibberish in the shape of regular words? That's the feeling I got watching this premiere. It wears the form and performs the expected movements of an average high-school sports show, but somewhere in its construction things didn't mesh properly, and the result is an uncomfortably stiff and empty start to what looks to be a perfectly middling badminton show.    Part of the problem is that across this whole premiere, there's maybe a combined 45 seconds of badminton action if you don't count the opening animation. That's just not going to cut it if you want to get the audience invested in your particular sport, and what we get instead is a flat and inert little drama about our nondescript main boy wavering over taking a sports recommendation to a big fancy school. And the scant few moments of sports action we do get are just...not right. For all its flaws, last season's Salaryman's Club was able to capture the impact, speed, and high-octane energy of high-level badminton matches. Here, things are stiff and slow by comparison, and it makes it a lot harder to buy into how our wet noodle protagonist just loves badminton so, so much.    Though those sequences are likely a product of an overall struggling production. Even with the lack of any big set pieces, the rest of this episode struggles with pretty much any movement, up to and including characters talking. There's a stiffness to everyone's body language and faces that prevents them from ever feeling expressive, and a strangely slow pace to the editing that makes any conversation feel more disjointed than it should. Taken together you have a character drama where none of the dialogue feels right, and the result is oddly alienating for such a mundane show. Even if these characters weren't already dull as dirt, that would kill basically any dramatic potential all on its own.    As always, my benchmark for a sports show is if I'd rather watch another episode, or just watch the real-life sport it's showcasing for the same amount of time. I'm by no means a badminton expert, but I would most certainly rather watch a match than sit through another episode of Love All Play going through the motions.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Some first episodes throw you right into the action. This is not one of them. That's not inherently a bad thing, though – Love All Play opts to start by establishing its protagonist and his situation, and since that stands to be a major factor in how he fits in (or doesn't) with the badminton team he's going to be a part of in high school, it feels like the right approach. Ryo only started playing the sport in middle school, and that's only because his best friend got suckered by the cute girls' team, so it really does feel like a shock that he gets scouted by an elite high school for a sports recommendation. If he accepts, he'll get to bypass the entrance exam, which as all seasoned anime viewers know is a lot of stress taken off of his plate.    What I like about this episode is that the recommendation doesn't immediately solve all of Ryo's problems. If anything, it creates more of them, because not only is he at risk of alienating his friends who didn't get offers, but his parents, rather than being happy for him, angrily tell him that he's not accepting the recommendation. This feels like the most surprising element of the episode, and even if his dad has decent reasons for his veto (Mom just seems to be going along with Dad, and that almost makes me angrier), he's still actively crushing his son's opportunities. It's older sister Rika who wins the family MVP award as the only person who's thinking about what Ryo might want and being supportive of his choices.    That feels like foreshadowing, because Ryo's first meeting with his new high school team (as a special invitation for five lucky middle schoolers before they enroll) looks like it could be rocky. There aren't really any surprises with the teammates in terms of character; Ryo's idol, Kenta, looks to be a raging asshole, there's a Kageyama lookalike, bouncy twins, and a kindly team captain to round the whole thing out. The badminton angle is at least a slightly less common sport to use (although last season had Ryman's Club, so it's apparently gaining popularity), but otherwise this episode looks to be setting up a regular old sports show. That said, the very introductory nature of the episode means that this is going to require another episode or two to determine how much you'll enjoy it, because this is very much a bare-bones setup. But it looks pretty good (even if it has a fixation on close-ups of faces) and it isn't hard to get behind a character like Ryo. Simply put, there's nothing overtly wrong with this episode even if there's nothing overtly right either, and if you're hankering for some boys playing sports in shorts, this very well might fit the bill.     discuss this in the forum (112 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature                The Best and Worst of Winter 2022   Apr  6, 10:10                 anime    With the last few episodes trailing into Spring like an April's fool, it's time to look at the final ranking of the Winter 2022 season.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Love All Play   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Love All Play ?                     Community score: 2.8              What is this?   Ryō Mizushima joined his middle school's badminton team full of motivation — but without a proper coach, ended up in obscurity. Nevertheless, he did eventually reach the prefectural tournament on his physical strength. Now he joins the prestigious Yokohama-Minato High School's badminton team under the legendary coach Ebihara and surrounded by talented teammates. He strives to become a top athlete and take his high school team to the inter-high tournament.    Love All Play is based on Asami Koseki's badminton novel and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Love All Play? More like Love No Play! Ha! I crack myself up. So clever. Because for a series about badminton, there sure are no badminton matches in the first episode!! Okay, maybe that wasn't that funny, but what can I say? When as little happens in an entire episode as with this one, my brain has way too much time to come up with corny dad jokes.    One thing I can say about Love All Play is that it is grounded. Very, very grounded. Pretty much every part of the first episode – from the recruiter talking to Ryo about going to play at Yokohama-Minato, to Ryo feeling torn about whether to go to a different school from his friends, to him having to convince his parents – plays out pretty much exactly how something like this would happen in real life. On the one hand, that can be nice; a lot of recent sports series lean on exaggerated personalities or narrative contrivances, so one with both feet firmly set in reality is refreshing, in a way. Ryo is a nice kid with nice friends who care about him, even as they're a bit upset and jealous that he got recruited for such a prestigious school. His parents don't want him to go to school purely on a sports recommendation instead of academic reasons, which is frustrating to him but fair. He has an older sister who supports and sticks up for him. He goes running to clear his head when he has a tough decision to make.    Yep, it's all pretty realistic… which is both a blessing and a curse. The script doesn't elide or exaggerate any of it, turning to neither narrative shorthand nor convenience. It depicts every detail so doggedly that I'm almost surprised it doesn't take place in real-time, or include Ryo attending class, walking home, futzing on his phone while pooping, and so on.

Now he joins the prestigious Yokohama-Minato High School's badminton team under the legendary coach Ebihara and surrounded by talented teammates. He strives to become a top athlete and take his high school team to the inter-high tournament.    Love All Play is based on Asami Koseki's badminton novel and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Love All Play? More like Love No Play! Ha! I crack myself up. So clever. Because for a series about badminton, there sure are no badminton matches in the first episode!! Okay, maybe that wasn't that funny, but what can I say? When as little happens in an entire episode as with this one, my brain has way too much time to come up with corny dad jokes.    One thing I can say about Love All Play is that it is grounded. Very, very grounded. Pretty much every part of the first episode – from the recruiter talking to Ryo about going to play at Yokohama-Minato, to Ryo feeling torn about whether to go to a different school from his friends, to him having to convince his parents – plays out pretty much exactly how something like this would happen in real life. On the one hand, that can be nice; a lot of recent sports series lean on exaggerated personalities or narrative contrivances, so one with both feet firmly set in reality is refreshing, in a way. Ryo is a nice kid with nice friends who care about him, even as they're a bit upset and jealous that he got recruited for such a prestigious school. His parents don't want him to go to school purely on a sports recommendation instead of academic reasons, which is frustrating to him but fair. He has an older sister who supports and sticks up for him. He goes running to clear his head when he has a tough decision to make.    Yep, it's all pretty realistic… which is both a blessing and a curse. The script doesn't elide or exaggerate any of it, turning to neither narrative shorthand nor convenience. It depicts every detail so doggedly that I'm almost surprised it doesn't take place in real-time, or include Ryo attending class, walking home, futzing on his phone while pooping, and so on. There had to be some places to cut without diluting the emotional impact! Instead, it just drags on and on, going so long that the episode ends without Ryo ever actually touching a shuttlecock.    I really did want to see some badminton! The animation is smooth and glossy, lifelike with just the right amount of detail. Ryo's future teammates did seem a bit stock (you know they're teammates because they show up in the theme songs), but I wanted to know what the deal was with their future sempai, a talented semi-celebrity who, based on the way he scowls at the newcomers, probably has a bad attitude. But I can't really see myself watching further, so I guess I'll never find out.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Love All Play is a sports anime focusing on badminton, yet its first episode has very little badminton in it. While it may sound counter-intuitive, this is a great choice. All too many sports anime these days split their first episodes between introducing their main character and the sport itself—doing neither particularly well in the process. Here's the thing I think many creators miss about sports anime: it's not the sport that makes the show interesting, its the people playing the sport that do. The sport is the framework used to explore and resolve human drama. If you don't care about the characters, it doesn't matter how well-animated or tense your sports scenes are.    Love All Play takes this lesson to heart. It spends its time establishing our main character Ryou, his environment, and the fact that he stands at the first major crossroads of his young adult life: choosing his high school. Peer pressure is a real thing that can have an invisible yet significant influence on one's decision, and we see that in full effect as his friends want him to go with them to a mid-level school and continue the status quo—because of course they do. On the other hand, Coach Ebihara wants Ryou at his high-level private school enough that he offers a sports scholarship, but Ryou's father is against Ryou taking it as he had one in college but got injured—and is now forcing his past insecurities onto his son.    Yet, as Ryou tries to sort through all this pressure, there is at least one person who wants to guide him without adding more stress to the pile: his sister. She makes him focus on the real question—i.e., what he wants to do rather than what he feels pressured to do—and intercedes with their family to give him the space to do so. This is solid human drama and the fact that it is not resolved in the most obvious way only makes things better.    All that said, the final scene of the show put a bit of a damper on my excitement. As we watch Ryou be introduced to his new teammates, it's hard not to notice that each of them is very much a walking cliché. We have the energetic guy, the silly twins, the cool/stoic guy, and the over-serious rival. Ending on something so bog-standard after something so above average leaves me worrying that the best is now behind us—but I truly hope that's not the case.        James Beckett  Rating:               By the looks of its premiere, Love All Play is a decent-looking series that showcases a team of likeable boys playing badminton. I was not aware that badminton was such a well-established sports institution that it would demand multiple anime adaptations, but between this, Hanebad!, and that Salaryman's Club show from just earlier this year, I guess fans around the world must be simmering with shuttlecock fever? That's all well and good, so far as I'm concerned, because I figure every sport deserves its day in the anime adaptation spotlight, no matter how niche they might seem to an inside boy like me.    My main issue with Love All Play is that, outside of depicting a unique sport that I'm sure will be interesting to longtime players or interested newcomers, the show doesn't have much else to offer for folks in the audience that want a good story to go along with all of the rackets and volleys. Our main character, Ryo, is defined by his meekness and general lack of ambition, and this whole first episode is focused on the “drama” of him trying to decide whether or not to join the premiere badminton team at the ritzy Yokohama Minato High School. There's some minor, barely addressed conflict concerning Ryo leaving his original badminton buddy behind, but it doesn't go anywhere interesting, and the rest of the dramatics feel forced.    When Ryo's father becomes almost comically angry at the prospect of his son attending a prestigious high school on the strength of his athletic skills, my first thought was “Geez, did a shuttlecock kill his parents in a dark alley, or something?” I wasn't that far off—the guy apparently lost out on a track scholarship because of an injury—but it's never a good sign when your jokey head-canon ends up being more compelling than what's happening on screen. I kind of liked how Ryo's sister stood up to their parents, since I'm always down for wholesome sibling dynamics, but it also serves to emphasize how much of a wet blanket Ryo is.    I get how that's the point of his character arc, and while there's nothing about Ryo's introduction here that is awful, it's nevertheless quite boring, to me. I was especially irritated by the chintzy soundtrack, which kept insisting that Ryo was going through some real intense drama, but c'mon. It's a badminton anime. We all know he's going to play badminton. Let's get on with it. If any of you Sports Boy Anime fans keep up with this one, let me know if it develops any of that missing spark in the coming weeks. Otherwise, I'll be moving on to [insert clever badminton related pun here].        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               There's something...off about this premiere, though not in a particularly intriguing way. Have you ever sat down to type something on your computer, not paying a lot of attention, then suddenly realize your fingers were just off the home row keys, and you've been typing gibberish in the shape of regular words? That's the feeling I got watching this premiere. It wears the form and performs the expected movements of an average high-school sports show, but somewhere in its construction things didn't mesh properly, and the result is an uncomfortably stiff and empty start to what looks to be a perfectly middling badminton show.    Part of the problem is that across this whole premiere, there's maybe a combined 45 seconds of badminton action if you don't count the opening animation. That's just not going to cut it if you want to get the audience invested in your particular sport, and what we get instead is a flat and inert little drama about our nondescript main boy wavering over taking a sports recommendation to a big fancy school. And the scant few moments of sports action we do get are just...not right. For all its flaws, last season's Salaryman's Club was able to capture the impact, speed, and high-octane energy of high-level badminton matches. Here, things are stiff and slow by comparison, and it makes it a lot harder to buy into how our wet noodle protagonist just loves badminton so, so much.    Though those sequences are likely a product of an overall struggling production. Even with the lack of any big set pieces, the rest of this episode struggles with pretty much any movement, up to and including characters talking. There's a stiffness to everyone's body language and faces that prevents them from ever feeling expressive, and a strangely slow pace to the editing that makes any conversation feel more disjointed than it should. Taken together you have a character drama where none of the dialogue feels right, and the result is oddly alienating for such a mundane show. Even if these characters weren't already dull as dirt, that would kill basically any dramatic potential all on its own.    As always, my benchmark for a sports show is if I'd rather watch another episode, or just watch the real-life sport it's showcasing for the same amount of time. I'm by no means a badminton expert, but I would most certainly rather watch a match than sit through another episode of Love All Play going through the motions.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Some first episodes throw you right into the action. This is not one of them. That's not inherently a bad thing, though – Love All Play opts to start by establishing its protagonist and his situation, and since that stands to be a major factor in how he fits in (or doesn't) with the badminton team he's going to be a part of in high school, it feels like the right approach. Ryo only started playing the sport in middle school, and that's only because his best friend got suckered by the cute girls' team, so it really does feel like a shock that he gets scouted by an elite high school for a sports recommendation. If he accepts, he'll get to bypass the entrance exam, which as all seasoned anime viewers know is a lot of stress taken off of his plate.    What I like about this episode is that the recommendation doesn't immediately solve all of Ryo's problems. If anything, it creates more of them, because not only is he at risk of alienating his friends who didn't get offers, but his parents, rather than being happy for him, angrily tell him that he's not accepting the recommendation. This feels like the most surprising element of the episode, and even if his dad has decent reasons for his veto (Mom just seems to be going along with Dad, and that almost makes me angrier), he's still actively crushing his son's opportunities. It's older sister Rika who wins the family MVP award as the only person who's thinking about what Ryo might want and being supportive of his choices.    That feels like foreshadowing, because Ryo's first meeting with his new high school team (as a special invitation for five lucky middle schoolers before they enroll) looks like it could be rocky. There aren't really any surprises with the teammates in terms of character; Ryo's idol, Kenta, looks to be a raging asshole, there's a Kageyama lookalike, bouncy twins, and a kindly team captain to round the whole thing out. The badminton angle is at least a slightly less common sport to use (although last season had Ryman's Club, so it's apparently gaining popularity), but otherwise this episode looks to be setting up a regular old sports show. That said, the very introductory nature of the episode means that this is going to require another episode or two to determine how much you'll enjoy it, because this is very much a bare-bones setup. But it looks pretty good (even if it has a fixation on close-ups of faces) and it isn't hard to get behind a character like Ryo. Simply put, there's nothing overtly wrong with this episode even if there's nothing overtly right either, and if you're hankering for some boys playing sports in shorts, this very well might fit the bill.     discuss this in the forum (112 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More     ",positive,en,{}

Ending on something so bog-standard after something so above average leaves me worrying that the best is now behind us—but I truly hope that's not the case.        James Beckett  Rating:               By the looks of its premiere, Love All Play is a decent-looking series that showcases a team of likeable boys playing badminton. I was not aware that badminton was such a well-established sports institution that it would demand multiple anime adaptations, but between this, Hanebad!, and that Salaryman's Club show from just earlier this year, I guess fans around the world must be simmering with shuttlecock fever? That's all well and good, so far as I'm concerned, because I figure every sport deserves its day in the anime adaptation spotlight, no matter how niche they might seem to an inside boy like me.    My main issue with Love All Play is that, outside of depicting a unique sport that I'm sure will be interesting to longtime players or interested newcomers, the show doesn't have much else to offer for folks in the audience that want a good story to go along with all of the rackets and volleys. Our main character, Ryo, is defined by his meekness and general lack of ambition, and this whole first episode is focused on the “drama” of him trying to decide whether or not to join the premiere badminton team at the ritzy Yokohama Minato High School. There's some minor, barely addressed conflict concerning Ryo leaving his original badminton buddy behind, but it doesn't go anywhere interesting, and the rest of the dramatics feel forced.    When Ryo's father becomes almost comically angry at the prospect of his son attending a prestigious high school on the strength of his athletic skills, my first thought was “Geez, did a shuttlecock kill his parents in a dark alley, or something?” I wasn't that far off—the guy apparently lost out on a track scholarship because of an injury—but it's never a good sign when your jokey head-canon ends up being more compelling than what's happening on screen. I kind of liked how Ryo's sister stood up to their parents, since I'm always down for wholesome sibling dynamics, but it also serves to emphasize how much of a wet blanket Ryo is.    I get how that's the point of his character arc, and while there's nothing about Ryo's introduction here that is awful, it's nevertheless quite boring, to me. I was especially irritated by the chintzy soundtrack, which kept insisting that Ryo was going through some real intense drama, but c'mon. It's a badminton anime. We all know he's going to play badminton. Let's get on with it. If any of you Sports Boy Anime fans keep up with this one, let me know if it develops any of that missing spark in the coming weeks. Otherwise, I'll be moving on to [insert clever badminton related pun here].        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               There's something...off about this premiere, though not in a particularly intriguing way. Have you ever sat down to type something on your computer, not paying a lot of attention, then suddenly realize your fingers were just off the home row keys, and you've been typing gibberish in the shape of regular words? That's the feeling I got watching this premiere. It wears the form and performs the expected movements of an average high-school sports show, but somewhere in its construction things didn't mesh properly, and the result is an uncomfortably stiff and empty start to what looks to be a perfectly middling badminton show.    Part of the problem is that across this whole premiere, there's maybe a combined 45 seconds of badminton action if you don't count the opening animation. That's just not going to cut it if you want to get the audience invested in your particular sport, and what we get instead is a flat and inert little drama about our nondescript main boy wavering over taking a sports recommendation to a big fancy school. And the scant few moments of sports action we do get are just...not right. For all its flaws, last season's Salaryman's Club was able to capture the impact, speed, and high-octane energy of high-level badminton matches. Here, things are stiff and slow by comparison, and it makes it a lot harder to buy into how our wet noodle protagonist just loves badminton so, so much.    Though those sequences are likely a product of an overall struggling production. Even with the lack of any big set pieces, the rest of this episode struggles with pretty much any movement, up to and including characters talking. There's a stiffness to everyone's body language and faces that prevents them from ever feeling expressive, and a strangely slow pace to the editing that makes any conversation feel more disjointed than it should. Taken together you have a character drama where none of the dialogue feels right, and the result is oddly alienating for such a mundane show. Even if these characters weren't already dull as dirt, that would kill basically any dramatic potential all on its own.    As always, my benchmark for a sports show is if I'd rather watch another episode, or just watch the real-life sport it's showcasing for the same amount of time. I'm by no means a badminton expert, but I would most certainly rather watch a match than sit through another episode of Love All Play going through the motions.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Some first episodes throw you right into the action. This is not one of them. That's not inherently a bad thing, though – Love All Play opts to start by establishing its protagonist and his situation, and since that stands to be a major factor in how he fits in (or doesn't) with the badminton team he's going to be a part of in high school, it feels like the right approach. Ryo only started playing the sport in middle school, and that's only because his best friend got suckered by the cute girls' team, so it really does feel like a shock that he gets scouted by an elite high school for a sports recommendation. If he accepts, he'll get to bypass the entrance exam, which as all seasoned anime viewers know is a lot of stress taken off of his plate.    What I like about this episode is that the recommendation doesn't immediately solve all of Ryo's problems. If anything, it creates more of them, because not only is he at risk of alienating his friends who didn't get offers, but his parents, rather than being happy for him, angrily tell him that he's not accepting the recommendation. This feels like the most surprising element of the episode, and even if his dad has decent reasons for his veto (Mom just seems to be going along with Dad, and that almost makes me angrier), he's still actively crushing his son's opportunities. It's older sister Rika who wins the family MVP award as the only person who's thinking about what Ryo might want and being supportive of his choices.    That feels like foreshadowing, because Ryo's first meeting with his new high school team (as a special invitation for five lucky middle schoolers before they enroll) looks like it could be rocky. There aren't really any surprises with the teammates in terms of character; Ryo's idol, Kenta, looks to be a raging asshole, there's a Kageyama lookalike, bouncy twins, and a kindly team captain to round the whole thing out. The badminton angle is at least a slightly less common sport to use (although last season had Ryman's Club, so it's apparently gaining popularity), but otherwise this episode looks to be setting up a regular old sports show. That said, the very introductory nature of the episode means that this is going to require another episode or two to determine how much you'll enjoy it, because this is very much a bare-bones setup. But it looks pretty good (even if it has a fixation on close-ups of faces) and it isn't hard to get behind a character like Ryo. Simply put, there's nothing overtly wrong with this episode even if there's nothing overtly right either, and if you're hankering for some boys playing sports in shorts, this very well might fit the bill.     discuss this in the forum (112 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives     ",positive,en,{}
06-04-2022,anime,5,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/preview-guide/2022/spring/love-all-play/.183508,Love All Play - The Spring 2022 Preview Guide - Anime News Network:SEA,"                 How would you rate episode 1 of Love All Play ?                     Community score: 2.8              What is this?   Ryō Mizushima joined his middle school's badminton team full of motivation — but without a proper coach, ended up in obscurity. Nevertheless, he did eventually reach the prefectural tournament on his physical strength. Now he joins the prestigious Yokohama-Minato High School's badminton team under the legendary coach Ebihara and surrounded by talented teammates. He strives to become a top athlete and take his high school team to the inter-high tournament.    Love All Play is based on Asami Koseki's badminton novel and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Love All Play? More like Love No Play! Ha! I crack myself up. So clever. Because for a series about badminton, there sure are no badminton matches in the first episode!! Okay, maybe that wasn't that funny, but what can I say? When as little happens in an entire episode as with this one, my brain has way too much time to come up with corny dad jokes.    One thing I can say about Love All Play is that it is grounded. Very, very grounded. Pretty much every part of the first episode – from the recruiter talking to Ryo about going to play at Yokohama-Minato, to Ryo feeling torn about whether to go to a different school from his friends, to him having to convince his parents – plays out pretty much exactly how something like this would happen in real life. On the one hand, that can be nice; a lot of recent sports series lean on exaggerated personalities or narrative contrivances, so one with both feet firmly set in reality is refreshing, in a way. Ryo is a nice kid with nice friends who care about him, even as they're a bit upset and jealous that he got recruited for such a prestigious school. His parents don't want him to go to school purely on a sports recommendation instead of academic reasons, which is frustrating to him but fair. He has an older sister who supports and sticks up for him. He goes running to clear his head when he has a tough decision to make.    Yep, it's all pretty realistic… which is both a blessing and a curse. The script doesn't elide or exaggerate any of it, turning to neither narrative shorthand nor convenience. It depicts every detail so doggedly that I'm almost surprised it doesn't take place in real-time, or include Ryo attending class, walking home, futzing on his phone while pooping, and so on. There had to be some places to cut without diluting the emotional impact! Instead, it just drags on and on, going so long that the episode ends without Ryo ever actually touching a shuttlecock.    I really did want to see some badminton! The animation is smooth and glossy, lifelike with just the right amount of detail. Ryo's future teammates did seem a bit stock (you know they're teammates because they show up in the theme songs), but I wanted to know what the deal was with their future sempai, a talented semi-celebrity who, based on the way he scowls at the newcomers, probably has a bad attitude. But I can't really see myself watching further, so I guess I'll never find out.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Love All Play is a sports anime focusing on badminton, yet its first episode has very little badminton in it. While it may sound counter-intuitive, this is a great choice. All too many sports anime these days split their first episodes between introducing their main character and the sport itself—doing neither particularly well in the process. Here's the thing I think many creators miss about sports anime: it's not the sport that makes the show interesting, its the people playing the sport that do. The sport is the framework used to explore and resolve human drama. If you don't care about the characters, it doesn't matter how well-animated or tense your sports scenes are.    Love All Play takes this lesson to heart. It spends its time establishing our main character Ryou, his environment, and the fact that he stands at the first major crossroads of his young adult life: choosing his high school. Peer pressure is a real thing that can have an invisible yet significant influence on one's decision, and we see that in full effect as his friends want him to go with them to a mid-level school and continue the status quo—because of course they do. On the other hand, Coach Ebihara wants Ryou at his high-level private school enough that he offers a sports scholarship, but Ryou's father is against Ryou taking it as he had one in college but got injured—and is now forcing his past insecurities onto his son.    Yet, as Ryou tries to sort through all this pressure, there is at least one person who wants to guide him without adding more stress to the pile: his sister. She makes him focus on the real question—i.e., what he wants to do rather than what he feels pressured to do—and intercedes with their family to give him the space to do so. This is solid human drama and the fact that it is not resolved in the most obvious way only makes things better.    All that said, the final scene of the show put a bit of a damper on my excitement. As we watch Ryou be introduced to his new teammates, it's hard not to notice that each of them is very much a walking cliché. We have the energetic guy, the silly twins, the cool/stoic guy, and the over-serious rival. Ending on something so bog-standard after something so above average leaves me worrying that the best is now behind us—but I truly hope that's not the case.

That's not inherently a bad thing, though – Love All Play opts to start by establishing its protagonist and his situation, and since that stands to be a major factor in how he fits in (or doesn't) with the badminton team he's going to be a part of in high school, it feels like the right approach. Ryo only started playing the sport in middle school, and that's only because his best friend got suckered by the cute girls' team, so it really does feel like a shock that he gets scouted by an elite high school for a sports recommendation. If he accepts, he'll get to bypass the entrance exam, which as all seasoned anime viewers know is a lot of stress taken off of his plate.    What I like about this episode is that the recommendation doesn't immediately solve all of Ryo's problems. If anything, it creates more of them, because not only is he at risk of alienating his friends who didn't get offers, but his parents, rather than being happy for him, angrily tell him that he's not accepting the recommendation. This feels like the most surprising element of the episode, and even if his dad has decent reasons for his veto (Mom just seems to be going along with Dad, and that almost makes me angrier), he's still actively crushing his son's opportunities. It's older sister Rika who wins the family MVP award as the only person who's thinking about what Ryo might want and being supportive of his choices.    That feels like foreshadowing, because Ryo's first meeting with his new high school team (as a special invitation for five lucky middle schoolers before they enroll) looks like it could be rocky. There aren't really any surprises with the teammates in terms of character; Ryo's idol, Kenta, looks to be a raging asshole, there's a Kageyama lookalike, bouncy twins, and a kindly team captain to round the whole thing out. The badminton angle is at least a slightly less common sport to use (although last season had Ryman's Club, so it's apparently gaining popularity), but otherwise this episode looks to be setting up a regular old sports show. That said, the very introductory nature of the episode means that this is going to require another episode or two to determine how much you'll enjoy it, because this is very much a bare-bones setup. But it looks pretty good (even if it has a fixation on close-ups of faces) and it isn't hard to get behind a character like Ryo. Simply put, there's nothing overtly wrong with this episode even if there's nothing overtly right either, and if you're hankering for some boys playing sports in shorts, this very well might fit the bill.     discuss this in the forum (112 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives   ",positive,en,{}
06-04-2022,anime,5,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/preview-guide/2022/spring/love-all-play/.183508,Love All Play - The Spring 2022 Preview Guide - Anime News Network:SEA,"             How would you rate episode 1 of Love All Play ?                     Community score: 2.8              What is this?   Ryō Mizushima joined his middle school's badminton team full of motivation — but without a proper coach, ended up in obscurity. Nevertheless, he did eventually reach the prefectural tournament on his physical strength. Now he joins the prestigious Yokohama-Minato High School's badminton team under the legendary coach Ebihara and surrounded by talented teammates. He strives to become a top athlete and take his high school team to the inter-high tournament.    Love All Play is based on Asami Koseki's badminton novel and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Love All Play? More like Love No Play! Ha! I crack myself up. So clever. Because for a series about badminton, there sure are no badminton matches in the first episode!! Okay, maybe that wasn't that funny, but what can I say? When as little happens in an entire episode as with this one, my brain has way too much time to come up with corny dad jokes.    One thing I can say about Love All Play is that it is grounded. Very, very grounded. Pretty much every part of the first episode – from the recruiter talking to Ryo about going to play at Yokohama-Minato, to Ryo feeling torn about whether to go to a different school from his friends, to him having to convince his parents – plays out pretty much exactly how something like this would happen in real life. On the one hand, that can be nice; a lot of recent sports series lean on exaggerated personalities or narrative contrivances, so one with both feet firmly set in reality is refreshing, in a way. Ryo is a nice kid with nice friends who care about him, even as they're a bit upset and jealous that he got recruited for such a prestigious school. His parents don't want him to go to school purely on a sports recommendation instead of academic reasons, which is frustrating to him but fair. He has an older sister who supports and sticks up for him. He goes running to clear his head when he has a tough decision to make.    Yep, it's all pretty realistic… which is both a blessing and a curse. The script doesn't elide or exaggerate any of it, turning to neither narrative shorthand nor convenience. It depicts every detail so doggedly that I'm almost surprised it doesn't take place in real-time, or include Ryo attending class, walking home, futzing on his phone while pooping, and so on. There had to be some places to cut without diluting the emotional impact! Instead, it just drags on and on, going so long that the episode ends without Ryo ever actually touching a shuttlecock.    I really did want to see some badminton! The animation is smooth and glossy, lifelike with just the right amount of detail. Ryo's future teammates did seem a bit stock (you know they're teammates because they show up in the theme songs), but I wanted to know what the deal was with their future sempai, a talented semi-celebrity who, based on the way he scowls at the newcomers, probably has a bad attitude. But I can't really see myself watching further, so I guess I'll never find out.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Love All Play is a sports anime focusing on badminton, yet its first episode has very little badminton in it. While it may sound counter-intuitive, this is a great choice. All too many sports anime these days split their first episodes between introducing their main character and the sport itself—doing neither particularly well in the process. Here's the thing I think many creators miss about sports anime: it's not the sport that makes the show interesting, its the people playing the sport that do. The sport is the framework used to explore and resolve human drama. If you don't care about the characters, it doesn't matter how well-animated or tense your sports scenes are.    Love All Play takes this lesson to heart. It spends its time establishing our main character Ryou, his environment, and the fact that he stands at the first major crossroads of his young adult life: choosing his high school. Peer pressure is a real thing that can have an invisible yet significant influence on one's decision, and we see that in full effect as his friends want him to go with them to a mid-level school and continue the status quo—because of course they do. On the other hand, Coach Ebihara wants Ryou at his high-level private school enough that he offers a sports scholarship, but Ryou's father is against Ryou taking it as he had one in college but got injured—and is now forcing his past insecurities onto his son.    Yet, as Ryou tries to sort through all this pressure, there is at least one person who wants to guide him without adding more stress to the pile: his sister. She makes him focus on the real question—i.e., what he wants to do rather than what he feels pressured to do—and intercedes with their family to give him the space to do so. This is solid human drama and the fact that it is not resolved in the most obvious way only makes things better.    All that said, the final scene of the show put a bit of a damper on my excitement. As we watch Ryou be introduced to his new teammates, it's hard not to notice that each of them is very much a walking cliché. We have the energetic guy, the silly twins, the cool/stoic guy, and the over-serious rival. Ending on something so bog-standard after something so above average leaves me worrying that the best is now behind us—but I truly hope that's not the case.        James Beckett  Rating:               By the looks of its premiere, Love All Play is a decent-looking series that showcases a team of likeable boys playing badminton. I was not aware that badminton was such a well-established sports institution that it would demand multiple anime adaptations, but between this, Hanebad!, and that Salaryman's Club show from just earlier this year, I guess fans around the world must be simmering with shuttlecock fever? That's all well and good, so far as I'm concerned, because I figure every sport deserves its day in the anime adaptation spotlight, no matter how niche they might seem to an inside boy like me.    My main issue with Love All Play is that, outside of depicting a unique sport that I'm sure will be interesting to longtime players or interested newcomers, the show doesn't have much else to offer for folks in the audience that want a good story to go along with all of the rackets and volleys. Our main character, Ryo, is defined by his meekness and general lack of ambition, and this whole first episode is focused on the “drama” of him trying to decide whether or not to join the premiere badminton team at the ritzy Yokohama Minato High School. There's some minor, barely addressed conflict concerning Ryo leaving his original badminton buddy behind, but it doesn't go anywhere interesting, and the rest of the dramatics feel forced.    When Ryo's father becomes almost comically angry at the prospect of his son attending a prestigious high school on the strength of his athletic skills, my first thought was “Geez, did a shuttlecock kill his parents in a dark alley, or something?” I wasn't that far off—the guy apparently lost out on a track scholarship because of an injury—but it's never a good sign when your jokey head-canon ends up being more compelling than what's happening on screen. I kind of liked how Ryo's sister stood up to their parents, since I'm always down for wholesome sibling dynamics, but it also serves to emphasize how much of a wet blanket Ryo is.    I get how that's the point of his character arc, and while there's nothing about Ryo's introduction here that is awful, it's nevertheless quite boring, to me. I was especially irritated by the chintzy soundtrack, which kept insisting that Ryo was going through some real intense drama, but c'mon. It's a badminton anime. We all know he's going to play badminton. Let's get on with it. If any of you Sports Boy Anime fans keep up with this one, let me know if it develops any of that missing spark in the coming weeks. Otherwise, I'll be moving on to [insert clever badminton related pun here].        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               There's something...off about this premiere, though not in a particularly intriguing way. Have you ever sat down to type something on your computer, not paying a lot of attention, then suddenly realize your fingers were just off the home row keys, and you've been typing gibberish in the shape of regular words? That's the feeling I got watching this premiere. It wears the form and performs the expected movements of an average high-school sports show, but somewhere in its construction things didn't mesh properly, and the result is an uncomfortably stiff and empty start to what looks to be a perfectly middling badminton show.    Part of the problem is that across this whole premiere, there's maybe a combined 45 seconds of badminton action if you don't count the opening animation. That's just not going to cut it if you want to get the audience invested in your particular sport, and what we get instead is a flat and inert little drama about our nondescript main boy wavering over taking a sports recommendation to a big fancy school. And the scant few moments of sports action we do get are just...not right. For all its flaws, last season's Salaryman's Club was able to capture the impact, speed, and high-octane energy of high-level badminton matches. Here, things are stiff and slow by comparison, and it makes it a lot harder to buy into how our wet noodle protagonist just loves badminton so, so much.    Though those sequences are likely a product of an overall struggling production. Even with the lack of any big set pieces, the rest of this episode struggles with pretty much any movement, up to and including characters talking. There's a stiffness to everyone's body language and faces that prevents them from ever feeling expressive, and a strangely slow pace to the editing that makes any conversation feel more disjointed than it should. Taken together you have a character drama where none of the dialogue feels right, and the result is oddly alienating for such a mundane show. Even if these characters weren't already dull as dirt, that would kill basically any dramatic potential all on its own.    As always, my benchmark for a sports show is if I'd rather watch another episode, or just watch the real-life sport it's showcasing for the same amount of time. I'm by no means a badminton expert, but I would most certainly rather watch a match than sit through another episode of Love All Play going through the motions.

Then there's Kengan Ashura. There's a reason this series has gained such a dedicated following for its brutal and kinetic fights — the manga it faithfully adapts was written by Yabako Sandrovich, a real-deal martial artist. Like the late, great Sonny Chiba performing karate in a 70s Toei action movie, Sandrovich and his illustrator Daromeon meticulously constructed Kengan Ashura's fights in the original manga, drawing from experience and study in the field of martial arts from around the globe.     Martial arts have been a major element of plenty of anime over the years, and have left a lasting imprint on the medium. Fist of the North Star famously drew from Chinese kung-fu to create one of the foundational series of 80s anime, filled with over-the-top violence and musclebound experts in martial technique. Those same descriptors can easily be applied to Kengan Ashura, the smash hit manga written by Sandrovich and drawn by Daromeon, later adapted into a popular Netflix-distributed anime series by director Seiji Kishi and Larx Entertainment that stays remarkably close to the original material.     Yabako Sandrovich is an interesting guy. One of his former stints before writing manga, which also includes the slice-of-life sensation How Heavy Are the Dumbbells You Lift?, was as a ruins excavator. More relevant to Kengan Ashura, he also has at least fourteen years of martial arts experience.    In the world of Kengan, international companies conduct business by employing fighters to enter a secret tournament of the world's deadliest fighting styles. Not only is the selection of martial arts from around the globe on display a veritable buffet for fight technique connoisseurs, it comes from a background of understanding what makes them work. Let's dive into some of the series' main combatants and take a look at the way they fight.     The basis for the mixed martial art fighting style practiced by the main protagonist Tokita Ohma is a combination of two of the most popular and widespread Japanese martial arts — karate and jiu-jitsu. Developed by the Ryukyu kingdom in Okinawa, karate is known for its sudden, explosive strikes that release pent-up force in the form of powerful punches and kicks. Jiu-jitsu originates from the Honshu mainland, and focuses more on using the opponent's momentum against them, redirecting their attacks and movements. The exact style Ohma uses that fuses these practices is the fictional “Niko Style” of Sandrovich's own invention, named after the famous town in Tochigi prefecture. The Niko Style applies secret techniques to the standard karate-based punching and axe-kicking that Ohma regularly performs to unleash a variety of superhuman abilities, and in the spirit of jiu-jitsu, to turn the enemy's own attacks back at them. Not only are the types of moves from these two Japanese martial arts depicted properly, but their core ethos are both intact in this new fantasy-tinged mashup. Like Fist of the North Star before it, Kengan Ashura has taken real martial arts and added a layer of prowess that only a manga character could possess.     Various styles of karate and jiu-jitsu form the basis of several other major characters' chosen disciplines, but let's head south to take a look at a fighter from Thailand, the home of another world-famous fighting style — Muay Thai. Kaolan Wongsawat is known as the “Thai God of War” in the world of Kengan. His moves incorporate the straightforward punches of western boxing, but are mainly based on Thailand's native martial art that dates back to before the 16th century. Using a combination of kneeing, jabbing opponents with elbows, and delivering slamming kicks with one's shins, this close-quarters style has become a favorite of MMA fighters and was popularized in world cinema by the blindingly fast athletics of actor Tony Jaa. Kaolan's superhuman prowess with Muay Thai and super-fast “flicker” jabs make him a dangerous man for any of the tournament's entrants to get near.     Staying in Southeast Asia, let's look at the martial art practiced by boisterous character Saw Paing from Myanmar. Lethwei is a brutal type of bare-knuckle boxing originating thousands of years ago in ancient Myanmar's Pyu Empire, used both for sport and warfare, and still practiced to this day. According to Sandrovich's author's notes in the back of a manga issue featuring Saw Paing, he'd heard through martial arts circles that lethwei fighters from Myanmar were especially strong, inspiring him to create the character. Saw Paing's exuberant personality balances out the annihilating techniques he uses, making him a likable fan favorite.    Crossing the Pacific, we arrive in Brazil, a country home to a sizable population of Japanese immigrants. This cultural exchange resulted in Brazilian jiu-jitsu, the basis for the style used by Kengan character Imai Cosmo. Cosmo's reputation as the ‘king of stranglers’ comes from a grappling-focused aspect of the Brazilian style' The difference from the original Japanese jiu-jitsu is that the Brazilian style focuses more on grappling with your opponent once you've gotten them into your desired position, putting them in a chokehold or lock. It's this method that allows Cosmo, a smaller fighter, to overpower larger adversaries.     Endearing and earnest American street fighter Adam “The Emperor” Dudley uses a type of blunt attack-oriented mixed martial arts, relying more on sheer force than a specific discipline. Hilariously, he fights on behalf of the “Boss Burger” corporation, whose CEO is a literal clown named Ronald. Very American!     Hailing from England, Mokichi Robinson uses Bartitsu, an archaic British martial art. Yes, there was a martial art developed in England in the Victorian era, though it's fallen into obscurity and is now most widely remembered via a misspelled reference to “Baritsu” in one of Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes novels. Its real-life inventor was an Englishman named Edward W. Barton-Wright who visited Meiji-era Japan as it newly opened to the West and became enamored with Japanese martial arts. Barton-Wright modestly named Bartitsu after himself, combining his last name with “jiu-jitsu”. It was a mixed martial art incorporating the aforementioned Japanese style, western boxing, French Savate, and others. Robinson's use of it is a deep cut, showing the type of research that went into his creation.     Returning to Japan, we find one of the series' darkest characters, former police officer Akoya Seishu. Akoya uses taiho-jutsu, literally “the art of arresting,” a restraining-focused martial art taught to Japanese police officers. While the use of taiho-jutsu is intended to be a non-lethal subduing alternative, Akoya's personal extremism lead him to warp it into a deadly execution technique. Police brutality is a loaded subject, and Kengan Ashura barrels headlong into it via one of its most horrific characters. Is there a thinly-veiled subtext? Is it pure exploitation? Whatever the case, Akoya stands as one of the more thought-provoking characters in the series.     On a lighter note, the “fighting style” of professional wrestling as used by charismatic fan favorite Sekibayashi Jun is (sorry to burst everyone's bubble) not real. WWE-style wrestling is described by that organization itself as “sports entertainment,” a scripted form of theater that uses the illusion of fighting to tell a story. In the world of Kengan Ashura, Sekibayashi is able to successfully hold his own against world-class fighters using methods that would not work in reality, which shows Sandrovich's true attitude toward all of this. Fighting technique is important, but what's more important is the entertainment for the audience. Kengan Ashura is a world where you can suspend your disbelief that a pro wrestler is really fighting and really winning against people trained in deadly martial art styles. It's a fantasy that incorporates just enough reality to be dynamic and interesting, but is heightened and purposely ridiculous in a way that watching an MMA match can't give you. Yes, there are unrealistic things in Kengan Ashura, and a martial arts aficionado like Sandrovich knows that. He's put them in there because a character like Sekibayashi is fun—and by extension, so is this wild and entertaining series.     At the time of this writing, a long-awaited third season of the anime has been announced to finish adapting the manga's original run. It's been a few years' hiatus, but martial arts are timeless — and the manga is well worth reading in the mean time. However over-the-top and insane its narrative and aesthetics become, Kengan Ashura was born and thrives on a reverence for the world's fighting styles in any form, a respectful celebration of martial arts and their appeal as much as a fantastic exaggeration of their entertainment value.

Then there's Kengan Ashura. There's a reason this series has gained such a dedicated following for its brutal and kinetic fights — the manga it faithfully adapts was written by Yabako Sandrovich, a real-deal martial artist. Like the late, great Sonny Chiba performing karate in a 70s Toei action movie, Sandrovich and his illustrator Daromeon meticulously constructed Kengan Ashura's fights in the original manga, drawing from experience and study in the field of martial arts from around the globe.     Martial arts have been a major element of plenty of anime over the years, and have left a lasting imprint on the medium. Fist of the North Star famously drew from Chinese kung-fu to create one of the foundational series of 80s anime, filled with over-the-top violence and musclebound experts in martial technique. Those same descriptors can easily be applied to Kengan Ashura, the smash hit manga written by Sandrovich and drawn by Daromeon, later adapted into a popular Netflix-distributed anime series by director Seiji Kishi and Larx Entertainment that stays remarkably close to the original material.     Yabako Sandrovich is an interesting guy. One of his former stints before writing manga, which also includes the slice-of-life sensation How Heavy Are the Dumbbells You Lift?, was as a ruins excavator. More relevant to Kengan Ashura, he also has at least fourteen years of martial arts experience.    In the world of Kengan, international companies conduct business by employing fighters to enter a secret tournament of the world's deadliest fighting styles. Not only is the selection of martial arts from around the globe on display a veritable buffet for fight technique connoisseurs, it comes from a background of understanding what makes them work. Let's dive into some of the series' main combatants and take a look at the way they fight.     The basis for the mixed martial art fighting style practiced by the main protagonist Tokita Ohma is a combination of two of the most popular and widespread Japanese martial arts — karate and jiu-jitsu. Developed by the Ryukyu kingdom in Okinawa, karate is known for its sudden, explosive strikes that release pent-up force in the form of powerful punches and kicks. Jiu-jitsu originates from the Honshu mainland, and focuses more on using the opponent's momentum against them, redirecting their attacks and movements. The exact style Ohma uses that fuses these practices is the fictional “Niko Style” of Sandrovich's own invention, named after the famous town in Tochigi prefecture. The Niko Style applies secret techniques to the standard karate-based punching and axe-kicking that Ohma regularly performs to unleash a variety of superhuman abilities, and in the spirit of jiu-jitsu, to turn the enemy's own attacks back at them. Not only are the types of moves from these two Japanese martial arts depicted properly, but their core ethos are both intact in this new fantasy-tinged mashup. Like Fist of the North Star before it, Kengan Ashura has taken real martial arts and added a layer of prowess that only a manga character could possess.     Various styles of karate and jiu-jitsu form the basis of several other major characters' chosen disciplines, but let's head south to take a look at a fighter from Thailand, the home of another world-famous fighting style — Muay Thai. Kaolan Wongsawat is known as the “Thai God of War” in the world of Kengan. His moves incorporate the straightforward punches of western boxing, but are mainly based on Thailand's native martial art that dates back to before the 16th century. Using a combination of kneeing, jabbing opponents with elbows, and delivering slamming kicks with one's shins, this close-quarters style has become a favorite of MMA fighters and was popularized in world cinema by the blindingly fast athletics of actor Tony Jaa. Kaolan's superhuman prowess with Muay Thai and super-fast “flicker” jabs make him a dangerous man for any of the tournament's entrants to get near.     Staying in Southeast Asia, let's look at the martial art practiced by boisterous character Saw Paing from Myanmar. Lethwei is a brutal type of bare-knuckle boxing originating thousands of years ago in ancient Myanmar's Pyu Empire, used both for sport and warfare, and still practiced to this day. According to Sandrovich's author's notes in the back of a manga issue featuring Saw Paing, he'd heard through martial arts circles that lethwei fighters from Myanmar were especially strong, inspiring him to create the character. Saw Paing's exuberant personality balances out the annihilating techniques he uses, making him a likable fan favorite.    Crossing the Pacific, we arrive in Brazil, a country home to a sizable population of Japanese immigrants. This cultural exchange resulted in Brazilian jiu-jitsu, the basis for the style used by Kengan character Imai Cosmo. Cosmo's reputation as the ‘king of stranglers’ comes from a grappling-focused aspect of the Brazilian style' The difference from the original Japanese jiu-jitsu is that the Brazilian style focuses more on grappling with your opponent once you've gotten them into your desired position, putting them in a chokehold or lock. It's this method that allows Cosmo, a smaller fighter, to overpower larger adversaries.     Endearing and earnest American street fighter Adam “The Emperor” Dudley uses a type of blunt attack-oriented mixed martial arts, relying more on sheer force than a specific discipline. Hilariously, he fights on behalf of the “Boss Burger” corporation, whose CEO is a literal clown named Ronald. Very American!     Hailing from England, Mokichi Robinson uses Bartitsu, an archaic British martial art. Yes, there was a martial art developed in England in the Victorian era, though it's fallen into obscurity and is now most widely remembered via a misspelled reference to “Baritsu” in one of Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes novels. Its real-life inventor was an Englishman named Edward W. Barton-Wright who visited Meiji-era Japan as it newly opened to the West and became enamored with Japanese martial arts. Barton-Wright modestly named Bartitsu after himself, combining his last name with “jiu-jitsu”. It was a mixed martial art incorporating the aforementioned Japanese style, western boxing, French Savate, and others. Robinson's use of it is a deep cut, showing the type of research that went into his creation.     Returning to Japan, we find one of the series' darkest characters, former police officer Akoya Seishu. Akoya uses taiho-jutsu, literally “the art of arresting,” a restraining-focused martial art taught to Japanese police officers. While the use of taiho-jutsu is intended to be a non-lethal subduing alternative, Akoya's personal extremism lead him to warp it into a deadly execution technique. Police brutality is a loaded subject, and Kengan Ashura barrels headlong into it via one of its most horrific characters. Is there a thinly-veiled subtext? Is it pure exploitation? Whatever the case, Akoya stands as one of the more thought-provoking characters in the series.     On a lighter note, the “fighting style” of professional wrestling as used by charismatic fan favorite Sekibayashi Jun is (sorry to burst everyone's bubble) not real. WWE-style wrestling is described by that organization itself as “sports entertainment,” a scripted form of theater that uses the illusion of fighting to tell a story. In the world of Kengan Ashura, Sekibayashi is able to successfully hold his own against world-class fighters using methods that would not work in reality, which shows Sandrovich's true attitude toward all of this. Fighting technique is important, but what's more important is the entertainment for the audience. Kengan Ashura is a world where you can suspend your disbelief that a pro wrestler is really fighting and really winning against people trained in deadly martial art styles. It's a fantasy that incorporates just enough reality to be dynamic and interesting, but is heightened and purposely ridiculous in a way that watching an MMA match can't give you. Yes, there are unrealistic things in Kengan Ashura, and a martial arts aficionado like Sandrovich knows that. He's put them in there because a character like Sekibayashi is fun—and by extension, so is this wild and entertaining series.     At the time of this writing, a long-awaited third season of the anime has been announced to finish adapting the manga's original run. It's been a few years' hiatus, but martial arts are timeless — and the manga is well worth reading in the mean time. However over-the-top and insane its narrative and aesthetics become, Kengan Ashura was born and thrives on a reverence for the world's fighting styles in any form, a respectful celebration of martial arts and their appeal as much as a fantastic exaggeration of their entertainment value.

Kaolan's superhuman prowess with Muay Thai and super-fast “flicker” jabs make him a dangerous man for any of the tournament's entrants to get near.     Staying in Southeast Asia, let's look at the martial art practiced by boisterous character Saw Paing from Myanmar. Lethwei is a brutal type of bare-knuckle boxing originating thousands of years ago in ancient Myanmar's Pyu Empire, used both for sport and warfare, and still practiced to this day. According to Sandrovich's author's notes in the back of a manga issue featuring Saw Paing, he'd heard through martial arts circles that lethwei fighters from Myanmar were especially strong, inspiring him to create the character. Saw Paing's exuberant personality balances out the annihilating techniques he uses, making him a likable fan favorite.    Crossing the Pacific, we arrive in Brazil, a country home to a sizable population of Japanese immigrants. This cultural exchange resulted in Brazilian jiu-jitsu, the basis for the style used by Kengan character Imai Cosmo. Cosmo's reputation as the ‘king of stranglers’ comes from a grappling-focused aspect of the Brazilian style' The difference from the original Japanese jiu-jitsu is that the Brazilian style focuses more on grappling with your opponent once you've gotten them into your desired position, putting them in a chokehold or lock. It's this method that allows Cosmo, a smaller fighter, to overpower larger adversaries.     Endearing and earnest American street fighter Adam “The Emperor” Dudley uses a type of blunt attack-oriented mixed martial arts, relying more on sheer force than a specific discipline. Hilariously, he fights on behalf of the “Boss Burger” corporation, whose CEO is a literal clown named Ronald. Very American!     Hailing from England, Mokichi Robinson uses Bartitsu, an archaic British martial art. Yes, there was a martial art developed in England in the Victorian era, though it's fallen into obscurity and is now most widely remembered via a misspelled reference to “Baritsu” in one of Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes novels. Its real-life inventor was an Englishman named Edward W. Barton-Wright who visited Meiji-era Japan as it newly opened to the West and became enamored with Japanese martial arts. Barton-Wright modestly named Bartitsu after himself, combining his last name with “jiu-jitsu”. It was a mixed martial art incorporating the aforementioned Japanese style, western boxing, French Savate, and others. Robinson's use of it is a deep cut, showing the type of research that went into his creation.     Returning to Japan, we find one of the series' darkest characters, former police officer Akoya Seishu. Akoya uses taiho-jutsu, literally “the art of arresting,” a restraining-focused martial art taught to Japanese police officers. While the use of taiho-jutsu is intended to be a non-lethal subduing alternative, Akoya's personal extremism lead him to warp it into a deadly execution technique. Police brutality is a loaded subject, and Kengan Ashura barrels headlong into it via one of its most horrific characters. Is there a thinly-veiled subtext? Is it pure exploitation? Whatever the case, Akoya stands as one of the more thought-provoking characters in the series.     On a lighter note, the “fighting style” of professional wrestling as used by charismatic fan favorite Sekibayashi Jun is (sorry to burst everyone's bubble) not real. WWE-style wrestling is described by that organization itself as “sports entertainment,” a scripted form of theater that uses the illusion of fighting to tell a story. In the world of Kengan Ashura, Sekibayashi is able to successfully hold his own against world-class fighters using methods that would not work in reality, which shows Sandrovich's true attitude toward all of this. Fighting technique is important, but what's more important is the entertainment for the audience. Kengan Ashura is a world where you can suspend your disbelief that a pro wrestler is really fighting and really winning against people trained in deadly martial art styles. It's a fantasy that incorporates just enough reality to be dynamic and interesting, but is heightened and purposely ridiculous in a way that watching an MMA match can't give you. Yes, there are unrealistic things in Kengan Ashura, and a martial arts aficionado like Sandrovich knows that. He's put them in there because a character like Sekibayashi is fun—and by extension, so is this wild and entertaining series.     At the time of this writing, a long-awaited third season of the anime has been announced to finish adapting the manga's original run. It's been a few years' hiatus, but martial arts are timeless — and the manga is well worth reading in the mean time. However over-the-top and insane its narrative and aesthetics become, Kengan Ashura was born and thrives on a reverence for the world's fighting styles in any form, a respectful celebration of martial arts and their appeal as much as a fantastic exaggeration of their entertainment value.

Then there's Kengan Ashura. There's a reason this series has gained such a dedicated following for its brutal and kinetic fights — the manga it faithfully adapts was written by Yabako Sandrovich, a real-deal martial artist. Like the late, great Sonny Chiba performing karate in a 70s Toei action movie, Sandrovich and his illustrator Daromeon meticulously constructed Kengan Ashura's fights in the original manga, drawing from experience and study in the field of martial arts from around the globe.     Martial arts have been a major element of plenty of anime over the years, and have left a lasting imprint on the medium. Fist of the North Star famously drew from Chinese kung-fu to create one of the foundational series of 80s anime, filled with over-the-top violence and musclebound experts in martial technique. Those same descriptors can easily be applied to Kengan Ashura, the smash hit manga written by Sandrovich and drawn by Daromeon, later adapted into a popular Netflix-distributed anime series by director Seiji Kishi and Larx Entertainment that stays remarkably close to the original material.     Yabako Sandrovich is an interesting guy. One of his former stints before writing manga, which also includes the slice-of-life sensation How Heavy Are the Dumbbells You Lift?, was as a ruins excavator. More relevant to Kengan Ashura, he also has at least fourteen years of martial arts experience.    In the world of Kengan, international companies conduct business by employing fighters to enter a secret tournament of the world's deadliest fighting styles. Not only is the selection of martial arts from around the globe on display a veritable buffet for fight technique connoisseurs, it comes from a background of understanding what makes them work. Let's dive into some of the series' main combatants and take a look at the way they fight.     The basis for the mixed martial art fighting style practiced by the main protagonist Tokita Ohma is a combination of two of the most popular and widespread Japanese martial arts — karate and jiu-jitsu. Developed by the Ryukyu kingdom in Okinawa, karate is known for its sudden, explosive strikes that release pent-up force in the form of powerful punches and kicks. Jiu-jitsu originates from the Honshu mainland, and focuses more on using the opponent's momentum against them, redirecting their attacks and movements. The exact style Ohma uses that fuses these practices is the fictional “Niko Style” of Sandrovich's own invention, named after the famous town in Tochigi prefecture. The Niko Style applies secret techniques to the standard karate-based punching and axe-kicking that Ohma regularly performs to unleash a variety of superhuman abilities, and in the spirit of jiu-jitsu, to turn the enemy's own attacks back at them. Not only are the types of moves from these two Japanese martial arts depicted properly, but their core ethos are both intact in this new fantasy-tinged mashup. Like Fist of the North Star before it, Kengan Ashura has taken real martial arts and added a layer of prowess that only a manga character could possess.     Various styles of karate and jiu-jitsu form the basis of several other major characters' chosen disciplines, but let's head south to take a look at a fighter from Thailand, the home of another world-famous fighting style — Muay Thai. Kaolan Wongsawat is known as the “Thai God of War” in the world of Kengan. His moves incorporate the straightforward punches of western boxing, but are mainly based on Thailand's native martial art that dates back to before the 16th century. Using a combination of kneeing, jabbing opponents with elbows, and delivering slamming kicks with one's shins, this close-quarters style has become a favorite of MMA fighters and was popularized in world cinema by the blindingly fast athletics of actor Tony Jaa. Kaolan's superhuman prowess with Muay Thai and super-fast “flicker” jabs make him a dangerous man for any of the tournament's entrants to get near.

Hilariously, he fights on behalf of the “Boss Burger” corporation, whose CEO is a literal clown named Ronald. Very American!     Hailing from England, Mokichi Robinson uses Bartitsu, an archaic British martial art. Yes, there was a martial art developed in England in the Victorian era, though it's fallen into obscurity and is now most widely remembered via a misspelled reference to “Baritsu” in one of Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes novels. Its real-life inventor was an Englishman named Edward W. Barton-Wright who visited Meiji-era Japan as it newly opened to the West and became enamored with Japanese martial arts. Barton-Wright modestly named Bartitsu after himself, combining his last name with “jiu-jitsu”. It was a mixed martial art incorporating the aforementioned Japanese style, western boxing, French Savate, and others. Robinson's use of it is a deep cut, showing the type of research that went into his creation.     Returning to Japan, we find one of the series' darkest characters, former police officer Akoya Seishu. Akoya uses taiho-jutsu, literally “the art of arresting,” a restraining-focused martial art taught to Japanese police officers. While the use of taiho-jutsu is intended to be a non-lethal subduing alternative, Akoya's personal extremism lead him to warp it into a deadly execution technique. Police brutality is a loaded subject, and Kengan Ashura barrels headlong into it via one of its most horrific characters. Is there a thinly-veiled subtext? Is it pure exploitation? Whatever the case, Akoya stands as one of the more thought-provoking characters in the series.     On a lighter note, the “fighting style” of professional wrestling as used by charismatic fan favorite Sekibayashi Jun is (sorry to burst everyone's bubble) not real. WWE-style wrestling is described by that organization itself as “sports entertainment,” a scripted form of theater that uses the illusion of fighting to tell a story. In the world of Kengan Ashura, Sekibayashi is able to successfully hold his own against world-class fighters using methods that would not work in reality, which shows Sandrovich's true attitude toward all of this. Fighting technique is important, but what's more important is the entertainment for the audience. Kengan Ashura is a world where you can suspend your disbelief that a pro wrestler is really fighting and really winning against people trained in deadly martial art styles. It's a fantasy that incorporates just enough reality to be dynamic and interesting, but is heightened and purposely ridiculous in a way that watching an MMA match can't give you. Yes, there are unrealistic things in Kengan Ashura, and a martial arts aficionado like Sandrovich knows that. He's put them in there because a character like Sekibayashi is fun—and by extension, so is this wild and entertaining series.     At the time of this writing, a long-awaited third season of the anime has been announced to finish adapting the manga's original run. It's been a few years' hiatus, but martial arts are timeless — and the manga is well worth reading in the mean time. However over-the-top and insane its narrative and aesthetics become, Kengan Ashura was born and thrives on a reverence for the world's fighting styles in any form, a respectful celebration of martial arts and their appeal as much as a fantastic exaggeration of their entertainment value.

Then there's Kengan Ashura. There's a reason this series has gained such a dedicated following for its brutal and kinetic fights — the manga it faithfully adapts was written by Yabako Sandrovich, a real-deal martial artist. Like the late, great Sonny Chiba performing karate in a 70s Toei action movie, Sandrovich and his illustrator Daromeon meticulously constructed Kengan Ashura's fights in the original manga, drawing from experience and study in the field of martial arts from around the globe.     Martial arts have been a major element of plenty of anime over the years, and have left a lasting imprint on the medium. Fist of the North Star famously drew from Chinese kung-fu to create one of the foundational series of 80s anime, filled with over-the-top violence and musclebound experts in martial technique. Those same descriptors can easily be applied to Kengan Ashura, the smash hit manga written by Sandrovich and drawn by Daromeon, later adapted into a popular Netflix-distributed anime series by director Seiji Kishi and Larx Entertainment that stays remarkably close to the original material.     Yabako Sandrovich is an interesting guy. One of his former stints before writing manga, which also includes the slice-of-life sensation How Heavy Are the Dumbbells You Lift?, was as a ruins excavator. More relevant to Kengan Ashura, he also has at least fourteen years of martial arts experience.    In the world of Kengan, international companies conduct business by employing fighters to enter a secret tournament of the world's deadliest fighting styles. Not only is the selection of martial arts from around the globe on display a veritable buffet for fight technique connoisseurs, it comes from a background of understanding what makes them work. Let's dive into some of the series' main combatants and take a look at the way they fight.     The basis for the mixed martial art fighting style practiced by the main protagonist Tokita Ohma is a combination of two of the most popular and widespread Japanese martial arts — karate and jiu-jitsu. Developed by the Ryukyu kingdom in Okinawa, karate is known for its sudden, explosive strikes that release pent-up force in the form of powerful punches and kicks. Jiu-jitsu originates from the Honshu mainland, and focuses more on using the opponent's momentum against them, redirecting their attacks and movements. The exact style Ohma uses that fuses these practices is the fictional “Niko Style” of Sandrovich's own invention, named after the famous town in Tochigi prefecture. The Niko Style applies secret techniques to the standard karate-based punching and axe-kicking that Ohma regularly performs to unleash a variety of superhuman abilities, and in the spirit of jiu-jitsu, to turn the enemy's own attacks back at them. Not only are the types of moves from these two Japanese martial arts depicted properly, but their core ethos are both intact in this new fantasy-tinged mashup. Like Fist of the North Star before it, Kengan Ashura has taken real martial arts and added a layer of prowess that only a manga character could possess.     Various styles of karate and jiu-jitsu form the basis of several other major characters' chosen disciplines, but let's head south to take a look at a fighter from Thailand, the home of another world-famous fighting style — Muay Thai. Kaolan Wongsawat is known as the “Thai God of War” in the world of Kengan. His moves incorporate the straightforward punches of western boxing, but are mainly based on Thailand's native martial art that dates back to before the 16th century. Using a combination of kneeing, jabbing opponents with elbows, and delivering slamming kicks with one's shins, this close-quarters style has become a favorite of MMA fighters and was popularized in world cinema by the blindingly fast athletics of actor Tony Jaa. Kaolan's superhuman prowess with Muay Thai and super-fast “flicker” jabs make him a dangerous man for any of the tournament's entrants to get near.     Staying in Southeast Asia, let's look at the martial art practiced by boisterous character Saw Paing from Myanmar. Lethwei is a brutal type of bare-knuckle boxing originating thousands of years ago in ancient Myanmar's Pyu Empire, used both for sport and warfare, and still practiced to this day. According to Sandrovich's author's notes in the back of a manga issue featuring Saw Paing, he'd heard through martial arts circles that lethwei fighters from Myanmar were especially strong, inspiring him to create the character. Saw Paing's exuberant personality balances out the annihilating techniques he uses, making him a likable fan favorite.    Crossing the Pacific, we arrive in Brazil, a country home to a sizable population of Japanese immigrants. This cultural exchange resulted in Brazilian jiu-jitsu, the basis for the style used by Kengan character Imai Cosmo. Cosmo's reputation as the ‘king of stranglers’ comes from a grappling-focused aspect of the Brazilian style' The difference from the original Japanese jiu-jitsu is that the Brazilian style focuses more on grappling with your opponent once you've gotten them into your desired position, putting them in a chokehold or lock. It's this method that allows Cosmo, a smaller fighter, to overpower larger adversaries.     Endearing and earnest American street fighter Adam “The Emperor” Dudley uses a type of blunt attack-oriented mixed martial arts, relying more on sheer force than a specific discipline. Hilariously, he fights on behalf of the “Boss Burger” corporation, whose CEO is a literal clown named Ronald. Very American!

There's a reason this series has gained such a dedicated following for its brutal and kinetic fights — the manga it faithfully adapts was written by Yabako Sandrovich, a real-deal martial artist. Like the late, great Sonny Chiba performing karate in a 70s Toei action movie, Sandrovich and his illustrator Daromeon meticulously constructed Kengan Ashura's fights in the original manga, drawing from experience and study in the field of martial arts from around the globe.     Martial arts have been a major element of plenty of anime over the years, and have left a lasting imprint on the medium. Fist of the North Star famously drew from Chinese kung-fu to create one of the foundational series of 80s anime, filled with over-the-top violence and musclebound experts in martial technique. Those same descriptors can easily be applied to Kengan Ashura, the smash hit manga written by Sandrovich and drawn by Daromeon, later adapted into a popular Netflix-distributed anime series by director Seiji Kishi and Larx Entertainment that stays remarkably close to the original material.     Yabako Sandrovich is an interesting guy. One of his former stints before writing manga, which also includes the slice-of-life sensation How Heavy Are the Dumbbells You Lift?, was as a ruins excavator. More relevant to Kengan Ashura, he also has at least fourteen years of martial arts experience.    In the world of Kengan, international companies conduct business by employing fighters to enter a secret tournament of the world's deadliest fighting styles. Not only is the selection of martial arts from around the globe on display a veritable buffet for fight technique connoisseurs, it comes from a background of understanding what makes them work. Let's dive into some of the series' main combatants and take a look at the way they fight.     The basis for the mixed martial art fighting style practiced by the main protagonist Tokita Ohma is a combination of two of the most popular and widespread Japanese martial arts — karate and jiu-jitsu. Developed by the Ryukyu kingdom in Okinawa, karate is known for its sudden, explosive strikes that release pent-up force in the form of powerful punches and kicks. Jiu-jitsu originates from the Honshu mainland, and focuses more on using the opponent's momentum against them, redirecting their attacks and movements. The exact style Ohma uses that fuses these practices is the fictional “Niko Style” of Sandrovich's own invention, named after the famous town in Tochigi prefecture. The Niko Style applies secret techniques to the standard karate-based punching and axe-kicking that Ohma regularly performs to unleash a variety of superhuman abilities, and in the spirit of jiu-jitsu, to turn the enemy's own attacks back at them. Not only are the types of moves from these two Japanese martial arts depicted properly, but their core ethos are both intact in this new fantasy-tinged mashup. Like Fist of the North Star before it, Kengan Ashura has taken real martial arts and added a layer of prowess that only a manga character could possess.     Various styles of karate and jiu-jitsu form the basis of several other major characters' chosen disciplines, but let's head south to take a look at a fighter from Thailand, the home of another world-famous fighting style — Muay Thai. Kaolan Wongsawat is known as the “Thai God of War” in the world of Kengan. His moves incorporate the straightforward punches of western boxing, but are mainly based on Thailand's native martial art that dates back to before the 16th century. Using a combination of kneeing, jabbing opponents with elbows, and delivering slamming kicks with one's shins, this close-quarters style has become a favorite of MMA fighters and was popularized in world cinema by the blindingly fast athletics of actor Tony Jaa. Kaolan's superhuman prowess with Muay Thai and super-fast “flicker” jabs make him a dangerous man for any of the tournament's entrants to get near.     Staying in Southeast Asia, let's look at the martial art practiced by boisterous character Saw Paing from Myanmar. Lethwei is a brutal type of bare-knuckle boxing originating thousands of years ago in ancient Myanmar's Pyu Empire, used both for sport and warfare, and still practiced to this day. According to Sandrovich's author's notes in the back of a manga issue featuring Saw Paing, he'd heard through martial arts circles that lethwei fighters from Myanmar were especially strong, inspiring him to create the character. Saw Paing's exuberant personality balances out the annihilating techniques he uses, making him a likable fan favorite.    Crossing the Pacific, we arrive in Brazil, a country home to a sizable population of Japanese immigrants. This cultural exchange resulted in Brazilian jiu-jitsu, the basis for the style used by Kengan character Imai Cosmo. Cosmo's reputation as the ‘king of stranglers’ comes from a grappling-focused aspect of the Brazilian style' The difference from the original Japanese jiu-jitsu is that the Brazilian style focuses more on grappling with your opponent once you've gotten them into your desired position, putting them in a chokehold or lock. It's this method that allows Cosmo, a smaller fighter, to overpower larger adversaries.     Endearing and earnest American street fighter Adam “The Emperor” Dudley uses a type of blunt attack-oriented mixed martial arts, relying more on sheer force than a specific discipline. Hilariously, he fights on behalf of the “Boss Burger” corporation, whose CEO is a literal clown named Ronald. Very American!     Hailing from England, Mokichi Robinson uses Bartitsu, an archaic British martial art. Yes, there was a martial art developed in England in the Victorian era, though it's fallen into obscurity and is now most widely remembered via a misspelled reference to “Baritsu” in one of Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes novels. Its real-life inventor was an Englishman named Edward W. Barton-Wright who visited Meiji-era Japan as it newly opened to the West and became enamored with Japanese martial arts. Barton-Wright modestly named Bartitsu after himself, combining his last name with “jiu-jitsu”. It was a mixed martial art incorporating the aforementioned Japanese style, western boxing, French Savate, and others. Robinson's use of it is a deep cut, showing the type of research that went into his creation.     Returning to Japan, we find one of the series' darkest characters, former police officer Akoya Seishu. Akoya uses taiho-jutsu, literally “the art of arresting,” a restraining-focused martial art taught to Japanese police officers. While the use of taiho-jutsu is intended to be a non-lethal subduing alternative, Akoya's personal extremism lead him to warp it into a deadly execution technique. Police brutality is a loaded subject, and Kengan Ashura barrels headlong into it via one of its most horrific characters. Is there a thinly-veiled subtext? Is it pure exploitation? Whatever the case, Akoya stands as one of the more thought-provoking characters in the series.     On a lighter note, the “fighting style” of professional wrestling as used by charismatic fan favorite Sekibayashi Jun is (sorry to burst everyone's bubble) not real. WWE-style wrestling is described by that organization itself as “sports entertainment,” a scripted form of theater that uses the illusion of fighting to tell a story. In the world of Kengan Ashura, Sekibayashi is able to successfully hold his own against world-class fighters using methods that would not work in reality, which shows Sandrovich's true attitude toward all of this. Fighting technique is important, but what's more important is the entertainment for the audience. Kengan Ashura is a world where you can suspend your disbelief that a pro wrestler is really fighting and really winning against people trained in deadly martial art styles. It's a fantasy that incorporates just enough reality to be dynamic and interesting, but is heightened and purposely ridiculous in a way that watching an MMA match can't give you. Yes, there are unrealistic things in Kengan Ashura, and a martial arts aficionado like Sandrovich knows that. He's put them in there because a character like Sekibayashi is fun—and by extension, so is this wild and entertaining series.     At the time of this writing, a long-awaited third season of the anime has been announced to finish adapting the manga's original run. It's been a few years' hiatus, but martial arts are timeless — and the manga is well worth reading in the mean time. However over-the-top and insane its narrative and aesthetics become, Kengan Ashura was born and thrives on a reverence for the world's fighting styles in any form, a respectful celebration of martial arts and their appeal as much as a fantastic exaggeration of their entertainment value.

Its real-life inventor was an Englishman named Edward W. Barton-Wright who visited Meiji-era Japan as it newly opened to the West and became enamored with Japanese martial arts. Barton-Wright modestly named Bartitsu after himself, combining his last name with “jiu-jitsu”. It was a mixed martial art incorporating the aforementioned Japanese style, western boxing, French Savate, and others. Robinson's use of it is a deep cut, showing the type of research that went into his creation.     Returning to Japan, we find one of the series' darkest characters, former police officer Akoya Seishu. Akoya uses taiho-jutsu, literally “the art of arresting,” a restraining-focused martial art taught to Japanese police officers. While the use of taiho-jutsu is intended to be a non-lethal subduing alternative, Akoya's personal extremism lead him to warp it into a deadly execution technique. Police brutality is a loaded subject, and Kengan Ashura barrels headlong into it via one of its most horrific characters. Is there a thinly-veiled subtext? Is it pure exploitation? Whatever the case, Akoya stands as one of the more thought-provoking characters in the series.     On a lighter note, the “fighting style” of professional wrestling as used by charismatic fan favorite Sekibayashi Jun is (sorry to burst everyone's bubble) not real. WWE-style wrestling is described by that organization itself as “sports entertainment,” a scripted form of theater that uses the illusion of fighting to tell a story. In the world of Kengan Ashura, Sekibayashi is able to successfully hold his own against world-class fighters using methods that would not work in reality, which shows Sandrovich's true attitude toward all of this. Fighting technique is important, but what's more important is the entertainment for the audience. Kengan Ashura is a world where you can suspend your disbelief that a pro wrestler is really fighting and really winning against people trained in deadly martial art styles. It's a fantasy that incorporates just enough reality to be dynamic and interesting, but is heightened and purposely ridiculous in a way that watching an MMA match can't give you. Yes, there are unrealistic things in Kengan Ashura, and a martial arts aficionado like Sandrovich knows that. He's put them in there because a character like Sekibayashi is fun—and by extension, so is this wild and entertaining series.     At the time of this writing, a long-awaited third season of the anime has been announced to finish adapting the manga's original run. It's been a few years' hiatus, but martial arts are timeless — and the manga is well worth reading in the mean time. However over-the-top and insane its narrative and aesthetics become, Kengan Ashura was born and thrives on a reverence for the world's fighting styles in any form, a respectful celebration of martial arts and their appeal as much as a fantastic exaggeration of their entertainment value.

News Kodansha USA Releases The Wallflower Manga Digitally on April 12   posted on 2022-04-06 23:00 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda         All 36 volumes will be available    Kodansha Comics announced on Tuesday that it will release all 36 volumes of Tomoko Hayakawa's The Wallflower (Yamato Nadeshiko Shichihenge) manga available digitally on April 12. The manga will be available on BookWalker, Kindle, Apple Books, Google Play, Nook, Kobo, izneo, MyAnimeList, and other vendors.    Kodansha Comics describes the manga:    It's a gorgeous, spacious mansion, and four handsome, fifteen-year-old friends are allowed to live in it for free! There's only one condition—that within three years the guys must transform the owner's wallflower niece into a lady befitting the palace in which they all live! How hard can it be? Enter Sunako Nakahara, the agoraphobic, horror-movie-loving, pockmark-faced, frizzy-haired, fashion-illiterate recluse who tends to break into explosive nosebleeds whenever she sees anyone attractive. This project is going to take more than our four heroes ever expected: it needs a miracle!   Hayakawa launched the manga in Kodansha's Bessatsu Friend magazine in 2000, and  ended it in 2015 after 15 years of serialization.    Kodansha Comics began releasing The Wallflower in North America after taking over publication rights from Del Rey in 2010. Kodansha Comics released the manga's 36th and final compiled volume in March 2016. The Wallflower inspired a 2006-2007 25-episode television anime series, which ADV Films released on DVD. The story also inspired a live-action television series in 2010.

News Kodansha USA Releases The Wallflower Manga Digitally on April 12   posted on 2022-04-06 23:00 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda         All 36 volumes will be available    Kodansha Comics announced on Tuesday that it will release all 36 volumes of Tomoko Hayakawa's The Wallflower (Yamato Nadeshiko Shichihenge) manga available digitally on April 12. The manga will be available on BookWalker, Kindle, Apple Books, Google Play, Nook, Kobo, izneo, MyAnimeList, and other vendors.    Kodansha Comics describes the manga:    It's a gorgeous, spacious mansion, and four handsome, fifteen-year-old friends are allowed to live in it for free! There's only one condition—that within three years the guys must transform the owner's wallflower niece into a lady befitting the palace in which they all live! How hard can it be? Enter Sunako Nakahara, the agoraphobic, horror-movie-loving, pockmark-faced, frizzy-haired, fashion-illiterate recluse who tends to break into explosive nosebleeds whenever she sees anyone attractive. This project is going to take more than our four heroes ever expected: it needs a miracle!   Hayakawa launched the manga in Kodansha's Bessatsu Friend magazine in 2000, and  ended it in 2015 after 15 years of serialization.    Kodansha Comics began releasing The Wallflower in North America after taking over publication rights from Del Rey in 2010. Kodansha Comics released the manga's 36th and final compiled volume in March 2016. The Wallflower inspired a 2006-2007 25-episode television anime series, which ADV Films released on DVD. The story also inspired a live-action television series in 2010.

The other nominees for Best Arrangement, Instrumental or A Cappella were ""Chopsticks"" by Bill O'Connell, ""For the Love of a Princess"" by Robin Smith, ""Infinite Love"" by Emile Mosseri, and ""The Struggle Within"" by Gabriela Quintero and Rodrigo Sanchez.
