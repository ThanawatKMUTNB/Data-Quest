Heidi breaks down what to expect. ― Greetings, everyone! I am quite relieved today, as it was very likely TWIG might not have happened this week.

Just a heads-up: This Week in Games is probably going to be a Friday thing from now on.

Welcome back to This Week in Games. It's a little bit of a light news week, which is probably for the best because, as you read this, I'll be in the hospital undergoing surgery. Nothing too major, and I should be back home for the weekend, but surgery is still not very fun in general!

Well, it's the end of April, and so far, 2021's been a great year for gaming. The release schedule is calming down a bit in May, but I can understand why – most publishers really don't want to compete with Resident Evil Village.

Just a heads-up: This Week in Games is probably going to be a Friday thing from now on. This benefits me because game companies, for whatever reason, just love dumping news on Thursdays, leaving me to either delay the column or look horribly out of date. Hopefully Friday publication solves this issue somewhat.

Heidi discusses what made the game so important in THIS WEEK IN GAMES. ― Hello again!

My man Keanu deserved better. ― Ho ho ho, Merry TWIGmas everyone! A little late, I know, but we're still in the holiday spirit.

Love of Kill Episode 12  by MrAJCosplay/Cartoon Cipher, Apr  3rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Love of Kill ?                     Community score: 3.6            Given the sheer amount of weight this final episode needed to carry, I must admit I'm a little bit conflicted. I kinda knew going in that there was no way this episode was going to tie up the present-day plot thread of the mob boss going after everybody. If anything, it just kinda hammers home how unimportant it is both to the present-day narrative and what goes on in the flashbacks. Looking back on the season as a whole, I definitely think that the material that is adapted shouldn't have taken up as many episodes as it did. While I will admit that the final revelations for everything in the past are mostly satisfying, it wasn't worth the incredibly slow, drawn-out pace that it took to get here. It genuinely feels like the writer of the season started with the decision to end the season with said revelations and then worked backwards to try to fill in the rest of the series. I don't know if this is all handled differently in the source material but that final shot of Château and Ryang-ha squaring off against this organization didn't exactly make me excited for future installments. At the same time, however, I did walk away with some sense of dramatic and emotional pay off.    This whole time I was led to believe that Ryang-ha was only interested in Chateau for more plot-driven reasons. When he says that he's happy the events of his past weren't just a dream, I was caught off guard by its surprising emotional impact. Château was traumatized by her past and completely forgot about it for the sake of her own sense of mental and emotional stability. So it also makes sense that years later growing up, she would start to feel the weight of what she did as a child to someone who was just trying to help her. The show is still very vague on what exactly the original Ryang-ha's mission was, so it's hard to see if he was always tasked with getting her to safety or if she was meant to be delivered to somebody else.    Again the show's plotting isn't necessarily the best, and as mentioned, I think cutting out some of the bloat in the previous episodes could've allowed the show to better flesh out the good elements that were actually here. The show manages to convey the emotions that Château and Ryang-ha felt for the original Ryang-ha, but I just wish I knew him more as a character. Ultimately, he definitely comes across as a naïve albeit kind-hearted kid that was just trying to help people regardless of whether or not he knew what Donny had planned for him all along. There is a sense of tragedy and sadness in him doing everything he can but alas, the show wasn't really about this boy. It has always been more interested in the current Ryang-ha and Château, and I think the reason why I feel so emotionally invested towards things in the end is because of what they're feeling, rather than the narrative putting me in a similar headspace to their emotional investment. A part of me does want to go back and rewatch the show now that I have this added context for why Ryang-ha was doing the things that he did, although I might also pick apart some of the really REALLY strong narrative conveniences that made them meet in the first place. I think the show excelled as a mystery and as a callback to that classic noir, “being in love with danger” aesthetic that we don't really see a lot of these days. I can see all of the building blocks to a successful thriller here but unfortunately, the show holds itself back from successfully landing the kill.

Love of Kill Episode 12  by MrAJCosplay/Cartoon Cipher, Apr  3rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Love of Kill ?                     Community score: 3.6            Given the sheer amount of weight this final episode needed to carry, I must admit I'm a little bit conflicted. I kinda knew going in that there was no way this episode was going to tie up the present-day plot thread of the mob boss going after everybody. If anything, it just kinda hammers home how unimportant it is both to the present-day narrative and what goes on in the flashbacks. Looking back on the season as a whole, I definitely think that the material that is adapted shouldn't have taken up as many episodes as it did. While I will admit that the final revelations for everything in the past are mostly satisfying, it wasn't worth the incredibly slow, drawn-out pace that it took to get here. It genuinely feels like the writer of the season started with the decision to end the season with said revelations and then worked backwards to try to fill in the rest of the series. I don't know if this is all handled differently in the source material but that final shot of Château and Ryang-ha squaring off against this organization didn't exactly make me excited for future installments. At the same time, however, I did walk away with some sense of dramatic and emotional pay off.    This whole time I was led to believe that Ryang-ha was only interested in Chateau for more plot-driven reasons. When he says that he's happy the events of his past weren't just a dream, I was caught off guard by its surprising emotional impact. Château was traumatized by her past and completely forgot about it for the sake of her own sense of mental and emotional stability. So it also makes sense that years later growing up, she would start to feel the weight of what she did as a child to someone who was just trying to help her. The show is still very vague on what exactly the original Ryang-ha's mission was, so it's hard to see if he was always tasked with getting her to safety or if she was meant to be delivered to somebody else.    Again the show's plotting isn't necessarily the best, and as mentioned, I think cutting out some of the bloat in the previous episodes could've allowed the show to better flesh out the good elements that were actually here. The show manages to convey the emotions that Château and Ryang-ha felt for the original Ryang-ha, but I just wish I knew him more as a character. Ultimately, he definitely comes across as a naïve albeit kind-hearted kid that was just trying to help people regardless of whether or not he knew what Donny had planned for him all along. There is a sense of tragedy and sadness in him doing everything he can but alas, the show wasn't really about this boy. It has always been more interested in the current Ryang-ha and Château, and I think the reason why I feel so emotionally invested towards things in the end is because of what they're feeling, rather than the narrative putting me in a similar headspace to their emotional investment. A part of me does want to go back and rewatch the show now that I have this added context for why Ryang-ha was doing the things that he did, although I might also pick apart some of the really REALLY strong narrative conveniences that made them meet in the first place. I think the show excelled as a mystery and as a callback to that classic noir, “being in love with danger” aesthetic that we don't really see a lot of these days. I can see all of the building blocks to a successful thriller here but unfortunately, the show holds itself back from successfully landing the kill.

Love of Kill Episode 12  by MrAJCosplay/Cartoon Cipher, Apr  3rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Love of Kill ?                     Community score: 3.6            Given the sheer amount of weight this final episode needed to carry, I must admit I'm a little bit conflicted. I kinda knew going in that there was no way this episode was going to tie up the present-day plot thread of the mob boss going after everybody. If anything, it just kinda hammers home how unimportant it is both to the present-day narrative and what goes on in the flashbacks. Looking back on the season as a whole, I definitely think that the material that is adapted shouldn't have taken up as many episodes as it did. While I will admit that the final revelations for everything in the past are mostly satisfying, it wasn't worth the incredibly slow, drawn-out pace that it took to get here. It genuinely feels like the writer of the season started with the decision to end the season with said revelations and then worked backwards to try to fill in the rest of the series. I don't know if this is all handled differently in the source material but that final shot of Château and Ryang-ha squaring off against this organization didn't exactly make me excited for future installments. At the same time, however, I did walk away with some sense of dramatic and emotional pay off.    This whole time I was led to believe that Ryang-ha was only interested in Chateau for more plot-driven reasons. When he says that he's happy the events of his past weren't just a dream, I was caught off guard by its surprising emotional impact. Château was traumatized by her past and completely forgot about it for the sake of her own sense of mental and emotional stability. So it also makes sense that years later growing up, she would start to feel the weight of what she did as a child to someone who was just trying to help her. The show is still very vague on what exactly the original Ryang-ha's mission was, so it's hard to see if he was always tasked with getting her to safety or if she was meant to be delivered to somebody else.    Again the show's plotting isn't necessarily the best, and as mentioned, I think cutting out some of the bloat in the previous episodes could've allowed the show to better flesh out the good elements that were actually here. The show manages to convey the emotions that Château and Ryang-ha felt for the original Ryang-ha, but I just wish I knew him more as a character. Ultimately, he definitely comes across as a naïve albeit kind-hearted kid that was just trying to help people regardless of whether or not he knew what Donny had planned for him all along. There is a sense of tragedy and sadness in him doing everything he can but alas, the show wasn't really about this boy. It has always been more interested in the current Ryang-ha and Château, and I think the reason why I feel so emotionally invested towards things in the end is because of what they're feeling, rather than the narrative putting me in a similar headspace to their emotional investment. A part of me does want to go back and rewatch the show now that I have this added context for why Ryang-ha was doing the things that he did, although I might also pick apart some of the really REALLY strong narrative conveniences that made them meet in the first place. I think the show excelled as a mystery and as a callback to that classic noir, “being in love with danger” aesthetic that we don't really see a lot of these days. I can see all of the building blocks to a successful thriller here but unfortunately, the show holds itself back from successfully landing the kill.

Platinum End Episode 24  by Nicholas Dupree, Mar 25th 2022                   How would you rate episode 24 of Platinum End ?                     Community score: 1.8            Y'know, in hindsight, maybe electing a suicidal 12-year-old to become God was a bad idea.    I've been struggling with how to cover this finale for a bit, because there are two distinct parts to it, but absolutely nobody gives a single, solitary shit about one of them. So I could waste everyone's time by discussing the worthless excuse for denouement this finale offers for Mirai and Saki, but what is there really left to say about that fetid carcass of a romance? Do you really need me to harp on how heatless their relationship is? Or how the show is incapable of selling any of the happiness they claim to have found with each other? Like they even give Mirai a line saying he's happiest when he sees Saki smile, then never draw either of them smiling in the entire rest of the episode – not even at their wedding!    But that's not what any of you are here for, so let's not pretend. The only thing anybody who hadn't read the manga knew going into this anime, was that the series had an infamously batshit ending. I fully believe that reputation is the only reason anyone voted for this show to continue getting episode reviews. And while this adaptation has cut a lot of the most embarrassing scenes from the manga's back-half, there was no way it could get around this one. And I'm glad it didn't. With a more conventional, happily-ever-after ending, this show would have gone down as little more than a footnote; something brought up in passing like “Hey, did ya know the Death Note guys made a crummy ripoff of The Future Diary one time?” Yet with this ending, Platinum End at last becomes the train wreck it always promised it could be.    So let's get started.    First off, is anyone here a fan of Futurama? If so, you may remember that episode where Bender gets lost in the vacuum of space and becomes host to a super tiny race of aliens who start worshiping him as a God. Predictably he screws it up and they all end up killing each other, before he happens upon the real God in the depths of space, and gets a bit of sardonic wisdom for how to play the all-knowing ruler of a planet: “You have to use a light touch, like a safe cracker or pickpocket. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all.” Platinum End's creators apparently watched that episode, took its jokey non-moral on the nature of godhood at face value, and decided to construct their story's whole universe around it.    Because that's the lesson Shuji learns upon becoming God and observing the entirety of human life and suffering. He gains access to the full gestalt of life on Earth; global inequality, hunger, greed, suffering, love, faith, and all experiences in-between. And the lesson he learns from the voice of God inside his head is that this is just how it's supposed to work – God is just there to hold down the corners of human existence and not break anything until he gets bored and decides to find a successor to man the security monitors. The lark's on the wing, the snail's on the thorn, God's got his thumb up his ass, and all's right in heaven. That is a bleak, nihilist view of metaphysics – that there is an all-knowing, all-powerful being that could change the world in any number of ways, and chooses not to for no particular reason. Which isn't necessarily a complaint! You could do a lot with that, especially after an entire season of everyone arguing about the purpose of God's existence. But this is Platinum End, which means there was never a chance in hell of that happening. Instead, we get the dumbest way to accidentally create a new theology ever conceived.    Shuji, despite being an edgelord teen who read and worshiped Super Atheist Yoneda and his mad cool Facts and Logic, never ran into that old canard about omnipotence. You know the one: “If God can do anything, can God make a rock so heavy even he can't lift it?” Instead, after mulling over the entire spectrum of human experience on a cosmic scale, he comes up with “If God is real, he should kill himself to prove it.” And without a second thought just goes for it. Giving us the amazing line you see up in the review image.    Yes, that's right, God commits suicide in order to see what will happen, and wouldn't you know it, turns out he was a load-bearing pillar of all Earthly life! D'oh! Thus every single living thing on the planet vanishes from existence. In their final moments, Saki and Mirai decide that they had a pretty good run and are happy to die at the whims of the teenager they forced to become God. Yoneda, meanwhile, decides he was right all along and that God and his angels were actually an extinction-level weapon created by human imagination to achieve Armageddon. I guess even in the face of imminent non-existence, dude just has to have the last word. Then, as we zoom out from the dead husk of Earth, in one final stupid twist, it turns out both humans and God were put there by some nameless race of immortal cosmic beings, seemingly as a failed simulation to find a way to kill themselves. It's like if somebody got really drunk and tried to explain the ending to Devilman, but it took six months to tell.    And that's how Platinum End calls it a career. I could sit here and attempt to pontificate over what any of this means, of how the creators came to this as the ending, but let's all be real here. This was never planned. The implications or morals or logistics of this entire ending were never thought through. What this finale was is a desperate Hail Mary pass to get somebody, anybody to remember this story for anything besides being an unremarkable failure. And to an extent it succeeded – I'm writing about it right now, after all. So I guess I have to hand it to them.    Ultimately, that's the legacy of this story. It came in with enough of a pedigree to at least have some expectations, immediately squandered them, and proceeded to flail frantically for any sense of identity or purpose. It never found them, and so all it could hope for was that its violent death throes could make it the type of bad story people will at least dunk on across the internet, and just barely managed it through sheer desperation. After 23 episodes of throwing every stupid, bad idea they could at the wall, they finally got a turd to stick at the 11th hour. Congratulations.

Platinum End Episode 24  by Nicholas Dupree, Mar 25th 2022                   How would you rate episode 24 of Platinum End ?                     Community score: 1.8            Y'know, in hindsight, maybe electing a suicidal 12-year-old to become God was a bad idea.    I've been struggling with how to cover this finale for a bit, because there are two distinct parts to it, but absolutely nobody gives a single, solitary shit about one of them. So I could waste everyone's time by discussing the worthless excuse for denouement this finale offers for Mirai and Saki, but what is there really left to say about that fetid carcass of a romance? Do you really need me to harp on how heatless their relationship is? Or how the show is incapable of selling any of the happiness they claim to have found with each other? Like they even give Mirai a line saying he's happiest when he sees Saki smile, then never draw either of them smiling in the entire rest of the episode – not even at their wedding!    But that's not what any of you are here for, so let's not pretend. The only thing anybody who hadn't read the manga knew going into this anime, was that the series had an infamously batshit ending. I fully believe that reputation is the only reason anyone voted for this show to continue getting episode reviews. And while this adaptation has cut a lot of the most embarrassing scenes from the manga's back-half, there was no way it could get around this one. And I'm glad it didn't. With a more conventional, happily-ever-after ending, this show would have gone down as little more than a footnote; something brought up in passing like “Hey, did ya know the Death Note guys made a crummy ripoff of The Future Diary one time?” Yet with this ending, Platinum End at last becomes the train wreck it always promised it could be.    So let's get started.    First off, is anyone here a fan of Futurama? If so, you may remember that episode where Bender gets lost in the vacuum of space and becomes host to a super tiny race of aliens who start worshiping him as a God. Predictably he screws it up and they all end up killing each other, before he happens upon the real God in the depths of space, and gets a bit of sardonic wisdom for how to play the all-knowing ruler of a planet: “You have to use a light touch, like a safe cracker or pickpocket. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all.” Platinum End's creators apparently watched that episode, took its jokey non-moral on the nature of godhood at face value, and decided to construct their story's whole universe around it.    Because that's the lesson Shuji learns upon becoming God and observing the entirety of human life and suffering. He gains access to the full gestalt of life on Earth; global inequality, hunger, greed, suffering, love, faith, and all experiences in-between. And the lesson he learns from the voice of God inside his head is that this is just how it's supposed to work – God is just there to hold down the corners of human existence and not break anything until he gets bored and decides to find a successor to man the security monitors. The lark's on the wing, the snail's on the thorn, God's got his thumb up his ass, and all's right in heaven. That is a bleak, nihilist view of metaphysics – that there is an all-knowing, all-powerful being that could change the world in any number of ways, and chooses not to for no particular reason. Which isn't necessarily a complaint! You could do a lot with that, especially after an entire season of everyone arguing about the purpose of God's existence. But this is Platinum End, which means there was never a chance in hell of that happening. Instead, we get the dumbest way to accidentally create a new theology ever conceived.    Shuji, despite being an edgelord teen who read and worshiped Super Atheist Yoneda and his mad cool Facts and Logic, never ran into that old canard about omnipotence. You know the one: “If God can do anything, can God make a rock so heavy even he can't lift it?” Instead, after mulling over the entire spectrum of human experience on a cosmic scale, he comes up with “If God is real, he should kill himself to prove it.” And without a second thought just goes for it. Giving us the amazing line you see up in the review image.    Yes, that's right, God commits suicide in order to see what will happen, and wouldn't you know it, turns out he was a load-bearing pillar of all Earthly life! D'oh! Thus every single living thing on the planet vanishes from existence. In their final moments, Saki and Mirai decide that they had a pretty good run and are happy to die at the whims of the teenager they forced to become God. Yoneda, meanwhile, decides he was right all along and that God and his angels were actually an extinction-level weapon created by human imagination to achieve Armageddon. I guess even in the face of imminent non-existence, dude just has to have the last word. Then, as we zoom out from the dead husk of Earth, in one final stupid twist, it turns out both humans and God were put there by some nameless race of immortal cosmic beings, seemingly as a failed simulation to find a way to kill themselves. It's like if somebody got really drunk and tried to explain the ending to Devilman, but it took six months to tell.    And that's how Platinum End calls it a career. I could sit here and attempt to pontificate over what any of this means, of how the creators came to this as the ending, but let's all be real here. This was never planned. The implications or morals or logistics of this entire ending were never thought through. What this finale was is a desperate Hail Mary pass to get somebody, anybody to remember this story for anything besides being an unremarkable failure. And to an extent it succeeded – I'm writing about it right now, after all. So I guess I have to hand it to them.    Ultimately, that's the legacy of this story. It came in with enough of a pedigree to at least have some expectations, immediately squandered them, and proceeded to flail frantically for any sense of identity or purpose. It never found them, and so all it could hope for was that its violent death throes could make it the type of bad story people will at least dunk on across the internet, and just barely managed it through sheer desperation. After 23 episodes of throwing every stupid, bad idea they could at the wall, they finally got a turd to stick at the 11th hour. Congratulations.

Platinum End Episode 24  by Nicholas Dupree, Mar 25th 2022                   How would you rate episode 24 of Platinum End ?                     Community score: 1.8            Y'know, in hindsight, maybe electing a suicidal 12-year-old to become God was a bad idea.    I've been struggling with how to cover this finale for a bit, because there are two distinct parts to it, but absolutely nobody gives a single, solitary shit about one of them. So I could waste everyone's time by discussing the worthless excuse for denouement this finale offers for Mirai and Saki, but what is there really left to say about that fetid carcass of a romance? Do you really need me to harp on how heatless their relationship is? Or how the show is incapable of selling any of the happiness they claim to have found with each other? Like they even give Mirai a line saying he's happiest when he sees Saki smile, then never draw either of them smiling in the entire rest of the episode – not even at their wedding!    But that's not what any of you are here for, so let's not pretend. The only thing anybody who hadn't read the manga knew going into this anime, was that the series had an infamously batshit ending. I fully believe that reputation is the only reason anyone voted for this show to continue getting episode reviews. And while this adaptation has cut a lot of the most embarrassing scenes from the manga's back-half, there was no way it could get around this one. And I'm glad it didn't. With a more conventional, happily-ever-after ending, this show would have gone down as little more than a footnote; something brought up in passing like “Hey, did ya know the Death Note guys made a crummy ripoff of The Future Diary one time?” Yet with this ending, Platinum End at last becomes the train wreck it always promised it could be.    So let's get started.    First off, is anyone here a fan of Futurama? If so, you may remember that episode where Bender gets lost in the vacuum of space and becomes host to a super tiny race of aliens who start worshiping him as a God. Predictably he screws it up and they all end up killing each other, before he happens upon the real God in the depths of space, and gets a bit of sardonic wisdom for how to play the all-knowing ruler of a planet: “You have to use a light touch, like a safe cracker or pickpocket. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all.” Platinum End's creators apparently watched that episode, took its jokey non-moral on the nature of godhood at face value, and decided to construct their story's whole universe around it.    Because that's the lesson Shuji learns upon becoming God and observing the entirety of human life and suffering. He gains access to the full gestalt of life on Earth; global inequality, hunger, greed, suffering, love, faith, and all experiences in-between. And the lesson he learns from the voice of God inside his head is that this is just how it's supposed to work – God is just there to hold down the corners of human existence and not break anything until he gets bored and decides to find a successor to man the security monitors. The lark's on the wing, the snail's on the thorn, God's got his thumb up his ass, and all's right in heaven. That is a bleak, nihilist view of metaphysics – that there is an all-knowing, all-powerful being that could change the world in any number of ways, and chooses not to for no particular reason. Which isn't necessarily a complaint! You could do a lot with that, especially after an entire season of everyone arguing about the purpose of God's existence. But this is Platinum End, which means there was never a chance in hell of that happening. Instead, we get the dumbest way to accidentally create a new theology ever conceived.    Shuji, despite being an edgelord teen who read and worshiped Super Atheist Yoneda and his mad cool Facts and Logic, never ran into that old canard about omnipotence. You know the one: “If God can do anything, can God make a rock so heavy even he can't lift it?” Instead, after mulling over the entire spectrum of human experience on a cosmic scale, he comes up with “If God is real, he should kill himself to prove it.” And without a second thought just goes for it. Giving us the amazing line you see up in the review image.    Yes, that's right, God commits suicide in order to see what will happen, and wouldn't you know it, turns out he was a load-bearing pillar of all Earthly life! D'oh! Thus every single living thing on the planet vanishes from existence. In their final moments, Saki and Mirai decide that they had a pretty good run and are happy to die at the whims of the teenager they forced to become God. Yoneda, meanwhile, decides he was right all along and that God and his angels were actually an extinction-level weapon created by human imagination to achieve Armageddon. I guess even in the face of imminent non-existence, dude just has to have the last word. Then, as we zoom out from the dead husk of Earth, in one final stupid twist, it turns out both humans and God were put there by some nameless race of immortal cosmic beings, seemingly as a failed simulation to find a way to kill themselves. It's like if somebody got really drunk and tried to explain the ending to Devilman, but it took six months to tell.    And that's how Platinum End calls it a career. I could sit here and attempt to pontificate over what any of this means, of how the creators came to this as the ending, but let's all be real here. This was never planned. The implications or morals or logistics of this entire ending were never thought through. What this finale was is a desperate Hail Mary pass to get somebody, anybody to remember this story for anything besides being an unremarkable failure. And to an extent it succeeded – I'm writing about it right now, after all. So I guess I have to hand it to them.    Ultimately, that's the legacy of this story. It came in with enough of a pedigree to at least have some expectations, immediately squandered them, and proceeded to flail frantically for any sense of identity or purpose. It never found them, and so all it could hope for was that its violent death throes could make it the type of bad story people will at least dunk on across the internet, and just barely managed it through sheer desperation. After 23 episodes of throwing every stupid, bad idea they could at the wall, they finally got a turd to stick at the 11th hour. Congratulations.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs   Apr  4th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs ?                     Community score: 3.6              What is this?   Office worker Leon is reincarnated into a particularly punishing dating sim video game, where women reign supreme and only beautiful men have a seat at the table. But Leon has a secret weapon: he remembers everything from his past life, which includes a complete playthrough of the very game in which he is now trapped. Watch Leon spark a revolution to change this new world in order to fulfill his ultimate desire of living a quiet, easy life in the countryside.    Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs is based on Yomu Mishima's light novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Sundays.      How was the first episode?   Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               This seems to be the season for me to be making statements like this, but I liked this story (tale type?) more when it was Past Life Countess, Present Life Otome Game NPC?!. Both series have a similar premise: someone is reincarnated in the world of an otome game as a random background character and have to do their best to get the kind of life they want. In the case of this show (based on the light novels of the same name), Leon seems to mostly want to overcome the disadvantages of his upbringing, which are apparently being both the son of his father's mistress and being born male. The latter does raise an eyebrow from me, because I can't think of any otome games that I've played that have that sort of world set up; naturally this doesn't mean that they don't exist, but it's the kind of detail that makes me wonder if the writer(s) have a whole lot of familiarity with otome games in the first place.    The show feels most concerned with the apparently bizarre nature of the game world he's been reincarnated into, which has elements of both fantasy and science fiction, but that's another mild red flag, because those two genres absolutely coexist in the otome games Steam Prison and Code:Realize.    Even if that wasn't the case, however, there's negligible time spent discovering what exactly Leon is after in going to the fancy academy from the game. Perhaps he does want to marry well, but the loot that he brings back from his foray to steal the game's goodies before the plot of the game begins would seem to negate that need, and he also doesn't seem interested in making a play for the heroine. In fact, he actively dislikes the characters from the game, as we see in his playthrough before he falls down the stairs and dies, which may be the single most original moment here because he's not being creamed by everyone's favorite motor vehicle. Watching Leon play the game is probably the most entertaining piece of the entire episode as he gets increasingly frustrated with its mechanics and characters, but even that is marred by the fact that he's doing it for his sister so that she doesn't have to. Does YouTube not exist in their world? Because last I checked, that was a good way to get to watch the cutscenes from video games without having to play them yourself.    The plot doesn't have a terrible concept, and goodness knows that isekai (otome game or otherwise) is ripe for parody and deconstruction at this stage. But as with The Executioner and Her Way of Life, I don't find this the most compelling telling of this particular story. Plus I'm very concerned that the story's “women have all the power” set up is going to be used as a way for the hero to frame himself as a perpetual victim, and I'm not a fan of that for any gender. This just is kind of a muddle, and that's a shame.        James Beckett  Rating:               I've come to learn that, of all the variations of the modern isekai anime that have cropped up over the years, I tend to prefer the ones where characters get trapped in dating sims and the like. The generic MMORPG worlds that so many of the other isekai trade in bore me to tears, and the stories tend to lack focus and direction on account of the open-ended natures of the video games that the stories are riffing on. When a gal or guy gets reincarnated into a dating sim, though, we have a set cast of characters and plot with more momentum right off the bat, and the characters' knowledge of the game has to be a little more specific than simply having memorized a thousand menus and sub-systems. Granted, the point of cribbing from the tropes of popular dating sims still lies in the fact that the isekai stories are treading familiar ground, but if we must operate entirely within the bumper-lanes of old clichés, I'll settle for the somewhat more entertaining clichés.    For those reasons, I ended up having an okay time with Trapped in a Dating Sim, even if it never left me feeling particularly excited or intrigued. A lot of my reservations come from the episode being such an exposition dump; we don't even meet the other central characters of the dating game that Leon has found himself stuck in until the very final shots of the premiere. Until then, it's the Leon the Loner show from top to bottom. He's not an awful protagonist, but he's nothing new to the genre, either. He's prickly and socially awkward, but he also can't be too much of an asshole, since we still have to be impressed with how much he breaks the game using his Earthbound knowledge of its systems and plot. This means that the story of this premiere is essentially a linear chronicle of how Leon inserts himself into the main plot of the game, with most scenes consisting of Leon monologuing in explicit detail what he knows about the game, how he's going to manipulate it, etc. This is the kind of stuff I almost never find interesting, because it assumes that the joy of the isekai premise comes from having the protagonist narrate the condensed Wiki-entry version of a video game, and not, you know, letting us just watch the story happen in peace.    Still, the setting itself has some cool stuff going for it, namely in how it mixes the elements of its typical fantasy setting with mechs and other sci-fi trappings—always a nice touch. It could also very well be that the story picks up speed once Leon arrives at the academy where the game truly takes place and starts to mingle with all of the characters; it's hard to judge how strong a dating-game style story is going to be when you don't even know most of the ensemble yet. I might stick with Trapped in a Dating Sim for another episode or two, just to see if it ends up winning me over. I doubt it will be as fun as My Next Life as a Villainess, but who knows? Stranger things have happened!        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               We haven't really seen it reflected in anime yet, but in LN and manga scenes, the isekai subgenre is absolutely rife with Otome Game Villainess stories. You can throw a rock in any direction and are just as liable to hit a book about being reincarnated as the mean girl character in a video game as anything else. So it makes sense with that particular gimmick's proliferation that you'd start seeing stories intentionally twisting it for novelty. Thus we have this show, which attempts to pull the perspective away from the stereotypical nobles and upper class, and instead focus on what it's like to be an anonymous background character in one of these stories. Or, well, it sort of tries that, then gets bored immediately with that premise and more or less turns into a typical male-led isekai in the span of half an episode. Whoops.    The biggest weakness for this show is it just doesn't feel like its creators knew all that much about otome games. Stories like My Next Life as a Villainess or I'm in Love with the Villainess use their familiarity with the subgenre to gently (and sometimes harshly) mock the established conventions of them, but you get the impression those are jokes borne from somebody who deeply enjoys that type of media and spends a lot of time thinking about them. This show, on the other hand, doesn't seem to know much about the genre besides there being a female PC and a lot of hot dudes for her to sweet talk. Everything else is crammed in from other facets of gaming – RTS battles, power armor, sci-fi style airships, micro-transactions, all stuff that shows up in other games that has to be ham-fistedly crammed in here because that's what the creators are more familiar with.    I say all this not to call the creators phonies, but because that muddling of its own premise kind of kills the joke. This isn't a parody of otome games or a critical look at the genre from a new point of view, so none of its observations or gags have any teeth. Wow show, you're right, there sure are a lot of haughty pretty boys in games made for women. You really got them there. And yeah, some games aren't balanced very well so you're forced to spend real money on them. Can't remember ever playing an otome game where that was the case but uh, good dunk on...mobile games? What are we parodying here, again?    This even comes down to our protagonist, who spends three full days 100%ing the central game – not because he is a guy who likes otome games, but because his pushy little sister blackmailed him into playing it for her. Because she wants to see the ending CGs but doesn't actually want to play the game to get it, and apparently can't use Google to just look them up? It's a clunky, contrived way to allow a guy who hates otome games to still have all the knowledge necessary to cheat the system and get ahead in life, making him fundamentally identical to a regular isekai hero. So we've taken three lefts to make a right and arrive at a plain wayne isekai story, only now our male lead will have to build a harem of doting anime girls by showing up those handsome gigachads who make up the typical love interests.    Then there's the frankly flaccid attempts at role reversal with the game world's gender politics. See, in this game, it's women who hold all the power! So now MEN are the ones forced into loveless political marriages where they serve older, richer WOMEN who all have disposable male paramours. See, it's clever, because they did CTRL+F for the word “patriarchy” and then replaced the P with an M. My first impression upon seeing that part of the premise was that this would be a cringe-inducing setup for a victim complex to further fuel the main character's resentful snark, but I've read enough of the manga adaptation to know that's largely not the case. But that doesn't stop it from feeling like a lazy way to build a paper-thin world, which isn't a whole lot better.    Combined with stiff, sub-par animation and pacing that leaps from moment to moment with a bald-faced desperation, this one winds up a total mess. It's at once overstuffed and totally lacking in ideas, and has the gall to have its own protagonist complain about how much its world and story suck like it's somebody else's fault. It's just a flop all around.        Caitlin Moore  Rating:               There's a particular type of guy out there who is seethingly angry at the idea of things that exist to play into women's fantasies. He doesn't take issue with media aimed at delivering male fantasies, oh no, but the very concept of media where the central aim is allowing women to indulge in the fantasy of being desirable to a range of hot men? Oh no, that cannot stand! Such things are truly detestable, and any girl who likes them is a shallow bitch.    I can't say that's for sure the case with whoever wrote Trapped in a Dating Sim, but it sure does come across that way. The protagonist, now known as Leon, beefed it on the staircase after his little sister blackmailed him into playing an otome game for three days straight while she went on Hawaii because… she wanted to hear the end conversation? Why not just go look it up? Why would she even care about it decontextualized from the rest of the game? (Or maybe that's just me.) What is this terrible secret she's holding over his head? Our little pre-Leon seems baffled that the game would have JRPG/science fiction/strategy elements, but considering my favorite genre of game is “visual novel with gameplay elements,” it doesn't seem remotely shocking. And why would it make him actively angry?    Then there's the issue of the matriarchal society. Why would that even be a thing in a dating sim? It's such a bizarre detail that has existed in absolutely none of the games I've played. That's the part that made me really get the feeling that whoever created this nonsense has never actually played an otome game, but is super angry that they exist. Pre-Leon grouses that the girls in the game are way too powerful, which shows up in the game world as women subjecting men to the exact same social oppression that women in the real world have been suffering under for centuries. Now, if it seemed like it had any actual intention of examining how things like economics arranged marriages between girls and much older men, that would be one thing, but it just leaves it as one of the reasons being in this world sucks for average men.    I hate being able to see the seams of constructed worlds, where you can see the structures designed specifically for the main character to chafe at and systems designed specifically to screw them over individually. And honestly, most of the episode's plot, with him going off on a little sidequest to get his DLC super-powerful fighter plane and enough money to sidestep his arranged marriage, felt like little more than a digression. The next one, where he starts attending the academy, will probably feel entirely different.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               As someone who loves games—including JRPGs and dating sims—I greatly enjoyed this first episode. Over the years we've had numerous anime about being reincarnated in good games. The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is the opposite: what it would be like to be trapped in a terrible one.    Let's break down the game we see in this anime. To start with, it suffers from the shotgun approach to game design. Alto Liebe may be a dating sim first and foremost, but it also features both turn-based dungeon crawling and strategy RPG mecha battles. Worse yet, the difficulty for these parts of the game is ridiculously unbalanced. The game is literally designed around its cash shop—forcing players to dump even more real-world money into the game if they want to be able to beat it.    The actual story for the game makes things even worse. When the game was just a game, things didn't really need to make sense. You could have fantasy magic, sci-fi mecha, and a feudal society together in the same story. You could even have an ending where the player character ends up with a harmonious harem made up of the kingdom's finest young men. The problem is that when this becomes a fully-realized world, everything becomes taken to their logical extremes.    This is the world our “hero” (and I use that term loosely) Leon finds himself in. The pay-to-win aspect of the game means that not only are the enemies in the world so strong that he almost dies on his first adventure (despite exploiting the enemies' weaknesses) but also that society is obsessed with money. But far worse is that, to contrive a happy reverse harem ending, the world suffers from a ludicrous level of ingrained misandry—with human men relegated to the status of third-class citizens. Leon himself is set to be married off to a 50-year-old black widow who will send him to the front lines to die for a quick insurance payout.    The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is a joke—and that's the point. It's cliché and underwritten to the extreme. It's a hell to live in. Because of this, we can get behind Leon and his rather assholish nature. His drive to be as far away from the main plot as possible is understandable—at least in the background he might find something resembling normalcy. Of course, it almost certainly won't be that simple and I look forward to watching Leon bust through numerous dating sim and RPG game tropes as the weeks go on.     discuss this in the forum (112 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature                The Best and Worst of Winter 2022   Apr  6, 10:10                 anime    With the last few episodes trailing into Spring like an April's fool, it's time to look at the final ranking of the Winter 2022 season.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs   Apr  4th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs ?                     Community score: 3.6              What is this?   Office worker Leon is reincarnated into a particularly punishing dating sim video game, where women reign supreme and only beautiful men have a seat at the table. But Leon has a secret weapon: he remembers everything from his past life, which includes a complete playthrough of the very game in which he is now trapped. Watch Leon spark a revolution to change this new world in order to fulfill his ultimate desire of living a quiet, easy life in the countryside.    Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs is based on Yomu Mishima's light novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Sundays.      How was the first episode?   Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               This seems to be the season for me to be making statements like this, but I liked this story (tale type?) more when it was Past Life Countess, Present Life Otome Game NPC?!. Both series have a similar premise: someone is reincarnated in the world of an otome game as a random background character and have to do their best to get the kind of life they want. In the case of this show (based on the light novels of the same name), Leon seems to mostly want to overcome the disadvantages of his upbringing, which are apparently being both the son of his father's mistress and being born male. The latter does raise an eyebrow from me, because I can't think of any otome games that I've played that have that sort of world set up; naturally this doesn't mean that they don't exist, but it's the kind of detail that makes me wonder if the writer(s) have a whole lot of familiarity with otome games in the first place.    The show feels most concerned with the apparently bizarre nature of the game world he's been reincarnated into, which has elements of both fantasy and science fiction, but that's another mild red flag, because those two genres absolutely coexist in the otome games Steam Prison and Code:Realize.    Even if that wasn't the case, however, there's negligible time spent discovering what exactly Leon is after in going to the fancy academy from the game. Perhaps he does want to marry well, but the loot that he brings back from his foray to steal the game's goodies before the plot of the game begins would seem to negate that need, and he also doesn't seem interested in making a play for the heroine. In fact, he actively dislikes the characters from the game, as we see in his playthrough before he falls down the stairs and dies, which may be the single most original moment here because he's not being creamed by everyone's favorite motor vehicle. Watching Leon play the game is probably the most entertaining piece of the entire episode as he gets increasingly frustrated with its mechanics and characters, but even that is marred by the fact that he's doing it for his sister so that she doesn't have to. Does YouTube not exist in their world? Because last I checked, that was a good way to get to watch the cutscenes from video games without having to play them yourself.    The plot doesn't have a terrible concept, and goodness knows that isekai (otome game or otherwise) is ripe for parody and deconstruction at this stage. But as with The Executioner and Her Way of Life, I don't find this the most compelling telling of this particular story. Plus I'm very concerned that the story's “women have all the power” set up is going to be used as a way for the hero to frame himself as a perpetual victim, and I'm not a fan of that for any gender. This just is kind of a muddle, and that's a shame.        James Beckett  Rating:               I've come to learn that, of all the variations of the modern isekai anime that have cropped up over the years, I tend to prefer the ones where characters get trapped in dating sims and the like. The generic MMORPG worlds that so many of the other isekai trade in bore me to tears, and the stories tend to lack focus and direction on account of the open-ended natures of the video games that the stories are riffing on. When a gal or guy gets reincarnated into a dating sim, though, we have a set cast of characters and plot with more momentum right off the bat, and the characters' knowledge of the game has to be a little more specific than simply having memorized a thousand menus and sub-systems. Granted, the point of cribbing from the tropes of popular dating sims still lies in the fact that the isekai stories are treading familiar ground, but if we must operate entirely within the bumper-lanes of old clichés, I'll settle for the somewhat more entertaining clichés.    For those reasons, I ended up having an okay time with Trapped in a Dating Sim, even if it never left me feeling particularly excited or intrigued. A lot of my reservations come from the episode being such an exposition dump; we don't even meet the other central characters of the dating game that Leon has found himself stuck in until the very final shots of the premiere. Until then, it's the Leon the Loner show from top to bottom. He's not an awful protagonist, but he's nothing new to the genre, either. He's prickly and socially awkward, but he also can't be too much of an asshole, since we still have to be impressed with how much he breaks the game using his Earthbound knowledge of its systems and plot. This means that the story of this premiere is essentially a linear chronicle of how Leon inserts himself into the main plot of the game, with most scenes consisting of Leon monologuing in explicit detail what he knows about the game, how he's going to manipulate it, etc. This is the kind of stuff I almost never find interesting, because it assumes that the joy of the isekai premise comes from having the protagonist narrate the condensed Wiki-entry version of a video game, and not, you know, letting us just watch the story happen in peace.    Still, the setting itself has some cool stuff going for it, namely in how it mixes the elements of its typical fantasy setting with mechs and other sci-fi trappings—always a nice touch. It could also very well be that the story picks up speed once Leon arrives at the academy where the game truly takes place and starts to mingle with all of the characters; it's hard to judge how strong a dating-game style story is going to be when you don't even know most of the ensemble yet. I might stick with Trapped in a Dating Sim for another episode or two, just to see if it ends up winning me over. I doubt it will be as fun as My Next Life as a Villainess, but who knows? Stranger things have happened!        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               We haven't really seen it reflected in anime yet, but in LN and manga scenes, the isekai subgenre is absolutely rife with Otome Game Villainess stories. You can throw a rock in any direction and are just as liable to hit a book about being reincarnated as the mean girl character in a video game as anything else. So it makes sense with that particular gimmick's proliferation that you'd start seeing stories intentionally twisting it for novelty. Thus we have this show, which attempts to pull the perspective away from the stereotypical nobles and upper class, and instead focus on what it's like to be an anonymous background character in one of these stories. Or, well, it sort of tries that, then gets bored immediately with that premise and more or less turns into a typical male-led isekai in the span of half an episode. Whoops.    The biggest weakness for this show is it just doesn't feel like its creators knew all that much about otome games. Stories like My Next Life as a Villainess or I'm in Love with the Villainess use their familiarity with the subgenre to gently (and sometimes harshly) mock the established conventions of them, but you get the impression those are jokes borne from somebody who deeply enjoys that type of media and spends a lot of time thinking about them. This show, on the other hand, doesn't seem to know much about the genre besides there being a female PC and a lot of hot dudes for her to sweet talk. Everything else is crammed in from other facets of gaming – RTS battles, power armor, sci-fi style airships, micro-transactions, all stuff that shows up in other games that has to be ham-fistedly crammed in here because that's what the creators are more familiar with.    I say all this not to call the creators phonies, but because that muddling of its own premise kind of kills the joke. This isn't a parody of otome games or a critical look at the genre from a new point of view, so none of its observations or gags have any teeth. Wow show, you're right, there sure are a lot of haughty pretty boys in games made for women. You really got them there. And yeah, some games aren't balanced very well so you're forced to spend real money on them. Can't remember ever playing an otome game where that was the case but uh, good dunk on...mobile games? What are we parodying here, again?    This even comes down to our protagonist, who spends three full days 100%ing the central game – not because he is a guy who likes otome games, but because his pushy little sister blackmailed him into playing it for her. Because she wants to see the ending CGs but doesn't actually want to play the game to get it, and apparently can't use Google to just look them up? It's a clunky, contrived way to allow a guy who hates otome games to still have all the knowledge necessary to cheat the system and get ahead in life, making him fundamentally identical to a regular isekai hero. So we've taken three lefts to make a right and arrive at a plain wayne isekai story, only now our male lead will have to build a harem of doting anime girls by showing up those handsome gigachads who make up the typical love interests.    Then there's the frankly flaccid attempts at role reversal with the game world's gender politics. See, in this game, it's women who hold all the power! So now MEN are the ones forced into loveless political marriages where they serve older, richer WOMEN who all have disposable male paramours. See, it's clever, because they did CTRL+F for the word “patriarchy” and then replaced the P with an M. My first impression upon seeing that part of the premise was that this would be a cringe-inducing setup for a victim complex to further fuel the main character's resentful snark, but I've read enough of the manga adaptation to know that's largely not the case. But that doesn't stop it from feeling like a lazy way to build a paper-thin world, which isn't a whole lot better.    Combined with stiff, sub-par animation and pacing that leaps from moment to moment with a bald-faced desperation, this one winds up a total mess. It's at once overstuffed and totally lacking in ideas, and has the gall to have its own protagonist complain about how much its world and story suck like it's somebody else's fault. It's just a flop all around.        Caitlin Moore  Rating:               There's a particular type of guy out there who is seethingly angry at the idea of things that exist to play into women's fantasies. He doesn't take issue with media aimed at delivering male fantasies, oh no, but the very concept of media where the central aim is allowing women to indulge in the fantasy of being desirable to a range of hot men? Oh no, that cannot stand! Such things are truly detestable, and any girl who likes them is a shallow bitch.    I can't say that's for sure the case with whoever wrote Trapped in a Dating Sim, but it sure does come across that way. The protagonist, now known as Leon, beefed it on the staircase after his little sister blackmailed him into playing an otome game for three days straight while she went on Hawaii because… she wanted to hear the end conversation? Why not just go look it up? Why would she even care about it decontextualized from the rest of the game? (Or maybe that's just me.) What is this terrible secret she's holding over his head? Our little pre-Leon seems baffled that the game would have JRPG/science fiction/strategy elements, but considering my favorite genre of game is “visual novel with gameplay elements,” it doesn't seem remotely shocking. And why would it make him actively angry?    Then there's the issue of the matriarchal society. Why would that even be a thing in a dating sim? It's such a bizarre detail that has existed in absolutely none of the games I've played. That's the part that made me really get the feeling that whoever created this nonsense has never actually played an otome game, but is super angry that they exist. Pre-Leon grouses that the girls in the game are way too powerful, which shows up in the game world as women subjecting men to the exact same social oppression that women in the real world have been suffering under for centuries. Now, if it seemed like it had any actual intention of examining how things like economics arranged marriages between girls and much older men, that would be one thing, but it just leaves it as one of the reasons being in this world sucks for average men.    I hate being able to see the seams of constructed worlds, where you can see the structures designed specifically for the main character to chafe at and systems designed specifically to screw them over individually. And honestly, most of the episode's plot, with him going off on a little sidequest to get his DLC super-powerful fighter plane and enough money to sidestep his arranged marriage, felt like little more than a digression. The next one, where he starts attending the academy, will probably feel entirely different.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               As someone who loves games—including JRPGs and dating sims—I greatly enjoyed this first episode. Over the years we've had numerous anime about being reincarnated in good games. The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is the opposite: what it would be like to be trapped in a terrible one.    Let's break down the game we see in this anime. To start with, it suffers from the shotgun approach to game design. Alto Liebe may be a dating sim first and foremost, but it also features both turn-based dungeon crawling and strategy RPG mecha battles. Worse yet, the difficulty for these parts of the game is ridiculously unbalanced. The game is literally designed around its cash shop—forcing players to dump even more real-world money into the game if they want to be able to beat it.    The actual story for the game makes things even worse. When the game was just a game, things didn't really need to make sense. You could have fantasy magic, sci-fi mecha, and a feudal society together in the same story. You could even have an ending where the player character ends up with a harmonious harem made up of the kingdom's finest young men. The problem is that when this becomes a fully-realized world, everything becomes taken to their logical extremes.    This is the world our “hero” (and I use that term loosely) Leon finds himself in. The pay-to-win aspect of the game means that not only are the enemies in the world so strong that he almost dies on his first adventure (despite exploiting the enemies' weaknesses) but also that society is obsessed with money. But far worse is that, to contrive a happy reverse harem ending, the world suffers from a ludicrous level of ingrained misandry—with human men relegated to the status of third-class citizens. Leon himself is set to be married off to a 50-year-old black widow who will send him to the front lines to die for a quick insurance payout.    The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is a joke—and that's the point. It's cliché and underwritten to the extreme. It's a hell to live in. Because of this, we can get behind Leon and his rather assholish nature. His drive to be as far away from the main plot as possible is understandable—at least in the background he might find something resembling normalcy.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs   Apr  4th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs ?                     Community score: 3.6              What is this?   Office worker Leon is reincarnated into a particularly punishing dating sim video game, where women reign supreme and only beautiful men have a seat at the table. But Leon has a secret weapon: he remembers everything from his past life, which includes a complete playthrough of the very game in which he is now trapped. Watch Leon spark a revolution to change this new world in order to fulfill his ultimate desire of living a quiet, easy life in the countryside.    Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs is based on Yomu Mishima's light novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Sundays.      How was the first episode?   Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               This seems to be the season for me to be making statements like this, but I liked this story (tale type?) more when it was Past Life Countess, Present Life Otome Game NPC?!. Both series have a similar premise: someone is reincarnated in the world of an otome game as a random background character and have to do their best to get the kind of life they want. In the case of this show (based on the light novels of the same name), Leon seems to mostly want to overcome the disadvantages of his upbringing, which are apparently being both the son of his father's mistress and being born male. The latter does raise an eyebrow from me, because I can't think of any otome games that I've played that have that sort of world set up; naturally this doesn't mean that they don't exist, but it's the kind of detail that makes me wonder if the writer(s) have a whole lot of familiarity with otome games in the first place.    The show feels most concerned with the apparently bizarre nature of the game world he's been reincarnated into, which has elements of both fantasy and science fiction, but that's another mild red flag, because those two genres absolutely coexist in the otome games Steam Prison and Code:Realize.    Even if that wasn't the case, however, there's negligible time spent discovering what exactly Leon is after in going to the fancy academy from the game. Perhaps he does want to marry well, but the loot that he brings back from his foray to steal the game's goodies before the plot of the game begins would seem to negate that need, and he also doesn't seem interested in making a play for the heroine. In fact, he actively dislikes the characters from the game, as we see in his playthrough before he falls down the stairs and dies, which may be the single most original moment here because he's not being creamed by everyone's favorite motor vehicle. Watching Leon play the game is probably the most entertaining piece of the entire episode as he gets increasingly frustrated with its mechanics and characters, but even that is marred by the fact that he's doing it for his sister so that she doesn't have to. Does YouTube not exist in their world? Because last I checked, that was a good way to get to watch the cutscenes from video games without having to play them yourself.    The plot doesn't have a terrible concept, and goodness knows that isekai (otome game or otherwise) is ripe for parody and deconstruction at this stage. But as with The Executioner and Her Way of Life, I don't find this the most compelling telling of this particular story. Plus I'm very concerned that the story's “women have all the power” set up is going to be used as a way for the hero to frame himself as a perpetual victim, and I'm not a fan of that for any gender. This just is kind of a muddle, and that's a shame.        James Beckett  Rating:               I've come to learn that, of all the variations of the modern isekai anime that have cropped up over the years, I tend to prefer the ones where characters get trapped in dating sims and the like. The generic MMORPG worlds that so many of the other isekai trade in bore me to tears, and the stories tend to lack focus and direction on account of the open-ended natures of the video games that the stories are riffing on. When a gal or guy gets reincarnated into a dating sim, though, we have a set cast of characters and plot with more momentum right off the bat, and the characters' knowledge of the game has to be a little more specific than simply having memorized a thousand menus and sub-systems. Granted, the point of cribbing from the tropes of popular dating sims still lies in the fact that the isekai stories are treading familiar ground, but if we must operate entirely within the bumper-lanes of old clichés, I'll settle for the somewhat more entertaining clichés.    For those reasons, I ended up having an okay time with Trapped in a Dating Sim, even if it never left me feeling particularly excited or intrigued. A lot of my reservations come from the episode being such an exposition dump; we don't even meet the other central characters of the dating game that Leon has found himself stuck in until the very final shots of the premiere. Until then, it's the Leon the Loner show from top to bottom. He's not an awful protagonist, but he's nothing new to the genre, either. He's prickly and socially awkward, but he also can't be too much of an asshole, since we still have to be impressed with how much he breaks the game using his Earthbound knowledge of its systems and plot. This means that the story of this premiere is essentially a linear chronicle of how Leon inserts himself into the main plot of the game, with most scenes consisting of Leon monologuing in explicit detail what he knows about the game, how he's going to manipulate it, etc. This is the kind of stuff I almost never find interesting, because it assumes that the joy of the isekai premise comes from having the protagonist narrate the condensed Wiki-entry version of a video game, and not, you know, letting us just watch the story happen in peace.    Still, the setting itself has some cool stuff going for it, namely in how it mixes the elements of its typical fantasy setting with mechs and other sci-fi trappings—always a nice touch. It could also very well be that the story picks up speed once Leon arrives at the academy where the game truly takes place and starts to mingle with all of the characters; it's hard to judge how strong a dating-game style story is going to be when you don't even know most of the ensemble yet. I might stick with Trapped in a Dating Sim for another episode or two, just to see if it ends up winning me over. I doubt it will be as fun as My Next Life as a Villainess, but who knows? Stranger things have happened!        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               We haven't really seen it reflected in anime yet, but in LN and manga scenes, the isekai subgenre is absolutely rife with Otome Game Villainess stories. You can throw a rock in any direction and are just as liable to hit a book about being reincarnated as the mean girl character in a video game as anything else. So it makes sense with that particular gimmick's proliferation that you'd start seeing stories intentionally twisting it for novelty. Thus we have this show, which attempts to pull the perspective away from the stereotypical nobles and upper class, and instead focus on what it's like to be an anonymous background character in one of these stories. Or, well, it sort of tries that, then gets bored immediately with that premise and more or less turns into a typical male-led isekai in the span of half an episode. Whoops.    The biggest weakness for this show is it just doesn't feel like its creators knew all that much about otome games. Stories like My Next Life as a Villainess or I'm in Love with the Villainess use their familiarity with the subgenre to gently (and sometimes harshly) mock the established conventions of them, but you get the impression those are jokes borne from somebody who deeply enjoys that type of media and spends a lot of time thinking about them. This show, on the other hand, doesn't seem to know much about the genre besides there being a female PC and a lot of hot dudes for her to sweet talk. Everything else is crammed in from other facets of gaming – RTS battles, power armor, sci-fi style airships, micro-transactions, all stuff that shows up in other games that has to be ham-fistedly crammed in here because that's what the creators are more familiar with.    I say all this not to call the creators phonies, but because that muddling of its own premise kind of kills the joke. This isn't a parody of otome games or a critical look at the genre from a new point of view, so none of its observations or gags have any teeth. Wow show, you're right, there sure are a lot of haughty pretty boys in games made for women. You really got them there. And yeah, some games aren't balanced very well so you're forced to spend real money on them. Can't remember ever playing an otome game where that was the case but uh, good dunk on...mobile games? What are we parodying here, again?    This even comes down to our protagonist, who spends three full days 100%ing the central game – not because he is a guy who likes otome games, but because his pushy little sister blackmailed him into playing it for her. Because she wants to see the ending CGs but doesn't actually want to play the game to get it, and apparently can't use Google to just look them up? It's a clunky, contrived way to allow a guy who hates otome games to still have all the knowledge necessary to cheat the system and get ahead in life, making him fundamentally identical to a regular isekai hero. So we've taken three lefts to make a right and arrive at a plain wayne isekai story, only now our male lead will have to build a harem of doting anime girls by showing up those handsome gigachads who make up the typical love interests.    Then there's the frankly flaccid attempts at role reversal with the game world's gender politics. See, in this game, it's women who hold all the power! So now MEN are the ones forced into loveless political marriages where they serve older, richer WOMEN who all have disposable male paramours. See, it's clever, because they did CTRL+F for the word “patriarchy” and then replaced the P with an M. My first impression upon seeing that part of the premise was that this would be a cringe-inducing setup for a victim complex to further fuel the main character's resentful snark, but I've read enough of the manga adaptation to know that's largely not the case. But that doesn't stop it from feeling like a lazy way to build a paper-thin world, which isn't a whole lot better.    Combined with stiff, sub-par animation and pacing that leaps from moment to moment with a bald-faced desperation, this one winds up a total mess. It's at once overstuffed and totally lacking in ideas, and has the gall to have its own protagonist complain about how much its world and story suck like it's somebody else's fault. It's just a flop all around.        Caitlin Moore  Rating:               There's a particular type of guy out there who is seethingly angry at the idea of things that exist to play into women's fantasies. He doesn't take issue with media aimed at delivering male fantasies, oh no, but the very concept of media where the central aim is allowing women to indulge in the fantasy of being desirable to a range of hot men? Oh no, that cannot stand! Such things are truly detestable, and any girl who likes them is a shallow bitch.    I can't say that's for sure the case with whoever wrote Trapped in a Dating Sim, but it sure does come across that way. The protagonist, now known as Leon, beefed it on the staircase after his little sister blackmailed him into playing an otome game for three days straight while she went on Hawaii because… she wanted to hear the end conversation? Why not just go look it up? Why would she even care about it decontextualized from the rest of the game? (Or maybe that's just me.) What is this terrible secret she's holding over his head? Our little pre-Leon seems baffled that the game would have JRPG/science fiction/strategy elements, but considering my favorite genre of game is “visual novel with gameplay elements,” it doesn't seem remotely shocking. And why would it make him actively angry?    Then there's the issue of the matriarchal society. Why would that even be a thing in a dating sim? It's such a bizarre detail that has existed in absolutely none of the games I've played. That's the part that made me really get the feeling that whoever created this nonsense has never actually played an otome game, but is super angry that they exist. Pre-Leon grouses that the girls in the game are way too powerful, which shows up in the game world as women subjecting men to the exact same social oppression that women in the real world have been suffering under for centuries. Now, if it seemed like it had any actual intention of examining how things like economics arranged marriages between girls and much older men, that would be one thing, but it just leaves it as one of the reasons being in this world sucks for average men.    I hate being able to see the seams of constructed worlds, where you can see the structures designed specifically for the main character to chafe at and systems designed specifically to screw them over individually. And honestly, most of the episode's plot, with him going off on a little sidequest to get his DLC super-powerful fighter plane and enough money to sidestep his arranged marriage, felt like little more than a digression. The next one, where he starts attending the academy, will probably feel entirely different.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               As someone who loves games—including JRPGs and dating sims—I greatly enjoyed this first episode. Over the years we've had numerous anime about being reincarnated in good games. The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is the opposite: what it would be like to be trapped in a terrible one.    Let's break down the game we see in this anime. To start with, it suffers from the shotgun approach to game design. Alto Liebe may be a dating sim first and foremost, but it also features both turn-based dungeon crawling and strategy RPG mecha battles. Worse yet, the difficulty for these parts of the game is ridiculously unbalanced. The game is literally designed around its cash shop—forcing players to dump even more real-world money into the game if they want to be able to beat it.    The actual story for the game makes things even worse. When the game was just a game, things didn't really need to make sense. You could have fantasy magic, sci-fi mecha, and a feudal society together in the same story. You could even have an ending where the player character ends up with a harmonious harem made up of the kingdom's finest young men. The problem is that when this becomes a fully-realized world, everything becomes taken to their logical extremes.    This is the world our “hero” (and I use that term loosely) Leon finds himself in. The pay-to-win aspect of the game means that not only are the enemies in the world so strong that he almost dies on his first adventure (despite exploiting the enemies' weaknesses) but also that society is obsessed with money. But far worse is that, to contrive a happy reverse harem ending, the world suffers from a ludicrous level of ingrained misandry—with human men relegated to the status of third-class citizens. Leon himself is set to be married off to a 50-year-old black widow who will send him to the front lines to die for a quick insurance payout.    The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is a joke—and that's the point. It's cliché and underwritten to the extreme. It's a hell to live in.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs   Apr  4th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs ?                     Community score: 3.6              What is this?   Office worker Leon is reincarnated into a particularly punishing dating sim video game, where women reign supreme and only beautiful men have a seat at the table. But Leon has a secret weapon: he remembers everything from his past life, which includes a complete playthrough of the very game in which he is now trapped. Watch Leon spark a revolution to change this new world in order to fulfill his ultimate desire of living a quiet, easy life in the countryside.    Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs is based on Yomu Mishima's light novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Sundays.      How was the first episode?   Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               This seems to be the season for me to be making statements like this, but I liked this story (tale type?) more when it was Past Life Countess, Present Life Otome Game NPC?!. Both series have a similar premise: someone is reincarnated in the world of an otome game as a random background character and have to do their best to get the kind of life they want. In the case of this show (based on the light novels of the same name), Leon seems to mostly want to overcome the disadvantages of his upbringing, which are apparently being both the son of his father's mistress and being born male. The latter does raise an eyebrow from me, because I can't think of any otome games that I've played that have that sort of world set up; naturally this doesn't mean that they don't exist, but it's the kind of detail that makes me wonder if the writer(s) have a whole lot of familiarity with otome games in the first place.    The show feels most concerned with the apparently bizarre nature of the game world he's been reincarnated into, which has elements of both fantasy and science fiction, but that's another mild red flag, because those two genres absolutely coexist in the otome games Steam Prison and Code:Realize.    Even if that wasn't the case, however, there's negligible time spent discovering what exactly Leon is after in going to the fancy academy from the game. Perhaps he does want to marry well, but the loot that he brings back from his foray to steal the game's goodies before the plot of the game begins would seem to negate that need, and he also doesn't seem interested in making a play for the heroine. In fact, he actively dislikes the characters from the game, as we see in his playthrough before he falls down the stairs and dies, which may be the single most original moment here because he's not being creamed by everyone's favorite motor vehicle. Watching Leon play the game is probably the most entertaining piece of the entire episode as he gets increasingly frustrated with its mechanics and characters, but even that is marred by the fact that he's doing it for his sister so that she doesn't have to. Does YouTube not exist in their world? Because last I checked, that was a good way to get to watch the cutscenes from video games without having to play them yourself.    The plot doesn't have a terrible concept, and goodness knows that isekai (otome game or otherwise) is ripe for parody and deconstruction at this stage. But as with The Executioner and Her Way of Life, I don't find this the most compelling telling of this particular story. Plus I'm very concerned that the story's “women have all the power” set up is going to be used as a way for the hero to frame himself as a perpetual victim, and I'm not a fan of that for any gender. This just is kind of a muddle, and that's a shame.        James Beckett  Rating:               I've come to learn that, of all the variations of the modern isekai anime that have cropped up over the years, I tend to prefer the ones where characters get trapped in dating sims and the like. The generic MMORPG worlds that so many of the other isekai trade in bore me to tears, and the stories tend to lack focus and direction on account of the open-ended natures of the video games that the stories are riffing on. When a gal or guy gets reincarnated into a dating sim, though, we have a set cast of characters and plot with more momentum right off the bat, and the characters' knowledge of the game has to be a little more specific than simply having memorized a thousand menus and sub-systems. Granted, the point of cribbing from the tropes of popular dating sims still lies in the fact that the isekai stories are treading familiar ground, but if we must operate entirely within the bumper-lanes of old clichés, I'll settle for the somewhat more entertaining clichés.    For those reasons, I ended up having an okay time with Trapped in a Dating Sim, even if it never left me feeling particularly excited or intrigued. A lot of my reservations come from the episode being such an exposition dump; we don't even meet the other central characters of the dating game that Leon has found himself stuck in until the very final shots of the premiere. Until then, it's the Leon the Loner show from top to bottom. He's not an awful protagonist, but he's nothing new to the genre, either. He's prickly and socially awkward, but he also can't be too much of an asshole, since we still have to be impressed with how much he breaks the game using his Earthbound knowledge of its systems and plot. This means that the story of this premiere is essentially a linear chronicle of how Leon inserts himself into the main plot of the game, with most scenes consisting of Leon monologuing in explicit detail what he knows about the game, how he's going to manipulate it, etc. This is the kind of stuff I almost never find interesting, because it assumes that the joy of the isekai premise comes from having the protagonist narrate the condensed Wiki-entry version of a video game, and not, you know, letting us just watch the story happen in peace.    Still, the setting itself has some cool stuff going for it, namely in how it mixes the elements of its typical fantasy setting with mechs and other sci-fi trappings—always a nice touch. It could also very well be that the story picks up speed once Leon arrives at the academy where the game truly takes place and starts to mingle with all of the characters; it's hard to judge how strong a dating-game style story is going to be when you don't even know most of the ensemble yet. I might stick with Trapped in a Dating Sim for another episode or two, just to see if it ends up winning me over. I doubt it will be as fun as My Next Life as a Villainess, but who knows? Stranger things have happened!        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               We haven't really seen it reflected in anime yet, but in LN and manga scenes, the isekai subgenre is absolutely rife with Otome Game Villainess stories. You can throw a rock in any direction and are just as liable to hit a book about being reincarnated as the mean girl character in a video game as anything else. So it makes sense with that particular gimmick's proliferation that you'd start seeing stories intentionally twisting it for novelty. Thus we have this show, which attempts to pull the perspective away from the stereotypical nobles and upper class, and instead focus on what it's like to be an anonymous background character in one of these stories. Or, well, it sort of tries that, then gets bored immediately with that premise and more or less turns into a typical male-led isekai in the span of half an episode. Whoops.    The biggest weakness for this show is it just doesn't feel like its creators knew all that much about otome games. Stories like My Next Life as a Villainess or I'm in Love with the Villainess use their familiarity with the subgenre to gently (and sometimes harshly) mock the established conventions of them, but you get the impression those are jokes borne from somebody who deeply enjoys that type of media and spends a lot of time thinking about them. This show, on the other hand, doesn't seem to know much about the genre besides there being a female PC and a lot of hot dudes for her to sweet talk. Everything else is crammed in from other facets of gaming – RTS battles, power armor, sci-fi style airships, micro-transactions, all stuff that shows up in other games that has to be ham-fistedly crammed in here because that's what the creators are more familiar with.    I say all this not to call the creators phonies, but because that muddling of its own premise kind of kills the joke. This isn't a parody of otome games or a critical look at the genre from a new point of view, so none of its observations or gags have any teeth. Wow show, you're right, there sure are a lot of haughty pretty boys in games made for women. You really got them there. And yeah, some games aren't balanced very well so you're forced to spend real money on them. Can't remember ever playing an otome game where that was the case but uh, good dunk on...mobile games? What are we parodying here, again?    This even comes down to our protagonist, who spends three full days 100%ing the central game – not because he is a guy who likes otome games, but because his pushy little sister blackmailed him into playing it for her. Because she wants to see the ending CGs but doesn't actually want to play the game to get it, and apparently can't use Google to just look them up? It's a clunky, contrived way to allow a guy who hates otome games to still have all the knowledge necessary to cheat the system and get ahead in life, making him fundamentally identical to a regular isekai hero. So we've taken three lefts to make a right and arrive at a plain wayne isekai story, only now our male lead will have to build a harem of doting anime girls by showing up those handsome gigachads who make up the typical love interests.    Then there's the frankly flaccid attempts at role reversal with the game world's gender politics. See, in this game, it's women who hold all the power! So now MEN are the ones forced into loveless political marriages where they serve older, richer WOMEN who all have disposable male paramours. See, it's clever, because they did CTRL+F for the word “patriarchy” and then replaced the P with an M. My first impression upon seeing that part of the premise was that this would be a cringe-inducing setup for a victim complex to further fuel the main character's resentful snark, but I've read enough of the manga adaptation to know that's largely not the case. But that doesn't stop it from feeling like a lazy way to build a paper-thin world, which isn't a whole lot better.    Combined with stiff, sub-par animation and pacing that leaps from moment to moment with a bald-faced desperation, this one winds up a total mess. It's at once overstuffed and totally lacking in ideas, and has the gall to have its own protagonist complain about how much its world and story suck like it's somebody else's fault. It's just a flop all around.        Caitlin Moore  Rating:               There's a particular type of guy out there who is seethingly angry at the idea of things that exist to play into women's fantasies. He doesn't take issue with media aimed at delivering male fantasies, oh no, but the very concept of media where the central aim is allowing women to indulge in the fantasy of being desirable to a range of hot men? Oh no, that cannot stand! Such things are truly detestable, and any girl who likes them is a shallow bitch.    I can't say that's for sure the case with whoever wrote Trapped in a Dating Sim, but it sure does come across that way. The protagonist, now known as Leon, beefed it on the staircase after his little sister blackmailed him into playing an otome game for three days straight while she went on Hawaii because… she wanted to hear the end conversation? Why not just go look it up? Why would she even care about it decontextualized from the rest of the game? (Or maybe that's just me.) What is this terrible secret she's holding over his head? Our little pre-Leon seems baffled that the game would have JRPG/science fiction/strategy elements, but considering my favorite genre of game is “visual novel with gameplay elements,” it doesn't seem remotely shocking. And why would it make him actively angry?    Then there's the issue of the matriarchal society. Why would that even be a thing in a dating sim? It's such a bizarre detail that has existed in absolutely none of the games I've played. That's the part that made me really get the feeling that whoever created this nonsense has never actually played an otome game, but is super angry that they exist. Pre-Leon grouses that the girls in the game are way too powerful, which shows up in the game world as women subjecting men to the exact same social oppression that women in the real world have been suffering under for centuries. Now, if it seemed like it had any actual intention of examining how things like economics arranged marriages between girls and much older men, that would be one thing, but it just leaves it as one of the reasons being in this world sucks for average men.    I hate being able to see the seams of constructed worlds, where you can see the structures designed specifically for the main character to chafe at and systems designed specifically to screw them over individually. And honestly, most of the episode's plot, with him going off on a little sidequest to get his DLC super-powerful fighter plane and enough money to sidestep his arranged marriage, felt like little more than a digression. The next one, where he starts attending the academy, will probably feel entirely different.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               As someone who loves games—including JRPGs and dating sims—I greatly enjoyed this first episode. Over the years we've had numerous anime about being reincarnated in good games. The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is the opposite: what it would be like to be trapped in a terrible one.    Let's break down the game we see in this anime. To start with, it suffers from the shotgun approach to game design. Alto Liebe may be a dating sim first and foremost, but it also features both turn-based dungeon crawling and strategy RPG mecha battles. Worse yet, the difficulty for these parts of the game is ridiculously unbalanced. The game is literally designed around its cash shop—forcing players to dump even more real-world money into the game if they want to be able to beat it.    The actual story for the game makes things even worse. When the game was just a game, things didn't really need to make sense. You could have fantasy magic, sci-fi mecha, and a feudal society together in the same story. You could even have an ending where the player character ends up with a harmonious harem made up of the kingdom's finest young men. The problem is that when this becomes a fully-realized world, everything becomes taken to their logical extremes.    This is the world our “hero” (and I use that term loosely) Leon finds himself in. The pay-to-win aspect of the game means that not only are the enemies in the world so strong that he almost dies on his first adventure (despite exploiting the enemies' weaknesses) but also that society is obsessed with money. But far worse is that, to contrive a happy reverse harem ending, the world suffers from a ludicrous level of ingrained misandry—with human men relegated to the status of third-class citizens. Leon himself is set to be married off to a 50-year-old black widow who will send him to the front lines to die for a quick insurance payout.    The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is a joke—and that's the point. It's cliché and underwritten to the extreme. It's a hell to live in. Because of this, we can get behind Leon and his rather assholish nature. His drive to be as far away from the main plot as possible is understandable—at least in the background he might find something resembling normalcy. Of course, it almost certainly won't be that simple and I look forward to watching Leon bust through numerous dating sim and RPG game tropes as the weeks go on.     discuss this in the forum (112 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature                The Best and Worst of Winter 2022   Apr  6, 10:10                 anime    With the last few episodes trailing into Spring like an April's fool, it's time to look at the final ranking of the Winter 2022 season.

Even if that wasn't the case, however, there's negligible time spent discovering what exactly Leon is after in going to the fancy academy from the game. Perhaps he does want to marry well, but the loot that he brings back from his foray to steal the game's goodies before the plot of the game begins would seem to negate that need, and he also doesn't seem interested in making a play for the heroine. In fact, he actively dislikes the characters from the game, as we see in his playthrough before he falls down the stairs and dies, which may be the single most original moment here because he's not being creamed by everyone's favorite motor vehicle. Watching Leon play the game is probably the most entertaining piece of the entire episode as he gets increasingly frustrated with its mechanics and characters, but even that is marred by the fact that he's doing it for his sister so that she doesn't have to. Does YouTube not exist in their world? Because last I checked, that was a good way to get to watch the cutscenes from video games without having to play them yourself.    The plot doesn't have a terrible concept, and goodness knows that isekai (otome game or otherwise) is ripe for parody and deconstruction at this stage. But as with The Executioner and Her Way of Life, I don't find this the most compelling telling of this particular story. Plus I'm very concerned that the story's “women have all the power” set up is going to be used as a way for the hero to frame himself as a perpetual victim, and I'm not a fan of that for any gender. This just is kind of a muddle, and that's a shame.        James Beckett  Rating:               I've come to learn that, of all the variations of the modern isekai anime that have cropped up over the years, I tend to prefer the ones where characters get trapped in dating sims and the like. The generic MMORPG worlds that so many of the other isekai trade in bore me to tears, and the stories tend to lack focus and direction on account of the open-ended natures of the video games that the stories are riffing on. When a gal or guy gets reincarnated into a dating sim, though, we have a set cast of characters and plot with more momentum right off the bat, and the characters' knowledge of the game has to be a little more specific than simply having memorized a thousand menus and sub-systems. Granted, the point of cribbing from the tropes of popular dating sims still lies in the fact that the isekai stories are treading familiar ground, but if we must operate entirely within the bumper-lanes of old clichés, I'll settle for the somewhat more entertaining clichés.    For those reasons, I ended up having an okay time with Trapped in a Dating Sim, even if it never left me feeling particularly excited or intrigued. A lot of my reservations come from the episode being such an exposition dump; we don't even meet the other central characters of the dating game that Leon has found himself stuck in until the very final shots of the premiere. Until then, it's the Leon the Loner show from top to bottom. He's not an awful protagonist, but he's nothing new to the genre, either. He's prickly and socially awkward, but he also can't be too much of an asshole, since we still have to be impressed with how much he breaks the game using his Earthbound knowledge of its systems and plot. This means that the story of this premiere is essentially a linear chronicle of how Leon inserts himself into the main plot of the game, with most scenes consisting of Leon monologuing in explicit detail what he knows about the game, how he's going to manipulate it, etc. This is the kind of stuff I almost never find interesting, because it assumes that the joy of the isekai premise comes from having the protagonist narrate the condensed Wiki-entry version of a video game, and not, you know, letting us just watch the story happen in peace.    Still, the setting itself has some cool stuff going for it, namely in how it mixes the elements of its typical fantasy setting with mechs and other sci-fi trappings—always a nice touch. It could also very well be that the story picks up speed once Leon arrives at the academy where the game truly takes place and starts to mingle with all of the characters; it's hard to judge how strong a dating-game style story is going to be when you don't even know most of the ensemble yet. I might stick with Trapped in a Dating Sim for another episode or two, just to see if it ends up winning me over. I doubt it will be as fun as My Next Life as a Villainess, but who knows? Stranger things have happened!        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               We haven't really seen it reflected in anime yet, but in LN and manga scenes, the isekai subgenre is absolutely rife with Otome Game Villainess stories. You can throw a rock in any direction and are just as liable to hit a book about being reincarnated as the mean girl character in a video game as anything else. So it makes sense with that particular gimmick's proliferation that you'd start seeing stories intentionally twisting it for novelty. Thus we have this show, which attempts to pull the perspective away from the stereotypical nobles and upper class, and instead focus on what it's like to be an anonymous background character in one of these stories. Or, well, it sort of tries that, then gets bored immediately with that premise and more or less turns into a typical male-led isekai in the span of half an episode. Whoops.    The biggest weakness for this show is it just doesn't feel like its creators knew all that much about otome games. Stories like My Next Life as a Villainess or I'm in Love with the Villainess use their familiarity with the subgenre to gently (and sometimes harshly) mock the established conventions of them, but you get the impression those are jokes borne from somebody who deeply enjoys that type of media and spends a lot of time thinking about them. This show, on the other hand, doesn't seem to know much about the genre besides there being a female PC and a lot of hot dudes for her to sweet talk. Everything else is crammed in from other facets of gaming – RTS battles, power armor, sci-fi style airships, micro-transactions, all stuff that shows up in other games that has to be ham-fistedly crammed in here because that's what the creators are more familiar with.    I say all this not to call the creators phonies, but because that muddling of its own premise kind of kills the joke. This isn't a parody of otome games or a critical look at the genre from a new point of view, so none of its observations or gags have any teeth. Wow show, you're right, there sure are a lot of haughty pretty boys in games made for women. You really got them there. And yeah, some games aren't balanced very well so you're forced to spend real money on them. Can't remember ever playing an otome game where that was the case but uh, good dunk on...mobile games? What are we parodying here, again?    This even comes down to our protagonist, who spends three full days 100%ing the central game – not because he is a guy who likes otome games, but because his pushy little sister blackmailed him into playing it for her. Because she wants to see the ending CGs but doesn't actually want to play the game to get it, and apparently can't use Google to just look them up? It's a clunky, contrived way to allow a guy who hates otome games to still have all the knowledge necessary to cheat the system and get ahead in life, making him fundamentally identical to a regular isekai hero. So we've taken three lefts to make a right and arrive at a plain wayne isekai story, only now our male lead will have to build a harem of doting anime girls by showing up those handsome gigachads who make up the typical love interests.    Then there's the frankly flaccid attempts at role reversal with the game world's gender politics. See, in this game, it's women who hold all the power! So now MEN are the ones forced into loveless political marriages where they serve older, richer WOMEN who all have disposable male paramours. See, it's clever, because they did CTRL+F for the word “patriarchy” and then replaced the P with an M. My first impression upon seeing that part of the premise was that this would be a cringe-inducing setup for a victim complex to further fuel the main character's resentful snark, but I've read enough of the manga adaptation to know that's largely not the case. But that doesn't stop it from feeling like a lazy way to build a paper-thin world, which isn't a whole lot better.    Combined with stiff, sub-par animation and pacing that leaps from moment to moment with a bald-faced desperation, this one winds up a total mess. It's at once overstuffed and totally lacking in ideas, and has the gall to have its own protagonist complain about how much its world and story suck like it's somebody else's fault. It's just a flop all around.        Caitlin Moore  Rating:               There's a particular type of guy out there who is seethingly angry at the idea of things that exist to play into women's fantasies. He doesn't take issue with media aimed at delivering male fantasies, oh no, but the very concept of media where the central aim is allowing women to indulge in the fantasy of being desirable to a range of hot men? Oh no, that cannot stand! Such things are truly detestable, and any girl who likes them is a shallow bitch.    I can't say that's for sure the case with whoever wrote Trapped in a Dating Sim, but it sure does come across that way. The protagonist, now known as Leon, beefed it on the staircase after his little sister blackmailed him into playing an otome game for three days straight while she went on Hawaii because… she wanted to hear the end conversation? Why not just go look it up? Why would she even care about it decontextualized from the rest of the game? (Or maybe that's just me.) What is this terrible secret she's holding over his head? Our little pre-Leon seems baffled that the game would have JRPG/science fiction/strategy elements, but considering my favorite genre of game is “visual novel with gameplay elements,” it doesn't seem remotely shocking. And why would it make him actively angry?    Then there's the issue of the matriarchal society. Why would that even be a thing in a dating sim? It's such a bizarre detail that has existed in absolutely none of the games I've played. That's the part that made me really get the feeling that whoever created this nonsense has never actually played an otome game, but is super angry that they exist. Pre-Leon grouses that the girls in the game are way too powerful, which shows up in the game world as women subjecting men to the exact same social oppression that women in the real world have been suffering under for centuries. Now, if it seemed like it had any actual intention of examining how things like economics arranged marriages between girls and much older men, that would be one thing, but it just leaves it as one of the reasons being in this world sucks for average men.    I hate being able to see the seams of constructed worlds, where you can see the structures designed specifically for the main character to chafe at and systems designed specifically to screw them over individually. And honestly, most of the episode's plot, with him going off on a little sidequest to get his DLC super-powerful fighter plane and enough money to sidestep his arranged marriage, felt like little more than a digression. The next one, where he starts attending the academy, will probably feel entirely different.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               As someone who loves games—including JRPGs and dating sims—I greatly enjoyed this first episode. Over the years we've had numerous anime about being reincarnated in good games. The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is the opposite: what it would be like to be trapped in a terrible one.    Let's break down the game we see in this anime. To start with, it suffers from the shotgun approach to game design. Alto Liebe may be a dating sim first and foremost, but it also features both turn-based dungeon crawling and strategy RPG mecha battles. Worse yet, the difficulty for these parts of the game is ridiculously unbalanced. The game is literally designed around its cash shop—forcing players to dump even more real-world money into the game if they want to be able to beat it.    The actual story for the game makes things even worse. When the game was just a game, things didn't really need to make sense. You could have fantasy magic, sci-fi mecha, and a feudal society together in the same story. You could even have an ending where the player character ends up with a harmonious harem made up of the kingdom's finest young men. The problem is that when this becomes a fully-realized world, everything becomes taken to their logical extremes.    This is the world our “hero” (and I use that term loosely) Leon finds himself in. The pay-to-win aspect of the game means that not only are the enemies in the world so strong that he almost dies on his first adventure (despite exploiting the enemies' weaknesses) but also that society is obsessed with money. But far worse is that, to contrive a happy reverse harem ending, the world suffers from a ludicrous level of ingrained misandry—with human men relegated to the status of third-class citizens. Leon himself is set to be married off to a 50-year-old black widow who will send him to the front lines to die for a quick insurance payout.    The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is a joke—and that's the point. It's cliché and underwritten to the extreme. It's a hell to live in. Because of this, we can get behind Leon and his rather assholish nature. His drive to be as far away from the main plot as possible is understandable—at least in the background he might find something resembling normalcy. Of course, it almost certainly won't be that simple and I look forward to watching Leon bust through numerous dating sim and RPG game tropes as the weeks go on.     discuss this in the forum (112 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,{}

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs   Apr  4th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs ?                     Community score: 3.6              What is this?   Office worker Leon is reincarnated into a particularly punishing dating sim video game, where women reign supreme and only beautiful men have a seat at the table. But Leon has a secret weapon: he remembers everything from his past life, which includes a complete playthrough of the very game in which he is now trapped. Watch Leon spark a revolution to change this new world in order to fulfill his ultimate desire of living a quiet, easy life in the countryside.    Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs is based on Yomu Mishima's light novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Sundays.      How was the first episode?   Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               This seems to be the season for me to be making statements like this, but I liked this story (tale type?) more when it was Past Life Countess, Present Life Otome Game NPC?!. Both series have a similar premise: someone is reincarnated in the world of an otome game as a random background character and have to do their best to get the kind of life they want. In the case of this show (based on the light novels of the same name), Leon seems to mostly want to overcome the disadvantages of his upbringing, which are apparently being both the son of his father's mistress and being born male. The latter does raise an eyebrow from me, because I can't think of any otome games that I've played that have that sort of world set up; naturally this doesn't mean that they don't exist, but it's the kind of detail that makes me wonder if the writer(s) have a whole lot of familiarity with otome games in the first place.    The show feels most concerned with the apparently bizarre nature of the game world he's been reincarnated into, which has elements of both fantasy and science fiction, but that's another mild red flag, because those two genres absolutely coexist in the otome games Steam Prison and Code:Realize.    Even if that wasn't the case, however, there's negligible time spent discovering what exactly Leon is after in going to the fancy academy from the game. Perhaps he does want to marry well, but the loot that he brings back from his foray to steal the game's goodies before the plot of the game begins would seem to negate that need, and he also doesn't seem interested in making a play for the heroine. In fact, he actively dislikes the characters from the game, as we see in his playthrough before he falls down the stairs and dies, which may be the single most original moment here because he's not being creamed by everyone's favorite motor vehicle. Watching Leon play the game is probably the most entertaining piece of the entire episode as he gets increasingly frustrated with its mechanics and characters, but even that is marred by the fact that he's doing it for his sister so that she doesn't have to. Does YouTube not exist in their world? Because last I checked, that was a good way to get to watch the cutscenes from video games without having to play them yourself.    The plot doesn't have a terrible concept, and goodness knows that isekai (otome game or otherwise) is ripe for parody and deconstruction at this stage. But as with The Executioner and Her Way of Life, I don't find this the most compelling telling of this particular story. Plus I'm very concerned that the story's “women have all the power” set up is going to be used as a way for the hero to frame himself as a perpetual victim, and I'm not a fan of that for any gender. This just is kind of a muddle, and that's a shame.

Office worker Leon is reincarnated into a particularly punishing dating sim video game, where women reign supreme and only beautiful men have a seat at the table. But Leon has a secret weapon: he remembers everything from his past life, which includes a complete playthrough of the very game in which he is now trapped. Watch Leon spark a revolution to change this new world in order to fulfill his ultimate desire of living a quiet, easy life in the countryside.    Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs is based on Yomu Mishima's light novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Sundays.      How was the first episode?   Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               This seems to be the season for me to be making statements like this, but I liked this story (tale type?) more when it was Past Life Countess, Present Life Otome Game NPC?!. Both series have a similar premise: someone is reincarnated in the world of an otome game as a random background character and have to do their best to get the kind of life they want. In the case of this show (based on the light novels of the same name), Leon seems to mostly want to overcome the disadvantages of his upbringing, which are apparently being both the son of his father's mistress and being born male. The latter does raise an eyebrow from me, because I can't think of any otome games that I've played that have that sort of world set up; naturally this doesn't mean that they don't exist, but it's the kind of detail that makes me wonder if the writer(s) have a whole lot of familiarity with otome games in the first place.    The show feels most concerned with the apparently bizarre nature of the game world he's been reincarnated into, which has elements of both fantasy and science fiction, but that's another mild red flag, because those two genres absolutely coexist in the otome games Steam Prison and Code:Realize.    Even if that wasn't the case, however, there's negligible time spent discovering what exactly Leon is after in going to the fancy academy from the game. Perhaps he does want to marry well, but the loot that he brings back from his foray to steal the game's goodies before the plot of the game begins would seem to negate that need, and he also doesn't seem interested in making a play for the heroine. In fact, he actively dislikes the characters from the game, as we see in his playthrough before he falls down the stairs and dies, which may be the single most original moment here because he's not being creamed by everyone's favorite motor vehicle. Watching Leon play the game is probably the most entertaining piece of the entire episode as he gets increasingly frustrated with its mechanics and characters, but even that is marred by the fact that he's doing it for his sister so that she doesn't have to. Does YouTube not exist in their world? Because last I checked, that was a good way to get to watch the cutscenes from video games without having to play them yourself.    The plot doesn't have a terrible concept, and goodness knows that isekai (otome game or otherwise) is ripe for parody and deconstruction at this stage. But as with The Executioner and Her Way of Life, I don't find this the most compelling telling of this particular story. Plus I'm very concerned that the story's “women have all the power” set up is going to be used as a way for the hero to frame himself as a perpetual victim, and I'm not a fan of that for any gender. This just is kind of a muddle, and that's a shame.        James Beckett  Rating:               I've come to learn that, of all the variations of the modern isekai anime that have cropped up over the years, I tend to prefer the ones where characters get trapped in dating sims and the like. The generic MMORPG worlds that so many of the other isekai trade in bore me to tears, and the stories tend to lack focus and direction on account of the open-ended natures of the video games that the stories are riffing on. When a gal or guy gets reincarnated into a dating sim, though, we have a set cast of characters and plot with more momentum right off the bat, and the characters' knowledge of the game has to be a little more specific than simply having memorized a thousand menus and sub-systems. Granted, the point of cribbing from the tropes of popular dating sims still lies in the fact that the isekai stories are treading familiar ground, but if we must operate entirely within the bumper-lanes of old clichés, I'll settle for the somewhat more entertaining clichés.    For those reasons, I ended up having an okay time with Trapped in a Dating Sim, even if it never left me feeling particularly excited or intrigued. A lot of my reservations come from the episode being such an exposition dump; we don't even meet the other central characters of the dating game that Leon has found himself stuck in until the very final shots of the premiere. Until then, it's the Leon the Loner show from top to bottom. He's not an awful protagonist, but he's nothing new to the genre, either. He's prickly and socially awkward, but he also can't be too much of an asshole, since we still have to be impressed with how much he breaks the game using his Earthbound knowledge of its systems and plot. This means that the story of this premiere is essentially a linear chronicle of how Leon inserts himself into the main plot of the game, with most scenes consisting of Leon monologuing in explicit detail what he knows about the game, how he's going to manipulate it, etc. This is the kind of stuff I almost never find interesting, because it assumes that the joy of the isekai premise comes from having the protagonist narrate the condensed Wiki-entry version of a video game, and not, you know, letting us just watch the story happen in peace.    Still, the setting itself has some cool stuff going for it, namely in how it mixes the elements of its typical fantasy setting with mechs and other sci-fi trappings—always a nice touch. It could also very well be that the story picks up speed once Leon arrives at the academy where the game truly takes place and starts to mingle with all of the characters; it's hard to judge how strong a dating-game style story is going to be when you don't even know most of the ensemble yet. I might stick with Trapped in a Dating Sim for another episode or two, just to see if it ends up winning me over. I doubt it will be as fun as My Next Life as a Villainess, but who knows? Stranger things have happened!        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               We haven't really seen it reflected in anime yet, but in LN and manga scenes, the isekai subgenre is absolutely rife with Otome Game Villainess stories. You can throw a rock in any direction and are just as liable to hit a book about being reincarnated as the mean girl character in a video game as anything else. So it makes sense with that particular gimmick's proliferation that you'd start seeing stories intentionally twisting it for novelty. Thus we have this show, which attempts to pull the perspective away from the stereotypical nobles and upper class, and instead focus on what it's like to be an anonymous background character in one of these stories. Or, well, it sort of tries that, then gets bored immediately with that premise and more or less turns into a typical male-led isekai in the span of half an episode. Whoops.    The biggest weakness for this show is it just doesn't feel like its creators knew all that much about otome games. Stories like My Next Life as a Villainess or I'm in Love with the Villainess use their familiarity with the subgenre to gently (and sometimes harshly) mock the established conventions of them, but you get the impression those are jokes borne from somebody who deeply enjoys that type of media and spends a lot of time thinking about them. This show, on the other hand, doesn't seem to know much about the genre besides there being a female PC and a lot of hot dudes for her to sweet talk. Everything else is crammed in from other facets of gaming – RTS battles, power armor, sci-fi style airships, micro-transactions, all stuff that shows up in other games that has to be ham-fistedly crammed in here because that's what the creators are more familiar with.    I say all this not to call the creators phonies, but because that muddling of its own premise kind of kills the joke. This isn't a parody of otome games or a critical look at the genre from a new point of view, so none of its observations or gags have any teeth. Wow show, you're right, there sure are a lot of haughty pretty boys in games made for women. You really got them there. And yeah, some games aren't balanced very well so you're forced to spend real money on them. Can't remember ever playing an otome game where that was the case but uh, good dunk on...mobile games? What are we parodying here, again?    This even comes down to our protagonist, who spends three full days 100%ing the central game – not because he is a guy who likes otome games, but because his pushy little sister blackmailed him into playing it for her. Because she wants to see the ending CGs but doesn't actually want to play the game to get it, and apparently can't use Google to just look them up? It's a clunky, contrived way to allow a guy who hates otome games to still have all the knowledge necessary to cheat the system and get ahead in life, making him fundamentally identical to a regular isekai hero. So we've taken three lefts to make a right and arrive at a plain wayne isekai story, only now our male lead will have to build a harem of doting anime girls by showing up those handsome gigachads who make up the typical love interests.    Then there's the frankly flaccid attempts at role reversal with the game world's gender politics. See, in this game, it's women who hold all the power! So now MEN are the ones forced into loveless political marriages where they serve older, richer WOMEN who all have disposable male paramours. See, it's clever, because they did CTRL+F for the word “patriarchy” and then replaced the P with an M. My first impression upon seeing that part of the premise was that this would be a cringe-inducing setup for a victim complex to further fuel the main character's resentful snark, but I've read enough of the manga adaptation to know that's largely not the case. But that doesn't stop it from feeling like a lazy way to build a paper-thin world, which isn't a whole lot better.    Combined with stiff, sub-par animation and pacing that leaps from moment to moment with a bald-faced desperation, this one winds up a total mess. It's at once overstuffed and totally lacking in ideas, and has the gall to have its own protagonist complain about how much its world and story suck like it's somebody else's fault. It's just a flop all around.        Caitlin Moore  Rating:               There's a particular type of guy out there who is seethingly angry at the idea of things that exist to play into women's fantasies. He doesn't take issue with media aimed at delivering male fantasies, oh no, but the very concept of media where the central aim is allowing women to indulge in the fantasy of being desirable to a range of hot men? Oh no, that cannot stand! Such things are truly detestable, and any girl who likes them is a shallow bitch.    I can't say that's for sure the case with whoever wrote Trapped in a Dating Sim, but it sure does come across that way. The protagonist, now known as Leon, beefed it on the staircase after his little sister blackmailed him into playing an otome game for three days straight while she went on Hawaii because… she wanted to hear the end conversation? Why not just go look it up? Why would she even care about it decontextualized from the rest of the game? (Or maybe that's just me.) What is this terrible secret she's holding over his head? Our little pre-Leon seems baffled that the game would have JRPG/science fiction/strategy elements, but considering my favorite genre of game is “visual novel with gameplay elements,” it doesn't seem remotely shocking. And why would it make him actively angry?    Then there's the issue of the matriarchal society. Why would that even be a thing in a dating sim? It's such a bizarre detail that has existed in absolutely none of the games I've played. That's the part that made me really get the feeling that whoever created this nonsense has never actually played an otome game, but is super angry that they exist. Pre-Leon grouses that the girls in the game are way too powerful, which shows up in the game world as women subjecting men to the exact same social oppression that women in the real world have been suffering under for centuries. Now, if it seemed like it had any actual intention of examining how things like economics arranged marriages between girls and much older men, that would be one thing, but it just leaves it as one of the reasons being in this world sucks for average men.    I hate being able to see the seams of constructed worlds, where you can see the structures designed specifically for the main character to chafe at and systems designed specifically to screw them over individually. And honestly, most of the episode's plot, with him going off on a little sidequest to get his DLC super-powerful fighter plane and enough money to sidestep his arranged marriage, felt like little more than a digression. The next one, where he starts attending the academy, will probably feel entirely different.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               As someone who loves games—including JRPGs and dating sims—I greatly enjoyed this first episode. Over the years we've had numerous anime about being reincarnated in good games. The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is the opposite: what it would be like to be trapped in a terrible one.    Let's break down the game we see in this anime. To start with, it suffers from the shotgun approach to game design. Alto Liebe may be a dating sim first and foremost, but it also features both turn-based dungeon crawling and strategy RPG mecha battles. Worse yet, the difficulty for these parts of the game is ridiculously unbalanced. The game is literally designed around its cash shop—forcing players to dump even more real-world money into the game if they want to be able to beat it.    The actual story for the game makes things even worse. When the game was just a game, things didn't really need to make sense. You could have fantasy magic, sci-fi mecha, and a feudal society together in the same story. You could even have an ending where the player character ends up with a harmonious harem made up of the kingdom's finest young men. The problem is that when this becomes a fully-realized world, everything becomes taken to their logical extremes.    This is the world our “hero” (and I use that term loosely) Leon finds himself in. The pay-to-win aspect of the game means that not only are the enemies in the world so strong that he almost dies on his first adventure (despite exploiting the enemies' weaknesses) but also that society is obsessed with money. But far worse is that, to contrive a happy reverse harem ending, the world suffers from a ludicrous level of ingrained misandry—with human men relegated to the status of third-class citizens. Leon himself is set to be married off to a 50-year-old black widow who will send him to the front lines to die for a quick insurance payout.    The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is a joke—and that's the point. It's cliché and underwritten to the extreme. It's a hell to live in. Because of this, we can get behind Leon and his rather assholish nature. His drive to be as far away from the main plot as possible is understandable—at least in the background he might find something resembling normalcy. Of course, it almost certainly won't be that simple and I look forward to watching Leon bust through numerous dating sim and RPG game tropes as the weeks go on.     discuss this in the forum (112 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives      ",positive,en,{}

Community score: 3.6              What is this?   Office worker Leon is reincarnated into a particularly punishing dating sim video game, where women reign supreme and only beautiful men have a seat at the table. But Leon has a secret weapon: he remembers everything from his past life, which includes a complete playthrough of the very game in which he is now trapped. Watch Leon spark a revolution to change this new world in order to fulfill his ultimate desire of living a quiet, easy life in the countryside.    Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs is based on Yomu Mishima's light novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Sundays.      How was the first episode?   Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               This seems to be the season for me to be making statements like this, but I liked this story (tale type?) more when it was Past Life Countess, Present Life Otome Game NPC?!. Both series have a similar premise: someone is reincarnated in the world of an otome game as a random background character and have to do their best to get the kind of life they want. In the case of this show (based on the light novels of the same name), Leon seems to mostly want to overcome the disadvantages of his upbringing, which are apparently being both the son of his father's mistress and being born male. The latter does raise an eyebrow from me, because I can't think of any otome games that I've played that have that sort of world set up; naturally this doesn't mean that they don't exist, but it's the kind of detail that makes me wonder if the writer(s) have a whole lot of familiarity with otome games in the first place.    The show feels most concerned with the apparently bizarre nature of the game world he's been reincarnated into, which has elements of both fantasy and science fiction, but that's another mild red flag, because those two genres absolutely coexist in the otome games Steam Prison and Code:Realize.    Even if that wasn't the case, however, there's negligible time spent discovering what exactly Leon is after in going to the fancy academy from the game. Perhaps he does want to marry well, but the loot that he brings back from his foray to steal the game's goodies before the plot of the game begins would seem to negate that need, and he also doesn't seem interested in making a play for the heroine. In fact, he actively dislikes the characters from the game, as we see in his playthrough before he falls down the stairs and dies, which may be the single most original moment here because he's not being creamed by everyone's favorite motor vehicle. Watching Leon play the game is probably the most entertaining piece of the entire episode as he gets increasingly frustrated with its mechanics and characters, but even that is marred by the fact that he's doing it for his sister so that she doesn't have to. Does YouTube not exist in their world? Because last I checked, that was a good way to get to watch the cutscenes from video games without having to play them yourself.    The plot doesn't have a terrible concept, and goodness knows that isekai (otome game or otherwise) is ripe for parody and deconstruction at this stage. But as with The Executioner and Her Way of Life, I don't find this the most compelling telling of this particular story. Plus I'm very concerned that the story's “women have all the power” set up is going to be used as a way for the hero to frame himself as a perpetual victim, and I'm not a fan of that for any gender. This just is kind of a muddle, and that's a shame.        James Beckett  Rating:               I've come to learn that, of all the variations of the modern isekai anime that have cropped up over the years, I tend to prefer the ones where characters get trapped in dating sims and the like. The generic MMORPG worlds that so many of the other isekai trade in bore me to tears, and the stories tend to lack focus and direction on account of the open-ended natures of the video games that the stories are riffing on. When a gal or guy gets reincarnated into a dating sim, though, we have a set cast of characters and plot with more momentum right off the bat, and the characters' knowledge of the game has to be a little more specific than simply having memorized a thousand menus and sub-systems. Granted, the point of cribbing from the tropes of popular dating sims still lies in the fact that the isekai stories are treading familiar ground, but if we must operate entirely within the bumper-lanes of old clichés, I'll settle for the somewhat more entertaining clichés.    For those reasons, I ended up having an okay time with Trapped in a Dating Sim, even if it never left me feeling particularly excited or intrigued. A lot of my reservations come from the episode being such an exposition dump; we don't even meet the other central characters of the dating game that Leon has found himself stuck in until the very final shots of the premiere. Until then, it's the Leon the Loner show from top to bottom. He's not an awful protagonist, but he's nothing new to the genre, either. He's prickly and socially awkward, but he also can't be too much of an asshole, since we still have to be impressed with how much he breaks the game using his Earthbound knowledge of its systems and plot. This means that the story of this premiere is essentially a linear chronicle of how Leon inserts himself into the main plot of the game, with most scenes consisting of Leon monologuing in explicit detail what he knows about the game, how he's going to manipulate it, etc. This is the kind of stuff I almost never find interesting, because it assumes that the joy of the isekai premise comes from having the protagonist narrate the condensed Wiki-entry version of a video game, and not, you know, letting us just watch the story happen in peace.    Still, the setting itself has some cool stuff going for it, namely in how it mixes the elements of its typical fantasy setting with mechs and other sci-fi trappings—always a nice touch. It could also very well be that the story picks up speed once Leon arrives at the academy where the game truly takes place and starts to mingle with all of the characters; it's hard to judge how strong a dating-game style story is going to be when you don't even know most of the ensemble yet. I might stick with Trapped in a Dating Sim for another episode or two, just to see if it ends up winning me over. I doubt it will be as fun as My Next Life as a Villainess, but who knows? Stranger things have happened!        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               We haven't really seen it reflected in anime yet, but in LN and manga scenes, the isekai subgenre is absolutely rife with Otome Game Villainess stories. You can throw a rock in any direction and are just as liable to hit a book about being reincarnated as the mean girl character in a video game as anything else. So it makes sense with that particular gimmick's proliferation that you'd start seeing stories intentionally twisting it for novelty. Thus we have this show, which attempts to pull the perspective away from the stereotypical nobles and upper class, and instead focus on what it's like to be an anonymous background character in one of these stories. Or, well, it sort of tries that, then gets bored immediately with that premise and more or less turns into a typical male-led isekai in the span of half an episode. Whoops.    The biggest weakness for this show is it just doesn't feel like its creators knew all that much about otome games. Stories like My Next Life as a Villainess or I'm in Love with the Villainess use their familiarity with the subgenre to gently (and sometimes harshly) mock the established conventions of them, but you get the impression those are jokes borne from somebody who deeply enjoys that type of media and spends a lot of time thinking about them. This show, on the other hand, doesn't seem to know much about the genre besides there being a female PC and a lot of hot dudes for her to sweet talk. Everything else is crammed in from other facets of gaming – RTS battles, power armor, sci-fi style airships, micro-transactions, all stuff that shows up in other games that has to be ham-fistedly crammed in here because that's what the creators are more familiar with.    I say all this not to call the creators phonies, but because that muddling of its own premise kind of kills the joke. This isn't a parody of otome games or a critical look at the genre from a new point of view, so none of its observations or gags have any teeth. Wow show, you're right, there sure are a lot of haughty pretty boys in games made for women. You really got them there. And yeah, some games aren't balanced very well so you're forced to spend real money on them. Can't remember ever playing an otome game where that was the case but uh, good dunk on...mobile games? What are we parodying here, again?    This even comes down to our protagonist, who spends three full days 100%ing the central game – not because he is a guy who likes otome games, but because his pushy little sister blackmailed him into playing it for her. Because she wants to see the ending CGs but doesn't actually want to play the game to get it, and apparently can't use Google to just look them up? It's a clunky, contrived way to allow a guy who hates otome games to still have all the knowledge necessary to cheat the system and get ahead in life, making him fundamentally identical to a regular isekai hero. So we've taken three lefts to make a right and arrive at a plain wayne isekai story, only now our male lead will have to build a harem of doting anime girls by showing up those handsome gigachads who make up the typical love interests.    Then there's the frankly flaccid attempts at role reversal with the game world's gender politics. See, in this game, it's women who hold all the power! So now MEN are the ones forced into loveless political marriages where they serve older, richer WOMEN who all have disposable male paramours. See, it's clever, because they did CTRL+F for the word “patriarchy” and then replaced the P with an M. My first impression upon seeing that part of the premise was that this would be a cringe-inducing setup for a victim complex to further fuel the main character's resentful snark, but I've read enough of the manga adaptation to know that's largely not the case. But that doesn't stop it from feeling like a lazy way to build a paper-thin world, which isn't a whole lot better.    Combined with stiff, sub-par animation and pacing that leaps from moment to moment with a bald-faced desperation, this one winds up a total mess. It's at once overstuffed and totally lacking in ideas, and has the gall to have its own protagonist complain about how much its world and story suck like it's somebody else's fault. It's just a flop all around.        Caitlin Moore  Rating:               There's a particular type of guy out there who is seethingly angry at the idea of things that exist to play into women's fantasies. He doesn't take issue with media aimed at delivering male fantasies, oh no, but the very concept of media where the central aim is allowing women to indulge in the fantasy of being desirable to a range of hot men? Oh no, that cannot stand! Such things are truly detestable, and any girl who likes them is a shallow bitch.    I can't say that's for sure the case with whoever wrote Trapped in a Dating Sim, but it sure does come across that way. The protagonist, now known as Leon, beefed it on the staircase after his little sister blackmailed him into playing an otome game for three days straight while she went on Hawaii because… she wanted to hear the end conversation? Why not just go look it up? Why would she even care about it decontextualized from the rest of the game? (Or maybe that's just me.) What is this terrible secret she's holding over his head? Our little pre-Leon seems baffled that the game would have JRPG/science fiction/strategy elements, but considering my favorite genre of game is “visual novel with gameplay elements,” it doesn't seem remotely shocking. And why would it make him actively angry?    Then there's the issue of the matriarchal society. Why would that even be a thing in a dating sim? It's such a bizarre detail that has existed in absolutely none of the games I've played. That's the part that made me really get the feeling that whoever created this nonsense has never actually played an otome game, but is super angry that they exist. Pre-Leon grouses that the girls in the game are way too powerful, which shows up in the game world as women subjecting men to the exact same social oppression that women in the real world have been suffering under for centuries. Now, if it seemed like it had any actual intention of examining how things like economics arranged marriages between girls and much older men, that would be one thing, but it just leaves it as one of the reasons being in this world sucks for average men.    I hate being able to see the seams of constructed worlds, where you can see the structures designed specifically for the main character to chafe at and systems designed specifically to screw them over individually. And honestly, most of the episode's plot, with him going off on a little sidequest to get his DLC super-powerful fighter plane and enough money to sidestep his arranged marriage, felt like little more than a digression. The next one, where he starts attending the academy, will probably feel entirely different.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               As someone who loves games—including JRPGs and dating sims—I greatly enjoyed this first episode. Over the years we've had numerous anime about being reincarnated in good games. The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is the opposite: what it would be like to be trapped in a terrible one.    Let's break down the game we see in this anime. To start with, it suffers from the shotgun approach to game design. Alto Liebe may be a dating sim first and foremost, but it also features both turn-based dungeon crawling and strategy RPG mecha battles. Worse yet, the difficulty for these parts of the game is ridiculously unbalanced. The game is literally designed around its cash shop—forcing players to dump even more real-world money into the game if they want to be able to beat it.    The actual story for the game makes things even worse. When the game was just a game, things didn't really need to make sense. You could have fantasy magic, sci-fi mecha, and a feudal society together in the same story. You could even have an ending where the player character ends up with a harmonious harem made up of the kingdom's finest young men. The problem is that when this becomes a fully-realized world, everything becomes taken to their logical extremes.    This is the world our “hero” (and I use that term loosely) Leon finds himself in. The pay-to-win aspect of the game means that not only are the enemies in the world so strong that he almost dies on his first adventure (despite exploiting the enemies' weaknesses) but also that society is obsessed with money. But far worse is that, to contrive a happy reverse harem ending, the world suffers from a ludicrous level of ingrained misandry—with human men relegated to the status of third-class citizens. Leon himself is set to be married off to a 50-year-old black widow who will send him to the front lines to die for a quick insurance payout.    The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is a joke—and that's the point. It's cliché and underwritten to the extreme. It's a hell to live in. Because of this, we can get behind Leon and his rather assholish nature. His drive to be as far away from the main plot as possible is understandable—at least in the background he might find something resembling normalcy. Of course, it almost certainly won't be that simple and I look forward to watching Leon bust through numerous dating sim and RPG game tropes as the weeks go on.     discuss this in the forum (112 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives    ",positive,en,{}

The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is a joke—and that's the point. It's cliché and underwritten to the extreme. It's a hell to live in. Because of this, we can get behind Leon and his rather assholish nature. His drive to be as far away from the main plot as possible is understandable—at least in the background he might find something resembling normalcy. Of course, it almost certainly won't be that simple and I look forward to watching Leon bust through numerous dating sim and RPG game tropes as the weeks go on.     discuss this in the forum (112 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives   ",positive,en,{}

Community score: 3.6              What is this?   Office worker Leon is reincarnated into a particularly punishing dating sim video game, where women reign supreme and only beautiful men have a seat at the table. But Leon has a secret weapon: he remembers everything from his past life, which includes a complete playthrough of the very game in which he is now trapped. Watch Leon spark a revolution to change this new world in order to fulfill his ultimate desire of living a quiet, easy life in the countryside.    Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs is based on Yomu Mishima's light novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Sundays.      How was the first episode?   Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               This seems to be the season for me to be making statements like this, but I liked this story (tale type?) more when it was Past Life Countess, Present Life Otome Game NPC?!. Both series have a similar premise: someone is reincarnated in the world of an otome game as a random background character and have to do their best to get the kind of life they want. In the case of this show (based on the light novels of the same name), Leon seems to mostly want to overcome the disadvantages of his upbringing, which are apparently being both the son of his father's mistress and being born male. The latter does raise an eyebrow from me, because I can't think of any otome games that I've played that have that sort of world set up; naturally this doesn't mean that they don't exist, but it's the kind of detail that makes me wonder if the writer(s) have a whole lot of familiarity with otome games in the first place.    The show feels most concerned with the apparently bizarre nature of the game world he's been reincarnated into, which has elements of both fantasy and science fiction, but that's another mild red flag, because those two genres absolutely coexist in the otome games Steam Prison and Code:Realize.    Even if that wasn't the case, however, there's negligible time spent discovering what exactly Leon is after in going to the fancy academy from the game. Perhaps he does want to marry well, but the loot that he brings back from his foray to steal the game's goodies before the plot of the game begins would seem to negate that need, and he also doesn't seem interested in making a play for the heroine. In fact, he actively dislikes the characters from the game, as we see in his playthrough before he falls down the stairs and dies, which may be the single most original moment here because he's not being creamed by everyone's favorite motor vehicle. Watching Leon play the game is probably the most entertaining piece of the entire episode as he gets increasingly frustrated with its mechanics and characters, but even that is marred by the fact that he's doing it for his sister so that she doesn't have to. Does YouTube not exist in their world? Because last I checked, that was a good way to get to watch the cutscenes from video games without having to play them yourself.    The plot doesn't have a terrible concept, and goodness knows that isekai (otome game or otherwise) is ripe for parody and deconstruction at this stage. But as with The Executioner and Her Way of Life, I don't find this the most compelling telling of this particular story. Plus I'm very concerned that the story's “women have all the power” set up is going to be used as a way for the hero to frame himself as a perpetual victim, and I'm not a fan of that for any gender. This just is kind of a muddle, and that's a shame.        James Beckett  Rating:               I've come to learn that, of all the variations of the modern isekai anime that have cropped up over the years, I tend to prefer the ones where characters get trapped in dating sims and the like. The generic MMORPG worlds that so many of the other isekai trade in bore me to tears, and the stories tend to lack focus and direction on account of the open-ended natures of the video games that the stories are riffing on. When a gal or guy gets reincarnated into a dating sim, though, we have a set cast of characters and plot with more momentum right off the bat, and the characters' knowledge of the game has to be a little more specific than simply having memorized a thousand menus and sub-systems. Granted, the point of cribbing from the tropes of popular dating sims still lies in the fact that the isekai stories are treading familiar ground, but if we must operate entirely within the bumper-lanes of old clichés, I'll settle for the somewhat more entertaining clichés.    For those reasons, I ended up having an okay time with Trapped in a Dating Sim, even if it never left me feeling particularly excited or intrigued. A lot of my reservations come from the episode being such an exposition dump; we don't even meet the other central characters of the dating game that Leon has found himself stuck in until the very final shots of the premiere. Until then, it's the Leon the Loner show from top to bottom. He's not an awful protagonist, but he's nothing new to the genre, either. He's prickly and socially awkward, but he also can't be too much of an asshole, since we still have to be impressed with how much he breaks the game using his Earthbound knowledge of its systems and plot. This means that the story of this premiere is essentially a linear chronicle of how Leon inserts himself into the main plot of the game, with most scenes consisting of Leon monologuing in explicit detail what he knows about the game, how he's going to manipulate it, etc. This is the kind of stuff I almost never find interesting, because it assumes that the joy of the isekai premise comes from having the protagonist narrate the condensed Wiki-entry version of a video game, and not, you know, letting us just watch the story happen in peace.    Still, the setting itself has some cool stuff going for it, namely in how it mixes the elements of its typical fantasy setting with mechs and other sci-fi trappings—always a nice touch. It could also very well be that the story picks up speed once Leon arrives at the academy where the game truly takes place and starts to mingle with all of the characters; it's hard to judge how strong a dating-game style story is going to be when you don't even know most of the ensemble yet. I might stick with Trapped in a Dating Sim for another episode or two, just to see if it ends up winning me over. I doubt it will be as fun as My Next Life as a Villainess, but who knows? Stranger things have happened!        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               We haven't really seen it reflected in anime yet, but in LN and manga scenes, the isekai subgenre is absolutely rife with Otome Game Villainess stories. You can throw a rock in any direction and are just as liable to hit a book about being reincarnated as the mean girl character in a video game as anything else. So it makes sense with that particular gimmick's proliferation that you'd start seeing stories intentionally twisting it for novelty. Thus we have this show, which attempts to pull the perspective away from the stereotypical nobles and upper class, and instead focus on what it's like to be an anonymous background character in one of these stories. Or, well, it sort of tries that, then gets bored immediately with that premise and more or less turns into a typical male-led isekai in the span of half an episode. Whoops.    The biggest weakness for this show is it just doesn't feel like its creators knew all that much about otome games. Stories like My Next Life as a Villainess or I'm in Love with the Villainess use their familiarity with the subgenre to gently (and sometimes harshly) mock the established conventions of them, but you get the impression those are jokes borne from somebody who deeply enjoys that type of media and spends a lot of time thinking about them. This show, on the other hand, doesn't seem to know much about the genre besides there being a female PC and a lot of hot dudes for her to sweet talk. Everything else is crammed in from other facets of gaming – RTS battles, power armor, sci-fi style airships, micro-transactions, all stuff that shows up in other games that has to be ham-fistedly crammed in here because that's what the creators are more familiar with.    I say all this not to call the creators phonies, but because that muddling of its own premise kind of kills the joke. This isn't a parody of otome games or a critical look at the genre from a new point of view, so none of its observations or gags have any teeth. Wow show, you're right, there sure are a lot of haughty pretty boys in games made for women. You really got them there. And yeah, some games aren't balanced very well so you're forced to spend real money on them. Can't remember ever playing an otome game where that was the case but uh, good dunk on...mobile games? What are we parodying here, again?    This even comes down to our protagonist, who spends three full days 100%ing the central game – not because he is a guy who likes otome games, but because his pushy little sister blackmailed him into playing it for her. Because she wants to see the ending CGs but doesn't actually want to play the game to get it, and apparently can't use Google to just look them up? It's a clunky, contrived way to allow a guy who hates otome games to still have all the knowledge necessary to cheat the system and get ahead in life, making him fundamentally identical to a regular isekai hero. So we've taken three lefts to make a right and arrive at a plain wayne isekai story, only now our male lead will have to build a harem of doting anime girls by showing up those handsome gigachads who make up the typical love interests.    Then there's the frankly flaccid attempts at role reversal with the game world's gender politics. See, in this game, it's women who hold all the power! So now MEN are the ones forced into loveless political marriages where they serve older, richer WOMEN who all have disposable male paramours. See, it's clever, because they did CTRL+F for the word “patriarchy” and then replaced the P with an M. My first impression upon seeing that part of the premise was that this would be a cringe-inducing setup for a victim complex to further fuel the main character's resentful snark, but I've read enough of the manga adaptation to know that's largely not the case. But that doesn't stop it from feeling like a lazy way to build a paper-thin world, which isn't a whole lot better.    Combined with stiff, sub-par animation and pacing that leaps from moment to moment with a bald-faced desperation, this one winds up a total mess. It's at once overstuffed and totally lacking in ideas, and has the gall to have its own protagonist complain about how much its world and story suck like it's somebody else's fault. It's just a flop all around.        Caitlin Moore  Rating:               There's a particular type of guy out there who is seethingly angry at the idea of things that exist to play into women's fantasies. He doesn't take issue with media aimed at delivering male fantasies, oh no, but the very concept of media where the central aim is allowing women to indulge in the fantasy of being desirable to a range of hot men? Oh no, that cannot stand! Such things are truly detestable, and any girl who likes them is a shallow bitch.    I can't say that's for sure the case with whoever wrote Trapped in a Dating Sim, but it sure does come across that way. The protagonist, now known as Leon, beefed it on the staircase after his little sister blackmailed him into playing an otome game for three days straight while she went on Hawaii because… she wanted to hear the end conversation? Why not just go look it up? Why would she even care about it decontextualized from the rest of the game? (Or maybe that's just me.) What is this terrible secret she's holding over his head? Our little pre-Leon seems baffled that the game would have JRPG/science fiction/strategy elements, but considering my favorite genre of game is “visual novel with gameplay elements,” it doesn't seem remotely shocking. And why would it make him actively angry?    Then there's the issue of the matriarchal society. Why would that even be a thing in a dating sim? It's such a bizarre detail that has existed in absolutely none of the games I've played. That's the part that made me really get the feeling that whoever created this nonsense has never actually played an otome game, but is super angry that they exist. Pre-Leon grouses that the girls in the game are way too powerful, which shows up in the game world as women subjecting men to the exact same social oppression that women in the real world have been suffering under for centuries. Now, if it seemed like it had any actual intention of examining how things like economics arranged marriages between girls and much older men, that would be one thing, but it just leaves it as one of the reasons being in this world sucks for average men.    I hate being able to see the seams of constructed worlds, where you can see the structures designed specifically for the main character to chafe at and systems designed specifically to screw them over individually. And honestly, most of the episode's plot, with him going off on a little sidequest to get his DLC super-powerful fighter plane and enough money to sidestep his arranged marriage, felt like little more than a digression. The next one, where he starts attending the academy, will probably feel entirely different.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               As someone who loves games—including JRPGs and dating sims—I greatly enjoyed this first episode. Over the years we've had numerous anime about being reincarnated in good games. The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is the opposite: what it would be like to be trapped in a terrible one.    Let's break down the game we see in this anime. To start with, it suffers from the shotgun approach to game design. Alto Liebe may be a dating sim first and foremost, but it also features both turn-based dungeon crawling and strategy RPG mecha battles. Worse yet, the difficulty for these parts of the game is ridiculously unbalanced. The game is literally designed around its cash shop—forcing players to dump even more real-world money into the game if they want to be able to beat it.    The actual story for the game makes things even worse. When the game was just a game, things didn't really need to make sense. You could have fantasy magic, sci-fi mecha, and a feudal society together in the same story. You could even have an ending where the player character ends up with a harmonious harem made up of the kingdom's finest young men. The problem is that when this becomes a fully-realized world, everything becomes taken to their logical extremes.    This is the world our “hero” (and I use that term loosely) Leon finds himself in. The pay-to-win aspect of the game means that not only are the enemies in the world so strong that he almost dies on his first adventure (despite exploiting the enemies' weaknesses) but also that society is obsessed with money. But far worse is that, to contrive a happy reverse harem ending, the world suffers from a ludicrous level of ingrained misandry—with human men relegated to the status of third-class citizens. Leon himself is set to be married off to a 50-year-old black widow who will send him to the front lines to die for a quick insurance payout.    The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is a joke—and that's the point. It's cliché and underwritten to the extreme. It's a hell to live in. Because of this, we can get behind Leon and his rather assholish nature. His drive to be as far away from the main plot as possible is understandable—at least in the background he might find something resembling normalcy. Of course, it almost certainly won't be that simple and I look forward to watching Leon bust through numerous dating sim and RPG game tropes as the weeks go on.   ",positive,en,{}

Leon himself is set to be married off to a 50-year-old black widow who will send him to the front lines to die for a quick insurance payout.    The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is a joke—and that's the point. It's cliché and underwritten to the extreme. It's a hell to live in. Because of this, we can get behind Leon and his rather assholish nature. His drive to be as far away from the main plot as possible is understandable—at least in the background he might find something resembling normalcy. Of course, it almost certainly won't be that simple and I look forward to watching Leon bust through numerous dating sim and RPG game tropes as the weeks go on.  ",positive,en,{}

News Funimation's YouTube Channel Becomes 'Crunchyroll Dubs' Channel   posted on 2022-04-06 01:18 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         Channel will post dubbed 1st episode every Saturday    Crunchyroll announced on Tuesday that Funimation's YouTube channel has become the ""Crunchyroll Dubs"" channel. The channel will continue to stream anime clips, trailers, and full episodes of English-dubbed anime. The channel will also post a dubbed first episode every Saturday at 3:00 p.m. ET, starting with Re:ZERO -Starting Life in Another World- on April 9.    Crunchyroll streams English-subtitled trailers and content on its ""Crunchyroll Collections"" YouTube channel.    Funimation and Crunchyroll announced on March 1 that that Funimation and Wakanim's anime library and simulcast content have moved to Crunchyroll. Sony's Funimation Global Group completed its acquisition of Crunchyroll from AT&T on August 9 last year. The purchase price was US$1.175 billion, and the proceeds were paid in cash at closing.    Funimation's home video releases are also becoming listed under Crunchyroll.    Crunchyroll and Funimation first announced the acquisition in December 2020 with a purchase price of US$1.175 billion. The technology website The Information reported in August 2020 that AT&T offered Crunchyroll to Sony for US$1.5 billion and that Sony reportedly ""balked at"" the price, which effectively valued the streaming service at US$500 per subscriber. Entertainment news source Variety reported that AT&T was shopping the company to multiple potential buyers aside from Sony Pictures Entertainment at that time. Nikkei Asia later reported that October that Sony was in final negotiations for the Crunchyroll acquisition. At that time, the newspaper reported that Sony ""could end up spending more than 100 billion yen ($957 million).""

Slow Loop Episode 12  by Mercedez Clewis, Mar 30th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Slow Loop ?                     Community score: 4.5            It feels fitting that our final episode -episode 12, “Let's Pick Some Out Together”- is a celebration: namely, Koharu's birthday is coming, and it's up to Hiyori to figure out a gift. Only… she doesn't know what to get her: that is, until inspiration strikes, lending itself to one of Slow Loop's strongest episodes, which is a perfect way to send off one of Winter 2022's best shows.    The bulk of episode 12 is a blend of more fly fishing skills -in this case, learning how to tie a fly itself- as well as reminiscing. In fact, reminiscing is what inspires Hiyori's birthday gift to Koharu. Mind  you, the explanation on how to make flies is pretty cool: it's the most technical Slow Loop has ever gotten, and is genuinely engaging. I never thought I'd say it, but I rewatched the segment a few times just because it's so darn fascinating. It's knowledge I'll probably never use, but is knowledge I'm thankful to have nonetheless.    All of this brings up to the real star of this week's episode: Hiyori's gift to Koharu. Or rather, her flub of a gift because initially… Hiyori doesn't give Koharu a gift during the party. From Koharu's perspective, Hiyori gave Koi a gift, but not her, which leads to her getting a bit tsundere, which like… dang, I really love Koharu and her very relatable jealousy/want.    Thankfully, right as the ED rolls one last time (hard cut to me open-mouth sobbing in front of my computer), Hiyori presents Koharu with a photo album full of empty pages. Koharu chastizes her because like… it's an empty album. But in Slow Loop's naturally gentle way, this becomes a perfect way to hint at a new adventure: picking out pictures from the past few seasons together to fill the album with not just as sisters, but as friends.    Memories are a big part of Slow Loop's narratives: so much of Hiyori's characterization is centered on her memories of her late father, as is Koharu's characterization as well. Memories are this show's bread and butter, but in episode 12, rather than moving through them, we see Hiyori and Koharu forge a beautiful new memory together. It's solid proof that these sisters genuinely have become as much a family as if born by blood, and perhaps because they aren't, their forged bond is all the more beautiful.    There's a lot I haven't talked about in this finale: there's a pretty engaging one-fly competition in the middle of the episode that features prizes ranging from a waterproof backpack to an unreasonably cute merfish plush that Hiyori gets VERY fired up about. It's cute, and is definitely the vehicle to the resolution of the episode, but really… that photo album had me in a grip! It's the perfect way to close out our time with Slow Loop, and just feels so fitting for a series about care and community.    Slow Loop has been a lot of things: a study in grief, a laid back series that blends Super Cub and Laid-Back Camp and a bit of Let's Make a Mug Too's character vibes into a genuinely enjoyable series about cute girls being cute and passionate and best of all, friends. Much like Spring 2021's Super Cub, Slow Loop is a show that's going to live rent-free in my head the rest of 2022 as a reminder that slow and steady are the best ways to approach life, as is earnestly and wholeheartedly loving what you love. Whether that's music, pottery, or in the case of Slow Loop, fly fishing, there's no shame in being who you are: in fact, there's a wonderful world awaiting us all when we kick back and really sink into what we love.

Slow Loop Episode 12  by Mercedez Clewis, Mar 30th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Slow Loop ?                     Community score: 4.5            It feels fitting that our final episode -episode 12, “Let's Pick Some Out Together”- is a celebration: namely, Koharu's birthday is coming, and it's up to Hiyori to figure out a gift. Only… she doesn't know what to get her: that is, until inspiration strikes, lending itself to one of Slow Loop's strongest episodes, which is a perfect way to send off one of Winter 2022's best shows.    The bulk of episode 12 is a blend of more fly fishing skills -in this case, learning how to tie a fly itself- as well as reminiscing. In fact, reminiscing is what inspires Hiyori's birthday gift to Koharu. Mind  you, the explanation on how to make flies is pretty cool: it's the most technical Slow Loop has ever gotten, and is genuinely engaging. I never thought I'd say it, but I rewatched the segment a few times just because it's so darn fascinating. It's knowledge I'll probably never use, but is knowledge I'm thankful to have nonetheless.    All of this brings up to the real star of this week's episode: Hiyori's gift to Koharu. Or rather, her flub of a gift because initially… Hiyori doesn't give Koharu a gift during the party. From Koharu's perspective, Hiyori gave Koi a gift, but not her, which leads to her getting a bit tsundere, which like… dang, I really love Koharu and her very relatable jealousy/want.    Thankfully, right as the ED rolls one last time (hard cut to me open-mouth sobbing in front of my computer), Hiyori presents Koharu with a photo album full of empty pages. Koharu chastizes her because like… it's an empty album. But in Slow Loop's naturally gentle way, this becomes a perfect way to hint at a new adventure: picking out pictures from the past few seasons together to fill the album with not just as sisters, but as friends.    Memories are a big part of Slow Loop's narratives: so much of Hiyori's characterization is centered on her memories of her late father, as is Koharu's characterization as well. Memories are this show's bread and butter, but in episode 12, rather than moving through them, we see Hiyori and Koharu forge a beautiful new memory together. It's solid proof that these sisters genuinely have become as much a family as if born by blood, and perhaps because they aren't, their forged bond is all the more beautiful.    There's a lot I haven't talked about in this finale: there's a pretty engaging one-fly competition in the middle of the episode that features prizes ranging from a waterproof backpack to an unreasonably cute merfish plush that Hiyori gets VERY fired up about. It's cute, and is definitely the vehicle to the resolution of the episode, but really… that photo album had me in a grip! It's the perfect way to close out our time with Slow Loop, and just feels so fitting for a series about care and community.    Slow Loop has been a lot of things: a study in grief, a laid back series that blends Super Cub and Laid-Back Camp and a bit of Let's Make a Mug Too's character vibes into a genuinely enjoyable series about cute girls being cute and passionate and best of all, friends. Much like Spring 2021's Super Cub, Slow Loop is a show that's going to live rent-free in my head the rest of 2022 as a reminder that slow and steady are the best ways to approach life, as is earnestly and wholeheartedly loving what you love. Whether that's music, pottery, or in the case of Slow Loop, fly fishing, there's no shame in being who you are: in fact, there's a wonderful world awaiting us all when we kick back and really sink into what we love.

The game will launch for PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam in fall 2022.      The game will have an original story supervised by Akihito Tsukushi and will be available in both English and Japanese (with  fully voiced event scenes). Numskull Games is publishing the physical version in Europe.    Spike Chunsoft describes the story:  The story begins with Riko and Reg's meeting in the first episode of season one. This marks the start of their great adventure, and together they travel to Seeker Camp in the second layer of the Abyss. Experience the awesome power of the Curse of the Abyss, as well as the astonishing, legendary entities known as primeval creatures. Prepare to glimpse the world of Riko and her friends.  The game will also feature a ""story mode"" that follows the storyline of the anime adaptation of Akihito Tsukushi's manga. The physical version of the game will also be available in a Collector's Edition that will include merchandise from the franchise.    Akihito Tsukushi launched the manga on Takeshobo's Web Comic Gamma website in 2012. Takeshobo published the 10th compiled book volume in July 2021. Seven Seas published the ninth volume in English in March 2020 and will ship the 10th volume on May 3.    The second season of the television anime will premiere in July.    The first 13-episode television anime series based on the manga premiered in Japan in July 2017.  The English-subtitled version of the show streamed in the United States on Amazon's Anime Strike service, and HIDIVE streamed the series outside of the United States.     The first compilation film for the anime, Made in Abyss: Journey's Dawn (Made in Abyss: Tabidachi no Yoake), opened in Japan in January 2019, followed by the second film, Made in Abyss: Wandering Twilight (Made in Abyss: Hōrō Suru Tasogare), two weeks later.

Sentai Filmworks again screened the film virtually in September 2020, and HIDIVE will begin streaming the film on June 28.    Sony's Columbia Pictures has ordered a feature film script of the manga from writer and director Kevin McMullin.

News Made in Abyss 3D Action RPG Launches in English This Fall   posted on 2022-04-05 23:21 UTC-8 by Adriana Hazra          Made in Abyss: Binary Star Falling into Darkness launches for PS4, Switch, Steam     Spike Chunsoft began streaming an announcement video on Monday for Made in Abyss: Binary Star Falling into Darkness (Made in Abyss: Yami o Mezashita Rensei), its new 3D action RPG for the Made in Abyss franchise. The game will launch for PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam in fall 2022.      The game will have an original story supervised by Akihito Tsukushi and will be available in both English and Japanese (with  fully voiced event scenes). Numskull Games is publishing the physical version in Europe.    Spike Chunsoft describes the story:  The story begins with Riko and Reg's meeting in the first episode of season one. This marks the start of their great adventure, and together they travel to Seeker Camp in the second layer of the Abyss. Experience the awesome power of the Curse of the Abyss, as well as the astonishing, legendary entities known as primeval creatures. Prepare to glimpse the world of Riko and her friends.  The game will also feature a ""story mode"" that follows the storyline of the anime adaptation of Akihito Tsukushi's manga. The physical version of the game will also be available in a Collector's Edition that will include merchandise from the franchise.    Akihito Tsukushi launched the manga on Takeshobo's Web Comic Gamma website in 2012. Takeshobo published the 10th compiled book volume in July 2021. Seven Seas published the ninth volume in English in March 2020 and will ship the 10th volume on May 3.    The second season of the television anime will premiere in July.    The first 13-episode television anime series based on the manga premiered in Japan in July 2017.  The English-subtitled version of the show streamed in the United States on Amazon's Anime Strike service, and HIDIVE streamed the series outside of the United States.     The first compilation film for the anime, Made in Abyss: Journey's Dawn (Made in Abyss: Tabidachi no Yoake), opened in Japan in January 2019, followed by the second film, Made in Abyss: Wandering Twilight (Made in Abyss: Hōrō Suru Tasogare), two weeks later. Sentai Filmworks premiered the first film in Los Angeles in March 2019, before it opened in theaters later that month. Sentai Filmworks premiered the second film in Rosemont, Illinois in May 2019, before it opened in theaters in the United States later that month.     Made in Abyss: Dawn of the Deep Soul, a sequel film to the first season, opened in Japan in January 2020.  Sentai Filmworks premiered the movie in select theaters in the U.S. and Canada in August 2020. Sentai Filmworks again screened the film virtually in September 2020, and HIDIVE will begin streaming the film on June 28.    Sony's Columbia Pictures has ordered a feature film script of the manga from writer and director Kevin McMullin. Roy Lee's Vertigo Entertainment and Mobius Productions' Masi Oka (Heroes' Hiro Nakamura actor, Outer Wilds game) are producing the project, after previously collaborating on the 2017 Death Note film (as well as its planned sequel) and the live-action The Promised Neverland series in development at Amazon.

The game will launch for PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam in fall 2022.      The game will have an original story supervised by Akihito Tsukushi and will be available in both English and Japanese (with  fully voiced event scenes). Numskull Games is publishing the physical version in Europe.    Spike Chunsoft describes the story:  The story begins with Riko and Reg's meeting in the first episode of season one. This marks the start of their great adventure, and together they travel to Seeker Camp in the second layer of the Abyss. Experience the awesome power of the Curse of the Abyss, as well as the astonishing, legendary entities known as primeval creatures. Prepare to glimpse the world of Riko and her friends.  The game will also feature a ""story mode"" that follows the storyline of the anime adaptation of Akihito Tsukushi's manga. The physical version of the game will also be available in a Collector's Edition that will include merchandise from the franchise.    Akihito Tsukushi launched the manga on Takeshobo's Web Comic Gamma website in 2012. Takeshobo published the 10th compiled book volume in July 2021. Seven Seas published the ninth volume in English in March 2020 and will ship the 10th volume on May 3.    The second season of the television anime will premiere in July.    The first 13-episode television anime series based on the manga premiered in Japan in July 2017.  The English-subtitled version of the show streamed in the United States on Amazon's Anime Strike service, and HIDIVE streamed the series outside of the United States.     The first compilation film for the anime, Made in Abyss: Journey's Dawn (Made in Abyss: Tabidachi no Yoake), opened in Japan in January 2019, followed by the second film, Made in Abyss: Wandering Twilight (Made in Abyss: Hōrō Suru Tasogare), two weeks later. Sentai Filmworks premiered the first film in Los Angeles in March 2019, before it opened in theaters later that month. Sentai Filmworks premiered the second film in Rosemont, Illinois in May 2019, before it opened in theaters in the United States later that month.

Sentai Filmworks premiered the movie in select theaters in the U.S. and Canada in August 2020. Sentai Filmworks again screened the film virtually in September 2020, and HIDIVE will begin streaming the film on June 28.    Sony's Columbia Pictures has ordered a feature film script of the manga from writer and director Kevin McMullin. Roy Lee's Vertigo Entertainment and Mobius Productions' Masi Oka (Heroes' Hiro Nakamura actor, Outer Wilds game) are producing the project, after previously collaborating on the 2017 Death Note film (as well as its planned sequel) and the live-action The Promised Neverland series in development at Amazon.

News Bandai Hobby Site Stops Posting Model Shipping Schedules Due to Scalping Concerns   posted on 2022-04-04 17:09 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda           The Bandai Hobby Site announced last Friday that it will stop posting the shipping and arrival schedules of its model kit products on the site in an effort to curtail scalping or resale efforts of individuals.    The site explained that while it posts the arrival dates of kits for retail stores on the site, the date is not a guarantee, and may represent a different shipping status with every retailer.    The current high demand of Gunpla and other model kit hobbies have recently led to scalpers coming into prominence, as in similar previous times of low supply and high demand. Scalpers usually purchase kits in bulk to resell them at inflated prices for a profit to customers seeking kits.

News Bandai Hobby Site Stops Posting Model Shipping Schedules Due to Scalping Concerns   posted on 2022-04-04 17:09 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda           The Bandai Hobby Site announced last Friday that it will stop posting the shipping and arrival schedules of its model kit products on the site in an effort to curtail scalping or resale efforts of individuals.    The site explained that while it posts the arrival dates of kits for retail stores on the site, the date is not a guarantee, and may represent a different shipping status with every retailer.    The current high demand of Gunpla and other model kit hobbies have recently led to scalpers coming into prominence, as in similar previous times of low supply and high demand. Scalpers usually purchase kits in bulk to resell them at inflated prices for a profit to customers seeking kits.

Anime News Network was created as a news source that focuses on the medium of Japanese Animation(anime) and Japanese Comics (manga). ANN was founded by Justin Sevakis in July of 1998, and has since lead the online anime news medium with a tradition of strong unbiased coverage of major breaking news. With in-depth coverage, analysis and commentary to provide insight into the world of anime and manga, ANN has been and continues to be the #1 English language source for anime and manga news on the Internet. ANN's goal is to make the latest, most comprehensive Anime news available to new fans and veteran Otaku alike.  What ANN is not:  A television network or station; A subsidiary of another company; A dubbing / voice recording studio; An animation company; A licensing or distribution company; A manufacturer or distributor of merchandise; For sale.    What is anime? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of anime, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, anime is animation that is primarily produced and conceived in Japan. This includes animation conceived in Japan that has portions outsourced to other countries, but does not include animation primarily produced outside Japan and with the animation outsourced to Japan. It does however include animation that is co-conceived inside and outside of Japan and at least partially produced inside Japan.  What is manga? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of manga, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, manga are comic books or strips that are produced and conceived in Japan. This includes include comics that are co-conceived inside and outside of Japan but produced in Japan.  Who operates ANN? ANN is operated by a team of people, under the guidance of Christopher Macdonald, Daniel DeLorme, Zac Bertschy, Egan Loo and Hori Shinsuke. A full list of the staff can be found on the staff page.   Who owns ANN? The website is owned by Anime News Network Inc., a privately owned corporation. The corporation's shareholders include: Christopher Macdonald (Minority owner, controlling shareholder), Hori Shinsuke (Minority owner), Anime Consortium Japan (Minority owner), others.   Where is ANN based? Wow, that question is so 1999! ANN is based everywhere and nowhere. We're based on the Internet! We don't have an office; our staff all work at home and are based around the world with the most full-time staff based in Japan and the United States. Anime News Network, Inc. the corporation that maintains ANN is a Canadian corporation.  Who is the mascot? When the site was first launched in 1998 it featured a blond-haired mascot named Jadress, created by Robin Sevakis. She was eventually replaced by Nina, who was featured in a webcomic (also created by Robin Sevakis) that ran from 2007 to 2013.  How often do you update? The site is run on a daily content format, as opposed to a monthly or bi-monthly magazine format. We update the news and reviews daily, and other content, such as features, columns, and editorials are also added throughout the week. Our encyclopedia is updated daily as well.  Under what settings is ANN best viewed? The site uses a responsive design that should look good at any resolution, from smartphones to large desktop screens.  How do I find older articles on ANN? Links to archives for news, features, columns, reviews, etc. can be found in their respective sections in the menu. You can also use the search engine.  What was used to make the site, as well as maintain it? The site is a combination of older parts in PHP and newer parts in Ruby, with a MySQL database to manage the content. Apart from the phpBB forum, we haven't used any pre-made packages; all the content is managed and presented with custom software.  How do I get permission to reprint an ANN Story, or obtain an ANN graphic or photo? ANN has a newsfeed program where you can get the latest anime news headlines on your very own website. If you wish to entirely reprint anything on your site please contact the editors. For more details about what you can and can not re-print with or without our permission, see our copyright statement.  How many people hear or read an ANN story? We get a bit over 200,000 visits every day. In addition to regular visitors, ANN's news is often sourced in print and occasionally on the airwaves.  How can I get in touch with the staff? Visit our contact page or visit our staff page for further contact and personal information. If a member's e-mail address is not there you can send your comments to the editors and we'll forward them.  Do you attend any public events? Yes. ANN tries to provide coverage to as many anime conventions/festivals/symposiums as our staff can manage. For more details on this see our events section and our events forum.  Do you have a newsfeed? You really should have an RSS newsfeed! Look at our newsfeed section for links to various RSS & Atom feeds as well as our custom newsfeed program. Submitting Content  How should I submit news ? Send an e-mail to [email protected] , this e-mail address is regularly monitored by several staff (someone is always ""on duty""). Other methods (e-mail directly to staff, PM, Forum, Twitter, etc...) are less reliable, and may lead to delays and/or a complete failure to notice your submission.  I have something to say about an online petition. Stop. Virtually every e-petition is a waste of time.   I submitted a news item, why wasn't it posted? We could still be in the process of verifying the details, we may not have been able to verify the items, or perhaps we didn't find it newsworthy enough to post. On a ""slow"" news day we're more likely to post less significant items.  I submitted a news item, why was it credited to someone else? They either submitted it first--or more importantly--submitted more information.  Can I submit news about a non-Japanese animation? No. We're Anime News Network, not ""Animation News Network"", not ""Asian Animation Network."" There's plenty of good animation from around the world, including Korea and China, but we only cover Japanese animation, not French, Mexican, Chinese, African, Korean or Afghanistanimation.  Can I submit a review? / How do I become a reviewer? Anime News Network does not accept unsolicited reviews. Take a quick look at the Staff Openings page, if there is an opening, it will be mentioned there. More often than not, we hire experienced writers who are known to us. Best piece of advice we can give is to make a name for yourself then we'll come to you when the time is right.  Can I submit an article? If you are an experienced writer/journalist with a portfolio you can point to, please E-mail the editors and ask about the topic, we'd be glad to consider your article idea.  Can I have a column? No. Only previous, regular contributors who have shown an ability to consistently write timely, quality articles (or reviews) are permitted to write columns. Try submitting some articles or reviews first.  Information X is missing from the Encyclopedia, can you add it? We can't add it, but YOU can. The Encyclopedia is a user-contributed database; it's made specially so that you can add missing information by yourself. You just need a user account. So please do take the time to register and submit the information you found was missing. Each page contains pointers about how to add information, and if that's not enough you can check the Encyclopedia FAQ or the memoranda.  How can I contribute to the encyclopedia? Any registered user can contribute standard data to the Encyclopedia for Anime, Manga and People. But if that's not enough for you and you're near the top of the contributors list and you'd like to help out with the releases, lexicon, or editing and verifying data submitted by other people, please contact the Encyclopedist.  Please note, that we'll be looking for someone who is inputting quality data, not just large amounts of data.   What if I want to contribute in some other way? We always appreciate whatever help and support that readers can give. If you'd like to help out at ANN in a way other than the ones described above, please contact the editors. There's so much to do at ANN that we're very appreciative of any help offered.   My company is making Anime, can you post a news article about it? Sorry, too many companies are trying to cash in on the popularity of Anime by making cartoons with big eyes and purple hair. We're sure you aren't like that, but... well actually, we aren't sure.  Why doesn't Anime News Network review world manga? Please see our definition of manga. It is Anime News Network's official position, and the personal belief of many of our staff, than there is nothing inheritently superior about Japanese manga when compared to world manga. However Anime News Network's purpose is to cover Japanese animation and comic books. Currently we do not have the resources to review all the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America. If and when we are able to review 100% of the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America, we will then consider expanding our area of review coverage to include manga-style comics (world manga) that originate outside of Japan.  Why didn't you post a news article about my (company's) new Anime or Manga? If your item is picked up in a distribution deal by a company that isn't being run out of someone's garage, then maybe its newsworthy. So when that happens, give us a shout, and we'll consider it, but if you can't tell us what makes your creation manga or anime (other than big eyes, purple hair and the like) you can pretty much forget it.  May I send you my company's product to review? If it's anime or manga-related, then yes. Contact editors[at]animenewsnetwork.com for shipping information.  I'm starting a new webmanga, is it news? No, there are a billion and one ""webmangas"", and most only last a couple of months. Now, if your webmanga gets licensed by a publisher... that might be news.  Can you mention my site? Only if you do something newsworthy, sorry.  Why have we been blacklisted? ANN has a 2-strikes rule regarding inappropriate PR. After 2 strikes for the following reasons we will blacklist your company or PR firm (when we blacklist a PR firm, we notify their relevant clients). i) Completely irrelevant PR that has nothing to do with anime, manga, Japanese pop-culture or any other related content; ii) Unauthorized stealth marketing on our forums; iii) Harassing our staff; iv) Continued PR submissions to inappropriate e-mail address. v) Any attempt to illicitly influence editorial We'll send you a link to this post after your first offense. After your second offense you'll never hear from us again (and our readers will never hear from you or your clients).  Isn't this a bit harsh? Perhaps, but we're tired of getting PRs for toilets, accounting firm management changes and World War 2 museums.   But we offer an opt-out! Clicking that link might opt us out of all your press releases, including your relevant ones. It would be the same as blacklisting you, without giving you the warning. Showing you this warning is actually less harsh than clicking your opt-out.  Forum / Account  I didn't receive my forum registration. If you are using a spam filter, please check your spam folder, some mail servers catch the registration code as spam. Search your spamfolder & inbox for e-mail from [email protected] or [email protected]. If you are using any sort of white list, please make sure that your e-mail account is set up to accept e-mails from [email protected] and [email protected]. If you are using a mail service that bounces the e-mail back to the sender and asks them to confirm that it is not spam, we will not do that. These services usually allow you to add the e-mail address to a white-list before hand. Once you have checked all of the above, you can have the server re-send you your activation code by going here. It should be instant, but sometimes e-mail is slow, give it a couple hours (the slowness is usually not because of our server). If you still don't get your activation code, then and ONLY then, e-mail us at [email protected] make sure that: 1) Your e-mail is sent from the e-mail address you submitted to ANN; 2) You include your user name; 3) Do not send us your password; 4) The subject of your e-mail must be ""activation code"".   How do I become a moderator? You're invited. When we feel there is a need for a new moderator, we look at our best forum users (the ones that contribute intelligently to conversation and act maturely) and ask them if they'd be willing to help us moderate the forum.  Will there ever be an off topic / general conversation forum among the forums? Not in the public areas, no. We do however maintain a community section for subscribers, and off-topic discussion is permitted there.  Why aren't my posts showing up? Posts from new users sometimes take a while to show up. Please be patient, they should appear within a few hours. Believe it or not, this is a ""feature"" not a ""bug.""  Is there a set of forum rules? Right here - read them if you haven't already.  Help, I've been banned or moderated! Read this.  How do I attach a picture (avatar) to my account? Read this.  Can I change my user name? You can make changes in your user account settings. But because other users depend on your username to recognize you, we have a ""no identity switcheroos"" policy: once you start using the forum we do not allow changes to your username beyond punctuation and capitalization.  Can I delete my account? Yes, you can. Go to your account settings page and you will be able to delete your account from there. Contests  Can I enter give-aways more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No.  Can I enter creative contests more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, Yes.  Does ANN ""own"" my entry? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No. But as a condition of your entry we generaly require you to give us the unrevocable right to display your entry on Anime News Network for all eternity.  Can I display my entry elsewhere? Yes, anywhere you please, unless otherwise stated in the contest rules.  Why do I have to put your logo and/or the sponsor's logo on my submission There are two reasons for this. First, it adds some extra benefit to the contest sponsors and second, it helps us insure that you made the entry for the contest, instead of just grabing some existing art and submiting it.  Explain those rules about where I live and whether or not I can enter and if you will ship me a prize. Most of our contest are open to anyone, regardless of where you live, because we don't believe in geographic discrimination. However sometimes our sponsors want a contest to only be open to their potential clients, so in those cases we have no choice to abide by their request to limit contest entry to a certain geographic area. While we don't believe in geographic discrimination, we also don't believe in spending a fortune on shipping and trying to figure out custom laws in order to get you your prize so that's why we only ship to the USA and Canada.   What does a complete mailing address look like? Short answer: ""It's what we need to put on a package to mail it to you."" It looks something like this:  416 William St. #402 Moralton, SS 70707 USA 24 Sussex Dr Ottawa, ON  K1A 0A3 Canada 1000 J.P. Laurel St. San Miguel 1005, Manila  Philippines   You'd be amazed at how many people enter our contests and leave out critical mailing information like their city, province/state and or postal/zip code. You'd also be amazed at how many people ask us ""What do you mean by complete mailing address?"" In fact, if you're reading this, it's quite possible that we referred you here because you asked that very question. Since we usually only ship to the USA and Canada, we won't disqualify you for leaving out the country, but if anything else is missing, we'll just pick another winner to replace you. We will not contact you to verify your mailing address. BTW, your name is not part of your mailing address, but we won't disqualify you for putting it in there...  Why do some contests not ship to PO Boxes? ANN usually doesn't handle shipping for our contest prizes. Shipping is done by the contest sponsor. If the contest states ""no PO boxes"" this is because our sponsor requested it. Most likely it is because they are shipping via a courier like UPS, which will not ship to PO boxes.  I'd really prefer it if you didn't post my name & city if I win This is done for legal reasons, sorry. That said, if you want to enter with an alias, that's fine as long as you are certain the package will reach you (we can't guarantee it will).  Why did you stop accepting art contest entries from Facebook By default, Facebook posts usually aren't public. Most people who submit Facebook URLs to our art contests forget to share their entries publicly, and we are often forced to disqualify these entries. It's better to just avoid the problem altogether. If you want to enter with Facebook, and you remember to make your entry public go ahead, we'll accept it. But if you forget to share it properly, we will simply ignore your entry.   Miscellaneous   Can I link to you? Yes, please feel free. Currently we don't have any banners to offer you for this, we'll be making some new ones shortly.  Can you link to me? No. We are not a link exchange site.  Wait, I can link to you, but you won't link to me?? Yes, we know it sounds a little conceited of us, but that's how it is. To be fair, we don't expect you to link to us, but we're honored if you do decide that you'd like to link to our site despite the fact that we won't be returning the favor. Please don't link to us if you're only doing it because you hope to get something in return; link to us because you feel that you want more people to know about Anime News Network.   Can we trade banners? Sorry, ANN relies on its banners to survive. We very seldom trade banners with another website or publication. If your publication is in print (10 000+ circulation) or a website with 10 million+ impressions per month, we may consider it. Please understand, ANN receives this question at least once a week, it isn't possible for us to even consider swapping / affiliating with so many sites, so we generally don't swap / affiliate with any.  Can you affiliate with us? Anime News Network would be happy to setup an affiliate program with any online store that pays referral fees provided that store meets certain pre-requisites. Anime News Network is unfortunately unable to affiliate itself with fan-sites much for the same reason that we can not link to you or trade banners with you (see above two entries).  Why'd you give this show a rating of ... in your review? Clearly it deserved a ... ! Obviously our reviewer disagrees.  When is title X coming out, how many episodes is it, and/or who is releasing it? Look it up in the encyclopedia, ask Answerman, or ask in the forum.  Why'd you make X change to the programming on [Cartoon Network, YTV, etc]? Uhh, try contacting the broadcaster, network or station. We're a news site and we have no more control over the schedule at [TV Station] than any other media source. Yes, believe it or not we get this question every so often.  I'd like to license, work on, be involved with, etc... one of your titles Just like we aren't involved in TV broadcasting, we are not licensors. Even for shows that we stream on ANN, we are not authorized to sub-license them to other companies. Contact the producers or the licensors, not us.  I'd like permission to do something with one of your titles Sorry, we do not control copyright permissions for any anime or manga. If you need permission to do something, contact the local licensee / master licensor; or failing that, contact the master licensor in Japan. A bit of advice though, for personal, non commercial projects, don't bother contacting them unless you absolutely need permission. They don't care if you make a 1-off t-shirt to wear to school, but if you ask them, they'll probably say ""No,"" as a matter of policy. Sorry we can not help you get in contact with a rights holder.  Why'd you take my video show off YouTube? We get this question a lot. We didn't take your video down. See the above answer as well as the first one. ANN has no involvement in the process of taking pirated materials off of websites like YouTube. For your information, the material was probably taken down because it was uploaded without permission (therefore illegally) and the licensors want you to watch it somewhere they will make money (on DVD, on TV, or on an authorized website). Go here for a list of places where you can legally watch anime and support the creators at the same time.  On a related note, allow us to point out that your video was probably automatically removed by a technology called video-fingerprinting. By this semi-automated process, YouTube removes videos that it believes infringe on copyrights without waiting for complaints from copyright holders. So it's quite possible that no anime company was involved in the removal of your video.   Sadly, this process can affect videos that are legitimate ""fair-use."" Even more sadly, the employees at the anime companies are too busy to bother reading all the e-mails they get about videos (the vast majority of are from morons that don't understand that ""I wasn't making money"" doesn't make it okay) so you can e-mail them to your hearts content, but they probably won't answer (not because they're fan-hating assholes, but because they don't have the time).    If you believe your video is legitimate fair-use (full episodes are never fair use, significant episode clips are rarely fair use, AMVs are almost never fair use of the music) try posting it again and include in the description why you feel it is fair use. If you're lucky, YouTube will take this into consideration (some videos are deleted automatically, others are looked at by a human employee at YouTube after the fingerprinting process identifies them) and not delete your video. You really should read up on ""fair use"" before you make any claims that your video is fair use though. And by ""read-up,"" we mean read professional, expert explanations, not your friend's blog.   I have a great idea for an anime or manga, where do I submit it? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not involved with the creation process of any anime or manga and we can not put you in contact with creators (more on that here). Finally, we'd recommend you read this and this.  How do I get your television channel? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not The Anime Network (TAN). For details on TAN, read the transcript of our chat with them, read our TAN news coverage, or visit their website.  Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? No. As a policy, ANN never gives out contact information. Don't send us this question unless you've exhausted every other resource available (phone book, 411, Google, their website, etc...), even then, we will only forward your request to them, and we will only do so provided it is a business-to-business request being made by a company we've actually heard of. If you can't find Hayao Miyazaki's e-mail address online, it's probably because he doesn't want to receive a thousand e-mails a day. The one exception to this rule is that we will give out the Public Relations / Press Relations (PR) contact information for a company provided we have it readily available. Generally you can find this information on your own though, so please don't be lazy. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? I'm an old acquaintance of theirs. The answer is still no. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? They worked on one of your projects. Just to be clear, our encyclopedia carries information about a myriad of projects (anime,manga, etc...) most of which (99.9%) Anime News Network is not, and never was, involved with. It is not a list of our projects. So if the person actually worked for ANN, please see this answer, but if they are one of the 67023+ people listed in the encyclopedia, they probably didn't work for us and therefore the previous two answers apply. Okay, I understand, you can't or won't put me in contact with them, but I really want/need to contact this person. Can you offer any suggestions on how to proceed? Depending on who you're trying to contact, they might have a fanclub, official webpage, or e-mail address listed in their encyclopedia entry. If not, try looking for the latest production they worked on and contacting the production company, they might be able and willing to forward your e-mail. Just a note, if you're contacting someone in Japan, it's highly recommended that at least your intro be in Japanese. Even if your intended recipient understands English, the person you ask to forward your e-mail might not. For your benefit, here's a quick intro you can prepend to any e-mail you send to Japan (replaces the blanks by the name of the person you are trying to contact): ご担当者様へ お世話になっております。 本社は____様にご連絡を取りたがっています。お手数ですが、このメールを____様へ転送して頂けないでしょうか? 宜しくお願いします。  Literally: To whom it may concern/the person in charge: Thank you for your time. We are trying to contact _____. If it isn't too much trouble, could you forward this e-mail to ____? Thank you very much.    Can you send me your catalog? We don't have a catalog, we don't sell anything.  Where can I buy Anime ? You can buy it at retail movie stores like Blockbuster and Suncoast as well as specialty Anime Shops. You can also buy it online at websites like Anime Castle, Anime Nation, J List, Roberts Anime Corner Store and The Right Stuf International.  Where can I download anime or watch it online? For the most part, you can't legally download anime online. Fansubs are generally illegal (whether or not they're unethical is a completely different topic), and as such, we can't help you obtain them. You might want to check the sites listed below, and read our news, when there's legal anime to download or watched online we generally mention it.  Don't ask us where to get bootlegs or fansubs, we won't tell you.  Some sites/services that allow you to download or watch anime online legally(may or may not be free):  Amazon Prime crunchyroll Funimation's Website HiDive Apple iTunes hulu Netflix Viz Anime  * Why isn't YouTube listed? Because a lot of the content on YouTube is illegally uploaded. One day we'll have an index of legal anime on YouTube, but until then we aren't listing it as a site where all content is legal/authorized.   How do I watch anime on ANN? ANN has stopped streaming anime episodes. Go to the websites above!  Can you help me with my school assignment No. We get this question about once a week, and we don't really want to spend 25 hours a year answering school questions. The worst part is that most people who e-mail us are actually asking us to provide information they could find with a little bit of research, in other words, they're asking us to do their work for them. On the other hand, if you're working on a master's project or PhD thesis related to anime, that interests us, so we'd probably be more than happy to help.  Does ANN offer Internships? Yes, Anime News Network offers internships in our newsroom and our web-development departments. Further details are available here   What happened to ANN UK? In late May the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into effect. The EU determined that any website targeting European readers would be ""doing business in Europe."" Anime News Network does not disagree with this conclusion. Unfortunately, the GDPR requires all websites doing business in Europe to meet a stringent set of privacy regulations. While ANN supports the intent of these regulations, some of them are extremely difficult to comply with. While it is our intention, for the benefit of all readers our readers around the world, to comply with these new standards, we are not able to do so immediately. Once we are fully compliant with GDPR requirements, we will re-launch ANN UK. In the meantime, ANN's global edition is available to all readers worldwide and is the default version for readers outside of North America, Australia, New Zealand and South East Asia.             bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Misc Page homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature                The Best and Worst of Winter 2022   Apr  6, 10:10                 anime    With the last few episodes trailing into Spring like an April's fool, it's time to look at the final ranking of the Winter 2022 season.

Anime News Network was created as a news source that focuses on the medium of Japanese Animation(anime) and Japanese Comics (manga). ANN was founded by Justin Sevakis in July of 1998, and has since lead the online anime news medium with a tradition of strong unbiased coverage of major breaking news. With in-depth coverage, analysis and commentary to provide insight into the world of anime and manga, ANN has been and continues to be the #1 English language source for anime and manga news on the Internet. ANN's goal is to make the latest, most comprehensive Anime news available to new fans and veteran Otaku alike.  What ANN is not:  A television network or station; A subsidiary of another company; A dubbing / voice recording studio; An animation company; A licensing or distribution company; A manufacturer or distributor of merchandise; For sale.    What is anime? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of anime, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, anime is animation that is primarily produced and conceived in Japan. This includes animation conceived in Japan that has portions outsourced to other countries, but does not include animation primarily produced outside Japan and with the animation outsourced to Japan. It does however include animation that is co-conceived inside and outside of Japan and at least partially produced inside Japan.  What is manga? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of manga, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, manga are comic books or strips that are produced and conceived in Japan. This includes include comics that are co-conceived inside and outside of Japan but produced in Japan.  Who operates ANN? ANN is operated by a team of people, under the guidance of Christopher Macdonald, Daniel DeLorme, Zac Bertschy, Egan Loo and Hori Shinsuke. A full list of the staff can be found on the staff page.   Who owns ANN? The website is owned by Anime News Network Inc., a privately owned corporation. The corporation's shareholders include: Christopher Macdonald (Minority owner, controlling shareholder), Hori Shinsuke (Minority owner), Anime Consortium Japan (Minority owner), others.   Where is ANN based? Wow, that question is so 1999! ANN is based everywhere and nowhere. We're based on the Internet! We don't have an office; our staff all work at home and are based around the world with the most full-time staff based in Japan and the United States. Anime News Network, Inc. the corporation that maintains ANN is a Canadian corporation.  Who is the mascot? When the site was first launched in 1998 it featured a blond-haired mascot named Jadress, created by Robin Sevakis. She was eventually replaced by Nina, who was featured in a webcomic (also created by Robin Sevakis) that ran from 2007 to 2013.  How often do you update? The site is run on a daily content format, as opposed to a monthly or bi-monthly magazine format. We update the news and reviews daily, and other content, such as features, columns, and editorials are also added throughout the week. Our encyclopedia is updated daily as well.  Under what settings is ANN best viewed? The site uses a responsive design that should look good at any resolution, from smartphones to large desktop screens.  How do I find older articles on ANN? Links to archives for news, features, columns, reviews, etc. can be found in their respective sections in the menu. You can also use the search engine.  What was used to make the site, as well as maintain it? The site is a combination of older parts in PHP and newer parts in Ruby, with a MySQL database to manage the content. Apart from the phpBB forum, we haven't used any pre-made packages; all the content is managed and presented with custom software.  How do I get permission to reprint an ANN Story, or obtain an ANN graphic or photo? ANN has a newsfeed program where you can get the latest anime news headlines on your very own website. If you wish to entirely reprint anything on your site please contact the editors. For more details about what you can and can not re-print with or without our permission, see our copyright statement.  How many people hear or read an ANN story? We get a bit over 200,000 visits every day. In addition to regular visitors, ANN's news is often sourced in print and occasionally on the airwaves.  How can I get in touch with the staff? Visit our contact page or visit our staff page for further contact and personal information. If a member's e-mail address is not there you can send your comments to the editors and we'll forward them.  Do you attend any public events? Yes. ANN tries to provide coverage to as many anime conventions/festivals/symposiums as our staff can manage. For more details on this see our events section and our events forum.  Do you have a newsfeed? You really should have an RSS newsfeed! Look at our newsfeed section for links to various RSS & Atom feeds as well as our custom newsfeed program. Submitting Content  How should I submit news ? Send an e-mail to [email protected] , this e-mail address is regularly monitored by several staff (someone is always ""on duty""). Other methods (e-mail directly to staff, PM, Forum, Twitter, etc...) are less reliable, and may lead to delays and/or a complete failure to notice your submission.  I have something to say about an online petition. Stop. Virtually every e-petition is a waste of time.   I submitted a news item, why wasn't it posted? We could still be in the process of verifying the details, we may not have been able to verify the items, or perhaps we didn't find it newsworthy enough to post. On a ""slow"" news day we're more likely to post less significant items.  I submitted a news item, why was it credited to someone else? They either submitted it first--or more importantly--submitted more information.  Can I submit news about a non-Japanese animation? No. We're Anime News Network, not ""Animation News Network"", not ""Asian Animation Network."" There's plenty of good animation from around the world, including Korea and China, but we only cover Japanese animation, not French, Mexican, Chinese, African, Korean or Afghanistanimation.  Can I submit a review? / How do I become a reviewer? Anime News Network does not accept unsolicited reviews. Take a quick look at the Staff Openings page, if there is an opening, it will be mentioned there. More often than not, we hire experienced writers who are known to us. Best piece of advice we can give is to make a name for yourself then we'll come to you when the time is right.  Can I submit an article? If you are an experienced writer/journalist with a portfolio you can point to, please E-mail the editors and ask about the topic, we'd be glad to consider your article idea.  Can I have a column? No. Only previous, regular contributors who have shown an ability to consistently write timely, quality articles (or reviews) are permitted to write columns. Try submitting some articles or reviews first.  Information X is missing from the Encyclopedia, can you add it? We can't add it, but YOU can. The Encyclopedia is a user-contributed database; it's made specially so that you can add missing information by yourself. You just need a user account. So please do take the time to register and submit the information you found was missing. Each page contains pointers about how to add information, and if that's not enough you can check the Encyclopedia FAQ or the memoranda.  How can I contribute to the encyclopedia? Any registered user can contribute standard data to the Encyclopedia for Anime, Manga and People. But if that's not enough for you and you're near the top of the contributors list and you'd like to help out with the releases, lexicon, or editing and verifying data submitted by other people, please contact the Encyclopedist.  Please note, that we'll be looking for someone who is inputting quality data, not just large amounts of data.   What if I want to contribute in some other way? We always appreciate whatever help and support that readers can give. If you'd like to help out at ANN in a way other than the ones described above, please contact the editors. There's so much to do at ANN that we're very appreciative of any help offered.   My company is making Anime, can you post a news article about it? Sorry, too many companies are trying to cash in on the popularity of Anime by making cartoons with big eyes and purple hair. We're sure you aren't like that, but... well actually, we aren't sure.  Why doesn't Anime News Network review world manga? Please see our definition of manga. It is Anime News Network's official position, and the personal belief of many of our staff, than there is nothing inheritently superior about Japanese manga when compared to world manga. However Anime News Network's purpose is to cover Japanese animation and comic books. Currently we do not have the resources to review all the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America. If and when we are able to review 100% of the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America, we will then consider expanding our area of review coverage to include manga-style comics (world manga) that originate outside of Japan.  Why didn't you post a news article about my (company's) new Anime or Manga? If your item is picked up in a distribution deal by a company that isn't being run out of someone's garage, then maybe its newsworthy. So when that happens, give us a shout, and we'll consider it, but if you can't tell us what makes your creation manga or anime (other than big eyes, purple hair and the like) you can pretty much forget it.  May I send you my company's product to review? If it's anime or manga-related, then yes. Contact editors[at]animenewsnetwork.com for shipping information.  I'm starting a new webmanga, is it news? No, there are a billion and one ""webmangas"", and most only last a couple of months. Now, if your webmanga gets licensed by a publisher... that might be news.  Can you mention my site? Only if you do something newsworthy, sorry.  Why have we been blacklisted? ANN has a 2-strikes rule regarding inappropriate PR. After 2 strikes for the following reasons we will blacklist your company or PR firm (when we blacklist a PR firm, we notify their relevant clients). i) Completely irrelevant PR that has nothing to do with anime, manga, Japanese pop-culture or any other related content; ii) Unauthorized stealth marketing on our forums; iii) Harassing our staff; iv) Continued PR submissions to inappropriate e-mail address. v) Any attempt to illicitly influence editorial We'll send you a link to this post after your first offense. After your second offense you'll never hear from us again (and our readers will never hear from you or your clients).  Isn't this a bit harsh? Perhaps, but we're tired of getting PRs for toilets, accounting firm management changes and World War 2 museums.   But we offer an opt-out! Clicking that link might opt us out of all your press releases, including your relevant ones. It would be the same as blacklisting you, without giving you the warning. Showing you this warning is actually less harsh than clicking your opt-out.  Forum / Account  I didn't receive my forum registration. If you are using a spam filter, please check your spam folder, some mail servers catch the registration code as spam. Search your spamfolder & inbox for e-mail from [email protected] or [email protected]. If you are using any sort of white list, please make sure that your e-mail account is set up to accept e-mails from [email protected] and [email protected]. If you are using a mail service that bounces the e-mail back to the sender and asks them to confirm that it is not spam, we will not do that. These services usually allow you to add the e-mail address to a white-list before hand. Once you have checked all of the above, you can have the server re-send you your activation code by going here. It should be instant, but sometimes e-mail is slow, give it a couple hours (the slowness is usually not because of our server). If you still don't get your activation code, then and ONLY then, e-mail us at [email protected] make sure that: 1) Your e-mail is sent from the e-mail address you submitted to ANN; 2) You include your user name; 3) Do not send us your password; 4) The subject of your e-mail must be ""activation code"".   How do I become a moderator? You're invited. When we feel there is a need for a new moderator, we look at our best forum users (the ones that contribute intelligently to conversation and act maturely) and ask them if they'd be willing to help us moderate the forum.  Will there ever be an off topic / general conversation forum among the forums? Not in the public areas, no. We do however maintain a community section for subscribers, and off-topic discussion is permitted there.  Why aren't my posts showing up? Posts from new users sometimes take a while to show up. Please be patient, they should appear within a few hours. Believe it or not, this is a ""feature"" not a ""bug.""  Is there a set of forum rules? Right here - read them if you haven't already.  Help, I've been banned or moderated! Read this.  How do I attach a picture (avatar) to my account? Read this.  Can I change my user name? You can make changes in your user account settings. But because other users depend on your username to recognize you, we have a ""no identity switcheroos"" policy: once you start using the forum we do not allow changes to your username beyond punctuation and capitalization.  Can I delete my account? Yes, you can. Go to your account settings page and you will be able to delete your account from there. Contests  Can I enter give-aways more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No.  Can I enter creative contests more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, Yes.  Does ANN ""own"" my entry? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No. But as a condition of your entry we generaly require you to give us the unrevocable right to display your entry on Anime News Network for all eternity.  Can I display my entry elsewhere? Yes, anywhere you please, unless otherwise stated in the contest rules.  Why do I have to put your logo and/or the sponsor's logo on my submission There are two reasons for this. First, it adds some extra benefit to the contest sponsors and second, it helps us insure that you made the entry for the contest, instead of just grabing some existing art and submiting it.  Explain those rules about where I live and whether or not I can enter and if you will ship me a prize. Most of our contest are open to anyone, regardless of where you live, because we don't believe in geographic discrimination. However sometimes our sponsors want a contest to only be open to their potential clients, so in those cases we have no choice to abide by their request to limit contest entry to a certain geographic area. While we don't believe in geographic discrimination, we also don't believe in spending a fortune on shipping and trying to figure out custom laws in order to get you your prize so that's why we only ship to the USA and Canada.   What does a complete mailing address look like? Short answer: ""It's what we need to put on a package to mail it to you."" It looks something like this:  416 William St. #402 Moralton, SS 70707 USA 24 Sussex Dr Ottawa, ON  K1A 0A3 Canada 1000 J.P. Laurel St. San Miguel 1005, Manila  Philippines   You'd be amazed at how many people enter our contests and leave out critical mailing information like their city, province/state and or postal/zip code. You'd also be amazed at how many people ask us ""What do you mean by complete mailing address?"" In fact, if you're reading this, it's quite possible that we referred you here because you asked that very question. Since we usually only ship to the USA and Canada, we won't disqualify you for leaving out the country, but if anything else is missing, we'll just pick another winner to replace you. We will not contact you to verify your mailing address. BTW, your name is not part of your mailing address, but we won't disqualify you for putting it in there...  Why do some contests not ship to PO Boxes? ANN usually doesn't handle shipping for our contest prizes. Shipping is done by the contest sponsor. If the contest states ""no PO boxes"" this is because our sponsor requested it. Most likely it is because they are shipping via a courier like UPS, which will not ship to PO boxes.  I'd really prefer it if you didn't post my name & city if I win This is done for legal reasons, sorry. That said, if you want to enter with an alias, that's fine as long as you are certain the package will reach you (we can't guarantee it will).  Why did you stop accepting art contest entries from Facebook By default, Facebook posts usually aren't public. Most people who submit Facebook URLs to our art contests forget to share their entries publicly, and we are often forced to disqualify these entries. It's better to just avoid the problem altogether. If you want to enter with Facebook, and you remember to make your entry public go ahead, we'll accept it. But if you forget to share it properly, we will simply ignore your entry.   Miscellaneous   Can I link to you? Yes, please feel free. Currently we don't have any banners to offer you for this, we'll be making some new ones shortly.  Can you link to me? No. We are not a link exchange site.  Wait, I can link to you, but you won't link to me?? Yes, we know it sounds a little conceited of us, but that's how it is. To be fair, we don't expect you to link to us, but we're honored if you do decide that you'd like to link to our site despite the fact that we won't be returning the favor. Please don't link to us if you're only doing it because you hope to get something in return; link to us because you feel that you want more people to know about Anime News Network.   Can we trade banners? Sorry, ANN relies on its banners to survive. We very seldom trade banners with another website or publication. If your publication is in print (10 000+ circulation) or a website with 10 million+ impressions per month, we may consider it. Please understand, ANN receives this question at least once a week, it isn't possible for us to even consider swapping / affiliating with so many sites, so we generally don't swap / affiliate with any.  Can you affiliate with us? Anime News Network would be happy to setup an affiliate program with any online store that pays referral fees provided that store meets certain pre-requisites. Anime News Network is unfortunately unable to affiliate itself with fan-sites much for the same reason that we can not link to you or trade banners with you (see above two entries).  Why'd you give this show a rating of ... in your review? Clearly it deserved a ... ! Obviously our reviewer disagrees.  When is title X coming out, how many episodes is it, and/or who is releasing it? Look it up in the encyclopedia, ask Answerman, or ask in the forum.  Why'd you make X change to the programming on [Cartoon Network, YTV, etc]? Uhh, try contacting the broadcaster, network or station. We're a news site and we have no more control over the schedule at [TV Station] than any other media source. Yes, believe it or not we get this question every so often.  I'd like to license, work on, be involved with, etc... one of your titles Just like we aren't involved in TV broadcasting, we are not licensors. Even for shows that we stream on ANN, we are not authorized to sub-license them to other companies. Contact the producers or the licensors, not us.  I'd like permission to do something with one of your titles Sorry, we do not control copyright permissions for any anime or manga. If you need permission to do something, contact the local licensee / master licensor; or failing that, contact the master licensor in Japan. A bit of advice though, for personal, non commercial projects, don't bother contacting them unless you absolutely need permission. They don't care if you make a 1-off t-shirt to wear to school, but if you ask them, they'll probably say ""No,"" as a matter of policy. Sorry we can not help you get in contact with a rights holder.  Why'd you take my video show off YouTube? We get this question a lot. We didn't take your video down. See the above answer as well as the first one. ANN has no involvement in the process of taking pirated materials off of websites like YouTube. For your information, the material was probably taken down because it was uploaded without permission (therefore illegally) and the licensors want you to watch it somewhere they will make money (on DVD, on TV, or on an authorized website). Go here for a list of places where you can legally watch anime and support the creators at the same time.  On a related note, allow us to point out that your video was probably automatically removed by a technology called video-fingerprinting. By this semi-automated process, YouTube removes videos that it believes infringe on copyrights without waiting for complaints from copyright holders. So it's quite possible that no anime company was involved in the removal of your video.   Sadly, this process can affect videos that are legitimate ""fair-use."" Even more sadly, the employees at the anime companies are too busy to bother reading all the e-mails they get about videos (the vast majority of are from morons that don't understand that ""I wasn't making money"" doesn't make it okay) so you can e-mail them to your hearts content, but they probably won't answer (not because they're fan-hating assholes, but because they don't have the time).    If you believe your video is legitimate fair-use (full episodes are never fair use, significant episode clips are rarely fair use, AMVs are almost never fair use of the music) try posting it again and include in the description why you feel it is fair use. If you're lucky, YouTube will take this into consideration (some videos are deleted automatically, others are looked at by a human employee at YouTube after the fingerprinting process identifies them) and not delete your video. You really should read up on ""fair use"" before you make any claims that your video is fair use though. And by ""read-up,"" we mean read professional, expert explanations, not your friend's blog.   I have a great idea for an anime or manga, where do I submit it? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not involved with the creation process of any anime or manga and we can not put you in contact with creators (more on that here). Finally, we'd recommend you read this and this.  How do I get your television channel? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not The Anime Network (TAN). For details on TAN, read the transcript of our chat with them, read our TAN news coverage, or visit their website.  Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? No. As a policy, ANN never gives out contact information. Don't send us this question unless you've exhausted every other resource available (phone book, 411, Google, their website, etc...), even then, we will only forward your request to them, and we will only do so provided it is a business-to-business request being made by a company we've actually heard of. If you can't find Hayao Miyazaki's e-mail address online, it's probably because he doesn't want to receive a thousand e-mails a day. The one exception to this rule is that we will give out the Public Relations / Press Relations (PR) contact information for a company provided we have it readily available. Generally you can find this information on your own though, so please don't be lazy. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? I'm an old acquaintance of theirs. The answer is still no. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? They worked on one of your projects. Just to be clear, our encyclopedia carries information about a myriad of projects (anime,manga, etc...) most of which (99.9%) Anime News Network is not, and never was, involved with. It is not a list of our projects. So if the person actually worked for ANN, please see this answer, but if they are one of the 67023+ people listed in the encyclopedia, they probably didn't work for us and therefore the previous two answers apply. Okay, I understand, you can't or won't put me in contact with them, but I really want/need to contact this person. Can you offer any suggestions on how to proceed? Depending on who you're trying to contact, they might have a fanclub, official webpage, or e-mail address listed in their encyclopedia entry. If not, try looking for the latest production they worked on and contacting the production company, they might be able and willing to forward your e-mail. Just a note, if you're contacting someone in Japan, it's highly recommended that at least your intro be in Japanese. Even if your intended recipient understands English, the person you ask to forward your e-mail might not. For your benefit, here's a quick intro you can prepend to any e-mail you send to Japan (replaces the blanks by the name of the person you are trying to contact): ご担当者様へ お世話になっております。 本社は____様にご連絡を取りたがっています。お手数ですが、このメールを____様へ転送して頂けないでしょうか? 宜しくお願いします。  Literally: To whom it may concern/the person in charge: Thank you for your time. We are trying to contact _____. If it isn't too much trouble, could you forward this e-mail to ____? Thank you very much.    Can you send me your catalog? We don't have a catalog, we don't sell anything.  Where can I buy Anime ? You can buy it at retail movie stores like Blockbuster and Suncoast as well as specialty Anime Shops. You can also buy it online at websites like Anime Castle, Anime Nation, J List, Roberts Anime Corner Store and The Right Stuf International.  Where can I download anime or watch it online? For the most part, you can't legally download anime online. Fansubs are generally illegal (whether or not they're unethical is a completely different topic), and as such, we can't help you obtain them. You might want to check the sites listed below, and read our news, when there's legal anime to download or watched online we generally mention it.  Don't ask us where to get bootlegs or fansubs, we won't tell you.  Some sites/services that allow you to download or watch anime online legally(may or may not be free):  Amazon Prime crunchyroll Funimation's Website HiDive Apple iTunes hulu Netflix Viz Anime  * Why isn't YouTube listed? Because a lot of the content on YouTube is illegally uploaded. One day we'll have an index of legal anime on YouTube, but until then we aren't listing it as a site where all content is legal/authorized.   How do I watch anime on ANN? ANN has stopped streaming anime episodes. Go to the websites above!  Can you help me with my school assignment No. We get this question about once a week, and we don't really want to spend 25 hours a year answering school questions. The worst part is that most people who e-mail us are actually asking us to provide information they could find with a little bit of research, in other words, they're asking us to do their work for them. On the other hand, if you're working on a master's project or PhD thesis related to anime, that interests us, so we'd probably be more than happy to help.  Does ANN offer Internships? Yes, Anime News Network offers internships in our newsroom and our web-development departments. Further details are available here   What happened to ANN UK? In late May the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into effect. The EU determined that any website targeting European readers would be ""doing business in Europe."" Anime News Network does not disagree with this conclusion. Unfortunately, the GDPR requires all websites doing business in Europe to meet a stringent set of privacy regulations. While ANN supports the intent of these regulations, some of them are extremely difficult to comply with. While it is our intention, for the benefit of all readers our readers around the world, to comply with these new standards, we are not able to do so immediately. Once we are fully compliant with GDPR requirements, we will re-launch ANN UK. In the meantime, ANN's global edition is available to all readers worldwide and is the default version for readers outside of North America, Australia, New Zealand and South East Asia.             bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Misc Page homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature                The Best and Worst of Winter 2022   Apr  6, 10:10                 anime    With the last few episodes trailing into Spring like an April's fool, it's time to look at the final ranking of the Winter 2022 season.

Anime News Network was created as a news source that focuses on the medium of Japanese Animation(anime) and Japanese Comics (manga). ANN was founded by Justin Sevakis in July of 1998, and has since lead the online anime news medium with a tradition of strong unbiased coverage of major breaking news. With in-depth coverage, analysis and commentary to provide insight into the world of anime and manga, ANN has been and continues to be the #1 English language source for anime and manga news on the Internet. ANN's goal is to make the latest, most comprehensive Anime news available to new fans and veteran Otaku alike.  What ANN is not:  A television network or station; A subsidiary of another company; A dubbing / voice recording studio; An animation company; A licensing or distribution company; A manufacturer or distributor of merchandise; For sale.

ANN is operated by a team of people, under the guidance of Christopher Macdonald, Daniel DeLorme, Zac Bertschy, Egan Loo and Hori Shinsuke. A full list of the staff can be found on the staff page.   Who owns ANN? The website is owned by Anime News Network Inc., a privately owned corporation. The corporation's shareholders include: Christopher Macdonald (Minority owner, controlling shareholder), Hori Shinsuke (Minority owner), Anime Consortium Japan (Minority owner), others.   Where is ANN based? Wow, that question is so 1999! ANN is based everywhere and nowhere. We're based on the Internet! We don't have an office; our staff all work at home and are based around the world with the most full-time staff based in Japan and the United States. Anime News Network, Inc. the corporation that maintains ANN is a Canadian corporation.  Who is the mascot? When the site was first launched in 1998 it featured a blond-haired mascot named Jadress, created by Robin Sevakis. She was eventually replaced by Nina, who was featured in a webcomic (also created by Robin Sevakis) that ran from 2007 to 2013.  How often do you update? The site is run on a daily content format, as opposed to a monthly or bi-monthly magazine format. We update the news and reviews daily, and other content, such as features, columns, and editorials are also added throughout the week. Our encyclopedia is updated daily as well.  Under what settings is ANN best viewed? The site uses a responsive design that should look good at any resolution, from smartphones to large desktop screens.  How do I find older articles on ANN? Links to archives for news, features, columns, reviews, etc. can be found in their respective sections in the menu. You can also use the search engine.  What was used to make the site, as well as maintain it? The site is a combination of older parts in PHP and newer parts in Ruby, with a MySQL database to manage the content. Apart from the phpBB forum, we haven't used any pre-made packages; all the content is managed and presented with custom software.  How do I get permission to reprint an ANN Story, or obtain an ANN graphic or photo? ANN has a newsfeed program where you can get the latest anime news headlines on your very own website. If you wish to entirely reprint anything on your site please contact the editors. For more details about what you can and can not re-print with or without our permission, see our copyright statement.  How many people hear or read an ANN story? We get a bit over 200,000 visits every day. In addition to regular visitors, ANN's news is often sourced in print and occasionally on the airwaves.  How can I get in touch with the staff? Visit our contact page or visit our staff page for further contact and personal information. If a member's e-mail address is not there you can send your comments to the editors and we'll forward them.  Do you attend any public events? Yes. ANN tries to provide coverage to as many anime conventions/festivals/symposiums as our staff can manage. For more details on this see our events section and our events forum.  Do you have a newsfeed? You really should have an RSS newsfeed! Look at our newsfeed section for links to various RSS & Atom feeds as well as our custom newsfeed program. Submitting Content  How should I submit news ? Send an e-mail to [email protected] , this e-mail address is regularly monitored by several staff (someone is always ""on duty""). Other methods (e-mail directly to staff, PM, Forum, Twitter, etc...) are less reliable, and may lead to delays and/or a complete failure to notice your submission.  I have something to say about an online petition. Stop. Virtually every e-petition is a waste of time.   I submitted a news item, why wasn't it posted? We could still be in the process of verifying the details, we may not have been able to verify the items, or perhaps we didn't find it newsworthy enough to post. On a ""slow"" news day we're more likely to post less significant items.  I submitted a news item, why was it credited to someone else? They either submitted it first--or more importantly--submitted more information.  Can I submit news about a non-Japanese animation? No. We're Anime News Network, not ""Animation News Network"", not ""Asian Animation Network."" There's plenty of good animation from around the world, including Korea and China, but we only cover Japanese animation, not French, Mexican, Chinese, African, Korean or Afghanistanimation.  Can I submit a review? / How do I become a reviewer? Anime News Network does not accept unsolicited reviews. Take a quick look at the Staff Openings page, if there is an opening, it will be mentioned there. More often than not, we hire experienced writers who are known to us. Best piece of advice we can give is to make a name for yourself then we'll come to you when the time is right.  Can I submit an article? If you are an experienced writer/journalist with a portfolio you can point to, please E-mail the editors and ask about the topic, we'd be glad to consider your article idea.  Can I have a column? No. Only previous, regular contributors who have shown an ability to consistently write timely, quality articles (or reviews) are permitted to write columns. Try submitting some articles or reviews first.  Information X is missing from the Encyclopedia, can you add it? We can't add it, but YOU can. The Encyclopedia is a user-contributed database; it's made specially so that you can add missing information by yourself. You just need a user account. So please do take the time to register and submit the information you found was missing. Each page contains pointers about how to add information, and if that's not enough you can check the Encyclopedia FAQ or the memoranda.  How can I contribute to the encyclopedia? Any registered user can contribute standard data to the Encyclopedia for Anime, Manga and People. But if that's not enough for you and you're near the top of the contributors list and you'd like to help out with the releases, lexicon, or editing and verifying data submitted by other people, please contact the Encyclopedist.  Please note, that we'll be looking for someone who is inputting quality data, not just large amounts of data.   What if I want to contribute in some other way? We always appreciate whatever help and support that readers can give. If you'd like to help out at ANN in a way other than the ones described above, please contact the editors. There's so much to do at ANN that we're very appreciative of any help offered.   My company is making Anime, can you post a news article about it? Sorry, too many companies are trying to cash in on the popularity of Anime by making cartoons with big eyes and purple hair. We're sure you aren't like that, but... well actually, we aren't sure.  Why doesn't Anime News Network review world manga? Please see our definition of manga. It is Anime News Network's official position, and the personal belief of many of our staff, than there is nothing inheritently superior about Japanese manga when compared to world manga. However Anime News Network's purpose is to cover Japanese animation and comic books. Currently we do not have the resources to review all the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America. If and when we are able to review 100% of the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America, we will then consider expanding our area of review coverage to include manga-style comics (world manga) that originate outside of Japan.  Why didn't you post a news article about my (company's) new Anime or Manga? If your item is picked up in a distribution deal by a company that isn't being run out of someone's garage, then maybe its newsworthy. So when that happens, give us a shout, and we'll consider it, but if you can't tell us what makes your creation manga or anime (other than big eyes, purple hair and the like) you can pretty much forget it.  May I send you my company's product to review? If it's anime or manga-related, then yes. Contact editors[at]animenewsnetwork.com for shipping information.  I'm starting a new webmanga, is it news? No, there are a billion and one ""webmangas"", and most only last a couple of months. Now, if your webmanga gets licensed by a publisher... that might be news.  Can you mention my site? Only if you do something newsworthy, sorry.  Why have we been blacklisted? ANN has a 2-strikes rule regarding inappropriate PR. After 2 strikes for the following reasons we will blacklist your company or PR firm (when we blacklist a PR firm, we notify their relevant clients). i) Completely irrelevant PR that has nothing to do with anime, manga, Japanese pop-culture or any other related content; ii) Unauthorized stealth marketing on our forums; iii) Harassing our staff; iv) Continued PR submissions to inappropriate e-mail address. v) Any attempt to illicitly influence editorial We'll send you a link to this post after your first offense. After your second offense you'll never hear from us again (and our readers will never hear from you or your clients).  Isn't this a bit harsh? Perhaps, but we're tired of getting PRs for toilets, accounting firm management changes and World War 2 museums.   But we offer an opt-out! Clicking that link might opt us out of all your press releases, including your relevant ones. It would be the same as blacklisting you, without giving you the warning. Showing you this warning is actually less harsh than clicking your opt-out.  Forum / Account  I didn't receive my forum registration. If you are using a spam filter, please check your spam folder, some mail servers catch the registration code as spam. Search your spamfolder & inbox for e-mail from [email protected] or [email protected]. If you are using any sort of white list, please make sure that your e-mail account is set up to accept e-mails from [email protected] and [email protected]. If you are using a mail service that bounces the e-mail back to the sender and asks them to confirm that it is not spam, we will not do that. These services usually allow you to add the e-mail address to a white-list before hand. Once you have checked all of the above, you can have the server re-send you your activation code by going here. It should be instant, but sometimes e-mail is slow, give it a couple hours (the slowness is usually not because of our server). If you still don't get your activation code, then and ONLY then, e-mail us at [email protected] make sure that: 1) Your e-mail is sent from the e-mail address you submitted to ANN; 2) You include your user name; 3) Do not send us your password; 4) The subject of your e-mail must be ""activation code"".   How do I become a moderator? You're invited. When we feel there is a need for a new moderator, we look at our best forum users (the ones that contribute intelligently to conversation and act maturely) and ask them if they'd be willing to help us moderate the forum.  Will there ever be an off topic / general conversation forum among the forums? Not in the public areas, no. We do however maintain a community section for subscribers, and off-topic discussion is permitted there.  Why aren't my posts showing up? Posts from new users sometimes take a while to show up. Please be patient, they should appear within a few hours. Believe it or not, this is a ""feature"" not a ""bug.""  Is there a set of forum rules? Right here - read them if you haven't already.  Help, I've been banned or moderated! Read this.  How do I attach a picture (avatar) to my account? Read this.  Can I change my user name? You can make changes in your user account settings. But because other users depend on your username to recognize you, we have a ""no identity switcheroos"" policy: once you start using the forum we do not allow changes to your username beyond punctuation and capitalization.  Can I delete my account? Yes, you can. Go to your account settings page and you will be able to delete your account from there. Contests  Can I enter give-aways more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No.  Can I enter creative contests more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, Yes.  Does ANN ""own"" my entry? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No. But as a condition of your entry we generaly require you to give us the unrevocable right to display your entry on Anime News Network for all eternity.  Can I display my entry elsewhere? Yes, anywhere you please, unless otherwise stated in the contest rules.  Why do I have to put your logo and/or the sponsor's logo on my submission There are two reasons for this. First, it adds some extra benefit to the contest sponsors and second, it helps us insure that you made the entry for the contest, instead of just grabing some existing art and submiting it.  Explain those rules about where I live and whether or not I can enter and if you will ship me a prize. Most of our contest are open to anyone, regardless of where you live, because we don't believe in geographic discrimination. However sometimes our sponsors want a contest to only be open to their potential clients, so in those cases we have no choice to abide by their request to limit contest entry to a certain geographic area. While we don't believe in geographic discrimination, we also don't believe in spending a fortune on shipping and trying to figure out custom laws in order to get you your prize so that's why we only ship to the USA and Canada.   What does a complete mailing address look like? Short answer: ""It's what we need to put on a package to mail it to you."" It looks something like this:  416 William St. #402 Moralton, SS 70707 USA 24 Sussex Dr Ottawa, ON  K1A 0A3 Canada 1000 J.P. Laurel St. San Miguel 1005, Manila  Philippines   You'd be amazed at how many people enter our contests and leave out critical mailing information like their city, province/state and or postal/zip code. You'd also be amazed at how many people ask us ""What do you mean by complete mailing address?"" In fact, if you're reading this, it's quite possible that we referred you here because you asked that very question. Since we usually only ship to the USA and Canada, we won't disqualify you for leaving out the country, but if anything else is missing, we'll just pick another winner to replace you. We will not contact you to verify your mailing address. BTW, your name is not part of your mailing address, but we won't disqualify you for putting it in there...  Why do some contests not ship to PO Boxes? ANN usually doesn't handle shipping for our contest prizes. Shipping is done by the contest sponsor. If the contest states ""no PO boxes"" this is because our sponsor requested it. Most likely it is because they are shipping via a courier like UPS, which will not ship to PO boxes.  I'd really prefer it if you didn't post my name & city if I win This is done for legal reasons, sorry. That said, if you want to enter with an alias, that's fine as long as you are certain the package will reach you (we can't guarantee it will).  Why did you stop accepting art contest entries from Facebook By default, Facebook posts usually aren't public. Most people who submit Facebook URLs to our art contests forget to share their entries publicly, and we are often forced to disqualify these entries. It's better to just avoid the problem altogether. If you want to enter with Facebook, and you remember to make your entry public go ahead, we'll accept it. But if you forget to share it properly, we will simply ignore your entry.   Miscellaneous   Can I link to you? Yes, please feel free. Currently we don't have any banners to offer you for this, we'll be making some new ones shortly.  Can you link to me? No. We are not a link exchange site.  Wait, I can link to you, but you won't link to me?? Yes, we know it sounds a little conceited of us, but that's how it is. To be fair, we don't expect you to link to us, but we're honored if you do decide that you'd like to link to our site despite the fact that we won't be returning the favor. Please don't link to us if you're only doing it because you hope to get something in return; link to us because you feel that you want more people to know about Anime News Network.   Can we trade banners? Sorry, ANN relies on its banners to survive. We very seldom trade banners with another website or publication. If your publication is in print (10 000+ circulation) or a website with 10 million+ impressions per month, we may consider it. Please understand, ANN receives this question at least once a week, it isn't possible for us to even consider swapping / affiliating with so many sites, so we generally don't swap / affiliate with any.  Can you affiliate with us? Anime News Network would be happy to setup an affiliate program with any online store that pays referral fees provided that store meets certain pre-requisites. Anime News Network is unfortunately unable to affiliate itself with fan-sites much for the same reason that we can not link to you or trade banners with you (see above two entries).  Why'd you give this show a rating of ... in your review? Clearly it deserved a ... ! Obviously our reviewer disagrees.  When is title X coming out, how many episodes is it, and/or who is releasing it? Look it up in the encyclopedia, ask Answerman, or ask in the forum.  Why'd you make X change to the programming on [Cartoon Network, YTV, etc]? Uhh, try contacting the broadcaster, network or station. We're a news site and we have no more control over the schedule at [TV Station] than any other media source. Yes, believe it or not we get this question every so often.  I'd like to license, work on, be involved with, etc... one of your titles Just like we aren't involved in TV broadcasting, we are not licensors. Even for shows that we stream on ANN, we are not authorized to sub-license them to other companies. Contact the producers or the licensors, not us.  I'd like permission to do something with one of your titles Sorry, we do not control copyright permissions for any anime or manga. If you need permission to do something, contact the local licensee / master licensor; or failing that, contact the master licensor in Japan. A bit of advice though, for personal, non commercial projects, don't bother contacting them unless you absolutely need permission. They don't care if you make a 1-off t-shirt to wear to school, but if you ask them, they'll probably say ""No,"" as a matter of policy. Sorry we can not help you get in contact with a rights holder.  Why'd you take my video show off YouTube? We get this question a lot. We didn't take your video down. See the above answer as well as the first one. ANN has no involvement in the process of taking pirated materials off of websites like YouTube. For your information, the material was probably taken down because it was uploaded without permission (therefore illegally) and the licensors want you to watch it somewhere they will make money (on DVD, on TV, or on an authorized website). Go here for a list of places where you can legally watch anime and support the creators at the same time.  On a related note, allow us to point out that your video was probably automatically removed by a technology called video-fingerprinting. By this semi-automated process, YouTube removes videos that it believes infringe on copyrights without waiting for complaints from copyright holders. So it's quite possible that no anime company was involved in the removal of your video.   Sadly, this process can affect videos that are legitimate ""fair-use."" Even more sadly, the employees at the anime companies are too busy to bother reading all the e-mails they get about videos (the vast majority of are from morons that don't understand that ""I wasn't making money"" doesn't make it okay) so you can e-mail them to your hearts content, but they probably won't answer (not because they're fan-hating assholes, but because they don't have the time).    If you believe your video is legitimate fair-use (full episodes are never fair use, significant episode clips are rarely fair use, AMVs are almost never fair use of the music) try posting it again and include in the description why you feel it is fair use. If you're lucky, YouTube will take this into consideration (some videos are deleted automatically, others are looked at by a human employee at YouTube after the fingerprinting process identifies them) and not delete your video. You really should read up on ""fair use"" before you make any claims that your video is fair use though. And by ""read-up,"" we mean read professional, expert explanations, not your friend's blog.   I have a great idea for an anime or manga, where do I submit it? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not involved with the creation process of any anime or manga and we can not put you in contact with creators (more on that here). Finally, we'd recommend you read this and this.  How do I get your television channel? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not The Anime Network (TAN). For details on TAN, read the transcript of our chat with them, read our TAN news coverage, or visit their website.  Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? No. As a policy, ANN never gives out contact information. Don't send us this question unless you've exhausted every other resource available (phone book, 411, Google, their website, etc...), even then, we will only forward your request to them, and we will only do so provided it is a business-to-business request being made by a company we've actually heard of. If you can't find Hayao Miyazaki's e-mail address online, it's probably because he doesn't want to receive a thousand e-mails a day. The one exception to this rule is that we will give out the Public Relations / Press Relations (PR) contact information for a company provided we have it readily available. Generally you can find this information on your own though, so please don't be lazy. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? I'm an old acquaintance of theirs. The answer is still no. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? They worked on one of your projects. Just to be clear, our encyclopedia carries information about a myriad of projects (anime,manga, etc...) most of which (99.9%) Anime News Network is not, and never was, involved with. It is not a list of our projects. So if the person actually worked for ANN, please see this answer, but if they are one of the 67023+ people listed in the encyclopedia, they probably didn't work for us and therefore the previous two answers apply. Okay, I understand, you can't or won't put me in contact with them, but I really want/need to contact this person. Can you offer any suggestions on how to proceed? Depending on who you're trying to contact, they might have a fanclub, official webpage, or e-mail address listed in their encyclopedia entry. If not, try looking for the latest production they worked on and contacting the production company, they might be able and willing to forward your e-mail. Just a note, if you're contacting someone in Japan, it's highly recommended that at least your intro be in Japanese. Even if your intended recipient understands English, the person you ask to forward your e-mail might not. For your benefit, here's a quick intro you can prepend to any e-mail you send to Japan (replaces the blanks by the name of the person you are trying to contact): ご担当者様へ お世話になっております。 本社は____様にご連絡を取りたがっています。お手数ですが、このメールを____様へ転送して頂けないでしょうか? 宜しくお願いします。  Literally: To whom it may concern/the person in charge: Thank you for your time. We are trying to contact _____. If it isn't too much trouble, could you forward this e-mail to ____? Thank you very much.    Can you send me your catalog? We don't have a catalog, we don't sell anything.  Where can I buy Anime ? You can buy it at retail movie stores like Blockbuster and Suncoast as well as specialty Anime Shops. You can also buy it online at websites like Anime Castle, Anime Nation, J List, Roberts Anime Corner Store and The Right Stuf International.  Where can I download anime or watch it online? For the most part, you can't legally download anime online. Fansubs are generally illegal (whether or not they're unethical is a completely different topic), and as such, we can't help you obtain them. You might want to check the sites listed below, and read our news, when there's legal anime to download or watched online we generally mention it.  Don't ask us where to get bootlegs or fansubs, we won't tell you.  Some sites/services that allow you to download or watch anime online legally(may or may not be free):  Amazon Prime crunchyroll Funimation's Website HiDive Apple iTunes hulu Netflix Viz Anime  * Why isn't YouTube listed? Because a lot of the content on YouTube is illegally uploaded. One day we'll have an index of legal anime on YouTube, but until then we aren't listing it as a site where all content is legal/authorized.   How do I watch anime on ANN? ANN has stopped streaming anime episodes. Go to the websites above!  Can you help me with my school assignment No. We get this question about once a week, and we don't really want to spend 25 hours a year answering school questions. The worst part is that most people who e-mail us are actually asking us to provide information they could find with a little bit of research, in other words, they're asking us to do their work for them. On the other hand, if you're working on a master's project or PhD thesis related to anime, that interests us, so we'd probably be more than happy to help.  Does ANN offer Internships? Yes, Anime News Network offers internships in our newsroom and our web-development departments. Further details are available here   What happened to ANN UK? In late May the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into effect. The EU determined that any website targeting European readers would be ""doing business in Europe."" Anime News Network does not disagree with this conclusion. Unfortunately, the GDPR requires all websites doing business in Europe to meet a stringent set of privacy regulations. While ANN supports the intent of these regulations, some of them are extremely difficult to comply with. While it is our intention, for the benefit of all readers our readers around the world, to comply with these new standards, we are not able to do so immediately. Once we are fully compliant with GDPR requirements, we will re-launch ANN UK. In the meantime, ANN's global edition is available to all readers worldwide and is the default version for readers outside of North America, Australia, New Zealand and South East Asia.             bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Misc Page homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature                The Best and Worst of Winter 2022   Apr  6, 10:10                 anime    With the last few episodes trailing into Spring like an April's fool, it's time to look at the final ranking of the Winter 2022 season.

Does ANN offer Internships? What happened to ANN UK?    About ANN  What is Anime News Network (ANN)? Anime News Network was created as a news source that focuses on the medium of Japanese Animation(anime) and Japanese Comics (manga). ANN was founded by Justin Sevakis in July of 1998, and has since lead the online anime news medium with a tradition of strong unbiased coverage of major breaking news. With in-depth coverage, analysis and commentary to provide insight into the world of anime and manga, ANN has been and continues to be the #1 English language source for anime and manga news on the Internet. ANN's goal is to make the latest, most comprehensive Anime news available to new fans and veteran Otaku alike.  What ANN is not:  A television network or station; A subsidiary of another company; A dubbing / voice recording studio; An animation company; A licensing or distribution company; A manufacturer or distributor of merchandise; For sale.    What is anime? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of anime, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, anime is animation that is primarily produced and conceived in Japan. This includes animation conceived in Japan that has portions outsourced to other countries, but does not include animation primarily produced outside Japan and with the animation outsourced to Japan. It does however include animation that is co-conceived inside and outside of Japan and at least partially produced inside Japan.  What is manga? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of manga, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, manga are comic books or strips that are produced and conceived in Japan. This includes include comics that are co-conceived inside and outside of Japan but produced in Japan.  Who operates ANN? ANN is operated by a team of people, under the guidance of Christopher Macdonald, Daniel DeLorme, Zac Bertschy, Egan Loo and Hori Shinsuke. A full list of the staff can be found on the staff page.   Who owns ANN? The website is owned by Anime News Network Inc., a privately owned corporation. The corporation's shareholders include: Christopher Macdonald (Minority owner, controlling shareholder), Hori Shinsuke (Minority owner), Anime Consortium Japan (Minority owner), others.   Where is ANN based? Wow, that question is so 1999! ANN is based everywhere and nowhere. We're based on the Internet! We don't have an office; our staff all work at home and are based around the world with the most full-time staff based in Japan and the United States. Anime News Network, Inc. the corporation that maintains ANN is a Canadian corporation.  Who is the mascot? When the site was first launched in 1998 it featured a blond-haired mascot named Jadress, created by Robin Sevakis. She was eventually replaced by Nina, who was featured in a webcomic (also created by Robin Sevakis) that ran from 2007 to 2013.  How often do you update? The site is run on a daily content format, as opposed to a monthly or bi-monthly magazine format. We update the news and reviews daily, and other content, such as features, columns, and editorials are also added throughout the week. Our encyclopedia is updated daily as well.  Under what settings is ANN best viewed? The site uses a responsive design that should look good at any resolution, from smartphones to large desktop screens.  How do I find older articles on ANN? Links to archives for news, features, columns, reviews, etc. can be found in their respective sections in the menu. You can also use the search engine.  What was used to make the site, as well as maintain it? The site is a combination of older parts in PHP and newer parts in Ruby, with a MySQL database to manage the content. Apart from the phpBB forum, we haven't used any pre-made packages; all the content is managed and presented with custom software.  How do I get permission to reprint an ANN Story, or obtain an ANN graphic or photo? ANN has a newsfeed program where you can get the latest anime news headlines on your very own website. If you wish to entirely reprint anything on your site please contact the editors. For more details about what you can and can not re-print with or without our permission, see our copyright statement.  How many people hear or read an ANN story? We get a bit over 200,000 visits every day. In addition to regular visitors, ANN's news is often sourced in print and occasionally on the airwaves.  How can I get in touch with the staff? Visit our contact page or visit our staff page for further contact and personal information. If a member's e-mail address is not there you can send your comments to the editors and we'll forward them.  Do you attend any public events? Yes. ANN tries to provide coverage to as many anime conventions/festivals/symposiums as our staff can manage. For more details on this see our events section and our events forum.  Do you have a newsfeed? You really should have an RSS newsfeed! Look at our newsfeed section for links to various RSS & Atom feeds as well as our custom newsfeed program. Submitting Content  How should I submit news ? Send an e-mail to [email protected] , this e-mail address is regularly monitored by several staff (someone is always ""on duty""). Other methods (e-mail directly to staff, PM, Forum, Twitter, etc...) are less reliable, and may lead to delays and/or a complete failure to notice your submission.  I have something to say about an online petition. Stop. Virtually every e-petition is a waste of time.   I submitted a news item, why wasn't it posted? We could still be in the process of verifying the details, we may not have been able to verify the items, or perhaps we didn't find it newsworthy enough to post. On a ""slow"" news day we're more likely to post less significant items.  I submitted a news item, why was it credited to someone else? They either submitted it first--or more importantly--submitted more information.  Can I submit news about a non-Japanese animation? No. We're Anime News Network, not ""Animation News Network"", not ""Asian Animation Network."" There's plenty of good animation from around the world, including Korea and China, but we only cover Japanese animation, not French, Mexican, Chinese, African, Korean or Afghanistanimation.  Can I submit a review? / How do I become a reviewer? Anime News Network does not accept unsolicited reviews. Take a quick look at the Staff Openings page, if there is an opening, it will be mentioned there. More often than not, we hire experienced writers who are known to us. Best piece of advice we can give is to make a name for yourself then we'll come to you when the time is right.  Can I submit an article? If you are an experienced writer/journalist with a portfolio you can point to, please E-mail the editors and ask about the topic, we'd be glad to consider your article idea.  Can I have a column? No. Only previous, regular contributors who have shown an ability to consistently write timely, quality articles (or reviews) are permitted to write columns. Try submitting some articles or reviews first.  Information X is missing from the Encyclopedia, can you add it? We can't add it, but YOU can. The Encyclopedia is a user-contributed database; it's made specially so that you can add missing information by yourself. You just need a user account. So please do take the time to register and submit the information you found was missing. Each page contains pointers about how to add information, and if that's not enough you can check the Encyclopedia FAQ or the memoranda.  How can I contribute to the encyclopedia? Any registered user can contribute standard data to the Encyclopedia for Anime, Manga and People. But if that's not enough for you and you're near the top of the contributors list and you'd like to help out with the releases, lexicon, or editing and verifying data submitted by other people, please contact the Encyclopedist.  Please note, that we'll be looking for someone who is inputting quality data, not just large amounts of data.   What if I want to contribute in some other way? We always appreciate whatever help and support that readers can give. If you'd like to help out at ANN in a way other than the ones described above, please contact the editors. There's so much to do at ANN that we're very appreciative of any help offered.   My company is making Anime, can you post a news article about it? Sorry, too many companies are trying to cash in on the popularity of Anime by making cartoons with big eyes and purple hair. We're sure you aren't like that, but... well actually, we aren't sure.  Why doesn't Anime News Network review world manga? Please see our definition of manga. It is Anime News Network's official position, and the personal belief of many of our staff, than there is nothing inheritently superior about Japanese manga when compared to world manga. However Anime News Network's purpose is to cover Japanese animation and comic books. Currently we do not have the resources to review all the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America. If and when we are able to review 100% of the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America, we will then consider expanding our area of review coverage to include manga-style comics (world manga) that originate outside of Japan.  Why didn't you post a news article about my (company's) new Anime or Manga? If your item is picked up in a distribution deal by a company that isn't being run out of someone's garage, then maybe its newsworthy. So when that happens, give us a shout, and we'll consider it, but if you can't tell us what makes your creation manga or anime (other than big eyes, purple hair and the like) you can pretty much forget it.  May I send you my company's product to review? If it's anime or manga-related, then yes. Contact editors[at]animenewsnetwork.com for shipping information.  I'm starting a new webmanga, is it news? No, there are a billion and one ""webmangas"", and most only last a couple of months. Now, if your webmanga gets licensed by a publisher... that might be news.  Can you mention my site? Only if you do something newsworthy, sorry.  Why have we been blacklisted? ANN has a 2-strikes rule regarding inappropriate PR. After 2 strikes for the following reasons we will blacklist your company or PR firm (when we blacklist a PR firm, we notify their relevant clients). i) Completely irrelevant PR that has nothing to do with anime, manga, Japanese pop-culture or any other related content; ii) Unauthorized stealth marketing on our forums; iii) Harassing our staff; iv) Continued PR submissions to inappropriate e-mail address. v) Any attempt to illicitly influence editorial We'll send you a link to this post after your first offense. After your second offense you'll never hear from us again (and our readers will never hear from you or your clients).  Isn't this a bit harsh? Perhaps, but we're tired of getting PRs for toilets, accounting firm management changes and World War 2 museums.   But we offer an opt-out! Clicking that link might opt us out of all your press releases, including your relevant ones. It would be the same as blacklisting you, without giving you the warning. Showing you this warning is actually less harsh than clicking your opt-out.  Forum / Account  I didn't receive my forum registration. If you are using a spam filter, please check your spam folder, some mail servers catch the registration code as spam. Search your spamfolder & inbox for e-mail from [email protected] or [email protected]. If you are using any sort of white list, please make sure that your e-mail account is set up to accept e-mails from [email protected] and [email protected]. If you are using a mail service that bounces the e-mail back to the sender and asks them to confirm that it is not spam, we will not do that. These services usually allow you to add the e-mail address to a white-list before hand. Once you have checked all of the above, you can have the server re-send you your activation code by going here. It should be instant, but sometimes e-mail is slow, give it a couple hours (the slowness is usually not because of our server). If you still don't get your activation code, then and ONLY then, e-mail us at [email protected] make sure that: 1) Your e-mail is sent from the e-mail address you submitted to ANN; 2) You include your user name; 3) Do not send us your password; 4) The subject of your e-mail must be ""activation code"".   How do I become a moderator? You're invited. When we feel there is a need for a new moderator, we look at our best forum users (the ones that contribute intelligently to conversation and act maturely) and ask them if they'd be willing to help us moderate the forum.  Will there ever be an off topic / general conversation forum among the forums? Not in the public areas, no. We do however maintain a community section for subscribers, and off-topic discussion is permitted there.  Why aren't my posts showing up? Posts from new users sometimes take a while to show up. Please be patient, they should appear within a few hours. Believe it or not, this is a ""feature"" not a ""bug.""  Is there a set of forum rules? Right here - read them if you haven't already.  Help, I've been banned or moderated! Read this.  How do I attach a picture (avatar) to my account? Read this.  Can I change my user name? You can make changes in your user account settings. But because other users depend on your username to recognize you, we have a ""no identity switcheroos"" policy: once you start using the forum we do not allow changes to your username beyond punctuation and capitalization.  Can I delete my account? Yes, you can. Go to your account settings page and you will be able to delete your account from there. Contests  Can I enter give-aways more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No.  Can I enter creative contests more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, Yes.  Does ANN ""own"" my entry? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No. But as a condition of your entry we generaly require you to give us the unrevocable right to display your entry on Anime News Network for all eternity.  Can I display my entry elsewhere? Yes, anywhere you please, unless otherwise stated in the contest rules.  Why do I have to put your logo and/or the sponsor's logo on my submission There are two reasons for this. First, it adds some extra benefit to the contest sponsors and second, it helps us insure that you made the entry for the contest, instead of just grabing some existing art and submiting it.  Explain those rules about where I live and whether or not I can enter and if you will ship me a prize. Most of our contest are open to anyone, regardless of where you live, because we don't believe in geographic discrimination. However sometimes our sponsors want a contest to only be open to their potential clients, so in those cases we have no choice to abide by their request to limit contest entry to a certain geographic area. While we don't believe in geographic discrimination, we also don't believe in spending a fortune on shipping and trying to figure out custom laws in order to get you your prize so that's why we only ship to the USA and Canada.   What does a complete mailing address look like? Short answer: ""It's what we need to put on a package to mail it to you."" It looks something like this:  416 William St. #402 Moralton, SS 70707 USA 24 Sussex Dr Ottawa, ON  K1A 0A3 Canada 1000 J.P. Laurel St. San Miguel 1005, Manila  Philippines   You'd be amazed at how many people enter our contests and leave out critical mailing information like their city, province/state and or postal/zip code. You'd also be amazed at how many people ask us ""What do you mean by complete mailing address?"" In fact, if you're reading this, it's quite possible that we referred you here because you asked that very question. Since we usually only ship to the USA and Canada, we won't disqualify you for leaving out the country, but if anything else is missing, we'll just pick another winner to replace you. We will not contact you to verify your mailing address. BTW, your name is not part of your mailing address, but we won't disqualify you for putting it in there...  Why do some contests not ship to PO Boxes? ANN usually doesn't handle shipping for our contest prizes. Shipping is done by the contest sponsor. If the contest states ""no PO boxes"" this is because our sponsor requested it. Most likely it is because they are shipping via a courier like UPS, which will not ship to PO boxes.  I'd really prefer it if you didn't post my name & city if I win This is done for legal reasons, sorry. That said, if you want to enter with an alias, that's fine as long as you are certain the package will reach you (we can't guarantee it will).  Why did you stop accepting art contest entries from Facebook By default, Facebook posts usually aren't public. Most people who submit Facebook URLs to our art contests forget to share their entries publicly, and we are often forced to disqualify these entries. It's better to just avoid the problem altogether. If you want to enter with Facebook, and you remember to make your entry public go ahead, we'll accept it. But if you forget to share it properly, we will simply ignore your entry.   Miscellaneous   Can I link to you? Yes, please feel free. Currently we don't have any banners to offer you for this, we'll be making some new ones shortly.  Can you link to me? No. We are not a link exchange site.  Wait, I can link to you, but you won't link to me?? Yes, we know it sounds a little conceited of us, but that's how it is. To be fair, we don't expect you to link to us, but we're honored if you do decide that you'd like to link to our site despite the fact that we won't be returning the favor. Please don't link to us if you're only doing it because you hope to get something in return; link to us because you feel that you want more people to know about Anime News Network.   Can we trade banners? Sorry, ANN relies on its banners to survive. We very seldom trade banners with another website or publication. If your publication is in print (10 000+ circulation) or a website with 10 million+ impressions per month, we may consider it. Please understand, ANN receives this question at least once a week, it isn't possible for us to even consider swapping / affiliating with so many sites, so we generally don't swap / affiliate with any.  Can you affiliate with us? Anime News Network would be happy to setup an affiliate program with any online store that pays referral fees provided that store meets certain pre-requisites. Anime News Network is unfortunately unable to affiliate itself with fan-sites much for the same reason that we can not link to you or trade banners with you (see above two entries).  Why'd you give this show a rating of ... in your review? Clearly it deserved a ... ! Obviously our reviewer disagrees.  When is title X coming out, how many episodes is it, and/or who is releasing it? Look it up in the encyclopedia, ask Answerman, or ask in the forum.  Why'd you make X change to the programming on [Cartoon Network, YTV, etc]? Uhh, try contacting the broadcaster, network or station. We're a news site and we have no more control over the schedule at [TV Station] than any other media source. Yes, believe it or not we get this question every so often.  I'd like to license, work on, be involved with, etc... one of your titles Just like we aren't involved in TV broadcasting, we are not licensors. Even for shows that we stream on ANN, we are not authorized to sub-license them to other companies. Contact the producers or the licensors, not us.  I'd like permission to do something with one of your titles Sorry, we do not control copyright permissions for any anime or manga. If you need permission to do something, contact the local licensee / master licensor; or failing that, contact the master licensor in Japan. A bit of advice though, for personal, non commercial projects, don't bother contacting them unless you absolutely need permission. They don't care if you make a 1-off t-shirt to wear to school, but if you ask them, they'll probably say ""No,"" as a matter of policy. Sorry we can not help you get in contact with a rights holder.  Why'd you take my video show off YouTube? We get this question a lot. We didn't take your video down. See the above answer as well as the first one. ANN has no involvement in the process of taking pirated materials off of websites like YouTube. For your information, the material was probably taken down because it was uploaded without permission (therefore illegally) and the licensors want you to watch it somewhere they will make money (on DVD, on TV, or on an authorized website). Go here for a list of places where you can legally watch anime and support the creators at the same time.  On a related note, allow us to point out that your video was probably automatically removed by a technology called video-fingerprinting. By this semi-automated process, YouTube removes videos that it believes infringe on copyrights without waiting for complaints from copyright holders. So it's quite possible that no anime company was involved in the removal of your video.   Sadly, this process can affect videos that are legitimate ""fair-use."" Even more sadly, the employees at the anime companies are too busy to bother reading all the e-mails they get about videos (the vast majority of are from morons that don't understand that ""I wasn't making money"" doesn't make it okay) so you can e-mail them to your hearts content, but they probably won't answer (not because they're fan-hating assholes, but because they don't have the time).    If you believe your video is legitimate fair-use (full episodes are never fair use, significant episode clips are rarely fair use, AMVs are almost never fair use of the music) try posting it again and include in the description why you feel it is fair use. If you're lucky, YouTube will take this into consideration (some videos are deleted automatically, others are looked at by a human employee at YouTube after the fingerprinting process identifies them) and not delete your video. You really should read up on ""fair use"" before you make any claims that your video is fair use though. And by ""read-up,"" we mean read professional, expert explanations, not your friend's blog.   I have a great idea for an anime or manga, where do I submit it? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not involved with the creation process of any anime or manga and we can not put you in contact with creators (more on that here). Finally, we'd recommend you read this and this.  How do I get your television channel? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not The Anime Network (TAN). For details on TAN, read the transcript of our chat with them, read our TAN news coverage, or visit their website.  Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? No. As a policy, ANN never gives out contact information. Don't send us this question unless you've exhausted every other resource available (phone book, 411, Google, their website, etc...), even then, we will only forward your request to them, and we will only do so provided it is a business-to-business request being made by a company we've actually heard of. If you can't find Hayao Miyazaki's e-mail address online, it's probably because he doesn't want to receive a thousand e-mails a day. The one exception to this rule is that we will give out the Public Relations / Press Relations (PR) contact information for a company provided we have it readily available. Generally you can find this information on your own though, so please don't be lazy. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? I'm an old acquaintance of theirs. The answer is still no. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? They worked on one of your projects. Just to be clear, our encyclopedia carries information about a myriad of projects (anime,manga, etc...) most of which (99.9%) Anime News Network is not, and never was, involved with. It is not a list of our projects. So if the person actually worked for ANN, please see this answer, but if they are one of the 67023+ people listed in the encyclopedia, they probably didn't work for us and therefore the previous two answers apply. Okay, I understand, you can't or won't put me in contact with them, but I really want/need to contact this person. Can you offer any suggestions on how to proceed? Depending on who you're trying to contact, they might have a fanclub, official webpage, or e-mail address listed in their encyclopedia entry. If not, try looking for the latest production they worked on and contacting the production company, they might be able and willing to forward your e-mail. Just a note, if you're contacting someone in Japan, it's highly recommended that at least your intro be in Japanese. Even if your intended recipient understands English, the person you ask to forward your e-mail might not. For your benefit, here's a quick intro you can prepend to any e-mail you send to Japan (replaces the blanks by the name of the person you are trying to contact): ご担当者様へ お世話になっております。 本社は____様にご連絡を取りたがっています。お手数ですが、このメールを____様へ転送して頂けないでしょうか? 宜しくお願いします。  Literally: To whom it may concern/the person in charge: Thank you for your time. We are trying to contact _____. If it isn't too much trouble, could you forward this e-mail to ____? Thank you very much.    Can you send me your catalog? We don't have a catalog, we don't sell anything.  Where can I buy Anime ? You can buy it at retail movie stores like Blockbuster and Suncoast as well as specialty Anime Shops. You can also buy it online at websites like Anime Castle, Anime Nation, J List, Roberts Anime Corner Store and The Right Stuf International.  Where can I download anime or watch it online? For the most part, you can't legally download anime online. Fansubs are generally illegal (whether or not they're unethical is a completely different topic), and as such, we can't help you obtain them. You might want to check the sites listed below, and read our news, when there's legal anime to download or watched online we generally mention it.  Don't ask us where to get bootlegs or fansubs, we won't tell you.  Some sites/services that allow you to download or watch anime online legally(may or may not be free):  Amazon Prime crunchyroll Funimation's Website HiDive Apple iTunes hulu Netflix Viz Anime  * Why isn't YouTube listed? Because a lot of the content on YouTube is illegally uploaded. One day we'll have an index of legal anime on YouTube, but until then we aren't listing it as a site where all content is legal/authorized.   How do I watch anime on ANN? ANN has stopped streaming anime episodes. Go to the websites above!  Can you help me with my school assignment No. We get this question about once a week, and we don't really want to spend 25 hours a year answering school questions. The worst part is that most people who e-mail us are actually asking us to provide information they could find with a little bit of research, in other words, they're asking us to do their work for them. On the other hand, if you're working on a master's project or PhD thesis related to anime, that interests us, so we'd probably be more than happy to help.  Does ANN offer Internships? Yes, Anime News Network offers internships in our newsroom and our web-development departments. Further details are available here   What happened to ANN UK? In late May the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into effect. The EU determined that any website targeting European readers would be ""doing business in Europe."" Anime News Network does not disagree with this conclusion. Unfortunately, the GDPR requires all websites doing business in Europe to meet a stringent set of privacy regulations. While ANN supports the intent of these regulations, some of them are extremely difficult to comply with. While it is our intention, for the benefit of all readers our readers around the world, to comply with these new standards, we are not able to do so immediately. Once we are fully compliant with GDPR requirements, we will re-launch ANN UK.

Anime News Network was created as a news source that focuses on the medium of Japanese Animation(anime) and Japanese Comics (manga). ANN was founded by Justin Sevakis in July of 1998, and has since lead the online anime news medium with a tradition of strong unbiased coverage of major breaking news. With in-depth coverage, analysis and commentary to provide insight into the world of anime and manga, ANN has been and continues to be the #1 English language source for anime and manga news on the Internet. ANN's goal is to make the latest, most comprehensive Anime news available to new fans and veteran Otaku alike.  What ANN is not:  A television network or station; A subsidiary of another company; A dubbing / voice recording studio; An animation company; A licensing or distribution company; A manufacturer or distributor of merchandise; For sale.    What is anime? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of anime, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, anime is animation that is primarily produced and conceived in Japan. This includes animation conceived in Japan that has portions outsourced to other countries, but does not include animation primarily produced outside Japan and with the animation outsourced to Japan. It does however include animation that is co-conceived inside and outside of Japan and at least partially produced inside Japan.  What is manga? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of manga, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, manga are comic books or strips that are produced and conceived in Japan. This includes include comics that are co-conceived inside and outside of Japan but produced in Japan.  Who operates ANN? ANN is operated by a team of people, under the guidance of Christopher Macdonald, Daniel DeLorme, Zac Bertschy, Egan Loo and Hori Shinsuke. A full list of the staff can be found on the staff page.   Who owns ANN? The website is owned by Anime News Network Inc., a privately owned corporation. The corporation's shareholders include: Christopher Macdonald (Minority owner, controlling shareholder), Hori Shinsuke (Minority owner), Anime Consortium Japan (Minority owner), others.   Where is ANN based? Wow, that question is so 1999! ANN is based everywhere and nowhere. We're based on the Internet! We don't have an office; our staff all work at home and are based around the world with the most full-time staff based in Japan and the United States. Anime News Network, Inc. the corporation that maintains ANN is a Canadian corporation.  Who is the mascot? When the site was first launched in 1998 it featured a blond-haired mascot named Jadress, created by Robin Sevakis. She was eventually replaced by Nina, who was featured in a webcomic (also created by Robin Sevakis) that ran from 2007 to 2013.  How often do you update? The site is run on a daily content format, as opposed to a monthly or bi-monthly magazine format. We update the news and reviews daily, and other content, such as features, columns, and editorials are also added throughout the week. Our encyclopedia is updated daily as well.  Under what settings is ANN best viewed? The site uses a responsive design that should look good at any resolution, from smartphones to large desktop screens.  How do I find older articles on ANN? Links to archives for news, features, columns, reviews, etc. can be found in their respective sections in the menu. You can also use the search engine.  What was used to make the site, as well as maintain it? The site is a combination of older parts in PHP and newer parts in Ruby, with a MySQL database to manage the content. Apart from the phpBB forum, we haven't used any pre-made packages; all the content is managed and presented with custom software.  How do I get permission to reprint an ANN Story, or obtain an ANN graphic or photo? ANN has a newsfeed program where you can get the latest anime news headlines on your very own website. If you wish to entirely reprint anything on your site please contact the editors. For more details about what you can and can not re-print with or without our permission, see our copyright statement.  How many people hear or read an ANN story? We get a bit over 200,000 visits every day. In addition to regular visitors, ANN's news is often sourced in print and occasionally on the airwaves.  How can I get in touch with the staff? Visit our contact page or visit our staff page for further contact and personal information. If a member's e-mail address is not there you can send your comments to the editors and we'll forward them.  Do you attend any public events? Yes. ANN tries to provide coverage to as many anime conventions/festivals/symposiums as our staff can manage. For more details on this see our events section and our events forum.  Do you have a newsfeed? You really should have an RSS newsfeed! Look at our newsfeed section for links to various RSS & Atom feeds as well as our custom newsfeed program. Submitting Content  How should I submit news ? Send an e-mail to [email protected] , this e-mail address is regularly monitored by several staff (someone is always ""on duty""). Other methods (e-mail directly to staff, PM, Forum, Twitter, etc...) are less reliable, and may lead to delays and/or a complete failure to notice your submission.  I have something to say about an online petition. Stop. Virtually every e-petition is a waste of time.   I submitted a news item, why wasn't it posted? We could still be in the process of verifying the details, we may not have been able to verify the items, or perhaps we didn't find it newsworthy enough to post. On a ""slow"" news day we're more likely to post less significant items.  I submitted a news item, why was it credited to someone else? They either submitted it first--or more importantly--submitted more information.  Can I submit news about a non-Japanese animation? No. We're Anime News Network, not ""Animation News Network"", not ""Asian Animation Network."" There's plenty of good animation from around the world, including Korea and China, but we only cover Japanese animation, not French, Mexican, Chinese, African, Korean or Afghanistanimation.  Can I submit a review? / How do I become a reviewer? Anime News Network does not accept unsolicited reviews. Take a quick look at the Staff Openings page, if there is an opening, it will be mentioned there. More often than not, we hire experienced writers who are known to us. Best piece of advice we can give is to make a name for yourself then we'll come to you when the time is right.  Can I submit an article? If you are an experienced writer/journalist with a portfolio you can point to, please E-mail the editors and ask about the topic, we'd be glad to consider your article idea.  Can I have a column? No. Only previous, regular contributors who have shown an ability to consistently write timely, quality articles (or reviews) are permitted to write columns. Try submitting some articles or reviews first.  Information X is missing from the Encyclopedia, can you add it? We can't add it, but YOU can. The Encyclopedia is a user-contributed database; it's made specially so that you can add missing information by yourself. You just need a user account. So please do take the time to register and submit the information you found was missing. Each page contains pointers about how to add information, and if that's not enough you can check the Encyclopedia FAQ or the memoranda.  How can I contribute to the encyclopedia? Any registered user can contribute standard data to the Encyclopedia for Anime, Manga and People. But if that's not enough for you and you're near the top of the contributors list and you'd like to help out with the releases, lexicon, or editing and verifying data submitted by other people, please contact the Encyclopedist.  Please note, that we'll be looking for someone who is inputting quality data, not just large amounts of data.   What if I want to contribute in some other way? We always appreciate whatever help and support that readers can give. If you'd like to help out at ANN in a way other than the ones described above, please contact the editors. There's so much to do at ANN that we're very appreciative of any help offered.   My company is making Anime, can you post a news article about it? Sorry, too many companies are trying to cash in on the popularity of Anime by making cartoons with big eyes and purple hair. We're sure you aren't like that, but... well actually, we aren't sure.  Why doesn't Anime News Network review world manga? Please see our definition of manga. It is Anime News Network's official position, and the personal belief of many of our staff, than there is nothing inheritently superior about Japanese manga when compared to world manga. However Anime News Network's purpose is to cover Japanese animation and comic books. Currently we do not have the resources to review all the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America. If and when we are able to review 100% of the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America, we will then consider expanding our area of review coverage to include manga-style comics (world manga) that originate outside of Japan.  Why didn't you post a news article about my (company's) new Anime or Manga? If your item is picked up in a distribution deal by a company that isn't being run out of someone's garage, then maybe its newsworthy. So when that happens, give us a shout, and we'll consider it, but if you can't tell us what makes your creation manga or anime (other than big eyes, purple hair and the like) you can pretty much forget it.  May I send you my company's product to review? If it's anime or manga-related, then yes. Contact editors[at]animenewsnetwork.com for shipping information.  I'm starting a new webmanga, is it news? No, there are a billion and one ""webmangas"", and most only last a couple of months. Now, if your webmanga gets licensed by a publisher... that might be news.  Can you mention my site? Only if you do something newsworthy, sorry.  Why have we been blacklisted? ANN has a 2-strikes rule regarding inappropriate PR. After 2 strikes for the following reasons we will blacklist your company or PR firm (when we blacklist a PR firm, we notify their relevant clients). i) Completely irrelevant PR that has nothing to do with anime, manga, Japanese pop-culture or any other related content; ii) Unauthorized stealth marketing on our forums; iii) Harassing our staff; iv) Continued PR submissions to inappropriate e-mail address. v) Any attempt to illicitly influence editorial We'll send you a link to this post after your first offense. After your second offense you'll never hear from us again (and our readers will never hear from you or your clients).  Isn't this a bit harsh? Perhaps, but we're tired of getting PRs for toilets, accounting firm management changes and World War 2 museums.   But we offer an opt-out! Clicking that link might opt us out of all your press releases, including your relevant ones. It would be the same as blacklisting you, without giving you the warning. Showing you this warning is actually less harsh than clicking your opt-out.  Forum / Account  I didn't receive my forum registration. If you are using a spam filter, please check your spam folder, some mail servers catch the registration code as spam. Search your spamfolder & inbox for e-mail from [email protected] or [email protected]. If you are using any sort of white list, please make sure that your e-mail account is set up to accept e-mails from [email protected] and [email protected]. If you are using a mail service that bounces the e-mail back to the sender and asks them to confirm that it is not spam, we will not do that. These services usually allow you to add the e-mail address to a white-list before hand. Once you have checked all of the above, you can have the server re-send you your activation code by going here. It should be instant, but sometimes e-mail is slow, give it a couple hours (the slowness is usually not because of our server). If you still don't get your activation code, then and ONLY then, e-mail us at [email protected] make sure that: 1) Your e-mail is sent from the e-mail address you submitted to ANN; 2) You include your user name; 3) Do not send us your password; 4) The subject of your e-mail must be ""activation code"".   How do I become a moderator? You're invited. When we feel there is a need for a new moderator, we look at our best forum users (the ones that contribute intelligently to conversation and act maturely) and ask them if they'd be willing to help us moderate the forum.  Will there ever be an off topic / general conversation forum among the forums? Not in the public areas, no. We do however maintain a community section for subscribers, and off-topic discussion is permitted there.  Why aren't my posts showing up? Posts from new users sometimes take a while to show up. Please be patient, they should appear within a few hours. Believe it or not, this is a ""feature"" not a ""bug.""  Is there a set of forum rules? Right here - read them if you haven't already.  Help, I've been banned or moderated! Read this.  How do I attach a picture (avatar) to my account? Read this.  Can I change my user name? You can make changes in your user account settings. But because other users depend on your username to recognize you, we have a ""no identity switcheroos"" policy: once you start using the forum we do not allow changes to your username beyond punctuation and capitalization.  Can I delete my account? Yes, you can. Go to your account settings page and you will be able to delete your account from there. Contests  Can I enter give-aways more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No.  Can I enter creative contests more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, Yes.  Does ANN ""own"" my entry? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No. But as a condition of your entry we generaly require you to give us the unrevocable right to display your entry on Anime News Network for all eternity.  Can I display my entry elsewhere? Yes, anywhere you please, unless otherwise stated in the contest rules.  Why do I have to put your logo and/or the sponsor's logo on my submission There are two reasons for this. First, it adds some extra benefit to the contest sponsors and second, it helps us insure that you made the entry for the contest, instead of just grabing some existing art and submiting it.  Explain those rules about where I live and whether or not I can enter and if you will ship me a prize. Most of our contest are open to anyone, regardless of where you live, because we don't believe in geographic discrimination. However sometimes our sponsors want a contest to only be open to their potential clients, so in those cases we have no choice to abide by their request to limit contest entry to a certain geographic area. While we don't believe in geographic discrimination, we also don't believe in spending a fortune on shipping and trying to figure out custom laws in order to get you your prize so that's why we only ship to the USA and Canada.   What does a complete mailing address look like? Short answer: ""It's what we need to put on a package to mail it to you."" It looks something like this:  416 William St. #402 Moralton, SS 70707 USA 24 Sussex Dr Ottawa, ON  K1A 0A3 Canada 1000 J.P. Laurel St. San Miguel 1005, Manila  Philippines   You'd be amazed at how many people enter our contests and leave out critical mailing information like their city, province/state and or postal/zip code. You'd also be amazed at how many people ask us ""What do you mean by complete mailing address?"" In fact, if you're reading this, it's quite possible that we referred you here because you asked that very question. Since we usually only ship to the USA and Canada, we won't disqualify you for leaving out the country, but if anything else is missing, we'll just pick another winner to replace you. We will not contact you to verify your mailing address. BTW, your name is not part of your mailing address, but we won't disqualify you for putting it in there...  Why do some contests not ship to PO Boxes? ANN usually doesn't handle shipping for our contest prizes. Shipping is done by the contest sponsor. If the contest states ""no PO boxes"" this is because our sponsor requested it. Most likely it is because they are shipping via a courier like UPS, which will not ship to PO boxes.  I'd really prefer it if you didn't post my name & city if I win This is done for legal reasons, sorry. That said, if you want to enter with an alias, that's fine as long as you are certain the package will reach you (we can't guarantee it will).  Why did you stop accepting art contest entries from Facebook By default, Facebook posts usually aren't public. Most people who submit Facebook URLs to our art contests forget to share their entries publicly, and we are often forced to disqualify these entries. It's better to just avoid the problem altogether. If you want to enter with Facebook, and you remember to make your entry public go ahead, we'll accept it. But if you forget to share it properly, we will simply ignore your entry.   Miscellaneous   Can I link to you? Yes, please feel free. Currently we don't have any banners to offer you for this, we'll be making some new ones shortly.  Can you link to me? No. We are not a link exchange site.  Wait, I can link to you, but you won't link to me?? Yes, we know it sounds a little conceited of us, but that's how it is. To be fair, we don't expect you to link to us, but we're honored if you do decide that you'd like to link to our site despite the fact that we won't be returning the favor. Please don't link to us if you're only doing it because you hope to get something in return; link to us because you feel that you want more people to know about Anime News Network.   Can we trade banners? Sorry, ANN relies on its banners to survive. We very seldom trade banners with another website or publication. If your publication is in print (10 000+ circulation) or a website with 10 million+ impressions per month, we may consider it. Please understand, ANN receives this question at least once a week, it isn't possible for us to even consider swapping / affiliating with so many sites, so we generally don't swap / affiliate with any.  Can you affiliate with us? Anime News Network would be happy to setup an affiliate program with any online store that pays referral fees provided that store meets certain pre-requisites. Anime News Network is unfortunately unable to affiliate itself with fan-sites much for the same reason that we can not link to you or trade banners with you (see above two entries).  Why'd you give this show a rating of ... in your review? Clearly it deserved a ... ! Obviously our reviewer disagrees.  When is title X coming out, how many episodes is it, and/or who is releasing it? Look it up in the encyclopedia, ask Answerman, or ask in the forum.  Why'd you make X change to the programming on [Cartoon Network, YTV, etc]? Uhh, try contacting the broadcaster, network or station. We're a news site and we have no more control over the schedule at [TV Station] than any other media source. Yes, believe it or not we get this question every so often.  I'd like to license, work on, be involved with, etc... one of your titles Just like we aren't involved in TV broadcasting, we are not licensors. Even for shows that we stream on ANN, we are not authorized to sub-license them to other companies. Contact the producers or the licensors, not us.  I'd like permission to do something with one of your titles Sorry, we do not control copyright permissions for any anime or manga. If you need permission to do something, contact the local licensee / master licensor; or failing that, contact the master licensor in Japan. A bit of advice though, for personal, non commercial projects, don't bother contacting them unless you absolutely need permission. They don't care if you make a 1-off t-shirt to wear to school, but if you ask them, they'll probably say ""No,"" as a matter of policy. Sorry we can not help you get in contact with a rights holder.  Why'd you take my video show off YouTube? We get this question a lot. We didn't take your video down. See the above answer as well as the first one. ANN has no involvement in the process of taking pirated materials off of websites like YouTube. For your information, the material was probably taken down because it was uploaded without permission (therefore illegally) and the licensors want you to watch it somewhere they will make money (on DVD, on TV, or on an authorized website). Go here for a list of places where you can legally watch anime and support the creators at the same time.  On a related note, allow us to point out that your video was probably automatically removed by a technology called video-fingerprinting. By this semi-automated process, YouTube removes videos that it believes infringe on copyrights without waiting for complaints from copyright holders. So it's quite possible that no anime company was involved in the removal of your video.   Sadly, this process can affect videos that are legitimate ""fair-use."" Even more sadly, the employees at the anime companies are too busy to bother reading all the e-mails they get about videos (the vast majority of are from morons that don't understand that ""I wasn't making money"" doesn't make it okay) so you can e-mail them to your hearts content, but they probably won't answer (not because they're fan-hating assholes, but because they don't have the time).    If you believe your video is legitimate fair-use (full episodes are never fair use, significant episode clips are rarely fair use, AMVs are almost never fair use of the music) try posting it again and include in the description why you feel it is fair use. If you're lucky, YouTube will take this into consideration (some videos are deleted automatically, others are looked at by a human employee at YouTube after the fingerprinting process identifies them) and not delete your video. You really should read up on ""fair use"" before you make any claims that your video is fair use though. And by ""read-up,"" we mean read professional, expert explanations, not your friend's blog.   I have a great idea for an anime or manga, where do I submit it? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not involved with the creation process of any anime or manga and we can not put you in contact with creators (more on that here). Finally, we'd recommend you read this and this.  How do I get your television channel? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not The Anime Network (TAN). For details on TAN, read the transcript of our chat with them, read our TAN news coverage, or visit their website.  Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? No. As a policy, ANN never gives out contact information. Don't send us this question unless you've exhausted every other resource available (phone book, 411, Google, their website, etc...), even then, we will only forward your request to them, and we will only do so provided it is a business-to-business request being made by a company we've actually heard of. If you can't find Hayao Miyazaki's e-mail address online, it's probably because he doesn't want to receive a thousand e-mails a day. The one exception to this rule is that we will give out the Public Relations / Press Relations (PR) contact information for a company provided we have it readily available. Generally you can find this information on your own though, so please don't be lazy. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? I'm an old acquaintance of theirs. The answer is still no. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? They worked on one of your projects. Just to be clear, our encyclopedia carries information about a myriad of projects (anime,manga, etc...) most of which (99.9%) Anime News Network is not, and never was, involved with. It is not a list of our projects. So if the person actually worked for ANN, please see this answer, but if they are one of the 67023+ people listed in the encyclopedia, they probably didn't work for us and therefore the previous two answers apply. Okay, I understand, you can't or won't put me in contact with them, but I really want/need to contact this person. Can you offer any suggestions on how to proceed? Depending on who you're trying to contact, they might have a fanclub, official webpage, or e-mail address listed in their encyclopedia entry. If not, try looking for the latest production they worked on and contacting the production company, they might be able and willing to forward your e-mail. Just a note, if you're contacting someone in Japan, it's highly recommended that at least your intro be in Japanese. Even if your intended recipient understands English, the person you ask to forward your e-mail might not. For your benefit, here's a quick intro you can prepend to any e-mail you send to Japan (replaces the blanks by the name of the person you are trying to contact): ご担当者様へ お世話になっております。 本社は____様にご連絡を取りたがっています。お手数ですが、このメールを____様へ転送して頂けないでしょうか? 宜しくお願いします。  Literally: To whom it may concern/the person in charge: Thank you for your time. We are trying to contact _____. If it isn't too much trouble, could you forward this e-mail to ____? Thank you very much.    Can you send me your catalog? We don't have a catalog, we don't sell anything.  Where can I buy Anime ? You can buy it at retail movie stores like Blockbuster and Suncoast as well as specialty Anime Shops. You can also buy it online at websites like Anime Castle, Anime Nation, J List, Roberts Anime Corner Store and The Right Stuf International.  Where can I download anime or watch it online? For the most part, you can't legally download anime online. Fansubs are generally illegal (whether or not they're unethical is a completely different topic), and as such, we can't help you obtain them. You might want to check the sites listed below, and read our news, when there's legal anime to download or watched online we generally mention it.  Don't ask us where to get bootlegs or fansubs, we won't tell you.  Some sites/services that allow you to download or watch anime online legally(may or may not be free):  Amazon Prime crunchyroll Funimation's Website HiDive Apple iTunes hulu Netflix Viz Anime  * Why isn't YouTube listed? Because a lot of the content on YouTube is illegally uploaded. One day we'll have an index of legal anime on YouTube, but until then we aren't listing it as a site where all content is legal/authorized.   How do I watch anime on ANN? ANN has stopped streaming anime episodes. Go to the websites above!  Can you help me with my school assignment No. We get this question about once a week, and we don't really want to spend 25 hours a year answering school questions. The worst part is that most people who e-mail us are actually asking us to provide information they could find with a little bit of research, in other words, they're asking us to do their work for them. On the other hand, if you're working on a master's project or PhD thesis related to anime, that interests us, so we'd probably be more than happy to help.  Does ANN offer Internships? Yes, Anime News Network offers internships in our newsroom and our web-development departments. Further details are available here   What happened to ANN UK? In late May the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into effect. The EU determined that any website targeting European readers would be ""doing business in Europe."" Anime News Network does not disagree with this conclusion. Unfortunately, the GDPR requires all websites doing business in Europe to meet a stringent set of privacy regulations. While ANN supports the intent of these regulations, some of them are extremely difficult to comply with. While it is our intention, for the benefit of all readers our readers around the world, to comply with these new standards, we are not able to do so immediately. Once we are fully compliant with GDPR requirements, we will re-launch ANN UK. In the meantime, ANN's global edition is available to all readers worldwide and is the default version for readers outside of North America, Australia, New Zealand and South East Asia.             bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Misc Page homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,{}

Does ANN offer Internships? What happened to ANN UK?    About ANN  What is Anime News Network (ANN)? Anime News Network was created as a news source that focuses on the medium of Japanese Animation(anime) and Japanese Comics (manga). ANN was founded by Justin Sevakis in July of 1998, and has since lead the online anime news medium with a tradition of strong unbiased coverage of major breaking news. With in-depth coverage, analysis and commentary to provide insight into the world of anime and manga, ANN has been and continues to be the #1 English language source for anime and manga news on the Internet. ANN's goal is to make the latest, most comprehensive Anime news available to new fans and veteran Otaku alike.  What ANN is not:  A television network or station; A subsidiary of another company; A dubbing / voice recording studio; An animation company; A licensing or distribution company; A manufacturer or distributor of merchandise; For sale.    What is anime? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of anime, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, anime is animation that is primarily produced and conceived in Japan. This includes animation conceived in Japan that has portions outsourced to other countries, but does not include animation primarily produced outside Japan and with the animation outsourced to Japan. It does however include animation that is co-conceived inside and outside of Japan and at least partially produced inside Japan.  What is manga? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of manga, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, manga are comic books or strips that are produced and conceived in Japan. This includes include comics that are co-conceived inside and outside of Japan but produced in Japan.  Who operates ANN? ANN is operated by a team of people, under the guidance of Christopher Macdonald, Daniel DeLorme, Zac Bertschy, Egan Loo and Hori Shinsuke. A full list of the staff can be found on the staff page.   Who owns ANN? The website is owned by Anime News Network Inc., a privately owned corporation. The corporation's shareholders include: Christopher Macdonald (Minority owner, controlling shareholder), Hori Shinsuke (Minority owner), Anime Consortium Japan (Minority owner), others.   Where is ANN based? Wow, that question is so 1999! ANN is based everywhere and nowhere. We're based on the Internet! We don't have an office; our staff all work at home and are based around the world with the most full-time staff based in Japan and the United States. Anime News Network, Inc. the corporation that maintains ANN is a Canadian corporation.  Who is the mascot? When the site was first launched in 1998 it featured a blond-haired mascot named Jadress, created by Robin Sevakis. She was eventually replaced by Nina, who was featured in a webcomic (also created by Robin Sevakis) that ran from 2007 to 2013.  How often do you update? The site is run on a daily content format, as opposed to a monthly or bi-monthly magazine format. We update the news and reviews daily, and other content, such as features, columns, and editorials are also added throughout the week. Our encyclopedia is updated daily as well.  Under what settings is ANN best viewed? The site uses a responsive design that should look good at any resolution, from smartphones to large desktop screens.  How do I find older articles on ANN? Links to archives for news, features, columns, reviews, etc. can be found in their respective sections in the menu. You can also use the search engine.  What was used to make the site, as well as maintain it? The site is a combination of older parts in PHP and newer parts in Ruby, with a MySQL database to manage the content. Apart from the phpBB forum, we haven't used any pre-made packages; all the content is managed and presented with custom software.  How do I get permission to reprint an ANN Story, or obtain an ANN graphic or photo? ANN has a newsfeed program where you can get the latest anime news headlines on your very own website. If you wish to entirely reprint anything on your site please contact the editors. For more details about what you can and can not re-print with or without our permission, see our copyright statement.  How many people hear or read an ANN story? We get a bit over 200,000 visits every day. In addition to regular visitors, ANN's news is often sourced in print and occasionally on the airwaves.  How can I get in touch with the staff? Visit our contact page or visit our staff page for further contact and personal information. If a member's e-mail address is not there you can send your comments to the editors and we'll forward them.  Do you attend any public events? Yes. ANN tries to provide coverage to as many anime conventions/festivals/symposiums as our staff can manage. For more details on this see our events section and our events forum.  Do you have a newsfeed? You really should have an RSS newsfeed! Look at our newsfeed section for links to various RSS & Atom feeds as well as our custom newsfeed program. Submitting Content  How should I submit news ? Send an e-mail to [email protected] , this e-mail address is regularly monitored by several staff (someone is always ""on duty""). Other methods (e-mail directly to staff, PM, Forum, Twitter, etc...) are less reliable, and may lead to delays and/or a complete failure to notice your submission.  I have something to say about an online petition. Stop. Virtually every e-petition is a waste of time.   I submitted a news item, why wasn't it posted? We could still be in the process of verifying the details, we may not have been able to verify the items, or perhaps we didn't find it newsworthy enough to post. On a ""slow"" news day we're more likely to post less significant items.  I submitted a news item, why was it credited to someone else? They either submitted it first--or more importantly--submitted more information.  Can I submit news about a non-Japanese animation? No. We're Anime News Network, not ""Animation News Network"", not ""Asian Animation Network."" There's plenty of good animation from around the world, including Korea and China, but we only cover Japanese animation, not French, Mexican, Chinese, African, Korean or Afghanistanimation.  Can I submit a review? / How do I become a reviewer? Anime News Network does not accept unsolicited reviews. Take a quick look at the Staff Openings page, if there is an opening, it will be mentioned there. More often than not, we hire experienced writers who are known to us. Best piece of advice we can give is to make a name for yourself then we'll come to you when the time is right.  Can I submit an article? If you are an experienced writer/journalist with a portfolio you can point to, please E-mail the editors and ask about the topic, we'd be glad to consider your article idea.  Can I have a column? No. Only previous, regular contributors who have shown an ability to consistently write timely, quality articles (or reviews) are permitted to write columns. Try submitting some articles or reviews first.  Information X is missing from the Encyclopedia, can you add it? We can't add it, but YOU can. The Encyclopedia is a user-contributed database; it's made specially so that you can add missing information by yourself. You just need a user account. So please do take the time to register and submit the information you found was missing. Each page contains pointers about how to add information, and if that's not enough you can check the Encyclopedia FAQ or the memoranda.  How can I contribute to the encyclopedia? Any registered user can contribute standard data to the Encyclopedia for Anime, Manga and People. But if that's not enough for you and you're near the top of the contributors list and you'd like to help out with the releases, lexicon, or editing and verifying data submitted by other people, please contact the Encyclopedist.  Please note, that we'll be looking for someone who is inputting quality data, not just large amounts of data.   What if I want to contribute in some other way? We always appreciate whatever help and support that readers can give. If you'd like to help out at ANN in a way other than the ones described above, please contact the editors. There's so much to do at ANN that we're very appreciative of any help offered.   My company is making Anime, can you post a news article about it? Sorry, too many companies are trying to cash in on the popularity of Anime by making cartoons with big eyes and purple hair. We're sure you aren't like that, but... well actually, we aren't sure.  Why doesn't Anime News Network review world manga? Please see our definition of manga. It is Anime News Network's official position, and the personal belief of many of our staff, than there is nothing inheritently superior about Japanese manga when compared to world manga. However Anime News Network's purpose is to cover Japanese animation and comic books. Currently we do not have the resources to review all the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America. If and when we are able to review 100% of the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America, we will then consider expanding our area of review coverage to include manga-style comics (world manga) that originate outside of Japan.  Why didn't you post a news article about my (company's) new Anime or Manga? If your item is picked up in a distribution deal by a company that isn't being run out of someone's garage, then maybe its newsworthy. So when that happens, give us a shout, and we'll consider it, but if you can't tell us what makes your creation manga or anime (other than big eyes, purple hair and the like) you can pretty much forget it.  May I send you my company's product to review? If it's anime or manga-related, then yes. Contact editors[at]animenewsnetwork.com for shipping information.  I'm starting a new webmanga, is it news? No, there are a billion and one ""webmangas"", and most only last a couple of months. Now, if your webmanga gets licensed by a publisher... that might be news.  Can you mention my site? Only if you do something newsworthy, sorry.  Why have we been blacklisted? ANN has a 2-strikes rule regarding inappropriate PR. After 2 strikes for the following reasons we will blacklist your company or PR firm (when we blacklist a PR firm, we notify their relevant clients). i) Completely irrelevant PR that has nothing to do with anime, manga, Japanese pop-culture or any other related content; ii) Unauthorized stealth marketing on our forums; iii) Harassing our staff; iv) Continued PR submissions to inappropriate e-mail address. v) Any attempt to illicitly influence editorial We'll send you a link to this post after your first offense. After your second offense you'll never hear from us again (and our readers will never hear from you or your clients).  Isn't this a bit harsh? Perhaps, but we're tired of getting PRs for toilets, accounting firm management changes and World War 2 museums.   But we offer an opt-out! Clicking that link might opt us out of all your press releases, including your relevant ones. It would be the same as blacklisting you, without giving you the warning. Showing you this warning is actually less harsh than clicking your opt-out.  Forum / Account  I didn't receive my forum registration. If you are using a spam filter, please check your spam folder, some mail servers catch the registration code as spam. Search your spamfolder & inbox for e-mail from [email protected] or [email protected]. If you are using any sort of white list, please make sure that your e-mail account is set up to accept e-mails from [email protected] and [email protected]. If you are using a mail service that bounces the e-mail back to the sender and asks them to confirm that it is not spam, we will not do that. These services usually allow you to add the e-mail address to a white-list before hand. Once you have checked all of the above, you can have the server re-send you your activation code by going here. It should be instant, but sometimes e-mail is slow, give it a couple hours (the slowness is usually not because of our server). If you still don't get your activation code, then and ONLY then, e-mail us at [email protected] make sure that: 1) Your e-mail is sent from the e-mail address you submitted to ANN; 2) You include your user name; 3) Do not send us your password; 4) The subject of your e-mail must be ""activation code"".   How do I become a moderator? You're invited. When we feel there is a need for a new moderator, we look at our best forum users (the ones that contribute intelligently to conversation and act maturely) and ask them if they'd be willing to help us moderate the forum.  Will there ever be an off topic / general conversation forum among the forums? Not in the public areas, no. We do however maintain a community section for subscribers, and off-topic discussion is permitted there.  Why aren't my posts showing up? Posts from new users sometimes take a while to show up. Please be patient, they should appear within a few hours. Believe it or not, this is a ""feature"" not a ""bug.""  Is there a set of forum rules? Right here - read them if you haven't already.  Help, I've been banned or moderated! Read this.  How do I attach a picture (avatar) to my account? Read this.  Can I change my user name? You can make changes in your user account settings. But because other users depend on your username to recognize you, we have a ""no identity switcheroos"" policy: once you start using the forum we do not allow changes to your username beyond punctuation and capitalization.  Can I delete my account? Yes, you can. Go to your account settings page and you will be able to delete your account from there. Contests  Can I enter give-aways more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No.  Can I enter creative contests more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, Yes.  Does ANN ""own"" my entry? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No. But as a condition of your entry we generaly require you to give us the unrevocable right to display your entry on Anime News Network for all eternity.  Can I display my entry elsewhere? Yes, anywhere you please, unless otherwise stated in the contest rules.  Why do I have to put your logo and/or the sponsor's logo on my submission There are two reasons for this. First, it adds some extra benefit to the contest sponsors and second, it helps us insure that you made the entry for the contest, instead of just grabing some existing art and submiting it.  Explain those rules about where I live and whether or not I can enter and if you will ship me a prize. Most of our contest are open to anyone, regardless of where you live, because we don't believe in geographic discrimination. However sometimes our sponsors want a contest to only be open to their potential clients, so in those cases we have no choice to abide by their request to limit contest entry to a certain geographic area. While we don't believe in geographic discrimination, we also don't believe in spending a fortune on shipping and trying to figure out custom laws in order to get you your prize so that's why we only ship to the USA and Canada.   What does a complete mailing address look like? Short answer: ""It's what we need to put on a package to mail it to you."" It looks something like this:  416 William St. #402 Moralton, SS 70707 USA 24 Sussex Dr Ottawa, ON  K1A 0A3 Canada 1000 J.P. Laurel St. San Miguel 1005, Manila  Philippines   You'd be amazed at how many people enter our contests and leave out critical mailing information like their city, province/state and or postal/zip code. You'd also be amazed at how many people ask us ""What do you mean by complete mailing address?"" In fact, if you're reading this, it's quite possible that we referred you here because you asked that very question. Since we usually only ship to the USA and Canada, we won't disqualify you for leaving out the country, but if anything else is missing, we'll just pick another winner to replace you. We will not contact you to verify your mailing address. BTW, your name is not part of your mailing address, but we won't disqualify you for putting it in there...  Why do some contests not ship to PO Boxes? ANN usually doesn't handle shipping for our contest prizes. Shipping is done by the contest sponsor. If the contest states ""no PO boxes"" this is because our sponsor requested it. Most likely it is because they are shipping via a courier like UPS, which will not ship to PO boxes.  I'd really prefer it if you didn't post my name & city if I win This is done for legal reasons, sorry. That said, if you want to enter with an alias, that's fine as long as you are certain the package will reach you (we can't guarantee it will).  Why did you stop accepting art contest entries from Facebook By default, Facebook posts usually aren't public. Most people who submit Facebook URLs to our art contests forget to share their entries publicly, and we are often forced to disqualify these entries. It's better to just avoid the problem altogether. If you want to enter with Facebook, and you remember to make your entry public go ahead, we'll accept it. But if you forget to share it properly, we will simply ignore your entry.   Miscellaneous   Can I link to you? Yes, please feel free. Currently we don't have any banners to offer you for this, we'll be making some new ones shortly.  Can you link to me? No. We are not a link exchange site.  Wait, I can link to you, but you won't link to me?? Yes, we know it sounds a little conceited of us, but that's how it is. To be fair, we don't expect you to link to us, but we're honored if you do decide that you'd like to link to our site despite the fact that we won't be returning the favor. Please don't link to us if you're only doing it because you hope to get something in return; link to us because you feel that you want more people to know about Anime News Network.   Can we trade banners? Sorry, ANN relies on its banners to survive. We very seldom trade banners with another website or publication. If your publication is in print (10 000+ circulation) or a website with 10 million+ impressions per month, we may consider it. Please understand, ANN receives this question at least once a week, it isn't possible for us to even consider swapping / affiliating with so many sites, so we generally don't swap / affiliate with any.  Can you affiliate with us? Anime News Network would be happy to setup an affiliate program with any online store that pays referral fees provided that store meets certain pre-requisites. Anime News Network is unfortunately unable to affiliate itself with fan-sites much for the same reason that we can not link to you or trade banners with you (see above two entries).  Why'd you give this show a rating of ... in your review? Clearly it deserved a ... ! Obviously our reviewer disagrees.  When is title X coming out, how many episodes is it, and/or who is releasing it? Look it up in the encyclopedia, ask Answerman, or ask in the forum.  Why'd you make X change to the programming on [Cartoon Network, YTV, etc]? Uhh, try contacting the broadcaster, network or station. We're a news site and we have no more control over the schedule at [TV Station] than any other media source. Yes, believe it or not we get this question every so often.  I'd like to license, work on, be involved with, etc... one of your titles Just like we aren't involved in TV broadcasting, we are not licensors. Even for shows that we stream on ANN, we are not authorized to sub-license them to other companies. Contact the producers or the licensors, not us.  I'd like permission to do something with one of your titles Sorry, we do not control copyright permissions for any anime or manga. If you need permission to do something, contact the local licensee / master licensor; or failing that, contact the master licensor in Japan. A bit of advice though, for personal, non commercial projects, don't bother contacting them unless you absolutely need permission. They don't care if you make a 1-off t-shirt to wear to school, but if you ask them, they'll probably say ""No,"" as a matter of policy. Sorry we can not help you get in contact with a rights holder.  Why'd you take my video show off YouTube? We get this question a lot. We didn't take your video down. See the above answer as well as the first one. ANN has no involvement in the process of taking pirated materials off of websites like YouTube. For your information, the material was probably taken down because it was uploaded without permission (therefore illegally) and the licensors want you to watch it somewhere they will make money (on DVD, on TV, or on an authorized website). Go here for a list of places where you can legally watch anime and support the creators at the same time.  On a related note, allow us to point out that your video was probably automatically removed by a technology called video-fingerprinting. By this semi-automated process, YouTube removes videos that it believes infringe on copyrights without waiting for complaints from copyright holders. So it's quite possible that no anime company was involved in the removal of your video.   Sadly, this process can affect videos that are legitimate ""fair-use."" Even more sadly, the employees at the anime companies are too busy to bother reading all the e-mails they get about videos (the vast majority of are from morons that don't understand that ""I wasn't making money"" doesn't make it okay) so you can e-mail them to your hearts content, but they probably won't answer (not because they're fan-hating assholes, but because they don't have the time).    If you believe your video is legitimate fair-use (full episodes are never fair use, significant episode clips are rarely fair use, AMVs are almost never fair use of the music) try posting it again and include in the description why you feel it is fair use. If you're lucky, YouTube will take this into consideration (some videos are deleted automatically, others are looked at by a human employee at YouTube after the fingerprinting process identifies them) and not delete your video. You really should read up on ""fair use"" before you make any claims that your video is fair use though. And by ""read-up,"" we mean read professional, expert explanations, not your friend's blog.   I have a great idea for an anime or manga, where do I submit it? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not involved with the creation process of any anime or manga and we can not put you in contact with creators (more on that here). Finally, we'd recommend you read this and this.  How do I get your television channel? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not The Anime Network (TAN). For details on TAN, read the transcript of our chat with them, read our TAN news coverage, or visit their website.  Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? No. As a policy, ANN never gives out contact information. Don't send us this question unless you've exhausted every other resource available (phone book, 411, Google, their website, etc...), even then, we will only forward your request to them, and we will only do so provided it is a business-to-business request being made by a company we've actually heard of. If you can't find Hayao Miyazaki's e-mail address online, it's probably because he doesn't want to receive a thousand e-mails a day. The one exception to this rule is that we will give out the Public Relations / Press Relations (PR) contact information for a company provided we have it readily available. Generally you can find this information on your own though, so please don't be lazy. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? I'm an old acquaintance of theirs. The answer is still no. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? They worked on one of your projects. Just to be clear, our encyclopedia carries information about a myriad of projects (anime,manga, etc...) most of which (99.9%) Anime News Network is not, and never was, involved with. It is not a list of our projects. So if the person actually worked for ANN, please see this answer, but if they are one of the 67023+ people listed in the encyclopedia, they probably didn't work for us and therefore the previous two answers apply. Okay, I understand, you can't or won't put me in contact with them, but I really want/need to contact this person. Can you offer any suggestions on how to proceed? Depending on who you're trying to contact, they might have a fanclub, official webpage, or e-mail address listed in their encyclopedia entry. If not, try looking for the latest production they worked on and contacting the production company, they might be able and willing to forward your e-mail. Just a note, if you're contacting someone in Japan, it's highly recommended that at least your intro be in Japanese. Even if your intended recipient understands English, the person you ask to forward your e-mail might not. For your benefit, here's a quick intro you can prepend to any e-mail you send to Japan (replaces the blanks by the name of the person you are trying to contact): ご担当者様へ お世話になっております。 本社は____様にご連絡を取りたがっています。お手数ですが、このメールを____様へ転送して頂けないでしょうか? 宜しくお願いします。  Literally: To whom it may concern/the person in charge: Thank you for your time. We are trying to contact _____. If it isn't too much trouble, could you forward this e-mail to ____? Thank you very much.    Can you send me your catalog? We don't have a catalog, we don't sell anything.  Where can I buy Anime ? You can buy it at retail movie stores like Blockbuster and Suncoast as well as specialty Anime Shops. You can also buy it online at websites like Anime Castle, Anime Nation, J List, Roberts Anime Corner Store and The Right Stuf International.  Where can I download anime or watch it online? For the most part, you can't legally download anime online. Fansubs are generally illegal (whether or not they're unethical is a completely different topic), and as such, we can't help you obtain them. You might want to check the sites listed below, and read our news, when there's legal anime to download or watched online we generally mention it.  Don't ask us where to get bootlegs or fansubs, we won't tell you.  Some sites/services that allow you to download or watch anime online legally(may or may not be free):  Amazon Prime crunchyroll Funimation's Website HiDive Apple iTunes hulu Netflix Viz Anime  * Why isn't YouTube listed? Because a lot of the content on YouTube is illegally uploaded. One day we'll have an index of legal anime on YouTube, but until then we aren't listing it as a site where all content is legal/authorized.   How do I watch anime on ANN? ANN has stopped streaming anime episodes. Go to the websites above!  Can you help me with my school assignment No. We get this question about once a week, and we don't really want to spend 25 hours a year answering school questions. The worst part is that most people who e-mail us are actually asking us to provide information they could find with a little bit of research, in other words, they're asking us to do their work for them. On the other hand, if you're working on a master's project or PhD thesis related to anime, that interests us, so we'd probably be more than happy to help.  Does ANN offer Internships? Yes, Anime News Network offers internships in our newsroom and our web-development departments. Further details are available here   What happened to ANN UK? In late May the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into effect. The EU determined that any website targeting European readers would be ""doing business in Europe."" Anime News Network does not disagree with this conclusion. Unfortunately, the GDPR requires all websites doing business in Europe to meet a stringent set of privacy regulations. While ANN supports the intent of these regulations, some of them are extremely difficult to comply with. While it is our intention, for the benefit of all readers our readers around the world, to comply with these new standards, we are not able to do so immediately. Once we are fully compliant with GDPR requirements, we will re-launch ANN UK. In the meantime, ANN's global edition is available to all readers worldwide and is the default version for readers outside of North America, Australia, New Zealand and South East Asia.             bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Misc Page homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More     ",positive,en,{}

Does ANN offer Internships? What happened to ANN UK?    About ANN  What is Anime News Network (ANN)? Anime News Network was created as a news source that focuses on the medium of Japanese Animation(anime) and Japanese Comics (manga). ANN was founded by Justin Sevakis in July of 1998, and has since lead the online anime news medium with a tradition of strong unbiased coverage of major breaking news. With in-depth coverage, analysis and commentary to provide insight into the world of anime and manga, ANN has been and continues to be the #1 English language source for anime and manga news on the Internet. ANN's goal is to make the latest, most comprehensive Anime news available to new fans and veteran Otaku alike.  What ANN is not:  A television network or station; A subsidiary of another company; A dubbing / voice recording studio; An animation company; A licensing or distribution company; A manufacturer or distributor of merchandise; For sale.    What is anime? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of anime, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, anime is animation that is primarily produced and conceived in Japan. This includes animation conceived in Japan that has portions outsourced to other countries, but does not include animation primarily produced outside Japan and with the animation outsourced to Japan. It does however include animation that is co-conceived inside and outside of Japan and at least partially produced inside Japan.  What is manga? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of manga, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, manga are comic books or strips that are produced and conceived in Japan. This includes include comics that are co-conceived inside and outside of Japan but produced in Japan.  Who operates ANN? ANN is operated by a team of people, under the guidance of Christopher Macdonald, Daniel DeLorme, Zac Bertschy, Egan Loo and Hori Shinsuke. A full list of the staff can be found on the staff page.   Who owns ANN? The website is owned by Anime News Network Inc., a privately owned corporation. The corporation's shareholders include: Christopher Macdonald (Minority owner, controlling shareholder), Hori Shinsuke (Minority owner), Anime Consortium Japan (Minority owner), others.   Where is ANN based? Wow, that question is so 1999! ANN is based everywhere and nowhere. We're based on the Internet! We don't have an office; our staff all work at home and are based around the world with the most full-time staff based in Japan and the United States. Anime News Network, Inc. the corporation that maintains ANN is a Canadian corporation.  Who is the mascot? When the site was first launched in 1998 it featured a blond-haired mascot named Jadress, created by Robin Sevakis. She was eventually replaced by Nina, who was featured in a webcomic (also created by Robin Sevakis) that ran from 2007 to 2013.  How often do you update? The site is run on a daily content format, as opposed to a monthly or bi-monthly magazine format. We update the news and reviews daily, and other content, such as features, columns, and editorials are also added throughout the week. Our encyclopedia is updated daily as well.  Under what settings is ANN best viewed? The site uses a responsive design that should look good at any resolution, from smartphones to large desktop screens.  How do I find older articles on ANN? Links to archives for news, features, columns, reviews, etc. can be found in their respective sections in the menu. You can also use the search engine.  What was used to make the site, as well as maintain it? The site is a combination of older parts in PHP and newer parts in Ruby, with a MySQL database to manage the content. Apart from the phpBB forum, we haven't used any pre-made packages; all the content is managed and presented with custom software.  How do I get permission to reprint an ANN Story, or obtain an ANN graphic or photo? ANN has a newsfeed program where you can get the latest anime news headlines on your very own website. If you wish to entirely reprint anything on your site please contact the editors. For more details about what you can and can not re-print with or without our permission, see our copyright statement.  How many people hear or read an ANN story? We get a bit over 200,000 visits every day. In addition to regular visitors, ANN's news is often sourced in print and occasionally on the airwaves.  How can I get in touch with the staff? Visit our contact page or visit our staff page for further contact and personal information. If a member's e-mail address is not there you can send your comments to the editors and we'll forward them.  Do you attend any public events? Yes. ANN tries to provide coverage to as many anime conventions/festivals/symposiums as our staff can manage. For more details on this see our events section and our events forum.  Do you have a newsfeed? You really should have an RSS newsfeed! Look at our newsfeed section for links to various RSS & Atom feeds as well as our custom newsfeed program. Submitting Content  How should I submit news ? Send an e-mail to [email protected] , this e-mail address is regularly monitored by several staff (someone is always ""on duty""). Other methods (e-mail directly to staff, PM, Forum, Twitter, etc...) are less reliable, and may lead to delays and/or a complete failure to notice your submission.  I have something to say about an online petition. Stop. Virtually every e-petition is a waste of time.   I submitted a news item, why wasn't it posted? We could still be in the process of verifying the details, we may not have been able to verify the items, or perhaps we didn't find it newsworthy enough to post. On a ""slow"" news day we're more likely to post less significant items.  I submitted a news item, why was it credited to someone else? They either submitted it first--or more importantly--submitted more information.  Can I submit news about a non-Japanese animation? No. We're Anime News Network, not ""Animation News Network"", not ""Asian Animation Network."" There's plenty of good animation from around the world, including Korea and China, but we only cover Japanese animation, not French, Mexican, Chinese, African, Korean or Afghanistanimation.  Can I submit a review? / How do I become a reviewer? Anime News Network does not accept unsolicited reviews. Take a quick look at the Staff Openings page, if there is an opening, it will be mentioned there. More often than not, we hire experienced writers who are known to us. Best piece of advice we can give is to make a name for yourself then we'll come to you when the time is right.  Can I submit an article? If you are an experienced writer/journalist with a portfolio you can point to, please E-mail the editors and ask about the topic, we'd be glad to consider your article idea.  Can I have a column? No. Only previous, regular contributors who have shown an ability to consistently write timely, quality articles (or reviews) are permitted to write columns. Try submitting some articles or reviews first.  Information X is missing from the Encyclopedia, can you add it? We can't add it, but YOU can. The Encyclopedia is a user-contributed database; it's made specially so that you can add missing information by yourself. You just need a user account. So please do take the time to register and submit the information you found was missing. Each page contains pointers about how to add information, and if that's not enough you can check the Encyclopedia FAQ or the memoranda.  How can I contribute to the encyclopedia? Any registered user can contribute standard data to the Encyclopedia for Anime, Manga and People. But if that's not enough for you and you're near the top of the contributors list and you'd like to help out with the releases, lexicon, or editing and verifying data submitted by other people, please contact the Encyclopedist.  Please note, that we'll be looking for someone who is inputting quality data, not just large amounts of data.   What if I want to contribute in some other way? We always appreciate whatever help and support that readers can give. If you'd like to help out at ANN in a way other than the ones described above, please contact the editors. There's so much to do at ANN that we're very appreciative of any help offered.   My company is making Anime, can you post a news article about it? Sorry, too many companies are trying to cash in on the popularity of Anime by making cartoons with big eyes and purple hair. We're sure you aren't like that, but... well actually, we aren't sure.  Why doesn't Anime News Network review world manga? Please see our definition of manga. It is Anime News Network's official position, and the personal belief of many of our staff, than there is nothing inheritently superior about Japanese manga when compared to world manga. However Anime News Network's purpose is to cover Japanese animation and comic books. Currently we do not have the resources to review all the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America. If and when we are able to review 100% of the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America, we will then consider expanding our area of review coverage to include manga-style comics (world manga) that originate outside of Japan.  Why didn't you post a news article about my (company's) new Anime or Manga? If your item is picked up in a distribution deal by a company that isn't being run out of someone's garage, then maybe its newsworthy. So when that happens, give us a shout, and we'll consider it, but if you can't tell us what makes your creation manga or anime (other than big eyes, purple hair and the like) you can pretty much forget it.  May I send you my company's product to review? If it's anime or manga-related, then yes. Contact editors[at]animenewsnetwork.com for shipping information.  I'm starting a new webmanga, is it news? No, there are a billion and one ""webmangas"", and most only last a couple of months. Now, if your webmanga gets licensed by a publisher... that might be news.  Can you mention my site? Only if you do something newsworthy, sorry.  Why have we been blacklisted? ANN has a 2-strikes rule regarding inappropriate PR. After 2 strikes for the following reasons we will blacklist your company or PR firm (when we blacklist a PR firm, we notify their relevant clients). i) Completely irrelevant PR that has nothing to do with anime, manga, Japanese pop-culture or any other related content; ii) Unauthorized stealth marketing on our forums; iii) Harassing our staff; iv) Continued PR submissions to inappropriate e-mail address. v) Any attempt to illicitly influence editorial We'll send you a link to this post after your first offense. After your second offense you'll never hear from us again (and our readers will never hear from you or your clients).  Isn't this a bit harsh? Perhaps, but we're tired of getting PRs for toilets, accounting firm management changes and World War 2 museums.   But we offer an opt-out! Clicking that link might opt us out of all your press releases, including your relevant ones. It would be the same as blacklisting you, without giving you the warning. Showing you this warning is actually less harsh than clicking your opt-out.  Forum / Account  I didn't receive my forum registration. If you are using a spam filter, please check your spam folder, some mail servers catch the registration code as spam. Search your spamfolder & inbox for e-mail from [email protected] or [email protected]. If you are using any sort of white list, please make sure that your e-mail account is set up to accept e-mails from [email protected] and [email protected]. If you are using a mail service that bounces the e-mail back to the sender and asks them to confirm that it is not spam, we will not do that. These services usually allow you to add the e-mail address to a white-list before hand. Once you have checked all of the above, you can have the server re-send you your activation code by going here. It should be instant, but sometimes e-mail is slow, give it a couple hours (the slowness is usually not because of our server). If you still don't get your activation code, then and ONLY then, e-mail us at [email protected] make sure that: 1) Your e-mail is sent from the e-mail address you submitted to ANN; 2) You include your user name; 3) Do not send us your password; 4) The subject of your e-mail must be ""activation code"".   How do I become a moderator? You're invited. When we feel there is a need for a new moderator, we look at our best forum users (the ones that contribute intelligently to conversation and act maturely) and ask them if they'd be willing to help us moderate the forum.  Will there ever be an off topic / general conversation forum among the forums? Not in the public areas, no. We do however maintain a community section for subscribers, and off-topic discussion is permitted there.  Why aren't my posts showing up? Posts from new users sometimes take a while to show up. Please be patient, they should appear within a few hours. Believe it or not, this is a ""feature"" not a ""bug.""  Is there a set of forum rules? Right here - read them if you haven't already.  Help, I've been banned or moderated! Read this.  How do I attach a picture (avatar) to my account? Read this.  Can I change my user name? You can make changes in your user account settings. But because other users depend on your username to recognize you, we have a ""no identity switcheroos"" policy: once you start using the forum we do not allow changes to your username beyond punctuation and capitalization.  Can I delete my account? Yes, you can. Go to your account settings page and you will be able to delete your account from there. Contests  Can I enter give-aways more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No.  Can I enter creative contests more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, Yes.  Does ANN ""own"" my entry? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No. But as a condition of your entry we generaly require you to give us the unrevocable right to display your entry on Anime News Network for all eternity.  Can I display my entry elsewhere? Yes, anywhere you please, unless otherwise stated in the contest rules.  Why do I have to put your logo and/or the sponsor's logo on my submission There are two reasons for this. First, it adds some extra benefit to the contest sponsors and second, it helps us insure that you made the entry for the contest, instead of just grabing some existing art and submiting it.  Explain those rules about where I live and whether or not I can enter and if you will ship me a prize. Most of our contest are open to anyone, regardless of where you live, because we don't believe in geographic discrimination. However sometimes our sponsors want a contest to only be open to their potential clients, so in those cases we have no choice to abide by their request to limit contest entry to a certain geographic area. While we don't believe in geographic discrimination, we also don't believe in spending a fortune on shipping and trying to figure out custom laws in order to get you your prize so that's why we only ship to the USA and Canada.   What does a complete mailing address look like? Short answer: ""It's what we need to put on a package to mail it to you."" It looks something like this:  416 William St. #402 Moralton, SS 70707 USA 24 Sussex Dr Ottawa, ON  K1A 0A3 Canada 1000 J.P. Laurel St. San Miguel 1005, Manila  Philippines   You'd be amazed at how many people enter our contests and leave out critical mailing information like their city, province/state and or postal/zip code. You'd also be amazed at how many people ask us ""What do you mean by complete mailing address?"" In fact, if you're reading this, it's quite possible that we referred you here because you asked that very question. Since we usually only ship to the USA and Canada, we won't disqualify you for leaving out the country, but if anything else is missing, we'll just pick another winner to replace you. We will not contact you to verify your mailing address. BTW, your name is not part of your mailing address, but we won't disqualify you for putting it in there...  Why do some contests not ship to PO Boxes? ANN usually doesn't handle shipping for our contest prizes. Shipping is done by the contest sponsor. If the contest states ""no PO boxes"" this is because our sponsor requested it. Most likely it is because they are shipping via a courier like UPS, which will not ship to PO boxes.  I'd really prefer it if you didn't post my name & city if I win This is done for legal reasons, sorry. That said, if you want to enter with an alias, that's fine as long as you are certain the package will reach you (we can't guarantee it will).  Why did you stop accepting art contest entries from Facebook By default, Facebook posts usually aren't public. Most people who submit Facebook URLs to our art contests forget to share their entries publicly, and we are often forced to disqualify these entries. It's better to just avoid the problem altogether. If you want to enter with Facebook, and you remember to make your entry public go ahead, we'll accept it. But if you forget to share it properly, we will simply ignore your entry.   Miscellaneous   Can I link to you? Yes, please feel free. Currently we don't have any banners to offer you for this, we'll be making some new ones shortly.  Can you link to me? No. We are not a link exchange site.  Wait, I can link to you, but you won't link to me?? Yes, we know it sounds a little conceited of us, but that's how it is. To be fair, we don't expect you to link to us, but we're honored if you do decide that you'd like to link to our site despite the fact that we won't be returning the favor. Please don't link to us if you're only doing it because you hope to get something in return; link to us because you feel that you want more people to know about Anime News Network.   Can we trade banners? Sorry, ANN relies on its banners to survive. We very seldom trade banners with another website or publication. If your publication is in print (10 000+ circulation) or a website with 10 million+ impressions per month, we may consider it. Please understand, ANN receives this question at least once a week, it isn't possible for us to even consider swapping / affiliating with so many sites, so we generally don't swap / affiliate with any.  Can you affiliate with us? Anime News Network would be happy to setup an affiliate program with any online store that pays referral fees provided that store meets certain pre-requisites. Anime News Network is unfortunately unable to affiliate itself with fan-sites much for the same reason that we can not link to you or trade banners with you (see above two entries).  Why'd you give this show a rating of ... in your review? Clearly it deserved a ... ! Obviously our reviewer disagrees.  When is title X coming out, how many episodes is it, and/or who is releasing it? Look it up in the encyclopedia, ask Answerman, or ask in the forum.  Why'd you make X change to the programming on [Cartoon Network, YTV, etc]? Uhh, try contacting the broadcaster, network or station. We're a news site and we have no more control over the schedule at [TV Station] than any other media source. Yes, believe it or not we get this question every so often.  I'd like to license, work on, be involved with, etc... one of your titles Just like we aren't involved in TV broadcasting, we are not licensors. Even for shows that we stream on ANN, we are not authorized to sub-license them to other companies. Contact the producers or the licensors, not us.  I'd like permission to do something with one of your titles Sorry, we do not control copyright permissions for any anime or manga. If you need permission to do something, contact the local licensee / master licensor; or failing that, contact the master licensor in Japan. A bit of advice though, for personal, non commercial projects, don't bother contacting them unless you absolutely need permission. They don't care if you make a 1-off t-shirt to wear to school, but if you ask them, they'll probably say ""No,"" as a matter of policy. Sorry we can not help you get in contact with a rights holder.  Why'd you take my video show off YouTube? We get this question a lot. We didn't take your video down. See the above answer as well as the first one. ANN has no involvement in the process of taking pirated materials off of websites like YouTube. For your information, the material was probably taken down because it was uploaded without permission (therefore illegally) and the licensors want you to watch it somewhere they will make money (on DVD, on TV, or on an authorized website). Go here for a list of places where you can legally watch anime and support the creators at the same time.  On a related note, allow us to point out that your video was probably automatically removed by a technology called video-fingerprinting. By this semi-automated process, YouTube removes videos that it believes infringe on copyrights without waiting for complaints from copyright holders. So it's quite possible that no anime company was involved in the removal of your video.   Sadly, this process can affect videos that are legitimate ""fair-use."" Even more sadly, the employees at the anime companies are too busy to bother reading all the e-mails they get about videos (the vast majority of are from morons that don't understand that ""I wasn't making money"" doesn't make it okay) so you can e-mail them to your hearts content, but they probably won't answer (not because they're fan-hating assholes, but because they don't have the time).    If you believe your video is legitimate fair-use (full episodes are never fair use, significant episode clips are rarely fair use, AMVs are almost never fair use of the music) try posting it again and include in the description why you feel it is fair use. If you're lucky, YouTube will take this into consideration (some videos are deleted automatically, others are looked at by a human employee at YouTube after the fingerprinting process identifies them) and not delete your video. You really should read up on ""fair use"" before you make any claims that your video is fair use though. And by ""read-up,"" we mean read professional, expert explanations, not your friend's blog.   I have a great idea for an anime or manga, where do I submit it? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not involved with the creation process of any anime or manga and we can not put you in contact with creators (more on that here). Finally, we'd recommend you read this and this.  How do I get your television channel? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not The Anime Network (TAN). For details on TAN, read the transcript of our chat with them, read our TAN news coverage, or visit their website.  Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? No. As a policy, ANN never gives out contact information. Don't send us this question unless you've exhausted every other resource available (phone book, 411, Google, their website, etc...), even then, we will only forward your request to them, and we will only do so provided it is a business-to-business request being made by a company we've actually heard of. If you can't find Hayao Miyazaki's e-mail address online, it's probably because he doesn't want to receive a thousand e-mails a day. The one exception to this rule is that we will give out the Public Relations / Press Relations (PR) contact information for a company provided we have it readily available. Generally you can find this information on your own though, so please don't be lazy. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? I'm an old acquaintance of theirs. The answer is still no. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? They worked on one of your projects. Just to be clear, our encyclopedia carries information about a myriad of projects (anime,manga, etc...) most of which (99.9%) Anime News Network is not, and never was, involved with. It is not a list of our projects. So if the person actually worked for ANN, please see this answer, but if they are one of the 67023+ people listed in the encyclopedia, they probably didn't work for us and therefore the previous two answers apply. Okay, I understand, you can't or won't put me in contact with them, but I really want/need to contact this person. Can you offer any suggestions on how to proceed? Depending on who you're trying to contact, they might have a fanclub, official webpage, or e-mail address listed in their encyclopedia entry. If not, try looking for the latest production they worked on and contacting the production company, they might be able and willing to forward your e-mail. Just a note, if you're contacting someone in Japan, it's highly recommended that at least your intro be in Japanese. Even if your intended recipient understands English, the person you ask to forward your e-mail might not. For your benefit, here's a quick intro you can prepend to any e-mail you send to Japan (replaces the blanks by the name of the person you are trying to contact): ご担当者様へ お世話になっております。 本社は____様にご連絡を取りたがっています。お手数ですが、このメールを____様へ転送して頂けないでしょうか? 宜しくお願いします。  Literally: To whom it may concern/the person in charge: Thank you for your time. We are trying to contact _____. If it isn't too much trouble, could you forward this e-mail to ____? Thank you very much.    Can you send me your catalog? We don't have a catalog, we don't sell anything.  Where can I buy Anime ? You can buy it at retail movie stores like Blockbuster and Suncoast as well as specialty Anime Shops. You can also buy it online at websites like Anime Castle, Anime Nation, J List, Roberts Anime Corner Store and The Right Stuf International.  Where can I download anime or watch it online? For the most part, you can't legally download anime online. Fansubs are generally illegal (whether or not they're unethical is a completely different topic), and as such, we can't help you obtain them. You might want to check the sites listed below, and read our news, when there's legal anime to download or watched online we generally mention it.  Don't ask us where to get bootlegs or fansubs, we won't tell you.  Some sites/services that allow you to download or watch anime online legally(may or may not be free):  Amazon Prime crunchyroll Funimation's Website HiDive Apple iTunes hulu Netflix Viz Anime  * Why isn't YouTube listed? Because a lot of the content on YouTube is illegally uploaded. One day we'll have an index of legal anime on YouTube, but until then we aren't listing it as a site where all content is legal/authorized.   How do I watch anime on ANN? ANN has stopped streaming anime episodes. Go to the websites above!  Can you help me with my school assignment No. We get this question about once a week, and we don't really want to spend 25 hours a year answering school questions. The worst part is that most people who e-mail us are actually asking us to provide information they could find with a little bit of research, in other words, they're asking us to do their work for them. On the other hand, if you're working on a master's project or PhD thesis related to anime, that interests us, so we'd probably be more than happy to help.  Does ANN offer Internships? Yes, Anime News Network offers internships in our newsroom and our web-development departments. Further details are available here   What happened to ANN UK? In late May the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into effect. The EU determined that any website targeting European readers would be ""doing business in Europe."" Anime News Network does not disagree with this conclusion. Unfortunately, the GDPR requires all websites doing business in Europe to meet a stringent set of privacy regulations. While ANN supports the intent of these regulations, some of them are extremely difficult to comply with. While it is our intention, for the benefit of all readers our readers around the world, to comply with these new standards, we are not able to do so immediately. Once we are fully compliant with GDPR requirements, we will re-launch ANN UK. In the meantime, ANN's global edition is available to all readers worldwide and is the default version for readers outside of North America, Australia, New Zealand and South East Asia.             bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Misc Page homepage / archives      ",positive,en,{}

Does ANN offer Internships? What happened to ANN UK?    About ANN  What is Anime News Network (ANN)? Anime News Network was created as a news source that focuses on the medium of Japanese Animation(anime) and Japanese Comics (manga). ANN was founded by Justin Sevakis in July of 1998, and has since lead the online anime news medium with a tradition of strong unbiased coverage of major breaking news. With in-depth coverage, analysis and commentary to provide insight into the world of anime and manga, ANN has been and continues to be the #1 English language source for anime and manga news on the Internet. ANN's goal is to make the latest, most comprehensive Anime news available to new fans and veteran Otaku alike.  What ANN is not:  A television network or station; A subsidiary of another company; A dubbing / voice recording studio; An animation company; A licensing or distribution company; A manufacturer or distributor of merchandise; For sale.    What is anime? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of anime, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, anime is animation that is primarily produced and conceived in Japan. This includes animation conceived in Japan that has portions outsourced to other countries, but does not include animation primarily produced outside Japan and with the animation outsourced to Japan. It does however include animation that is co-conceived inside and outside of Japan and at least partially produced inside Japan.  What is manga? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of manga, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, manga are comic books or strips that are produced and conceived in Japan. This includes include comics that are co-conceived inside and outside of Japan but produced in Japan.  Who operates ANN? ANN is operated by a team of people, under the guidance of Christopher Macdonald, Daniel DeLorme, Zac Bertschy, Egan Loo and Hori Shinsuke. A full list of the staff can be found on the staff page.   Who owns ANN? The website is owned by Anime News Network Inc., a privately owned corporation. The corporation's shareholders include: Christopher Macdonald (Minority owner, controlling shareholder), Hori Shinsuke (Minority owner), Anime Consortium Japan (Minority owner), others.   Where is ANN based? Wow, that question is so 1999! ANN is based everywhere and nowhere. We're based on the Internet! We don't have an office; our staff all work at home and are based around the world with the most full-time staff based in Japan and the United States. Anime News Network, Inc. the corporation that maintains ANN is a Canadian corporation.  Who is the mascot? When the site was first launched in 1998 it featured a blond-haired mascot named Jadress, created by Robin Sevakis. She was eventually replaced by Nina, who was featured in a webcomic (also created by Robin Sevakis) that ran from 2007 to 2013.  How often do you update? The site is run on a daily content format, as opposed to a monthly or bi-monthly magazine format. We update the news and reviews daily, and other content, such as features, columns, and editorials are also added throughout the week. Our encyclopedia is updated daily as well.  Under what settings is ANN best viewed? The site uses a responsive design that should look good at any resolution, from smartphones to large desktop screens.  How do I find older articles on ANN? Links to archives for news, features, columns, reviews, etc. can be found in their respective sections in the menu. You can also use the search engine.  What was used to make the site, as well as maintain it? The site is a combination of older parts in PHP and newer parts in Ruby, with a MySQL database to manage the content. Apart from the phpBB forum, we haven't used any pre-made packages; all the content is managed and presented with custom software.  How do I get permission to reprint an ANN Story, or obtain an ANN graphic or photo? ANN has a newsfeed program where you can get the latest anime news headlines on your very own website. If you wish to entirely reprint anything on your site please contact the editors. For more details about what you can and can not re-print with or without our permission, see our copyright statement.  How many people hear or read an ANN story? We get a bit over 200,000 visits every day. In addition to regular visitors, ANN's news is often sourced in print and occasionally on the airwaves.  How can I get in touch with the staff? Visit our contact page or visit our staff page for further contact and personal information. If a member's e-mail address is not there you can send your comments to the editors and we'll forward them.  Do you attend any public events? Yes. ANN tries to provide coverage to as many anime conventions/festivals/symposiums as our staff can manage. For more details on this see our events section and our events forum.  Do you have a newsfeed? You really should have an RSS newsfeed! Look at our newsfeed section for links to various RSS & Atom feeds as well as our custom newsfeed program. Submitting Content  How should I submit news ? Send an e-mail to [email protected] , this e-mail address is regularly monitored by several staff (someone is always ""on duty""). Other methods (e-mail directly to staff, PM, Forum, Twitter, etc...) are less reliable, and may lead to delays and/or a complete failure to notice your submission.  I have something to say about an online petition. Stop. Virtually every e-petition is a waste of time.   I submitted a news item, why wasn't it posted? We could still be in the process of verifying the details, we may not have been able to verify the items, or perhaps we didn't find it newsworthy enough to post. On a ""slow"" news day we're more likely to post less significant items.  I submitted a news item, why was it credited to someone else? They either submitted it first--or more importantly--submitted more information.  Can I submit news about a non-Japanese animation? No. We're Anime News Network, not ""Animation News Network"", not ""Asian Animation Network."" There's plenty of good animation from around the world, including Korea and China, but we only cover Japanese animation, not French, Mexican, Chinese, African, Korean or Afghanistanimation.  Can I submit a review? / How do I become a reviewer? Anime News Network does not accept unsolicited reviews. Take a quick look at the Staff Openings page, if there is an opening, it will be mentioned there. More often than not, we hire experienced writers who are known to us. Best piece of advice we can give is to make a name for yourself then we'll come to you when the time is right.  Can I submit an article? If you are an experienced writer/journalist with a portfolio you can point to, please E-mail the editors and ask about the topic, we'd be glad to consider your article idea.  Can I have a column? No. Only previous, regular contributors who have shown an ability to consistently write timely, quality articles (or reviews) are permitted to write columns. Try submitting some articles or reviews first.  Information X is missing from the Encyclopedia, can you add it? We can't add it, but YOU can. The Encyclopedia is a user-contributed database; it's made specially so that you can add missing information by yourself. You just need a user account. So please do take the time to register and submit the information you found was missing. Each page contains pointers about how to add information, and if that's not enough you can check the Encyclopedia FAQ or the memoranda.  How can I contribute to the encyclopedia? Any registered user can contribute standard data to the Encyclopedia for Anime, Manga and People. But if that's not enough for you and you're near the top of the contributors list and you'd like to help out with the releases, lexicon, or editing and verifying data submitted by other people, please contact the Encyclopedist.  Please note, that we'll be looking for someone who is inputting quality data, not just large amounts of data.   What if I want to contribute in some other way? We always appreciate whatever help and support that readers can give. If you'd like to help out at ANN in a way other than the ones described above, please contact the editors. There's so much to do at ANN that we're very appreciative of any help offered.   My company is making Anime, can you post a news article about it? Sorry, too many companies are trying to cash in on the popularity of Anime by making cartoons with big eyes and purple hair. We're sure you aren't like that, but... well actually, we aren't sure.  Why doesn't Anime News Network review world manga? Please see our definition of manga. It is Anime News Network's official position, and the personal belief of many of our staff, than there is nothing inheritently superior about Japanese manga when compared to world manga. However Anime News Network's purpose is to cover Japanese animation and comic books. Currently we do not have the resources to review all the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America. If and when we are able to review 100% of the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America, we will then consider expanding our area of review coverage to include manga-style comics (world manga) that originate outside of Japan.  Why didn't you post a news article about my (company's) new Anime or Manga? If your item is picked up in a distribution deal by a company that isn't being run out of someone's garage, then maybe its newsworthy. So when that happens, give us a shout, and we'll consider it, but if you can't tell us what makes your creation manga or anime (other than big eyes, purple hair and the like) you can pretty much forget it.  May I send you my company's product to review? If it's anime or manga-related, then yes. Contact editors[at]animenewsnetwork.com for shipping information.  I'm starting a new webmanga, is it news? No, there are a billion and one ""webmangas"", and most only last a couple of months. Now, if your webmanga gets licensed by a publisher... that might be news.  Can you mention my site? Only if you do something newsworthy, sorry.  Why have we been blacklisted? ANN has a 2-strikes rule regarding inappropriate PR. After 2 strikes for the following reasons we will blacklist your company or PR firm (when we blacklist a PR firm, we notify their relevant clients). i) Completely irrelevant PR that has nothing to do with anime, manga, Japanese pop-culture or any other related content; ii) Unauthorized stealth marketing on our forums; iii) Harassing our staff; iv) Continued PR submissions to inappropriate e-mail address. v) Any attempt to illicitly influence editorial We'll send you a link to this post after your first offense. After your second offense you'll never hear from us again (and our readers will never hear from you or your clients).  Isn't this a bit harsh? Perhaps, but we're tired of getting PRs for toilets, accounting firm management changes and World War 2 museums.   But we offer an opt-out! Clicking that link might opt us out of all your press releases, including your relevant ones. It would be the same as blacklisting you, without giving you the warning. Showing you this warning is actually less harsh than clicking your opt-out.  Forum / Account  I didn't receive my forum registration. If you are using a spam filter, please check your spam folder, some mail servers catch the registration code as spam. Search your spamfolder & inbox for e-mail from [email protected] or [email protected]. If you are using any sort of white list, please make sure that your e-mail account is set up to accept e-mails from [email protected] and [email protected]. If you are using a mail service that bounces the e-mail back to the sender and asks them to confirm that it is not spam, we will not do that. These services usually allow you to add the e-mail address to a white-list before hand. Once you have checked all of the above, you can have the server re-send you your activation code by going here. It should be instant, but sometimes e-mail is slow, give it a couple hours (the slowness is usually not because of our server). If you still don't get your activation code, then and ONLY then, e-mail us at [email protected] make sure that: 1) Your e-mail is sent from the e-mail address you submitted to ANN; 2) You include your user name; 3) Do not send us your password; 4) The subject of your e-mail must be ""activation code"".   How do I become a moderator? You're invited. When we feel there is a need for a new moderator, we look at our best forum users (the ones that contribute intelligently to conversation and act maturely) and ask them if they'd be willing to help us moderate the forum.  Will there ever be an off topic / general conversation forum among the forums? Not in the public areas, no. We do however maintain a community section for subscribers, and off-topic discussion is permitted there.  Why aren't my posts showing up? Posts from new users sometimes take a while to show up. Please be patient, they should appear within a few hours. Believe it or not, this is a ""feature"" not a ""bug.""  Is there a set of forum rules? Right here - read them if you haven't already.  Help, I've been banned or moderated! Read this.  How do I attach a picture (avatar) to my account? Read this.  Can I change my user name? You can make changes in your user account settings. But because other users depend on your username to recognize you, we have a ""no identity switcheroos"" policy: once you start using the forum we do not allow changes to your username beyond punctuation and capitalization.  Can I delete my account? Yes, you can. Go to your account settings page and you will be able to delete your account from there. Contests  Can I enter give-aways more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No.  Can I enter creative contests more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, Yes.  Does ANN ""own"" my entry? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No. But as a condition of your entry we generaly require you to give us the unrevocable right to display your entry on Anime News Network for all eternity.  Can I display my entry elsewhere? Yes, anywhere you please, unless otherwise stated in the contest rules.  Why do I have to put your logo and/or the sponsor's logo on my submission There are two reasons for this. First, it adds some extra benefit to the contest sponsors and second, it helps us insure that you made the entry for the contest, instead of just grabing some existing art and submiting it.  Explain those rules about where I live and whether or not I can enter and if you will ship me a prize. Most of our contest are open to anyone, regardless of where you live, because we don't believe in geographic discrimination. However sometimes our sponsors want a contest to only be open to their potential clients, so in those cases we have no choice to abide by their request to limit contest entry to a certain geographic area. While we don't believe in geographic discrimination, we also don't believe in spending a fortune on shipping and trying to figure out custom laws in order to get you your prize so that's why we only ship to the USA and Canada.   What does a complete mailing address look like? Short answer: ""It's what we need to put on a package to mail it to you."" It looks something like this:  416 William St. #402 Moralton, SS 70707 USA 24 Sussex Dr Ottawa, ON  K1A 0A3 Canada 1000 J.P. Laurel St. San Miguel 1005, Manila  Philippines   You'd be amazed at how many people enter our contests and leave out critical mailing information like their city, province/state and or postal/zip code. You'd also be amazed at how many people ask us ""What do you mean by complete mailing address?"" In fact, if you're reading this, it's quite possible that we referred you here because you asked that very question. Since we usually only ship to the USA and Canada, we won't disqualify you for leaving out the country, but if anything else is missing, we'll just pick another winner to replace you. We will not contact you to verify your mailing address. BTW, your name is not part of your mailing address, but we won't disqualify you for putting it in there...  Why do some contests not ship to PO Boxes? ANN usually doesn't handle shipping for our contest prizes. Shipping is done by the contest sponsor. If the contest states ""no PO boxes"" this is because our sponsor requested it. Most likely it is because they are shipping via a courier like UPS, which will not ship to PO boxes.  I'd really prefer it if you didn't post my name & city if I win This is done for legal reasons, sorry. That said, if you want to enter with an alias, that's fine as long as you are certain the package will reach you (we can't guarantee it will).  Why did you stop accepting art contest entries from Facebook By default, Facebook posts usually aren't public. Most people who submit Facebook URLs to our art contests forget to share their entries publicly, and we are often forced to disqualify these entries. It's better to just avoid the problem altogether. If you want to enter with Facebook, and you remember to make your entry public go ahead, we'll accept it. But if you forget to share it properly, we will simply ignore your entry.   Miscellaneous   Can I link to you? Yes, please feel free. Currently we don't have any banners to offer you for this, we'll be making some new ones shortly.  Can you link to me? No. We are not a link exchange site.  Wait, I can link to you, but you won't link to me?? Yes, we know it sounds a little conceited of us, but that's how it is. To be fair, we don't expect you to link to us, but we're honored if you do decide that you'd like to link to our site despite the fact that we won't be returning the favor. Please don't link to us if you're only doing it because you hope to get something in return; link to us because you feel that you want more people to know about Anime News Network.   Can we trade banners? Sorry, ANN relies on its banners to survive. We very seldom trade banners with another website or publication. If your publication is in print (10 000+ circulation) or a website with 10 million+ impressions per month, we may consider it. Please understand, ANN receives this question at least once a week, it isn't possible for us to even consider swapping / affiliating with so many sites, so we generally don't swap / affiliate with any.  Can you affiliate with us? Anime News Network would be happy to setup an affiliate program with any online store that pays referral fees provided that store meets certain pre-requisites. Anime News Network is unfortunately unable to affiliate itself with fan-sites much for the same reason that we can not link to you or trade banners with you (see above two entries).  Why'd you give this show a rating of ... in your review? Clearly it deserved a ... ! Obviously our reviewer disagrees.  When is title X coming out, how many episodes is it, and/or who is releasing it? Look it up in the encyclopedia, ask Answerman, or ask in the forum.  Why'd you make X change to the programming on [Cartoon Network, YTV, etc]? Uhh, try contacting the broadcaster, network or station. We're a news site and we have no more control over the schedule at [TV Station] than any other media source. Yes, believe it or not we get this question every so often.  I'd like to license, work on, be involved with, etc... one of your titles Just like we aren't involved in TV broadcasting, we are not licensors. Even for shows that we stream on ANN, we are not authorized to sub-license them to other companies. Contact the producers or the licensors, not us.  I'd like permission to do something with one of your titles Sorry, we do not control copyright permissions for any anime or manga. If you need permission to do something, contact the local licensee / master licensor; or failing that, contact the master licensor in Japan. A bit of advice though, for personal, non commercial projects, don't bother contacting them unless you absolutely need permission. They don't care if you make a 1-off t-shirt to wear to school, but if you ask them, they'll probably say ""No,"" as a matter of policy. Sorry we can not help you get in contact with a rights holder.  Why'd you take my video show off YouTube? We get this question a lot. We didn't take your video down. See the above answer as well as the first one. ANN has no involvement in the process of taking pirated materials off of websites like YouTube. For your information, the material was probably taken down because it was uploaded without permission (therefore illegally) and the licensors want you to watch it somewhere they will make money (on DVD, on TV, or on an authorized website). Go here for a list of places where you can legally watch anime and support the creators at the same time.  On a related note, allow us to point out that your video was probably automatically removed by a technology called video-fingerprinting. By this semi-automated process, YouTube removes videos that it believes infringe on copyrights without waiting for complaints from copyright holders. So it's quite possible that no anime company was involved in the removal of your video.   Sadly, this process can affect videos that are legitimate ""fair-use."" Even more sadly, the employees at the anime companies are too busy to bother reading all the e-mails they get about videos (the vast majority of are from morons that don't understand that ""I wasn't making money"" doesn't make it okay) so you can e-mail them to your hearts content, but they probably won't answer (not because they're fan-hating assholes, but because they don't have the time).    If you believe your video is legitimate fair-use (full episodes are never fair use, significant episode clips are rarely fair use, AMVs are almost never fair use of the music) try posting it again and include in the description why you feel it is fair use. If you're lucky, YouTube will take this into consideration (some videos are deleted automatically, others are looked at by a human employee at YouTube after the fingerprinting process identifies them) and not delete your video. You really should read up on ""fair use"" before you make any claims that your video is fair use though. And by ""read-up,"" we mean read professional, expert explanations, not your friend's blog.   I have a great idea for an anime or manga, where do I submit it? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not involved with the creation process of any anime or manga and we can not put you in contact with creators (more on that here). Finally, we'd recommend you read this and this.  How do I get your television channel? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not The Anime Network (TAN). For details on TAN, read the transcript of our chat with them, read our TAN news coverage, or visit their website.  Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? No. As a policy, ANN never gives out contact information. Don't send us this question unless you've exhausted every other resource available (phone book, 411, Google, their website, etc...), even then, we will only forward your request to them, and we will only do so provided it is a business-to-business request being made by a company we've actually heard of. If you can't find Hayao Miyazaki's e-mail address online, it's probably because he doesn't want to receive a thousand e-mails a day. The one exception to this rule is that we will give out the Public Relations / Press Relations (PR) contact information for a company provided we have it readily available. Generally you can find this information on your own though, so please don't be lazy. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? I'm an old acquaintance of theirs. The answer is still no. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? They worked on one of your projects. Just to be clear, our encyclopedia carries information about a myriad of projects (anime,manga, etc...) most of which (99.9%) Anime News Network is not, and never was, involved with. It is not a list of our projects. So if the person actually worked for ANN, please see this answer, but if they are one of the 67023+ people listed in the encyclopedia, they probably didn't work for us and therefore the previous two answers apply. Okay, I understand, you can't or won't put me in contact with them, but I really want/need to contact this person. Can you offer any suggestions on how to proceed? Depending on who you're trying to contact, they might have a fanclub, official webpage, or e-mail address listed in their encyclopedia entry. If not, try looking for the latest production they worked on and contacting the production company, they might be able and willing to forward your e-mail. Just a note, if you're contacting someone in Japan, it's highly recommended that at least your intro be in Japanese. Even if your intended recipient understands English, the person you ask to forward your e-mail might not. For your benefit, here's a quick intro you can prepend to any e-mail you send to Japan (replaces the blanks by the name of the person you are trying to contact): ご担当者様へ お世話になっております。 本社は____様にご連絡を取りたがっています。お手数ですが、このメールを____様へ転送して頂けないでしょうか? 宜しくお願いします。  Literally: To whom it may concern/the person in charge: Thank you for your time. We are trying to contact _____. If it isn't too much trouble, could you forward this e-mail to ____? Thank you very much.    Can you send me your catalog? We don't have a catalog, we don't sell anything.  Where can I buy Anime ? You can buy it at retail movie stores like Blockbuster and Suncoast as well as specialty Anime Shops. You can also buy it online at websites like Anime Castle, Anime Nation, J List, Roberts Anime Corner Store and The Right Stuf International.  Where can I download anime or watch it online? For the most part, you can't legally download anime online. Fansubs are generally illegal (whether or not they're unethical is a completely different topic), and as such, we can't help you obtain them. You might want to check the sites listed below, and read our news, when there's legal anime to download or watched online we generally mention it.  Don't ask us where to get bootlegs or fansubs, we won't tell you.  Some sites/services that allow you to download or watch anime online legally(may or may not be free):  Amazon Prime crunchyroll Funimation's Website HiDive Apple iTunes hulu Netflix Viz Anime  * Why isn't YouTube listed? Because a lot of the content on YouTube is illegally uploaded. One day we'll have an index of legal anime on YouTube, but until then we aren't listing it as a site where all content is legal/authorized.   How do I watch anime on ANN? ANN has stopped streaming anime episodes. Go to the websites above!  Can you help me with my school assignment No. We get this question about once a week, and we don't really want to spend 25 hours a year answering school questions. The worst part is that most people who e-mail us are actually asking us to provide information they could find with a little bit of research, in other words, they're asking us to do their work for them. On the other hand, if you're working on a master's project or PhD thesis related to anime, that interests us, so we'd probably be more than happy to help.  Does ANN offer Internships? Yes, Anime News Network offers internships in our newsroom and our web-development departments. Further details are available here   What happened to ANN UK? In late May the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into effect. The EU determined that any website targeting European readers would be ""doing business in Europe."" Anime News Network does not disagree with this conclusion. Unfortunately, the GDPR requires all websites doing business in Europe to meet a stringent set of privacy regulations. While ANN supports the intent of these regulations, some of them are extremely difficult to comply with. While it is our intention, for the benefit of all readers our readers around the world, to comply with these new standards, we are not able to do so immediately. Once we are fully compliant with GDPR requirements, we will re-launch ANN UK. In the meantime, ANN's global edition is available to all readers worldwide and is the default version for readers outside of North America, Australia, New Zealand and South East Asia.             bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Misc Page homepage / archives     ",positive,en,{}

Does ANN offer Internships? What happened to ANN UK?    About ANN  What is Anime News Network (ANN)? Anime News Network was created as a news source that focuses on the medium of Japanese Animation(anime) and Japanese Comics (manga). ANN was founded by Justin Sevakis in July of 1998, and has since lead the online anime news medium with a tradition of strong unbiased coverage of major breaking news. With in-depth coverage, analysis and commentary to provide insight into the world of anime and manga, ANN has been and continues to be the #1 English language source for anime and manga news on the Internet. ANN's goal is to make the latest, most comprehensive Anime news available to new fans and veteran Otaku alike.  What ANN is not:  A television network or station; A subsidiary of another company; A dubbing / voice recording studio; An animation company; A licensing or distribution company; A manufacturer or distributor of merchandise; For sale.    What is anime? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of anime, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, anime is animation that is primarily produced and conceived in Japan. This includes animation conceived in Japan that has portions outsourced to other countries, but does not include animation primarily produced outside Japan and with the animation outsourced to Japan. It does however include animation that is co-conceived inside and outside of Japan and at least partially produced inside Japan.  What is manga? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of manga, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, manga are comic books or strips that are produced and conceived in Japan. This includes include comics that are co-conceived inside and outside of Japan but produced in Japan.  Who operates ANN? ANN is operated by a team of people, under the guidance of Christopher Macdonald, Daniel DeLorme, Zac Bertschy, Egan Loo and Hori Shinsuke. A full list of the staff can be found on the staff page.   Who owns ANN? The website is owned by Anime News Network Inc., a privately owned corporation. The corporation's shareholders include: Christopher Macdonald (Minority owner, controlling shareholder), Hori Shinsuke (Minority owner), Anime Consortium Japan (Minority owner), others.   Where is ANN based? Wow, that question is so 1999! ANN is based everywhere and nowhere. We're based on the Internet! We don't have an office; our staff all work at home and are based around the world with the most full-time staff based in Japan and the United States. Anime News Network, Inc. the corporation that maintains ANN is a Canadian corporation.  Who is the mascot? When the site was first launched in 1998 it featured a blond-haired mascot named Jadress, created by Robin Sevakis. She was eventually replaced by Nina, who was featured in a webcomic (also created by Robin Sevakis) that ran from 2007 to 2013.  How often do you update? The site is run on a daily content format, as opposed to a monthly or bi-monthly magazine format. We update the news and reviews daily, and other content, such as features, columns, and editorials are also added throughout the week. Our encyclopedia is updated daily as well.  Under what settings is ANN best viewed? The site uses a responsive design that should look good at any resolution, from smartphones to large desktop screens.  How do I find older articles on ANN? Links to archives for news, features, columns, reviews, etc. can be found in their respective sections in the menu. You can also use the search engine.  What was used to make the site, as well as maintain it? The site is a combination of older parts in PHP and newer parts in Ruby, with a MySQL database to manage the content. Apart from the phpBB forum, we haven't used any pre-made packages; all the content is managed and presented with custom software.  How do I get permission to reprint an ANN Story, or obtain an ANN graphic or photo? ANN has a newsfeed program where you can get the latest anime news headlines on your very own website. If you wish to entirely reprint anything on your site please contact the editors. For more details about what you can and can not re-print with or without our permission, see our copyright statement.  How many people hear or read an ANN story? We get a bit over 200,000 visits every day. In addition to regular visitors, ANN's news is often sourced in print and occasionally on the airwaves.  How can I get in touch with the staff? Visit our contact page or visit our staff page for further contact and personal information. If a member's e-mail address is not there you can send your comments to the editors and we'll forward them.  Do you attend any public events? Yes. ANN tries to provide coverage to as many anime conventions/festivals/symposiums as our staff can manage. For more details on this see our events section and our events forum.  Do you have a newsfeed? You really should have an RSS newsfeed! Look at our newsfeed section for links to various RSS & Atom feeds as well as our custom newsfeed program. Submitting Content  How should I submit news ? Send an e-mail to [email protected] , this e-mail address is regularly monitored by several staff (someone is always ""on duty""). Other methods (e-mail directly to staff, PM, Forum, Twitter, etc...) are less reliable, and may lead to delays and/or a complete failure to notice your submission.  I have something to say about an online petition. Stop. Virtually every e-petition is a waste of time.   I submitted a news item, why wasn't it posted? We could still be in the process of verifying the details, we may not have been able to verify the items, or perhaps we didn't find it newsworthy enough to post. On a ""slow"" news day we're more likely to post less significant items.  I submitted a news item, why was it credited to someone else? They either submitted it first--or more importantly--submitted more information.  Can I submit news about a non-Japanese animation? No. We're Anime News Network, not ""Animation News Network"", not ""Asian Animation Network."" There's plenty of good animation from around the world, including Korea and China, but we only cover Japanese animation, not French, Mexican, Chinese, African, Korean or Afghanistanimation.  Can I submit a review? / How do I become a reviewer? Anime News Network does not accept unsolicited reviews. Take a quick look at the Staff Openings page, if there is an opening, it will be mentioned there. More often than not, we hire experienced writers who are known to us. Best piece of advice we can give is to make a name for yourself then we'll come to you when the time is right.  Can I submit an article? If you are an experienced writer/journalist with a portfolio you can point to, please E-mail the editors and ask about the topic, we'd be glad to consider your article idea.  Can I have a column? No. Only previous, regular contributors who have shown an ability to consistently write timely, quality articles (or reviews) are permitted to write columns. Try submitting some articles or reviews first.  Information X is missing from the Encyclopedia, can you add it? We can't add it, but YOU can. The Encyclopedia is a user-contributed database; it's made specially so that you can add missing information by yourself. You just need a user account. So please do take the time to register and submit the information you found was missing. Each page contains pointers about how to add information, and if that's not enough you can check the Encyclopedia FAQ or the memoranda.  How can I contribute to the encyclopedia? Any registered user can contribute standard data to the Encyclopedia for Anime, Manga and People. But if that's not enough for you and you're near the top of the contributors list and you'd like to help out with the releases, lexicon, or editing and verifying data submitted by other people, please contact the Encyclopedist.  Please note, that we'll be looking for someone who is inputting quality data, not just large amounts of data.   What if I want to contribute in some other way? We always appreciate whatever help and support that readers can give. If you'd like to help out at ANN in a way other than the ones described above, please contact the editors. There's so much to do at ANN that we're very appreciative of any help offered.   My company is making Anime, can you post a news article about it? Sorry, too many companies are trying to cash in on the popularity of Anime by making cartoons with big eyes and purple hair. We're sure you aren't like that, but... well actually, we aren't sure.  Why doesn't Anime News Network review world manga? Please see our definition of manga. It is Anime News Network's official position, and the personal belief of many of our staff, than there is nothing inheritently superior about Japanese manga when compared to world manga. However Anime News Network's purpose is to cover Japanese animation and comic books. Currently we do not have the resources to review all the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America. If and when we are able to review 100% of the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America, we will then consider expanding our area of review coverage to include manga-style comics (world manga) that originate outside of Japan.  Why didn't you post a news article about my (company's) new Anime or Manga? If your item is picked up in a distribution deal by a company that isn't being run out of someone's garage, then maybe its newsworthy. So when that happens, give us a shout, and we'll consider it, but if you can't tell us what makes your creation manga or anime (other than big eyes, purple hair and the like) you can pretty much forget it.  May I send you my company's product to review? If it's anime or manga-related, then yes. Contact editors[at]animenewsnetwork.com for shipping information.  I'm starting a new webmanga, is it news? No, there are a billion and one ""webmangas"", and most only last a couple of months. Now, if your webmanga gets licensed by a publisher... that might be news.  Can you mention my site? Only if you do something newsworthy, sorry.  Why have we been blacklisted? ANN has a 2-strikes rule regarding inappropriate PR. After 2 strikes for the following reasons we will blacklist your company or PR firm (when we blacklist a PR firm, we notify their relevant clients). i) Completely irrelevant PR that has nothing to do with anime, manga, Japanese pop-culture or any other related content; ii) Unauthorized stealth marketing on our forums; iii) Harassing our staff; iv) Continued PR submissions to inappropriate e-mail address. v) Any attempt to illicitly influence editorial We'll send you a link to this post after your first offense. After your second offense you'll never hear from us again (and our readers will never hear from you or your clients).  Isn't this a bit harsh? Perhaps, but we're tired of getting PRs for toilets, accounting firm management changes and World War 2 museums.   But we offer an opt-out! Clicking that link might opt us out of all your press releases, including your relevant ones. It would be the same as blacklisting you, without giving you the warning. Showing you this warning is actually less harsh than clicking your opt-out.  Forum / Account  I didn't receive my forum registration. If you are using a spam filter, please check your spam folder, some mail servers catch the registration code as spam. Search your spamfolder & inbox for e-mail from [email protected] or [email protected]. If you are using any sort of white list, please make sure that your e-mail account is set up to accept e-mails from [email protected] and [email protected]. If you are using a mail service that bounces the e-mail back to the sender and asks them to confirm that it is not spam, we will not do that. These services usually allow you to add the e-mail address to a white-list before hand. Once you have checked all of the above, you can have the server re-send you your activation code by going here. It should be instant, but sometimes e-mail is slow, give it a couple hours (the slowness is usually not because of our server). If you still don't get your activation code, then and ONLY then, e-mail us at [email protected] make sure that: 1) Your e-mail is sent from the e-mail address you submitted to ANN; 2) You include your user name; 3) Do not send us your password; 4) The subject of your e-mail must be ""activation code"".   How do I become a moderator? You're invited. When we feel there is a need for a new moderator, we look at our best forum users (the ones that contribute intelligently to conversation and act maturely) and ask them if they'd be willing to help us moderate the forum.  Will there ever be an off topic / general conversation forum among the forums? Not in the public areas, no. We do however maintain a community section for subscribers, and off-topic discussion is permitted there.  Why aren't my posts showing up? Posts from new users sometimes take a while to show up. Please be patient, they should appear within a few hours. Believe it or not, this is a ""feature"" not a ""bug.""  Is there a set of forum rules? Right here - read them if you haven't already.  Help, I've been banned or moderated! Read this.  How do I attach a picture (avatar) to my account? Read this.  Can I change my user name? You can make changes in your user account settings. But because other users depend on your username to recognize you, we have a ""no identity switcheroos"" policy: once you start using the forum we do not allow changes to your username beyond punctuation and capitalization.  Can I delete my account? Yes, you can. Go to your account settings page and you will be able to delete your account from there. Contests  Can I enter give-aways more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No.  Can I enter creative contests more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, Yes.  Does ANN ""own"" my entry? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No. But as a condition of your entry we generaly require you to give us the unrevocable right to display your entry on Anime News Network for all eternity.  Can I display my entry elsewhere? Yes, anywhere you please, unless otherwise stated in the contest rules.  Why do I have to put your logo and/or the sponsor's logo on my submission There are two reasons for this. First, it adds some extra benefit to the contest sponsors and second, it helps us insure that you made the entry for the contest, instead of just grabing some existing art and submiting it.  Explain those rules about where I live and whether or not I can enter and if you will ship me a prize. Most of our contest are open to anyone, regardless of where you live, because we don't believe in geographic discrimination. However sometimes our sponsors want a contest to only be open to their potential clients, so in those cases we have no choice to abide by their request to limit contest entry to a certain geographic area. While we don't believe in geographic discrimination, we also don't believe in spending a fortune on shipping and trying to figure out custom laws in order to get you your prize so that's why we only ship to the USA and Canada.   What does a complete mailing address look like? Short answer: ""It's what we need to put on a package to mail it to you."" It looks something like this:  416 William St. #402 Moralton, SS 70707 USA 24 Sussex Dr Ottawa, ON  K1A 0A3 Canada 1000 J.P. Laurel St. San Miguel 1005, Manila  Philippines   You'd be amazed at how many people enter our contests and leave out critical mailing information like their city, province/state and or postal/zip code. You'd also be amazed at how many people ask us ""What do you mean by complete mailing address?"" In fact, if you're reading this, it's quite possible that we referred you here because you asked that very question. Since we usually only ship to the USA and Canada, we won't disqualify you for leaving out the country, but if anything else is missing, we'll just pick another winner to replace you. We will not contact you to verify your mailing address. BTW, your name is not part of your mailing address, but we won't disqualify you for putting it in there...  Why do some contests not ship to PO Boxes? ANN usually doesn't handle shipping for our contest prizes. Shipping is done by the contest sponsor. If the contest states ""no PO boxes"" this is because our sponsor requested it. Most likely it is because they are shipping via a courier like UPS, which will not ship to PO boxes.  I'd really prefer it if you didn't post my name & city if I win This is done for legal reasons, sorry. That said, if you want to enter with an alias, that's fine as long as you are certain the package will reach you (we can't guarantee it will).  Why did you stop accepting art contest entries from Facebook By default, Facebook posts usually aren't public. Most people who submit Facebook URLs to our art contests forget to share their entries publicly, and we are often forced to disqualify these entries. It's better to just avoid the problem altogether. If you want to enter with Facebook, and you remember to make your entry public go ahead, we'll accept it. But if you forget to share it properly, we will simply ignore your entry.   Miscellaneous   Can I link to you? Yes, please feel free. Currently we don't have any banners to offer you for this, we'll be making some new ones shortly.  Can you link to me? No. We are not a link exchange site.  Wait, I can link to you, but you won't link to me?? Yes, we know it sounds a little conceited of us, but that's how it is. To be fair, we don't expect you to link to us, but we're honored if you do decide that you'd like to link to our site despite the fact that we won't be returning the favor. Please don't link to us if you're only doing it because you hope to get something in return; link to us because you feel that you want more people to know about Anime News Network.   Can we trade banners? Sorry, ANN relies on its banners to survive. We very seldom trade banners with another website or publication. If your publication is in print (10 000+ circulation) or a website with 10 million+ impressions per month, we may consider it. Please understand, ANN receives this question at least once a week, it isn't possible for us to even consider swapping / affiliating with so many sites, so we generally don't swap / affiliate with any.  Can you affiliate with us? Anime News Network would be happy to setup an affiliate program with any online store that pays referral fees provided that store meets certain pre-requisites. Anime News Network is unfortunately unable to affiliate itself with fan-sites much for the same reason that we can not link to you or trade banners with you (see above two entries).  Why'd you give this show a rating of ... in your review? Clearly it deserved a ... ! Obviously our reviewer disagrees.  When is title X coming out, how many episodes is it, and/or who is releasing it? Look it up in the encyclopedia, ask Answerman, or ask in the forum.  Why'd you make X change to the programming on [Cartoon Network, YTV, etc]? Uhh, try contacting the broadcaster, network or station. We're a news site and we have no more control over the schedule at [TV Station] than any other media source. Yes, believe it or not we get this question every so often.  I'd like to license, work on, be involved with, etc... one of your titles Just like we aren't involved in TV broadcasting, we are not licensors. Even for shows that we stream on ANN, we are not authorized to sub-license them to other companies. Contact the producers or the licensors, not us.  I'd like permission to do something with one of your titles Sorry, we do not control copyright permissions for any anime or manga. If you need permission to do something, contact the local licensee / master licensor; or failing that, contact the master licensor in Japan. A bit of advice though, for personal, non commercial projects, don't bother contacting them unless you absolutely need permission. They don't care if you make a 1-off t-shirt to wear to school, but if you ask them, they'll probably say ""No,"" as a matter of policy. Sorry we can not help you get in contact with a rights holder.  Why'd you take my video show off YouTube? We get this question a lot. We didn't take your video down. See the above answer as well as the first one. ANN has no involvement in the process of taking pirated materials off of websites like YouTube. For your information, the material was probably taken down because it was uploaded without permission (therefore illegally) and the licensors want you to watch it somewhere they will make money (on DVD, on TV, or on an authorized website). Go here for a list of places where you can legally watch anime and support the creators at the same time.  On a related note, allow us to point out that your video was probably automatically removed by a technology called video-fingerprinting. By this semi-automated process, YouTube removes videos that it believes infringe on copyrights without waiting for complaints from copyright holders. So it's quite possible that no anime company was involved in the removal of your video.   Sadly, this process can affect videos that are legitimate ""fair-use."" Even more sadly, the employees at the anime companies are too busy to bother reading all the e-mails they get about videos (the vast majority of are from morons that don't understand that ""I wasn't making money"" doesn't make it okay) so you can e-mail them to your hearts content, but they probably won't answer (not because they're fan-hating assholes, but because they don't have the time).    If you believe your video is legitimate fair-use (full episodes are never fair use, significant episode clips are rarely fair use, AMVs are almost never fair use of the music) try posting it again and include in the description why you feel it is fair use. If you're lucky, YouTube will take this into consideration (some videos are deleted automatically, others are looked at by a human employee at YouTube after the fingerprinting process identifies them) and not delete your video. You really should read up on ""fair use"" before you make any claims that your video is fair use though. And by ""read-up,"" we mean read professional, expert explanations, not your friend's blog.   I have a great idea for an anime or manga, where do I submit it? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not involved with the creation process of any anime or manga and we can not put you in contact with creators (more on that here). Finally, we'd recommend you read this and this.  How do I get your television channel? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not The Anime Network (TAN). For details on TAN, read the transcript of our chat with them, read our TAN news coverage, or visit their website.  Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? No. As a policy, ANN never gives out contact information. Don't send us this question unless you've exhausted every other resource available (phone book, 411, Google, their website, etc...), even then, we will only forward your request to them, and we will only do so provided it is a business-to-business request being made by a company we've actually heard of. If you can't find Hayao Miyazaki's e-mail address online, it's probably because he doesn't want to receive a thousand e-mails a day. The one exception to this rule is that we will give out the Public Relations / Press Relations (PR) contact information for a company provided we have it readily available. Generally you can find this information on your own though, so please don't be lazy. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? I'm an old acquaintance of theirs. The answer is still no. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? They worked on one of your projects. Just to be clear, our encyclopedia carries information about a myriad of projects (anime,manga, etc...) most of which (99.9%) Anime News Network is not, and never was, involved with. It is not a list of our projects. So if the person actually worked for ANN, please see this answer, but if they are one of the 67023+ people listed in the encyclopedia, they probably didn't work for us and therefore the previous two answers apply. Okay, I understand, you can't or won't put me in contact with them, but I really want/need to contact this person. Can you offer any suggestions on how to proceed? Depending on who you're trying to contact, they might have a fanclub, official webpage, or e-mail address listed in their encyclopedia entry. If not, try looking for the latest production they worked on and contacting the production company, they might be able and willing to forward your e-mail. Just a note, if you're contacting someone in Japan, it's highly recommended that at least your intro be in Japanese. Even if your intended recipient understands English, the person you ask to forward your e-mail might not. For your benefit, here's a quick intro you can prepend to any e-mail you send to Japan (replaces the blanks by the name of the person you are trying to contact): ご担当者様へ お世話になっております。 本社は____様にご連絡を取りたがっています。お手数ですが、このメールを____様へ転送して頂けないでしょうか? 宜しくお願いします。  Literally: To whom it may concern/the person in charge: Thank you for your time. We are trying to contact _____. If it isn't too much trouble, could you forward this e-mail to ____? Thank you very much.    Can you send me your catalog? We don't have a catalog, we don't sell anything.  Where can I buy Anime ? You can buy it at retail movie stores like Blockbuster and Suncoast as well as specialty Anime Shops. You can also buy it online at websites like Anime Castle, Anime Nation, J List, Roberts Anime Corner Store and The Right Stuf International.  Where can I download anime or watch it online? For the most part, you can't legally download anime online. Fansubs are generally illegal (whether or not they're unethical is a completely different topic), and as such, we can't help you obtain them. You might want to check the sites listed below, and read our news, when there's legal anime to download or watched online we generally mention it.  Don't ask us where to get bootlegs or fansubs, we won't tell you.  Some sites/services that allow you to download or watch anime online legally(may or may not be free):  Amazon Prime crunchyroll Funimation's Website HiDive Apple iTunes hulu Netflix Viz Anime  * Why isn't YouTube listed? Because a lot of the content on YouTube is illegally uploaded. One day we'll have an index of legal anime on YouTube, but until then we aren't listing it as a site where all content is legal/authorized.   How do I watch anime on ANN? ANN has stopped streaming anime episodes. Go to the websites above!  Can you help me with my school assignment No. We get this question about once a week, and we don't really want to spend 25 hours a year answering school questions. The worst part is that most people who e-mail us are actually asking us to provide information they could find with a little bit of research, in other words, they're asking us to do their work for them. On the other hand, if you're working on a master's project or PhD thesis related to anime, that interests us, so we'd probably be more than happy to help.  Does ANN offer Internships? Yes, Anime News Network offers internships in our newsroom and our web-development departments. Further details are available here   What happened to ANN UK? In late May the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into effect. The EU determined that any website targeting European readers would be ""doing business in Europe."" Anime News Network does not disagree with this conclusion. Unfortunately, the GDPR requires all websites doing business in Europe to meet a stringent set of privacy regulations. While ANN supports the intent of these regulations, some of them are extremely difficult to comply with. While it is our intention, for the benefit of all readers our readers around the world, to comply with these new standards, we are not able to do so immediately. Once we are fully compliant with GDPR requirements, we will re-launch ANN UK. In the meantime, ANN's global edition is available to all readers worldwide and is the default version for readers outside of North America, Australia, New Zealand and South East Asia.             bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Misc Page homepage / archives    ",positive,en,{}

Does ANN offer Internships? What happened to ANN UK?    About ANN  What is Anime News Network (ANN)? Anime News Network was created as a news source that focuses on the medium of Japanese Animation(anime) and Japanese Comics (manga). ANN was founded by Justin Sevakis in July of 1998, and has since lead the online anime news medium with a tradition of strong unbiased coverage of major breaking news. With in-depth coverage, analysis and commentary to provide insight into the world of anime and manga, ANN has been and continues to be the #1 English language source for anime and manga news on the Internet. ANN's goal is to make the latest, most comprehensive Anime news available to new fans and veteran Otaku alike.  What ANN is not:  A television network or station; A subsidiary of another company; A dubbing / voice recording studio; An animation company; A licensing or distribution company; A manufacturer or distributor of merchandise; For sale.    What is anime? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of anime, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, anime is animation that is primarily produced and conceived in Japan. This includes animation conceived in Japan that has portions outsourced to other countries, but does not include animation primarily produced outside Japan and with the animation outsourced to Japan. It does however include animation that is co-conceived inside and outside of Japan and at least partially produced inside Japan.  What is manga? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of manga, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, manga are comic books or strips that are produced and conceived in Japan. This includes include comics that are co-conceived inside and outside of Japan but produced in Japan.  Who operates ANN? ANN is operated by a team of people, under the guidance of Christopher Macdonald, Daniel DeLorme, Zac Bertschy, Egan Loo and Hori Shinsuke. A full list of the staff can be found on the staff page.   Who owns ANN? The website is owned by Anime News Network Inc., a privately owned corporation. The corporation's shareholders include: Christopher Macdonald (Minority owner, controlling shareholder), Hori Shinsuke (Minority owner), Anime Consortium Japan (Minority owner), others.   Where is ANN based? Wow, that question is so 1999! ANN is based everywhere and nowhere. We're based on the Internet! We don't have an office; our staff all work at home and are based around the world with the most full-time staff based in Japan and the United States. Anime News Network, Inc. the corporation that maintains ANN is a Canadian corporation.  Who is the mascot? When the site was first launched in 1998 it featured a blond-haired mascot named Jadress, created by Robin Sevakis. She was eventually replaced by Nina, who was featured in a webcomic (also created by Robin Sevakis) that ran from 2007 to 2013.  How often do you update? The site is run on a daily content format, as opposed to a monthly or bi-monthly magazine format. We update the news and reviews daily, and other content, such as features, columns, and editorials are also added throughout the week. Our encyclopedia is updated daily as well.  Under what settings is ANN best viewed? The site uses a responsive design that should look good at any resolution, from smartphones to large desktop screens.  How do I find older articles on ANN? Links to archives for news, features, columns, reviews, etc. can be found in their respective sections in the menu. You can also use the search engine.  What was used to make the site, as well as maintain it? The site is a combination of older parts in PHP and newer parts in Ruby, with a MySQL database to manage the content. Apart from the phpBB forum, we haven't used any pre-made packages; all the content is managed and presented with custom software.  How do I get permission to reprint an ANN Story, or obtain an ANN graphic or photo? ANN has a newsfeed program where you can get the latest anime news headlines on your very own website. If you wish to entirely reprint anything on your site please contact the editors. For more details about what you can and can not re-print with or without our permission, see our copyright statement.  How many people hear or read an ANN story? We get a bit over 200,000 visits every day. In addition to regular visitors, ANN's news is often sourced in print and occasionally on the airwaves.  How can I get in touch with the staff? Visit our contact page or visit our staff page for further contact and personal information. If a member's e-mail address is not there you can send your comments to the editors and we'll forward them.  Do you attend any public events? Yes. ANN tries to provide coverage to as many anime conventions/festivals/symposiums as our staff can manage. For more details on this see our events section and our events forum.  Do you have a newsfeed? You really should have an RSS newsfeed! Look at our newsfeed section for links to various RSS & Atom feeds as well as our custom newsfeed program. Submitting Content  How should I submit news ? Send an e-mail to [email protected] , this e-mail address is regularly monitored by several staff (someone is always ""on duty""). Other methods (e-mail directly to staff, PM, Forum, Twitter, etc...) are less reliable, and may lead to delays and/or a complete failure to notice your submission.  I have something to say about an online petition. Stop. Virtually every e-petition is a waste of time.   I submitted a news item, why wasn't it posted? We could still be in the process of verifying the details, we may not have been able to verify the items, or perhaps we didn't find it newsworthy enough to post. On a ""slow"" news day we're more likely to post less significant items.  I submitted a news item, why was it credited to someone else? They either submitted it first--or more importantly--submitted more information.  Can I submit news about a non-Japanese animation? No. We're Anime News Network, not ""Animation News Network"", not ""Asian Animation Network."" There's plenty of good animation from around the world, including Korea and China, but we only cover Japanese animation, not French, Mexican, Chinese, African, Korean or Afghanistanimation.  Can I submit a review? / How do I become a reviewer? Anime News Network does not accept unsolicited reviews. Take a quick look at the Staff Openings page, if there is an opening, it will be mentioned there. More often than not, we hire experienced writers who are known to us. Best piece of advice we can give is to make a name for yourself then we'll come to you when the time is right.  Can I submit an article? If you are an experienced writer/journalist with a portfolio you can point to, please E-mail the editors and ask about the topic, we'd be glad to consider your article idea.  Can I have a column? No. Only previous, regular contributors who have shown an ability to consistently write timely, quality articles (or reviews) are permitted to write columns. Try submitting some articles or reviews first.  Information X is missing from the Encyclopedia, can you add it? We can't add it, but YOU can. The Encyclopedia is a user-contributed database; it's made specially so that you can add missing information by yourself. You just need a user account. So please do take the time to register and submit the information you found was missing. Each page contains pointers about how to add information, and if that's not enough you can check the Encyclopedia FAQ or the memoranda.  How can I contribute to the encyclopedia? Any registered user can contribute standard data to the Encyclopedia for Anime, Manga and People. But if that's not enough for you and you're near the top of the contributors list and you'd like to help out with the releases, lexicon, or editing and verifying data submitted by other people, please contact the Encyclopedist.  Please note, that we'll be looking for someone who is inputting quality data, not just large amounts of data.   What if I want to contribute in some other way? We always appreciate whatever help and support that readers can give. If you'd like to help out at ANN in a way other than the ones described above, please contact the editors. There's so much to do at ANN that we're very appreciative of any help offered.   My company is making Anime, can you post a news article about it? Sorry, too many companies are trying to cash in on the popularity of Anime by making cartoons with big eyes and purple hair. We're sure you aren't like that, but... well actually, we aren't sure.  Why doesn't Anime News Network review world manga? Please see our definition of manga. It is Anime News Network's official position, and the personal belief of many of our staff, than there is nothing inheritently superior about Japanese manga when compared to world manga. However Anime News Network's purpose is to cover Japanese animation and comic books. Currently we do not have the resources to review all the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America. If and when we are able to review 100% of the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America, we will then consider expanding our area of review coverage to include manga-style comics (world manga) that originate outside of Japan.  Why didn't you post a news article about my (company's) new Anime or Manga? If your item is picked up in a distribution deal by a company that isn't being run out of someone's garage, then maybe its newsworthy. So when that happens, give us a shout, and we'll consider it, but if you can't tell us what makes your creation manga or anime (other than big eyes, purple hair and the like) you can pretty much forget it.  May I send you my company's product to review? If it's anime or manga-related, then yes. Contact editors[at]animenewsnetwork.com for shipping information.  I'm starting a new webmanga, is it news? No, there are a billion and one ""webmangas"", and most only last a couple of months. Now, if your webmanga gets licensed by a publisher... that might be news.  Can you mention my site? Only if you do something newsworthy, sorry.  Why have we been blacklisted? ANN has a 2-strikes rule regarding inappropriate PR. After 2 strikes for the following reasons we will blacklist your company or PR firm (when we blacklist a PR firm, we notify their relevant clients). i) Completely irrelevant PR that has nothing to do with anime, manga, Japanese pop-culture or any other related content; ii) Unauthorized stealth marketing on our forums; iii) Harassing our staff; iv) Continued PR submissions to inappropriate e-mail address. v) Any attempt to illicitly influence editorial We'll send you a link to this post after your first offense. After your second offense you'll never hear from us again (and our readers will never hear from you or your clients).  Isn't this a bit harsh? Perhaps, but we're tired of getting PRs for toilets, accounting firm management changes and World War 2 museums.   But we offer an opt-out! Clicking that link might opt us out of all your press releases, including your relevant ones. It would be the same as blacklisting you, without giving you the warning. Showing you this warning is actually less harsh than clicking your opt-out.  Forum / Account  I didn't receive my forum registration. If you are using a spam filter, please check your spam folder, some mail servers catch the registration code as spam. Search your spamfolder & inbox for e-mail from [email protected] or [email protected]. If you are using any sort of white list, please make sure that your e-mail account is set up to accept e-mails from [email protected] and [email protected]. If you are using a mail service that bounces the e-mail back to the sender and asks them to confirm that it is not spam, we will not do that. These services usually allow you to add the e-mail address to a white-list before hand. Once you have checked all of the above, you can have the server re-send you your activation code by going here. It should be instant, but sometimes e-mail is slow, give it a couple hours (the slowness is usually not because of our server). If you still don't get your activation code, then and ONLY then, e-mail us at [email protected] make sure that: 1) Your e-mail is sent from the e-mail address you submitted to ANN; 2) You include your user name; 3) Do not send us your password; 4) The subject of your e-mail must be ""activation code"".   How do I become a moderator? You're invited. When we feel there is a need for a new moderator, we look at our best forum users (the ones that contribute intelligently to conversation and act maturely) and ask them if they'd be willing to help us moderate the forum.  Will there ever be an off topic / general conversation forum among the forums? Not in the public areas, no. We do however maintain a community section for subscribers, and off-topic discussion is permitted there.  Why aren't my posts showing up? Posts from new users sometimes take a while to show up. Please be patient, they should appear within a few hours. Believe it or not, this is a ""feature"" not a ""bug.""  Is there a set of forum rules? Right here - read them if you haven't already.  Help, I've been banned or moderated! Read this.  How do I attach a picture (avatar) to my account? Read this.  Can I change my user name? You can make changes in your user account settings. But because other users depend on your username to recognize you, we have a ""no identity switcheroos"" policy: once you start using the forum we do not allow changes to your username beyond punctuation and capitalization.  Can I delete my account? Yes, you can. Go to your account settings page and you will be able to delete your account from there. Contests  Can I enter give-aways more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No.  Can I enter creative contests more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, Yes.  Does ANN ""own"" my entry? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No. But as a condition of your entry we generaly require you to give us the unrevocable right to display your entry on Anime News Network for all eternity.  Can I display my entry elsewhere? Yes, anywhere you please, unless otherwise stated in the contest rules.  Why do I have to put your logo and/or the sponsor's logo on my submission There are two reasons for this. First, it adds some extra benefit to the contest sponsors and second, it helps us insure that you made the entry for the contest, instead of just grabing some existing art and submiting it.  Explain those rules about where I live and whether or not I can enter and if you will ship me a prize. Most of our contest are open to anyone, regardless of where you live, because we don't believe in geographic discrimination. However sometimes our sponsors want a contest to only be open to their potential clients, so in those cases we have no choice to abide by their request to limit contest entry to a certain geographic area. While we don't believe in geographic discrimination, we also don't believe in spending a fortune on shipping and trying to figure out custom laws in order to get you your prize so that's why we only ship to the USA and Canada.   What does a complete mailing address look like? Short answer: ""It's what we need to put on a package to mail it to you."" It looks something like this:  416 William St. #402 Moralton, SS 70707 USA 24 Sussex Dr Ottawa, ON  K1A 0A3 Canada 1000 J.P. Laurel St. San Miguel 1005, Manila  Philippines   You'd be amazed at how many people enter our contests and leave out critical mailing information like their city, province/state and or postal/zip code. You'd also be amazed at how many people ask us ""What do you mean by complete mailing address?"" In fact, if you're reading this, it's quite possible that we referred you here because you asked that very question. Since we usually only ship to the USA and Canada, we won't disqualify you for leaving out the country, but if anything else is missing, we'll just pick another winner to replace you. We will not contact you to verify your mailing address. BTW, your name is not part of your mailing address, but we won't disqualify you for putting it in there...  Why do some contests not ship to PO Boxes? ANN usually doesn't handle shipping for our contest prizes. Shipping is done by the contest sponsor. If the contest states ""no PO boxes"" this is because our sponsor requested it. Most likely it is because they are shipping via a courier like UPS, which will not ship to PO boxes.  I'd really prefer it if you didn't post my name & city if I win This is done for legal reasons, sorry. That said, if you want to enter with an alias, that's fine as long as you are certain the package will reach you (we can't guarantee it will).  Why did you stop accepting art contest entries from Facebook By default, Facebook posts usually aren't public. Most people who submit Facebook URLs to our art contests forget to share their entries publicly, and we are often forced to disqualify these entries. It's better to just avoid the problem altogether. If you want to enter with Facebook, and you remember to make your entry public go ahead, we'll accept it. But if you forget to share it properly, we will simply ignore your entry.   Miscellaneous   Can I link to you? Yes, please feel free. Currently we don't have any banners to offer you for this, we'll be making some new ones shortly.  Can you link to me? No. We are not a link exchange site.  Wait, I can link to you, but you won't link to me?? Yes, we know it sounds a little conceited of us, but that's how it is. To be fair, we don't expect you to link to us, but we're honored if you do decide that you'd like to link to our site despite the fact that we won't be returning the favor. Please don't link to us if you're only doing it because you hope to get something in return; link to us because you feel that you want more people to know about Anime News Network.   Can we trade banners? Sorry, ANN relies on its banners to survive. We very seldom trade banners with another website or publication. If your publication is in print (10 000+ circulation) or a website with 10 million+ impressions per month, we may consider it. Please understand, ANN receives this question at least once a week, it isn't possible for us to even consider swapping / affiliating with so many sites, so we generally don't swap / affiliate with any.  Can you affiliate with us? Anime News Network would be happy to setup an affiliate program with any online store that pays referral fees provided that store meets certain pre-requisites. Anime News Network is unfortunately unable to affiliate itself with fan-sites much for the same reason that we can not link to you or trade banners with you (see above two entries).  Why'd you give this show a rating of ... in your review? Clearly it deserved a ... ! Obviously our reviewer disagrees.  When is title X coming out, how many episodes is it, and/or who is releasing it? Look it up in the encyclopedia, ask Answerman, or ask in the forum.  Why'd you make X change to the programming on [Cartoon Network, YTV, etc]? Uhh, try contacting the broadcaster, network or station. We're a news site and we have no more control over the schedule at [TV Station] than any other media source. Yes, believe it or not we get this question every so often.  I'd like to license, work on, be involved with, etc... one of your titles Just like we aren't involved in TV broadcasting, we are not licensors. Even for shows that we stream on ANN, we are not authorized to sub-license them to other companies. Contact the producers or the licensors, not us.  I'd like permission to do something with one of your titles Sorry, we do not control copyright permissions for any anime or manga. If you need permission to do something, contact the local licensee / master licensor; or failing that, contact the master licensor in Japan. A bit of advice though, for personal, non commercial projects, don't bother contacting them unless you absolutely need permission. They don't care if you make a 1-off t-shirt to wear to school, but if you ask them, they'll probably say ""No,"" as a matter of policy. Sorry we can not help you get in contact with a rights holder.  Why'd you take my video show off YouTube? We get this question a lot. We didn't take your video down. See the above answer as well as the first one. ANN has no involvement in the process of taking pirated materials off of websites like YouTube. For your information, the material was probably taken down because it was uploaded without permission (therefore illegally) and the licensors want you to watch it somewhere they will make money (on DVD, on TV, or on an authorized website). Go here for a list of places where you can legally watch anime and support the creators at the same time.  On a related note, allow us to point out that your video was probably automatically removed by a technology called video-fingerprinting. By this semi-automated process, YouTube removes videos that it believes infringe on copyrights without waiting for complaints from copyright holders. So it's quite possible that no anime company was involved in the removal of your video.   Sadly, this process can affect videos that are legitimate ""fair-use."" Even more sadly, the employees at the anime companies are too busy to bother reading all the e-mails they get about videos (the vast majority of are from morons that don't understand that ""I wasn't making money"" doesn't make it okay) so you can e-mail them to your hearts content, but they probably won't answer (not because they're fan-hating assholes, but because they don't have the time).    If you believe your video is legitimate fair-use (full episodes are never fair use, significant episode clips are rarely fair use, AMVs are almost never fair use of the music) try posting it again and include in the description why you feel it is fair use. If you're lucky, YouTube will take this into consideration (some videos are deleted automatically, others are looked at by a human employee at YouTube after the fingerprinting process identifies them) and not delete your video. You really should read up on ""fair use"" before you make any claims that your video is fair use though. And by ""read-up,"" we mean read professional, expert explanations, not your friend's blog.   I have a great idea for an anime or manga, where do I submit it? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not involved with the creation process of any anime or manga and we can not put you in contact with creators (more on that here). Finally, we'd recommend you read this and this.  How do I get your television channel? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not The Anime Network (TAN). For details on TAN, read the transcript of our chat with them, read our TAN news coverage, or visit their website.  Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? No. As a policy, ANN never gives out contact information. Don't send us this question unless you've exhausted every other resource available (phone book, 411, Google, their website, etc...), even then, we will only forward your request to them, and we will only do so provided it is a business-to-business request being made by a company we've actually heard of. If you can't find Hayao Miyazaki's e-mail address online, it's probably because he doesn't want to receive a thousand e-mails a day. The one exception to this rule is that we will give out the Public Relations / Press Relations (PR) contact information for a company provided we have it readily available. Generally you can find this information on your own though, so please don't be lazy. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? I'm an old acquaintance of theirs. The answer is still no. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? They worked on one of your projects. Just to be clear, our encyclopedia carries information about a myriad of projects (anime,manga, etc...) most of which (99.9%) Anime News Network is not, and never was, involved with. It is not a list of our projects. So if the person actually worked for ANN, please see this answer, but if they are one of the 67023+ people listed in the encyclopedia, they probably didn't work for us and therefore the previous two answers apply. Okay, I understand, you can't or won't put me in contact with them, but I really want/need to contact this person. Can you offer any suggestions on how to proceed? Depending on who you're trying to contact, they might have a fanclub, official webpage, or e-mail address listed in their encyclopedia entry. If not, try looking for the latest production they worked on and contacting the production company, they might be able and willing to forward your e-mail. Just a note, if you're contacting someone in Japan, it's highly recommended that at least your intro be in Japanese. Even if your intended recipient understands English, the person you ask to forward your e-mail might not. For your benefit, here's a quick intro you can prepend to any e-mail you send to Japan (replaces the blanks by the name of the person you are trying to contact): ご担当者様へ お世話になっております。 本社は____様にご連絡を取りたがっています。お手数ですが、このメールを____様へ転送して頂けないでしょうか? 宜しくお願いします。  Literally: To whom it may concern/the person in charge: Thank you for your time. We are trying to contact _____. If it isn't too much trouble, could you forward this e-mail to ____? Thank you very much.    Can you send me your catalog? We don't have a catalog, we don't sell anything.  Where can I buy Anime ? You can buy it at retail movie stores like Blockbuster and Suncoast as well as specialty Anime Shops. You can also buy it online at websites like Anime Castle, Anime Nation, J List, Roberts Anime Corner Store and The Right Stuf International.  Where can I download anime or watch it online? For the most part, you can't legally download anime online. Fansubs are generally illegal (whether or not they're unethical is a completely different topic), and as such, we can't help you obtain them. You might want to check the sites listed below, and read our news, when there's legal anime to download or watched online we generally mention it.  Don't ask us where to get bootlegs or fansubs, we won't tell you.  Some sites/services that allow you to download or watch anime online legally(may or may not be free):  Amazon Prime crunchyroll Funimation's Website HiDive Apple iTunes hulu Netflix Viz Anime  * Why isn't YouTube listed? Because a lot of the content on YouTube is illegally uploaded. One day we'll have an index of legal anime on YouTube, but until then we aren't listing it as a site where all content is legal/authorized.   How do I watch anime on ANN? ANN has stopped streaming anime episodes. Go to the websites above!  Can you help me with my school assignment No. We get this question about once a week, and we don't really want to spend 25 hours a year answering school questions. The worst part is that most people who e-mail us are actually asking us to provide information they could find with a little bit of research, in other words, they're asking us to do their work for them. On the other hand, if you're working on a master's project or PhD thesis related to anime, that interests us, so we'd probably be more than happy to help.  Does ANN offer Internships? Yes, Anime News Network offers internships in our newsroom and our web-development departments. Further details are available here   What happened to ANN UK? In late May the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into effect. The EU determined that any website targeting European readers would be ""doing business in Europe."" Anime News Network does not disagree with this conclusion. Unfortunately, the GDPR requires all websites doing business in Europe to meet a stringent set of privacy regulations. While ANN supports the intent of these regulations, some of them are extremely difficult to comply with. While it is our intention, for the benefit of all readers our readers around the world, to comply with these new standards, we are not able to do so immediately. Once we are fully compliant with GDPR requirements, we will re-launch ANN UK. In the meantime, ANN's global edition is available to all readers worldwide and is the default version for readers outside of North America, Australia, New Zealand and South East Asia.             bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Misc Page homepage / archives   ",positive,en,{}

Does ANN offer Internships? What happened to ANN UK?    About ANN  What is Anime News Network (ANN)? Anime News Network was created as a news source that focuses on the medium of Japanese Animation(anime) and Japanese Comics (manga). ANN was founded by Justin Sevakis in July of 1998, and has since lead the online anime news medium with a tradition of strong unbiased coverage of major breaking news. With in-depth coverage, analysis and commentary to provide insight into the world of anime and manga, ANN has been and continues to be the #1 English language source for anime and manga news on the Internet. ANN's goal is to make the latest, most comprehensive Anime news available to new fans and veteran Otaku alike.  What ANN is not:  A television network or station; A subsidiary of another company; A dubbing / voice recording studio; An animation company; A licensing or distribution company; A manufacturer or distributor of merchandise; For sale.    What is anime? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of anime, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, anime is animation that is primarily produced and conceived in Japan. This includes animation conceived in Japan that has portions outsourced to other countries, but does not include animation primarily produced outside Japan and with the animation outsourced to Japan. It does however include animation that is co-conceived inside and outside of Japan and at least partially produced inside Japan.  What is manga? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of manga, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, manga are comic books or strips that are produced and conceived in Japan. This includes include comics that are co-conceived inside and outside of Japan but produced in Japan.  Who operates ANN? ANN is operated by a team of people, under the guidance of Christopher Macdonald, Daniel DeLorme, Zac Bertschy, Egan Loo and Hori Shinsuke. A full list of the staff can be found on the staff page.   Who owns ANN? The website is owned by Anime News Network Inc., a privately owned corporation. The corporation's shareholders include: Christopher Macdonald (Minority owner, controlling shareholder), Hori Shinsuke (Minority owner), Anime Consortium Japan (Minority owner), others.   Where is ANN based? Wow, that question is so 1999! ANN is based everywhere and nowhere. We're based on the Internet! We don't have an office; our staff all work at home and are based around the world with the most full-time staff based in Japan and the United States. Anime News Network, Inc. the corporation that maintains ANN is a Canadian corporation.  Who is the mascot? When the site was first launched in 1998 it featured a blond-haired mascot named Jadress, created by Robin Sevakis. She was eventually replaced by Nina, who was featured in a webcomic (also created by Robin Sevakis) that ran from 2007 to 2013.  How often do you update? The site is run on a daily content format, as opposed to a monthly or bi-monthly magazine format. We update the news and reviews daily, and other content, such as features, columns, and editorials are also added throughout the week. Our encyclopedia is updated daily as well.  Under what settings is ANN best viewed? The site uses a responsive design that should look good at any resolution, from smartphones to large desktop screens.  How do I find older articles on ANN? Links to archives for news, features, columns, reviews, etc. can be found in their respective sections in the menu. You can also use the search engine.  What was used to make the site, as well as maintain it? The site is a combination of older parts in PHP and newer parts in Ruby, with a MySQL database to manage the content. Apart from the phpBB forum, we haven't used any pre-made packages; all the content is managed and presented with custom software.  How do I get permission to reprint an ANN Story, or obtain an ANN graphic or photo? ANN has a newsfeed program where you can get the latest anime news headlines on your very own website. If you wish to entirely reprint anything on your site please contact the editors. For more details about what you can and can not re-print with or without our permission, see our copyright statement.  How many people hear or read an ANN story? We get a bit over 200,000 visits every day. In addition to regular visitors, ANN's news is often sourced in print and occasionally on the airwaves.  How can I get in touch with the staff? Visit our contact page or visit our staff page for further contact and personal information. If a member's e-mail address is not there you can send your comments to the editors and we'll forward them.  Do you attend any public events? Yes. ANN tries to provide coverage to as many anime conventions/festivals/symposiums as our staff can manage. For more details on this see our events section and our events forum.  Do you have a newsfeed? You really should have an RSS newsfeed! Look at our newsfeed section for links to various RSS & Atom feeds as well as our custom newsfeed program. Submitting Content  How should I submit news ? Send an e-mail to [email protected] , this e-mail address is regularly monitored by several staff (someone is always ""on duty""). Other methods (e-mail directly to staff, PM, Forum, Twitter, etc...) are less reliable, and may lead to delays and/or a complete failure to notice your submission.  I have something to say about an online petition. Stop. Virtually every e-petition is a waste of time.   I submitted a news item, why wasn't it posted? We could still be in the process of verifying the details, we may not have been able to verify the items, or perhaps we didn't find it newsworthy enough to post. On a ""slow"" news day we're more likely to post less significant items.  I submitted a news item, why was it credited to someone else? They either submitted it first--or more importantly--submitted more information.  Can I submit news about a non-Japanese animation? No. We're Anime News Network, not ""Animation News Network"", not ""Asian Animation Network."" There's plenty of good animation from around the world, including Korea and China, but we only cover Japanese animation, not French, Mexican, Chinese, African, Korean or Afghanistanimation.  Can I submit a review? / How do I become a reviewer? Anime News Network does not accept unsolicited reviews. Take a quick look at the Staff Openings page, if there is an opening, it will be mentioned there. More often than not, we hire experienced writers who are known to us. Best piece of advice we can give is to make a name for yourself then we'll come to you when the time is right.  Can I submit an article? If you are an experienced writer/journalist with a portfolio you can point to, please E-mail the editors and ask about the topic, we'd be glad to consider your article idea.  Can I have a column? No. Only previous, regular contributors who have shown an ability to consistently write timely, quality articles (or reviews) are permitted to write columns. Try submitting some articles or reviews first.  Information X is missing from the Encyclopedia, can you add it? We can't add it, but YOU can. The Encyclopedia is a user-contributed database; it's made specially so that you can add missing information by yourself. You just need a user account. So please do take the time to register and submit the information you found was missing. Each page contains pointers about how to add information, and if that's not enough you can check the Encyclopedia FAQ or the memoranda.  How can I contribute to the encyclopedia? Any registered user can contribute standard data to the Encyclopedia for Anime, Manga and People. But if that's not enough for you and you're near the top of the contributors list and you'd like to help out with the releases, lexicon, or editing and verifying data submitted by other people, please contact the Encyclopedist.  Please note, that we'll be looking for someone who is inputting quality data, not just large amounts of data.   What if I want to contribute in some other way? We always appreciate whatever help and support that readers can give. If you'd like to help out at ANN in a way other than the ones described above, please contact the editors. There's so much to do at ANN that we're very appreciative of any help offered.   My company is making Anime, can you post a news article about it? Sorry, too many companies are trying to cash in on the popularity of Anime by making cartoons with big eyes and purple hair. We're sure you aren't like that, but... well actually, we aren't sure.  Why doesn't Anime News Network review world manga? Please see our definition of manga. It is Anime News Network's official position, and the personal belief of many of our staff, than there is nothing inheritently superior about Japanese manga when compared to world manga. However Anime News Network's purpose is to cover Japanese animation and comic books. Currently we do not have the resources to review all the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America. If and when we are able to review 100% of the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America, we will then consider expanding our area of review coverage to include manga-style comics (world manga) that originate outside of Japan.  Why didn't you post a news article about my (company's) new Anime or Manga? If your item is picked up in a distribution deal by a company that isn't being run out of someone's garage, then maybe its newsworthy. So when that happens, give us a shout, and we'll consider it, but if you can't tell us what makes your creation manga or anime (other than big eyes, purple hair and the like) you can pretty much forget it.  May I send you my company's product to review? If it's anime or manga-related, then yes. Contact editors[at]animenewsnetwork.com for shipping information.  I'm starting a new webmanga, is it news? No, there are a billion and one ""webmangas"", and most only last a couple of months. Now, if your webmanga gets licensed by a publisher... that might be news.  Can you mention my site? Only if you do something newsworthy, sorry.  Why have we been blacklisted? ANN has a 2-strikes rule regarding inappropriate PR. After 2 strikes for the following reasons we will blacklist your company or PR firm (when we blacklist a PR firm, we notify their relevant clients). i) Completely irrelevant PR that has nothing to do with anime, manga, Japanese pop-culture or any other related content; ii) Unauthorized stealth marketing on our forums; iii) Harassing our staff; iv) Continued PR submissions to inappropriate e-mail address. v) Any attempt to illicitly influence editorial We'll send you a link to this post after your first offense. After your second offense you'll never hear from us again (and our readers will never hear from you or your clients).  Isn't this a bit harsh? Perhaps, but we're tired of getting PRs for toilets, accounting firm management changes and World War 2 museums.   But we offer an opt-out! Clicking that link might opt us out of all your press releases, including your relevant ones. It would be the same as blacklisting you, without giving you the warning. Showing you this warning is actually less harsh than clicking your opt-out.  Forum / Account  I didn't receive my forum registration. If you are using a spam filter, please check your spam folder, some mail servers catch the registration code as spam. Search your spamfolder & inbox for e-mail from [email protected] or [email protected]. If you are using any sort of white list, please make sure that your e-mail account is set up to accept e-mails from [email protected] and [email protected]. If you are using a mail service that bounces the e-mail back to the sender and asks them to confirm that it is not spam, we will not do that. These services usually allow you to add the e-mail address to a white-list before hand. Once you have checked all of the above, you can have the server re-send you your activation code by going here. It should be instant, but sometimes e-mail is slow, give it a couple hours (the slowness is usually not because of our server). If you still don't get your activation code, then and ONLY then, e-mail us at [email protected] make sure that: 1) Your e-mail is sent from the e-mail address you submitted to ANN; 2) You include your user name; 3) Do not send us your password; 4) The subject of your e-mail must be ""activation code"".   How do I become a moderator? You're invited. When we feel there is a need for a new moderator, we look at our best forum users (the ones that contribute intelligently to conversation and act maturely) and ask them if they'd be willing to help us moderate the forum.  Will there ever be an off topic / general conversation forum among the forums? Not in the public areas, no. We do however maintain a community section for subscribers, and off-topic discussion is permitted there.  Why aren't my posts showing up? Posts from new users sometimes take a while to show up. Please be patient, they should appear within a few hours. Believe it or not, this is a ""feature"" not a ""bug.""  Is there a set of forum rules? Right here - read them if you haven't already.  Help, I've been banned or moderated! Read this.  How do I attach a picture (avatar) to my account? Read this.  Can I change my user name? You can make changes in your user account settings. But because other users depend on your username to recognize you, we have a ""no identity switcheroos"" policy: once you start using the forum we do not allow changes to your username beyond punctuation and capitalization.  Can I delete my account? Yes, you can. Go to your account settings page and you will be able to delete your account from there. Contests  Can I enter give-aways more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No.  Can I enter creative contests more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, Yes.  Does ANN ""own"" my entry? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No. But as a condition of your entry we generaly require you to give us the unrevocable right to display your entry on Anime News Network for all eternity.  Can I display my entry elsewhere? Yes, anywhere you please, unless otherwise stated in the contest rules.  Why do I have to put your logo and/or the sponsor's logo on my submission There are two reasons for this. First, it adds some extra benefit to the contest sponsors and second, it helps us insure that you made the entry for the contest, instead of just grabing some existing art and submiting it.  Explain those rules about where I live and whether or not I can enter and if you will ship me a prize. Most of our contest are open to anyone, regardless of where you live, because we don't believe in geographic discrimination. However sometimes our sponsors want a contest to only be open to their potential clients, so in those cases we have no choice to abide by their request to limit contest entry to a certain geographic area. While we don't believe in geographic discrimination, we also don't believe in spending a fortune on shipping and trying to figure out custom laws in order to get you your prize so that's why we only ship to the USA and Canada.   What does a complete mailing address look like? Short answer: ""It's what we need to put on a package to mail it to you."" It looks something like this:  416 William St. #402 Moralton, SS 70707 USA 24 Sussex Dr Ottawa, ON  K1A 0A3 Canada 1000 J.P. Laurel St. San Miguel 1005, Manila  Philippines   You'd be amazed at how many people enter our contests and leave out critical mailing information like their city, province/state and or postal/zip code. You'd also be amazed at how many people ask us ""What do you mean by complete mailing address?"" In fact, if you're reading this, it's quite possible that we referred you here because you asked that very question. Since we usually only ship to the USA and Canada, we won't disqualify you for leaving out the country, but if anything else is missing, we'll just pick another winner to replace you. We will not contact you to verify your mailing address. BTW, your name is not part of your mailing address, but we won't disqualify you for putting it in there...  Why do some contests not ship to PO Boxes? ANN usually doesn't handle shipping for our contest prizes. Shipping is done by the contest sponsor. If the contest states ""no PO boxes"" this is because our sponsor requested it. Most likely it is because they are shipping via a courier like UPS, which will not ship to PO boxes.  I'd really prefer it if you didn't post my name & city if I win This is done for legal reasons, sorry. That said, if you want to enter with an alias, that's fine as long as you are certain the package will reach you (we can't guarantee it will).  Why did you stop accepting art contest entries from Facebook By default, Facebook posts usually aren't public. Most people who submit Facebook URLs to our art contests forget to share their entries publicly, and we are often forced to disqualify these entries. It's better to just avoid the problem altogether. If you want to enter with Facebook, and you remember to make your entry public go ahead, we'll accept it. But if you forget to share it properly, we will simply ignore your entry.   Miscellaneous   Can I link to you? Yes, please feel free. Currently we don't have any banners to offer you for this, we'll be making some new ones shortly.  Can you link to me? No. We are not a link exchange site.  Wait, I can link to you, but you won't link to me?? Yes, we know it sounds a little conceited of us, but that's how it is. To be fair, we don't expect you to link to us, but we're honored if you do decide that you'd like to link to our site despite the fact that we won't be returning the favor. Please don't link to us if you're only doing it because you hope to get something in return; link to us because you feel that you want more people to know about Anime News Network.   Can we trade banners? Sorry, ANN relies on its banners to survive. We very seldom trade banners with another website or publication. If your publication is in print (10 000+ circulation) or a website with 10 million+ impressions per month, we may consider it. Please understand, ANN receives this question at least once a week, it isn't possible for us to even consider swapping / affiliating with so many sites, so we generally don't swap / affiliate with any.  Can you affiliate with us? Anime News Network would be happy to setup an affiliate program with any online store that pays referral fees provided that store meets certain pre-requisites. Anime News Network is unfortunately unable to affiliate itself with fan-sites much for the same reason that we can not link to you or trade banners with you (see above two entries).  Why'd you give this show a rating of ... in your review? Clearly it deserved a ... ! Obviously our reviewer disagrees.  When is title X coming out, how many episodes is it, and/or who is releasing it? Look it up in the encyclopedia, ask Answerman, or ask in the forum.  Why'd you make X change to the programming on [Cartoon Network, YTV, etc]? Uhh, try contacting the broadcaster, network or station. We're a news site and we have no more control over the schedule at [TV Station] than any other media source. Yes, believe it or not we get this question every so often.  I'd like to license, work on, be involved with, etc... one of your titles Just like we aren't involved in TV broadcasting, we are not licensors. Even for shows that we stream on ANN, we are not authorized to sub-license them to other companies. Contact the producers or the licensors, not us.  I'd like permission to do something with one of your titles Sorry, we do not control copyright permissions for any anime or manga. If you need permission to do something, contact the local licensee / master licensor; or failing that, contact the master licensor in Japan. A bit of advice though, for personal, non commercial projects, don't bother contacting them unless you absolutely need permission. They don't care if you make a 1-off t-shirt to wear to school, but if you ask them, they'll probably say ""No,"" as a matter of policy. Sorry we can not help you get in contact with a rights holder.  Why'd you take my video show off YouTube? We get this question a lot. We didn't take your video down. See the above answer as well as the first one. ANN has no involvement in the process of taking pirated materials off of websites like YouTube. For your information, the material was probably taken down because it was uploaded without permission (therefore illegally) and the licensors want you to watch it somewhere they will make money (on DVD, on TV, or on an authorized website). Go here for a list of places where you can legally watch anime and support the creators at the same time.  On a related note, allow us to point out that your video was probably automatically removed by a technology called video-fingerprinting. By this semi-automated process, YouTube removes videos that it believes infringe on copyrights without waiting for complaints from copyright holders. So it's quite possible that no anime company was involved in the removal of your video.   Sadly, this process can affect videos that are legitimate ""fair-use."" Even more sadly, the employees at the anime companies are too busy to bother reading all the e-mails they get about videos (the vast majority of are from morons that don't understand that ""I wasn't making money"" doesn't make it okay) so you can e-mail them to your hearts content, but they probably won't answer (not because they're fan-hating assholes, but because they don't have the time).    If you believe your video is legitimate fair-use (full episodes are never fair use, significant episode clips are rarely fair use, AMVs are almost never fair use of the music) try posting it again and include in the description why you feel it is fair use. If you're lucky, YouTube will take this into consideration (some videos are deleted automatically, others are looked at by a human employee at YouTube after the fingerprinting process identifies them) and not delete your video. You really should read up on ""fair use"" before you make any claims that your video is fair use though. And by ""read-up,"" we mean read professional, expert explanations, not your friend's blog.   I have a great idea for an anime or manga, where do I submit it? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not involved with the creation process of any anime or manga and we can not put you in contact with creators (more on that here). Finally, we'd recommend you read this and this.  How do I get your television channel? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not The Anime Network (TAN). For details on TAN, read the transcript of our chat with them, read our TAN news coverage, or visit their website.  Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? No. As a policy, ANN never gives out contact information. Don't send us this question unless you've exhausted every other resource available (phone book, 411, Google, their website, etc...), even then, we will only forward your request to them, and we will only do so provided it is a business-to-business request being made by a company we've actually heard of. If you can't find Hayao Miyazaki's e-mail address online, it's probably because he doesn't want to receive a thousand e-mails a day. The one exception to this rule is that we will give out the Public Relations / Press Relations (PR) contact information for a company provided we have it readily available. Generally you can find this information on your own though, so please don't be lazy. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? I'm an old acquaintance of theirs. The answer is still no. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? They worked on one of your projects. Just to be clear, our encyclopedia carries information about a myriad of projects (anime,manga, etc...) most of which (99.9%) Anime News Network is not, and never was, involved with. It is not a list of our projects. So if the person actually worked for ANN, please see this answer, but if they are one of the 67023+ people listed in the encyclopedia, they probably didn't work for us and therefore the previous two answers apply. Okay, I understand, you can't or won't put me in contact with them, but I really want/need to contact this person. Can you offer any suggestions on how to proceed? Depending on who you're trying to contact, they might have a fanclub, official webpage, or e-mail address listed in their encyclopedia entry. If not, try looking for the latest production they worked on and contacting the production company, they might be able and willing to forward your e-mail. Just a note, if you're contacting someone in Japan, it's highly recommended that at least your intro be in Japanese. Even if your intended recipient understands English, the person you ask to forward your e-mail might not. For your benefit, here's a quick intro you can prepend to any e-mail you send to Japan (replaces the blanks by the name of the person you are trying to contact): ご担当者様へ お世話になっております。 本社は____様にご連絡を取りたがっています。お手数ですが、このメールを____様へ転送して頂けないでしょうか? 宜しくお願いします。  Literally: To whom it may concern/the person in charge: Thank you for your time. We are trying to contact _____. If it isn't too much trouble, could you forward this e-mail to ____? Thank you very much.    Can you send me your catalog? We don't have a catalog, we don't sell anything.  Where can I buy Anime ? You can buy it at retail movie stores like Blockbuster and Suncoast as well as specialty Anime Shops. You can also buy it online at websites like Anime Castle, Anime Nation, J List, Roberts Anime Corner Store and The Right Stuf International.  Where can I download anime or watch it online? For the most part, you can't legally download anime online. Fansubs are generally illegal (whether or not they're unethical is a completely different topic), and as such, we can't help you obtain them. You might want to check the sites listed below, and read our news, when there's legal anime to download or watched online we generally mention it.  Don't ask us where to get bootlegs or fansubs, we won't tell you.  Some sites/services that allow you to download or watch anime online legally(may or may not be free):  Amazon Prime crunchyroll Funimation's Website HiDive Apple iTunes hulu Netflix Viz Anime  * Why isn't YouTube listed? Because a lot of the content on YouTube is illegally uploaded. One day we'll have an index of legal anime on YouTube, but until then we aren't listing it as a site where all content is legal/authorized.   How do I watch anime on ANN? ANN has stopped streaming anime episodes. Go to the websites above!  Can you help me with my school assignment No. We get this question about once a week, and we don't really want to spend 25 hours a year answering school questions. The worst part is that most people who e-mail us are actually asking us to provide information they could find with a little bit of research, in other words, they're asking us to do their work for them. On the other hand, if you're working on a master's project or PhD thesis related to anime, that interests us, so we'd probably be more than happy to help.  Does ANN offer Internships? Yes, Anime News Network offers internships in our newsroom and our web-development departments. Further details are available here   What happened to ANN UK? In late May the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into effect. The EU determined that any website targeting European readers would be ""doing business in Europe."" Anime News Network does not disagree with this conclusion. Unfortunately, the GDPR requires all websites doing business in Europe to meet a stringent set of privacy regulations. While ANN supports the intent of these regulations, some of them are extremely difficult to comply with. While it is our intention, for the benefit of all readers our readers around the world, to comply with these new standards, we are not able to do so immediately. Once we are fully compliant with GDPR requirements, we will re-launch ANN UK.

Does ANN offer Internships? What happened to ANN UK?    About ANN  What is Anime News Network (ANN)? Anime News Network was created as a news source that focuses on the medium of Japanese Animation(anime) and Japanese Comics (manga). ANN was founded by Justin Sevakis in July of 1998, and has since lead the online anime news medium with a tradition of strong unbiased coverage of major breaking news. With in-depth coverage, analysis and commentary to provide insight into the world of anime and manga, ANN has been and continues to be the #1 English language source for anime and manga news on the Internet. ANN's goal is to make the latest, most comprehensive Anime news available to new fans and veteran Otaku alike.  What ANN is not:  A television network or station; A subsidiary of another company; A dubbing / voice recording studio; An animation company; A licensing or distribution company; A manufacturer or distributor of merchandise; For sale.    What is anime? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of anime, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, anime is animation that is primarily produced and conceived in Japan. This includes animation conceived in Japan that has portions outsourced to other countries, but does not include animation primarily produced outside Japan and with the animation outsourced to Japan. It does however include animation that is co-conceived inside and outside of Japan and at least partially produced inside Japan.  What is manga? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of manga, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, manga are comic books or strips that are produced and conceived in Japan. This includes include comics that are co-conceived inside and outside of Japan but produced in Japan.  Who operates ANN? ANN is operated by a team of people, under the guidance of Christopher Macdonald, Daniel DeLorme, Zac Bertschy, Egan Loo and Hori Shinsuke. A full list of the staff can be found on the staff page.   Who owns ANN? The website is owned by Anime News Network Inc., a privately owned corporation. The corporation's shareholders include: Christopher Macdonald (Minority owner, controlling shareholder), Hori Shinsuke (Minority owner), Anime Consortium Japan (Minority owner), others.   Where is ANN based? Wow, that question is so 1999! ANN is based everywhere and nowhere. We're based on the Internet! We don't have an office; our staff all work at home and are based around the world with the most full-time staff based in Japan and the United States. Anime News Network, Inc. the corporation that maintains ANN is a Canadian corporation.  Who is the mascot? When the site was first launched in 1998 it featured a blond-haired mascot named Jadress, created by Robin Sevakis. She was eventually replaced by Nina, who was featured in a webcomic (also created by Robin Sevakis) that ran from 2007 to 2013.  How often do you update? The site is run on a daily content format, as opposed to a monthly or bi-monthly magazine format. We update the news and reviews daily, and other content, such as features, columns, and editorials are also added throughout the week. Our encyclopedia is updated daily as well.  Under what settings is ANN best viewed? The site uses a responsive design that should look good at any resolution, from smartphones to large desktop screens.  How do I find older articles on ANN? Links to archives for news, features, columns, reviews, etc. can be found in their respective sections in the menu. You can also use the search engine.  What was used to make the site, as well as maintain it? The site is a combination of older parts in PHP and newer parts in Ruby, with a MySQL database to manage the content. Apart from the phpBB forum, we haven't used any pre-made packages; all the content is managed and presented with custom software.  How do I get permission to reprint an ANN Story, or obtain an ANN graphic or photo? ANN has a newsfeed program where you can get the latest anime news headlines on your very own website. If you wish to entirely reprint anything on your site please contact the editors. For more details about what you can and can not re-print with or without our permission, see our copyright statement.  How many people hear or read an ANN story? We get a bit over 200,000 visits every day. In addition to regular visitors, ANN's news is often sourced in print and occasionally on the airwaves.  How can I get in touch with the staff? Visit our contact page or visit our staff page for further contact and personal information. If a member's e-mail address is not there you can send your comments to the editors and we'll forward them.  Do you attend any public events? Yes. ANN tries to provide coverage to as many anime conventions/festivals/symposiums as our staff can manage. For more details on this see our events section and our events forum.  Do you have a newsfeed? You really should have an RSS newsfeed! Look at our newsfeed section for links to various RSS & Atom feeds as well as our custom newsfeed program. Submitting Content  How should I submit news ? Send an e-mail to [email protected] , this e-mail address is regularly monitored by several staff (someone is always ""on duty""). Other methods (e-mail directly to staff, PM, Forum, Twitter, etc...) are less reliable, and may lead to delays and/or a complete failure to notice your submission.  I have something to say about an online petition. Stop. Virtually every e-petition is a waste of time.   I submitted a news item, why wasn't it posted? We could still be in the process of verifying the details, we may not have been able to verify the items, or perhaps we didn't find it newsworthy enough to post. On a ""slow"" news day we're more likely to post less significant items.  I submitted a news item, why was it credited to someone else? They either submitted it first--or more importantly--submitted more information.  Can I submit news about a non-Japanese animation? No. We're Anime News Network, not ""Animation News Network"", not ""Asian Animation Network."" There's plenty of good animation from around the world, including Korea and China, but we only cover Japanese animation, not French, Mexican, Chinese, African, Korean or Afghanistanimation.  Can I submit a review? / How do I become a reviewer? Anime News Network does not accept unsolicited reviews. Take a quick look at the Staff Openings page, if there is an opening, it will be mentioned there. More often than not, we hire experienced writers who are known to us. Best piece of advice we can give is to make a name for yourself then we'll come to you when the time is right.  Can I submit an article? If you are an experienced writer/journalist with a portfolio you can point to, please E-mail the editors and ask about the topic, we'd be glad to consider your article idea.  Can I have a column? No. Only previous, regular contributors who have shown an ability to consistently write timely, quality articles (or reviews) are permitted to write columns. Try submitting some articles or reviews first.  Information X is missing from the Encyclopedia, can you add it? We can't add it, but YOU can. The Encyclopedia is a user-contributed database; it's made specially so that you can add missing information by yourself. You just need a user account. So please do take the time to register and submit the information you found was missing. Each page contains pointers about how to add information, and if that's not enough you can check the Encyclopedia FAQ or the memoranda.  How can I contribute to the encyclopedia? Any registered user can contribute standard data to the Encyclopedia for Anime, Manga and People. But if that's not enough for you and you're near the top of the contributors list and you'd like to help out with the releases, lexicon, or editing and verifying data submitted by other people, please contact the Encyclopedist.  Please note, that we'll be looking for someone who is inputting quality data, not just large amounts of data.   What if I want to contribute in some other way? We always appreciate whatever help and support that readers can give. If you'd like to help out at ANN in a way other than the ones described above, please contact the editors. There's so much to do at ANN that we're very appreciative of any help offered.   My company is making Anime, can you post a news article about it? Sorry, too many companies are trying to cash in on the popularity of Anime by making cartoons with big eyes and purple hair. We're sure you aren't like that, but... well actually, we aren't sure.  Why doesn't Anime News Network review world manga? Please see our definition of manga. It is Anime News Network's official position, and the personal belief of many of our staff, than there is nothing inheritently superior about Japanese manga when compared to world manga. However Anime News Network's purpose is to cover Japanese animation and comic books. Currently we do not have the resources to review all the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America. If and when we are able to review 100% of the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America, we will then consider expanding our area of review coverage to include manga-style comics (world manga) that originate outside of Japan.  Why didn't you post a news article about my (company's) new Anime or Manga? If your item is picked up in a distribution deal by a company that isn't being run out of someone's garage, then maybe its newsworthy. So when that happens, give us a shout, and we'll consider it, but if you can't tell us what makes your creation manga or anime (other than big eyes, purple hair and the like) you can pretty much forget it.  May I send you my company's product to review? If it's anime or manga-related, then yes. Contact editors[at]animenewsnetwork.com for shipping information.  I'm starting a new webmanga, is it news? No, there are a billion and one ""webmangas"", and most only last a couple of months. Now, if your webmanga gets licensed by a publisher... that might be news.  Can you mention my site? Only if you do something newsworthy, sorry.  Why have we been blacklisted? ANN has a 2-strikes rule regarding inappropriate PR. After 2 strikes for the following reasons we will blacklist your company or PR firm (when we blacklist a PR firm, we notify their relevant clients). i) Completely irrelevant PR that has nothing to do with anime, manga, Japanese pop-culture or any other related content; ii) Unauthorized stealth marketing on our forums; iii) Harassing our staff; iv) Continued PR submissions to inappropriate e-mail address. v) Any attempt to illicitly influence editorial We'll send you a link to this post after your first offense. After your second offense you'll never hear from us again (and our readers will never hear from you or your clients).  Isn't this a bit harsh? Perhaps, but we're tired of getting PRs for toilets, accounting firm management changes and World War 2 museums.   But we offer an opt-out! Clicking that link might opt us out of all your press releases, including your relevant ones. It would be the same as blacklisting you, without giving you the warning. Showing you this warning is actually less harsh than clicking your opt-out.  Forum / Account  I didn't receive my forum registration. If you are using a spam filter, please check your spam folder, some mail servers catch the registration code as spam. Search your spamfolder & inbox for e-mail from [email protected] or [email protected]. If you are using any sort of white list, please make sure that your e-mail account is set up to accept e-mails from [email protected] and [email protected]. If you are using a mail service that bounces the e-mail back to the sender and asks them to confirm that it is not spam, we will not do that. These services usually allow you to add the e-mail address to a white-list before hand. Once you have checked all of the above, you can have the server re-send you your activation code by going here. It should be instant, but sometimes e-mail is slow, give it a couple hours (the slowness is usually not because of our server). If you still don't get your activation code, then and ONLY then, e-mail us at [email protected] make sure that: 1) Your e-mail is sent from the e-mail address you submitted to ANN; 2) You include your user name; 3) Do not send us your password; 4) The subject of your e-mail must be ""activation code"".   How do I become a moderator? You're invited. When we feel there is a need for a new moderator, we look at our best forum users (the ones that contribute intelligently to conversation and act maturely) and ask them if they'd be willing to help us moderate the forum.  Will there ever be an off topic / general conversation forum among the forums? Not in the public areas, no. We do however maintain a community section for subscribers, and off-topic discussion is permitted there.  Why aren't my posts showing up? Posts from new users sometimes take a while to show up. Please be patient, they should appear within a few hours. Believe it or not, this is a ""feature"" not a ""bug.""  Is there a set of forum rules? Right here - read them if you haven't already.  Help, I've been banned or moderated! Read this.  How do I attach a picture (avatar) to my account? Read this.  Can I change my user name? You can make changes in your user account settings. But because other users depend on your username to recognize you, we have a ""no identity switcheroos"" policy: once you start using the forum we do not allow changes to your username beyond punctuation and capitalization.  Can I delete my account? Yes, you can. Go to your account settings page and you will be able to delete your account from there. Contests  Can I enter give-aways more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No.  Can I enter creative contests more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, Yes.  Does ANN ""own"" my entry? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No. But as a condition of your entry we generaly require you to give us the unrevocable right to display your entry on Anime News Network for all eternity.  Can I display my entry elsewhere? Yes, anywhere you please, unless otherwise stated in the contest rules.  Why do I have to put your logo and/or the sponsor's logo on my submission There are two reasons for this. First, it adds some extra benefit to the contest sponsors and second, it helps us insure that you made the entry for the contest, instead of just grabing some existing art and submiting it.  Explain those rules about where I live and whether or not I can enter and if you will ship me a prize. Most of our contest are open to anyone, regardless of where you live, because we don't believe in geographic discrimination. However sometimes our sponsors want a contest to only be open to their potential clients, so in those cases we have no choice to abide by their request to limit contest entry to a certain geographic area. While we don't believe in geographic discrimination, we also don't believe in spending a fortune on shipping and trying to figure out custom laws in order to get you your prize so that's why we only ship to the USA and Canada.   What does a complete mailing address look like? Short answer: ""It's what we need to put on a package to mail it to you."" It looks something like this:  416 William St. #402 Moralton, SS 70707 USA 24 Sussex Dr Ottawa, ON  K1A 0A3 Canada 1000 J.P. Laurel St. San Miguel 1005, Manila  Philippines   You'd be amazed at how many people enter our contests and leave out critical mailing information like their city, province/state and or postal/zip code. You'd also be amazed at how many people ask us ""What do you mean by complete mailing address?"" In fact, if you're reading this, it's quite possible that we referred you here because you asked that very question. Since we usually only ship to the USA and Canada, we won't disqualify you for leaving out the country, but if anything else is missing, we'll just pick another winner to replace you. We will not contact you to verify your mailing address. BTW, your name is not part of your mailing address, but we won't disqualify you for putting it in there...  Why do some contests not ship to PO Boxes? ANN usually doesn't handle shipping for our contest prizes. Shipping is done by the contest sponsor. If the contest states ""no PO boxes"" this is because our sponsor requested it. Most likely it is because they are shipping via a courier like UPS, which will not ship to PO boxes.  I'd really prefer it if you didn't post my name & city if I win This is done for legal reasons, sorry. That said, if you want to enter with an alias, that's fine as long as you are certain the package will reach you (we can't guarantee it will).  Why did you stop accepting art contest entries from Facebook By default, Facebook posts usually aren't public. Most people who submit Facebook URLs to our art contests forget to share their entries publicly, and we are often forced to disqualify these entries. It's better to just avoid the problem altogether. If you want to enter with Facebook, and you remember to make your entry public go ahead, we'll accept it. But if you forget to share it properly, we will simply ignore your entry.   Miscellaneous   Can I link to you? Yes, please feel free. Currently we don't have any banners to offer you for this, we'll be making some new ones shortly.  Can you link to me? No. We are not a link exchange site.  Wait, I can link to you, but you won't link to me?? Yes, we know it sounds a little conceited of us, but that's how it is. To be fair, we don't expect you to link to us, but we're honored if you do decide that you'd like to link to our site despite the fact that we won't be returning the favor. Please don't link to us if you're only doing it because you hope to get something in return; link to us because you feel that you want more people to know about Anime News Network.   Can we trade banners? Sorry, ANN relies on its banners to survive. We very seldom trade banners with another website or publication. If your publication is in print (10 000+ circulation) or a website with 10 million+ impressions per month, we may consider it. Please understand, ANN receives this question at least once a week, it isn't possible for us to even consider swapping / affiliating with so many sites, so we generally don't swap / affiliate with any.  Can you affiliate with us? Anime News Network would be happy to setup an affiliate program with any online store that pays referral fees provided that store meets certain pre-requisites. Anime News Network is unfortunately unable to affiliate itself with fan-sites much for the same reason that we can not link to you or trade banners with you (see above two entries).  Why'd you give this show a rating of ... in your review? Clearly it deserved a ... ! Obviously our reviewer disagrees.  When is title X coming out, how many episodes is it, and/or who is releasing it? Look it up in the encyclopedia, ask Answerman, or ask in the forum.  Why'd you make X change to the programming on [Cartoon Network, YTV, etc]? Uhh, try contacting the broadcaster, network or station. We're a news site and we have no more control over the schedule at [TV Station] than any other media source. Yes, believe it or not we get this question every so often.  I'd like to license, work on, be involved with, etc... one of your titles Just like we aren't involved in TV broadcasting, we are not licensors. Even for shows that we stream on ANN, we are not authorized to sub-license them to other companies. Contact the producers or the licensors, not us.  I'd like permission to do something with one of your titles Sorry, we do not control copyright permissions for any anime or manga. If you need permission to do something, contact the local licensee / master licensor; or failing that, contact the master licensor in Japan. A bit of advice though, for personal, non commercial projects, don't bother contacting them unless you absolutely need permission. They don't care if you make a 1-off t-shirt to wear to school, but if you ask them, they'll probably say ""No,"" as a matter of policy. Sorry we can not help you get in contact with a rights holder.  Why'd you take my video show off YouTube? We get this question a lot. We didn't take your video down. See the above answer as well as the first one. ANN has no involvement in the process of taking pirated materials off of websites like YouTube. For your information, the material was probably taken down because it was uploaded without permission (therefore illegally) and the licensors want you to watch it somewhere they will make money (on DVD, on TV, or on an authorized website). Go here for a list of places where you can legally watch anime and support the creators at the same time.  On a related note, allow us to point out that your video was probably automatically removed by a technology called video-fingerprinting. By this semi-automated process, YouTube removes videos that it believes infringe on copyrights without waiting for complaints from copyright holders. So it's quite possible that no anime company was involved in the removal of your video.   Sadly, this process can affect videos that are legitimate ""fair-use."" Even more sadly, the employees at the anime companies are too busy to bother reading all the e-mails they get about videos (the vast majority of are from morons that don't understand that ""I wasn't making money"" doesn't make it okay) so you can e-mail them to your hearts content, but they probably won't answer (not because they're fan-hating assholes, but because they don't have the time).    If you believe your video is legitimate fair-use (full episodes are never fair use, significant episode clips are rarely fair use, AMVs are almost never fair use of the music) try posting it again and include in the description why you feel it is fair use. If you're lucky, YouTube will take this into consideration (some videos are deleted automatically, others are looked at by a human employee at YouTube after the fingerprinting process identifies them) and not delete your video. You really should read up on ""fair use"" before you make any claims that your video is fair use though. And by ""read-up,"" we mean read professional, expert explanations, not your friend's blog.   I have a great idea for an anime or manga, where do I submit it? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not involved with the creation process of any anime or manga and we can not put you in contact with creators (more on that here). Finally, we'd recommend you read this and this.  How do I get your television channel? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not The Anime Network (TAN). For details on TAN, read the transcript of our chat with them, read our TAN news coverage, or visit their website.  Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? No. As a policy, ANN never gives out contact information. Don't send us this question unless you've exhausted every other resource available (phone book, 411, Google, their website, etc...), even then, we will only forward your request to them, and we will only do so provided it is a business-to-business request being made by a company we've actually heard of. If you can't find Hayao Miyazaki's e-mail address online, it's probably because he doesn't want to receive a thousand e-mails a day. The one exception to this rule is that we will give out the Public Relations / Press Relations (PR) contact information for a company provided we have it readily available. Generally you can find this information on your own though, so please don't be lazy. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? I'm an old acquaintance of theirs. The answer is still no. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? They worked on one of your projects. Just to be clear, our encyclopedia carries information about a myriad of projects (anime,manga, etc...) most of which (99.9%) Anime News Network is not, and never was, involved with. It is not a list of our projects. So if the person actually worked for ANN, please see this answer, but if they are one of the 67023+ people listed in the encyclopedia, they probably didn't work for us and therefore the previous two answers apply. Okay, I understand, you can't or won't put me in contact with them, but I really want/need to contact this person. Can you offer any suggestions on how to proceed? Depending on who you're trying to contact, they might have a fanclub, official webpage, or e-mail address listed in their encyclopedia entry. If not, try looking for the latest production they worked on and contacting the production company, they might be able and willing to forward your e-mail. Just a note, if you're contacting someone in Japan, it's highly recommended that at least your intro be in Japanese. Even if your intended recipient understands English, the person you ask to forward your e-mail might not. For your benefit, here's a quick intro you can prepend to any e-mail you send to Japan (replaces the blanks by the name of the person you are trying to contact): ご担当者様へ お世話になっております。 本社は____様にご連絡を取りたがっています。お手数ですが、このメールを____様へ転送して頂けないでしょうか? 宜しくお願いします。  Literally: To whom it may concern/the person in charge: Thank you for your time. We are trying to contact _____. If it isn't too much trouble, could you forward this e-mail to ____? Thank you very much.    Can you send me your catalog? We don't have a catalog, we don't sell anything.  Where can I buy Anime ? You can buy it at retail movie stores like Blockbuster and Suncoast as well as specialty Anime Shops. You can also buy it online at websites like Anime Castle, Anime Nation, J List, Roberts Anime Corner Store and The Right Stuf International.  Where can I download anime or watch it online? For the most part, you can't legally download anime online. Fansubs are generally illegal (whether or not they're unethical is a completely different topic), and as such, we can't help you obtain them. You might want to check the sites listed below, and read our news, when there's legal anime to download or watched online we generally mention it.  Don't ask us where to get bootlegs or fansubs, we won't tell you.  Some sites/services that allow you to download or watch anime online legally(may or may not be free):  Amazon Prime crunchyroll Funimation's Website HiDive Apple iTunes hulu Netflix Viz Anime  * Why isn't YouTube listed? Because a lot of the content on YouTube is illegally uploaded. One day we'll have an index of legal anime on YouTube, but until then we aren't listing it as a site where all content is legal/authorized.   How do I watch anime on ANN? ANN has stopped streaming anime episodes. Go to the websites above!  Can you help me with my school assignment No. We get this question about once a week, and we don't really want to spend 25 hours a year answering school questions. The worst part is that most people who e-mail us are actually asking us to provide information they could find with a little bit of research, in other words, they're asking us to do their work for them. On the other hand, if you're working on a master's project or PhD thesis related to anime, that interests us, so we'd probably be more than happy to help.  Does ANN offer Internships? Yes, Anime News Network offers internships in our newsroom and our web-development departments. Further details are available here   What happened to ANN UK? In late May the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into effect. The EU determined that any website targeting European readers would be ""doing business in Europe."" Anime News Network does not disagree with this conclusion. Unfortunately, the GDPR requires all websites doing business in Europe to meet a stringent set of privacy regulations. While ANN supports the intent of these regulations, some of them are extremely difficult to comply with. While it is our intention, for the benefit of all readers our readers around the world, to comply with these new standards, we are not able to do so immediately. Once we are fully compliant with GDPR requirements, we will re-launch ANN UK. In the meantime, ANN's global edition is available to all readers worldwide and is the default version for readers outside of North America, Australia, New Zealand and South East Asia.

Teasing Master Takagi-san Season 3 Episode 12  by James Beckett, Mar 31st 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Teasing Master Takagi-san (TV 3) ?                     Community score: 4.8             Wow. Given how absolutely wonderful this third season of Teasing Master Takagi-san has been, I was trying to keep my expectations as low-key as possible going into this finale. There's a shiny new theatrical release on its way, after all, so I figured that the show would save its biggest romantic revelations for the big screen. Now, it's true that we don't technically get a confession this week, so that Takagi-san movie still has some ammo left in its pocket to work with, but that doesn't prevent “March 14th” from being one of the most sweet and satisfying finales that I've ever seen in a romance anime. Even if we didn't have a movie to look forward to, and this final episode of Season 3 was the last we were ever going to see of Nishikata and Takagi, I would have walked away from Teasing Master Takagi-san feeling completely satisfied. To steal a phrase from New Girl's Schmidt: “No notes!” First of all, it is impossible to understate how gosh darned adorable it is to see Nishikata slowly-but-surely piece together his own feelings for Takagi after Hamaguchi tries to pressure him into confessing to Takagi. At first, of course, Nishikata feels like there is no way that he feels anything other than a friendly (but fierce) rivalry towards the girl who teases him so much, and his elaborately designed “Nishikata Quest” is going to be the ultimate test of Takagi's mental fortitude against his. It's just pure, platonic friendship that is fueling Nishikata's urge to spend inordinate amounts of time arranging elaborate scavenger hunts for the girl he spends nearly every minute of his free time with…right? Sure, he does like hanging out with Takagi, and he can admit that she's pretty cute…and his heart starts to sink when he realizes she's not around to play the usual games with him in class…and he was so excited to see her face when she discovered the game-to-end-all-games that he made just for her… That alone would have been enough to dial my heart's Melt-o-Meter™ to dangerously high levels, but then the show actually goes out of its way to bring back the sneaky love confession that Takagi gave with that book she was teasing Nishikata with all the way back in Episode 2. Nishikata learns that there certainly wasn't an oddly specific and direct love confession for Takagi to read in the text of the book, and if that was Takagi trying to stealthily communicate her true feelings for Nishikata, then maybe the dozens of other times she's pulled similar stunts have also been…. (Dear readers, let me tell you that watching the truth of it all slowly dawn on our precious idiot's face has been one of the anime highlights of the past who-knows-how-long for me. I can only thank the Anime Gods that text reviews are incapable of transmitting the embarrassing noises I was making for half of this episode).  Also, can we talk for a moment about how incredible of a boyfriend Nishikata is going to be once he realizes that he's already been dating Takagi for, like, two years now? Nishikata may have been able to fool himself into thinking that “Nishikata Quest” was nothing more than an attempt to finally one-up his lifelong rival, but you and I (and the Girl Squad!) all know that his insanely elaborate scavenger hunt is one of the most romantic gestures imaginable, and if I had just one completely petty complaint to make about “March 14th”, it is that we have to settle for watching Mina and Co. solve all of the puzzles instead of Takagi herself. Yes, I am fully aware that the sight of Takagi falling in love with Nishikata all over again as she played Nishikata Quest would likely have fully killed me, or at the very least sent me into a shock-induced coma, but dammit, that's a risk I'm willing to take! I need this, Takagi-san! Ah well. I suppose I'll just have to settle for the utterly delightful ending scene that sees Nishikata racing after Takagi's car to make sure he can get her the traditional White Day gift on time. Could I maybe nitpick a little about how some of the running animation looks a little off, or how the general timing of the scene feels just a little bit stretched out? Sure, I could…if I was a monster that hated love and art. I am not a monster, though, so instead I will simply revel in the simple joy that comes from watching two sweet kids get one step closer to expressing how much they love each other. Sure, Nishikata might not say “I love you” in this finale, but he doesn't need to. All Takagi needs to hear is that the boy of her dreams wanted nothing more than to see her, and to give her a small token of appreciation, because she really does mean the world to him.  That's more than enough for me. Whatever comes next for Teasing Master Takagi-san is just icing on the cake. What we've got here, already, is maybe about as close to a perfect anime love story is you can get. Rating:                 Teasing Master Takagi-san Season 3 is currently streaming on HIDIVE.

Teasing Master Takagi-san Season 3 Episode 12  by James Beckett, Mar 31st 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Teasing Master Takagi-san (TV 3) ?                     Community score: 4.8             Wow. Given how absolutely wonderful this third season of Teasing Master Takagi-san has been, I was trying to keep my expectations as low-key as possible going into this finale. There's a shiny new theatrical release on its way, after all, so I figured that the show would save its biggest romantic revelations for the big screen. Now, it's true that we don't technically get a confession this week, so that Takagi-san movie still has some ammo left in its pocket to work with, but that doesn't prevent “March 14th” from being one of the most sweet and satisfying finales that I've ever seen in a romance anime. Even if we didn't have a movie to look forward to, and this final episode of Season 3 was the last we were ever going to see of Nishikata and Takagi, I would have walked away from Teasing Master Takagi-san feeling completely satisfied. To steal a phrase from New Girl's Schmidt: “No notes!” First of all, it is impossible to understate how gosh darned adorable it is to see Nishikata slowly-but-surely piece together his own feelings for Takagi after Hamaguchi tries to pressure him into confessing to Takagi. At first, of course, Nishikata feels like there is no way that he feels anything other than a friendly (but fierce) rivalry towards the girl who teases him so much, and his elaborately designed “Nishikata Quest” is going to be the ultimate test of Takagi's mental fortitude against his. It's just pure, platonic friendship that is fueling Nishikata's urge to spend inordinate amounts of time arranging elaborate scavenger hunts for the girl he spends nearly every minute of his free time with…right? Sure, he does like hanging out with Takagi, and he can admit that she's pretty cute…and his heart starts to sink when he realizes she's not around to play the usual games with him in class…and he was so excited to see her face when she discovered the game-to-end-all-games that he made just for her… That alone would have been enough to dial my heart's Melt-o-Meter™ to dangerously high levels, but then the show actually goes out of its way to bring back the sneaky love confession that Takagi gave with that book she was teasing Nishikata with all the way back in Episode 2. Nishikata learns that there certainly wasn't an oddly specific and direct love confession for Takagi to read in the text of the book, and if that was Takagi trying to stealthily communicate her true feelings for Nishikata, then maybe the dozens of other times she's pulled similar stunts have also been…. (Dear readers, let me tell you that watching the truth of it all slowly dawn on our precious idiot's face has been one of the anime highlights of the past who-knows-how-long for me. I can only thank the Anime Gods that text reviews are incapable of transmitting the embarrassing noises I was making for half of this episode).  Also, can we talk for a moment about how incredible of a boyfriend Nishikata is going to be once he realizes that he's already been dating Takagi for, like, two years now? Nishikata may have been able to fool himself into thinking that “Nishikata Quest” was nothing more than an attempt to finally one-up his lifelong rival, but you and I (and the Girl Squad!) all know that his insanely elaborate scavenger hunt is one of the most romantic gestures imaginable, and if I had just one completely petty complaint to make about “March 14th”, it is that we have to settle for watching Mina and Co. solve all of the puzzles instead of Takagi herself. Yes, I am fully aware that the sight of Takagi falling in love with Nishikata all over again as she played Nishikata Quest would likely have fully killed me, or at the very least sent me into a shock-induced coma, but dammit, that's a risk I'm willing to take! I need this, Takagi-san! Ah well. I suppose I'll just have to settle for the utterly delightful ending scene that sees Nishikata racing after Takagi's car to make sure he can get her the traditional White Day gift on time. Could I maybe nitpick a little about how some of the running animation looks a little off, or how the general timing of the scene feels just a little bit stretched out? Sure, I could…if I was a monster that hated love and art. I am not a monster, though, so instead I will simply revel in the simple joy that comes from watching two sweet kids get one step closer to expressing how much they love each other. Sure, Nishikata might not say “I love you” in this finale, but he doesn't need to. All Takagi needs to hear is that the boy of her dreams wanted nothing more than to see her, and to give her a small token of appreciation, because she really does mean the world to him.  That's more than enough for me. Whatever comes next for Teasing Master Takagi-san is just icing on the cake. What we've got here, already, is maybe about as close to a perfect anime love story is you can get. Rating:                 Teasing Master Takagi-san Season 3 is currently streaming on HIDIVE.

Teasing Master Takagi-san Season 3 Episode 12  by James Beckett, Mar 31st 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Teasing Master Takagi-san (TV 3) ?                     Community score: 4.8             Wow. Given how absolutely wonderful this third season of Teasing Master Takagi-san has been, I was trying to keep my expectations as low-key as possible going into this finale. There's a shiny new theatrical release on its way, after all, so I figured that the show would save its biggest romantic revelations for the big screen. Now, it's true that we don't technically get a confession this week, so that Takagi-san movie still has some ammo left in its pocket to work with, but that doesn't prevent “March 14th” from being one of the most sweet and satisfying finales that I've ever seen in a romance anime. Even if we didn't have a movie to look forward to, and this final episode of Season 3 was the last we were ever going to see of Nishikata and Takagi, I would have walked away from Teasing Master Takagi-san feeling completely satisfied. To steal a phrase from New Girl's Schmidt: “No notes!” First of all, it is impossible to understate how gosh darned adorable it is to see Nishikata slowly-but-surely piece together his own feelings for Takagi after Hamaguchi tries to pressure him into confessing to Takagi. At first, of course, Nishikata feels like there is no way that he feels anything other than a friendly (but fierce) rivalry towards the girl who teases him so much, and his elaborately designed “Nishikata Quest” is going to be the ultimate test of Takagi's mental fortitude against his. It's just pure, platonic friendship that is fueling Nishikata's urge to spend inordinate amounts of time arranging elaborate scavenger hunts for the girl he spends nearly every minute of his free time with…right? Sure, he does like hanging out with Takagi, and he can admit that she's pretty cute…and his heart starts to sink when he realizes she's not around to play the usual games with him in class…and he was so excited to see her face when she discovered the game-to-end-all-games that he made just for her… That alone would have been enough to dial my heart's Melt-o-Meter™ to dangerously high levels, but then the show actually goes out of its way to bring back the sneaky love confession that Takagi gave with that book she was teasing Nishikata with all the way back in Episode 2. Nishikata learns that there certainly wasn't an oddly specific and direct love confession for Takagi to read in the text of the book, and if that was Takagi trying to stealthily communicate her true feelings for Nishikata, then maybe the dozens of other times she's pulled similar stunts have also been…. (Dear readers, let me tell you that watching the truth of it all slowly dawn on our precious idiot's face has been one of the anime highlights of the past who-knows-how-long for me. I can only thank the Anime Gods that text reviews are incapable of transmitting the embarrassing noises I was making for half of this episode).  Also, can we talk for a moment about how incredible of a boyfriend Nishikata is going to be once he realizes that he's already been dating Takagi for, like, two years now? Nishikata may have been able to fool himself into thinking that “Nishikata Quest” was nothing more than an attempt to finally one-up his lifelong rival, but you and I (and the Girl Squad!) all know that his insanely elaborate scavenger hunt is one of the most romantic gestures imaginable, and if I had just one completely petty complaint to make about “March 14th”, it is that we have to settle for watching Mina and Co. solve all of the puzzles instead of Takagi herself. Yes, I am fully aware that the sight of Takagi falling in love with Nishikata all over again as she played Nishikata Quest would likely have fully killed me, or at the very least sent me into a shock-induced coma, but dammit, that's a risk I'm willing to take! I need this, Takagi-san! Ah well. I suppose I'll just have to settle for the utterly delightful ending scene that sees Nishikata racing after Takagi's car to make sure he can get her the traditional White Day gift on time. Could I maybe nitpick a little about how some of the running animation looks a little off, or how the general timing of the scene feels just a little bit stretched out? Sure, I could…if I was a monster that hated love and art. I am not a monster, though, so instead I will simply revel in the simple joy that comes from watching two sweet kids get one step closer to expressing how much they love each other. Sure, Nishikata might not say “I love you” in this finale, but he doesn't need to. All Takagi needs to hear is that the boy of her dreams wanted nothing more than to see her, and to give her a small token of appreciation, because she really does mean the world to him.  That's more than enough for me. Whatever comes next for Teasing Master Takagi-san is just icing on the cake. What we've got here, already, is maybe about as close to a perfect anime love story is you can get. Rating:                 Teasing Master Takagi-san Season 3 is currently streaming on HIDIVE.

Community score: 4.8             Wow. Given how absolutely wonderful this third season of Teasing Master Takagi-san has been, I was trying to keep my expectations as low-key as possible going into this finale. There's a shiny new theatrical release on its way, after all, so I figured that the show would save its biggest romantic revelations for the big screen. Now, it's true that we don't technically get a confession this week, so that Takagi-san movie still has some ammo left in its pocket to work with, but that doesn't prevent “March 14th” from being one of the most sweet and satisfying finales that I've ever seen in a romance anime. Even if we didn't have a movie to look forward to, and this final episode of Season 3 was the last we were ever going to see of Nishikata and Takagi, I would have walked away from Teasing Master Takagi-san feeling completely satisfied. To steal a phrase from New Girl's Schmidt: “No notes!” First of all, it is impossible to understate how gosh darned adorable it is to see Nishikata slowly-but-surely piece together his own feelings for Takagi after Hamaguchi tries to pressure him into confessing to Takagi. At first, of course, Nishikata feels like there is no way that he feels anything other than a friendly (but fierce) rivalry towards the girl who teases him so much, and his elaborately designed “Nishikata Quest” is going to be the ultimate test of Takagi's mental fortitude against his. It's just pure, platonic friendship that is fueling Nishikata's urge to spend inordinate amounts of time arranging elaborate scavenger hunts for the girl he spends nearly every minute of his free time with…right? Sure, he does like hanging out with Takagi, and he can admit that she's pretty cute…and his heart starts to sink when he realizes she's not around to play the usual games with him in class…and he was so excited to see her face when she discovered the game-to-end-all-games that he made just for her… That alone would have been enough to dial my heart's Melt-o-Meter™ to dangerously high levels, but then the show actually goes out of its way to bring back the sneaky love confession that Takagi gave with that book she was teasing Nishikata with all the way back in Episode 2. Nishikata learns that there certainly wasn't an oddly specific and direct love confession for Takagi to read in the text of the book, and if that was Takagi trying to stealthily communicate her true feelings for Nishikata, then maybe the dozens of other times she's pulled similar stunts have also been…. (Dear readers, let me tell you that watching the truth of it all slowly dawn on our precious idiot's face has been one of the anime highlights of the past who-knows-how-long for me. I can only thank the Anime Gods that text reviews are incapable of transmitting the embarrassing noises I was making for half of this episode).  Also, can we talk for a moment about how incredible of a boyfriend Nishikata is going to be once he realizes that he's already been dating Takagi for, like, two years now? Nishikata may have been able to fool himself into thinking that “Nishikata Quest” was nothing more than an attempt to finally one-up his lifelong rival, but you and I (and the Girl Squad!) all know that his insanely elaborate scavenger hunt is one of the most romantic gestures imaginable, and if I had just one completely petty complaint to make about “March 14th”, it is that we have to settle for watching Mina and Co. solve all of the puzzles instead of Takagi herself. Yes, I am fully aware that the sight of Takagi falling in love with Nishikata all over again as she played Nishikata Quest would likely have fully killed me, or at the very least sent me into a shock-induced coma, but dammit, that's a risk I'm willing to take! I need this, Takagi-san! Ah well. I suppose I'll just have to settle for the utterly delightful ending scene that sees Nishikata racing after Takagi's car to make sure he can get her the traditional White Day gift on time. Could I maybe nitpick a little about how some of the running animation looks a little off, or how the general timing of the scene feels just a little bit stretched out? Sure, I could…if I was a monster that hated love and art. I am not a monster, though, so instead I will simply revel in the simple joy that comes from watching two sweet kids get one step closer to expressing how much they love each other. Sure, Nishikata might not say “I love you” in this finale, but he doesn't need to. All Takagi needs to hear is that the boy of her dreams wanted nothing more than to see her, and to give her a small token of appreciation, because she really does mean the world to him.  That's more than enough for me. Whatever comes next for Teasing Master Takagi-san is just icing on the cake. What we've got here, already, is maybe about as close to a perfect anime love story is you can get. Rating:                 Teasing Master Takagi-san Season 3 is currently streaming on HIDIVE.

Sure, he does like hanging out with Takagi, and he can admit that she's pretty cute…and his heart starts to sink when he realizes she's not around to play the usual games with him in class…and he was so excited to see her face when she discovered the game-to-end-all-games that he made just for her… That alone would have been enough to dial my heart's Melt-o-Meter™ to dangerously high levels, but then the show actually goes out of its way to bring back the sneaky love confession that Takagi gave with that book she was teasing Nishikata with all the way back in Episode 2. Nishikata learns that there certainly wasn't an oddly specific and direct love confession for Takagi to read in the text of the book, and if that was Takagi trying to stealthily communicate her true feelings for Nishikata, then maybe the dozens of other times she's pulled similar stunts have also been…. (Dear readers, let me tell you that watching the truth of it all slowly dawn on our precious idiot's face has been one of the anime highlights of the past who-knows-how-long for me. I can only thank the Anime Gods that text reviews are incapable of transmitting the embarrassing noises I was making for half of this episode).  Also, can we talk for a moment about how incredible of a boyfriend Nishikata is going to be once he realizes that he's already been dating Takagi for, like, two years now? Nishikata may have been able to fool himself into thinking that “Nishikata Quest” was nothing more than an attempt to finally one-up his lifelong rival, but you and I (and the Girl Squad!) all know that his insanely elaborate scavenger hunt is one of the most romantic gestures imaginable, and if I had just one completely petty complaint to make about “March 14th”, it is that we have to settle for watching Mina and Co. solve all of the puzzles instead of Takagi herself. Yes, I am fully aware that the sight of Takagi falling in love with Nishikata all over again as she played Nishikata Quest would likely have fully killed me, or at the very least sent me into a shock-induced coma, but dammit, that's a risk I'm willing to take! I need this, Takagi-san! Ah well. I suppose I'll just have to settle for the utterly delightful ending scene that sees Nishikata racing after Takagi's car to make sure he can get her the traditional White Day gift on time. Could I maybe nitpick a little about how some of the running animation looks a little off, or how the general timing of the scene feels just a little bit stretched out? Sure, I could…if I was a monster that hated love and art. I am not a monster, though, so instead I will simply revel in the simple joy that comes from watching two sweet kids get one step closer to expressing how much they love each other. Sure, Nishikata might not say “I love you” in this finale, but he doesn't need to. All Takagi needs to hear is that the boy of her dreams wanted nothing more than to see her, and to give her a small token of appreciation, because she really does mean the world to him.  That's more than enough for me. Whatever comes next for Teasing Master Takagi-san is just icing on the cake. What we've got here, already, is maybe about as close to a perfect anime love story is you can get. Rating:                 Teasing Master Takagi-san Season 3 is currently streaming on HIDIVE.

Interest Levi Gets Pumped on Caffeine   posted on 2022-04-06 00:45 UTC-8 by Choo Sum Lee           A new commercial for the energy drink ZONe is starring Levi Ackermann from the Attack on Titan series, possibly capitalizing on the connection between the drink and the electric moments of Levi being ""in the zone"" and pulling off inhuman feats of Titan-slaying.      The commercial, ""To the Invincible Zone, Levi""  depicts Levi confronting the Beast Titan in a city inspired by modern-day Shibuya.    Additionally, the ZONe members program has also started in conjunction with the release of the commercial. By scanning the QR code attached to the ZONe account and accumulating points, members can enter a giveaway for various limited edition goods and receive other special offers.

Re:Dive Season 2 Episode 12  by Richard Eisenbeis, Mar 30th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Princess Connect! Re:Dive (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.5           This, the final episode of Princess Connect! Re:Dive, is a roller coaster. It's fast-paced, flashy, and hits all the emotional ups and downs you'd expect. It's easy to get caught up in cheering for our heroes in their final battle and feel satisfied at the happy end they've earned.    Pecorine saves the people of Landsol, reunites with her family, and even manages to do it without killing anyone. Kayrl, on the other hand, is able to stand with her new friends, establish the personal connection with Kaiser she's always wanted, and save Kaiser's life—even if that means Kaiser will be imprisoned indefinitely. Lastly, Yuuki is able to do what he wasn't able to do in the previous loop—put it all on the line for his friends and come out victorious. These are all good, solid endings to our heroes and their character arcs—and we even get a ton of extra fanservice as every character we've met so far shows up either in the climax or gets a little epilogue still-frame (or both).    Unfortunately, this episode comes with one major problem—one that has plagued the series as a whole on one level or another: It only really works beyond a surface level if you've played the game. For anime-only viewers, it's got to feel like you're missing major swaths of the story even as the main credits roll. You know that there is some sort of bigger tale going on with Kaiser, Labyrista, and Neneka but nothing about the specifics.    This hurts the anime in a massive way—especially as the series never truly dives into the main villain's motivations. Oh sure, we are told Kaiser is tired from having lived the looping world so many times—and that she hopes to make a utopia. But what does this mean exactly? What is a utopia for Kaiser? Who is the “Minerva” she prays to and what part would Minerva play in all this? And what does pulling Sol Tower down have to do with anything? Heck, beyond the last reset (which was done for Yuuki's sake) we don't even know why loops occur in the first place!    Of course, mentioning important things in passing while never explaining them is hardly new for the show. What are the “Seven Crowns”? What does it mean to be a “Princess Knight”? How/why did Yuuki become Labyrista's? These are important questions and not knowing the answers leaves more than a few holes in this episode's climax.    Overall, the series has tried to make a show that works for both Princess Connect newbies and players of the game—and on some level it has. The emotional character arcs for the Gourmet Guild are well-build and well-defined. We've come to know their goals, motivations, and backstories—and it's easy to root for them. However, the lack of a clear explanation for the setting and the villain's motivations leaves the show with a giant hole in the middle. Though, given that this anime exists largely to get people to play the game, maybe that's the point: “Confused? I guess you'll just have to download the game then, won't you?”    Rating:                Random Thoughts:   •	We never did find out what the shadow did and what the real kaiser did in the story overall. Oh well!    •	Looking back, it's odd but Kokkoro didn't really get an arc. She was more just the kind, loving, straight-man.    •	I don't know why Little Lyrical of all possible guilds got so much of the spotlight in these final three episodes but the payoff of them getting to do a classic GINAX Pose was well worth it.    •	I loved the effect of Jun's platemail rippling like liquid from Kaiser's attack.    •	If you didn't know that Jun was voiced by Ayako Kawasumi, having her do the classic Fate Stay/night Saber pose probably spelled it out for you.    •	I am shocked that Twinkle Wish did not appear—implying they are well and truly dead. I did not expect that. Knowing that they are dead and not coming back makes Yuuki's depression a few episodes back far more powerful. Unfortunately, at the time, the thought of the original game's three main characters actually being dead was so unbelievable that I rejected the concept outright and all the drama was lost.    •	All in all, this season was much better than I expected it would be. I had a lot of fun writing these reviews and I hope you enjoyed reading them just as much.       Princess Connect! Re:Dive is currently streaming on Crunchyroll.

Re:Dive Season 2 Episode 12  by Richard Eisenbeis, Mar 30th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Princess Connect! Re:Dive (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.5           This, the final episode of Princess Connect! Re:Dive, is a roller coaster. It's fast-paced, flashy, and hits all the emotional ups and downs you'd expect. It's easy to get caught up in cheering for our heroes in their final battle and feel satisfied at the happy end they've earned.    Pecorine saves the people of Landsol, reunites with her family, and even manages to do it without killing anyone. Kayrl, on the other hand, is able to stand with her new friends, establish the personal connection with Kaiser she's always wanted, and save Kaiser's life—even if that means Kaiser will be imprisoned indefinitely. Lastly, Yuuki is able to do what he wasn't able to do in the previous loop—put it all on the line for his friends and come out victorious. These are all good, solid endings to our heroes and their character arcs—and we even get a ton of extra fanservice as every character we've met so far shows up either in the climax or gets a little epilogue still-frame (or both).    Unfortunately, this episode comes with one major problem—one that has plagued the series as a whole on one level or another: It only really works beyond a surface level if you've played the game. For anime-only viewers, it's got to feel like you're missing major swaths of the story even as the main credits roll. You know that there is some sort of bigger tale going on with Kaiser, Labyrista, and Neneka but nothing about the specifics.    This hurts the anime in a massive way—especially as the series never truly dives into the main villain's motivations. Oh sure, we are told Kaiser is tired from having lived the looping world so many times—and that she hopes to make a utopia. But what does this mean exactly? What is a utopia for Kaiser? Who is the “Minerva” she prays to and what part would Minerva play in all this? And what does pulling Sol Tower down have to do with anything? Heck, beyond the last reset (which was done for Yuuki's sake) we don't even know why loops occur in the first place!    Of course, mentioning important things in passing while never explaining them is hardly new for the show. What are the “Seven Crowns”? What does it mean to be a “Princess Knight”? How/why did Yuuki become Labyrista's? These are important questions and not knowing the answers leaves more than a few holes in this episode's climax.    Overall, the series has tried to make a show that works for both Princess Connect newbies and players of the game—and on some level it has. The emotional character arcs for the Gourmet Guild are well-build and well-defined. We've come to know their goals, motivations, and backstories—and it's easy to root for them. However, the lack of a clear explanation for the setting and the villain's motivations leaves the show with a giant hole in the middle. Though, given that this anime exists largely to get people to play the game, maybe that's the point: “Confused? I guess you'll just have to download the game then, won't you?”    Rating:                Random Thoughts:   •	We never did find out what the shadow did and what the real kaiser did in the story overall. Oh well!    •	Looking back, it's odd but Kokkoro didn't really get an arc. She was more just the kind, loving, straight-man.    •	I don't know why Little Lyrical of all possible guilds got so much of the spotlight in these final three episodes but the payoff of them getting to do a classic GINAX Pose was well worth it.    •	I loved the effect of Jun's platemail rippling like liquid from Kaiser's attack.    •	If you didn't know that Jun was voiced by Ayako Kawasumi, having her do the classic Fate Stay/night Saber pose probably spelled it out for you.    •	I am shocked that Twinkle Wish did not appear—implying they are well and truly dead. I did not expect that. Knowing that they are dead and not coming back makes Yuuki's depression a few episodes back far more powerful. Unfortunately, at the time, the thought of the original game's three main characters actually being dead was so unbelievable that I rejected the concept outright and all the drama was lost.    •	All in all, this season was much better than I expected it would be. I had a lot of fun writing these reviews and I hope you enjoyed reading them just as much.       Princess Connect! Re:Dive is currently streaming on Crunchyroll.

Re:Dive Season 2 Episode 12  by Richard Eisenbeis, Mar 30th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Princess Connect! Re:Dive (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.5           This, the final episode of Princess Connect! Re:Dive, is a roller coaster. It's fast-paced, flashy, and hits all the emotional ups and downs you'd expect. It's easy to get caught up in cheering for our heroes in their final battle and feel satisfied at the happy end they've earned.    Pecorine saves the people of Landsol, reunites with her family, and even manages to do it without killing anyone. Kayrl, on the other hand, is able to stand with her new friends, establish the personal connection with Kaiser she's always wanted, and save Kaiser's life—even if that means Kaiser will be imprisoned indefinitely. Lastly, Yuuki is able to do what he wasn't able to do in the previous loop—put it all on the line for his friends and come out victorious. These are all good, solid endings to our heroes and their character arcs—and we even get a ton of extra fanservice as every character we've met so far shows up either in the climax or gets a little epilogue still-frame (or both).    Unfortunately, this episode comes with one major problem—one that has plagued the series as a whole on one level or another: It only really works beyond a surface level if you've played the game. For anime-only viewers, it's got to feel like you're missing major swaths of the story even as the main credits roll. You know that there is some sort of bigger tale going on with Kaiser, Labyrista, and Neneka but nothing about the specifics.    This hurts the anime in a massive way—especially as the series never truly dives into the main villain's motivations. Oh sure, we are told Kaiser is tired from having lived the looping world so many times—and that she hopes to make a utopia. But what does this mean exactly? What is a utopia for Kaiser? Who is the “Minerva” she prays to and what part would Minerva play in all this? And what does pulling Sol Tower down have to do with anything? Heck, beyond the last reset (which was done for Yuuki's sake) we don't even know why loops occur in the first place!    Of course, mentioning important things in passing while never explaining them is hardly new for the show. What are the “Seven Crowns”? What does it mean to be a “Princess Knight”? How/why did Yuuki become Labyrista's? These are important questions and not knowing the answers leaves more than a few holes in this episode's climax.    Overall, the series has tried to make a show that works for both Princess Connect newbies and players of the game—and on some level it has. The emotional character arcs for the Gourmet Guild are well-build and well-defined. We've come to know their goals, motivations, and backstories—and it's easy to root for them. However, the lack of a clear explanation for the setting and the villain's motivations leaves the show with a giant hole in the middle. Though, given that this anime exists largely to get people to play the game, maybe that's the point: “Confused? I guess you'll just have to download the game then, won't you?”    Rating:                Random Thoughts:   •	We never did find out what the shadow did and what the real kaiser did in the story overall. Oh well!    •	Looking back, it's odd but Kokkoro didn't really get an arc. She was more just the kind, loving, straight-man.    •	I don't know why Little Lyrical of all possible guilds got so much of the spotlight in these final three episodes but the payoff of them getting to do a classic GINAX Pose was well worth it.    •	I loved the effect of Jun's platemail rippling like liquid from Kaiser's attack.    •	If you didn't know that Jun was voiced by Ayako Kawasumi, having her do the classic Fate Stay/night Saber pose probably spelled it out for you.    •	I am shocked that Twinkle Wish did not appear—implying they are well and truly dead. I did not expect that. Knowing that they are dead and not coming back makes Yuuki's depression a few episodes back far more powerful. Unfortunately, at the time, the thought of the original game's three main characters actually being dead was so unbelievable that I rejected the concept outright and all the drama was lost.    •	All in all, this season was much better than I expected it would be. I had a lot of fun writing these reviews and I hope you enjoyed reading them just as much.       Princess Connect! Re:Dive is currently streaming on Crunchyroll.

I did not expect that. Knowing that they are dead and not coming back makes Yuuki's depression a few episodes back far more powerful.

Re:Dive Season 2 - Anime News Network:SEA,"      Princess Connect! Re:Dive Season 2 Episode 12  by Richard Eisenbeis, Mar 30th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Princess Connect! Re:Dive (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.5           This, the final episode of Princess Connect! Re:Dive, is a roller coaster. It's fast-paced, flashy, and hits all the emotional ups and downs you'd expect. It's easy to get caught up in cheering for our heroes in their final battle and feel satisfied at the happy end they've earned.    Pecorine saves the people of Landsol, reunites with her family, and even manages to do it without killing anyone. Kayrl, on the other hand, is able to stand with her new friends, establish the personal connection with Kaiser she's always wanted, and save Kaiser's life—even if that means Kaiser will be imprisoned indefinitely. Lastly, Yuuki is able to do what he wasn't able to do in the previous loop—put it all on the line for his friends and come out victorious. These are all good, solid endings to our heroes and their character arcs—and we even get a ton of extra fanservice as every character we've met so far shows up either in the climax or gets a little epilogue still-frame (or both).    Unfortunately, this episode comes with one major problem—one that has plagued the series as a whole on one level or another: It only really works beyond a surface level if you've played the game. For anime-only viewers, it's got to feel like you're missing major swaths of the story even as the main credits roll. You know that there is some sort of bigger tale going on with Kaiser, Labyrista, and Neneka but nothing about the specifics.    This hurts the anime in a massive way—especially as the series never truly dives into the main villain's motivations. Oh sure, we are told Kaiser is tired from having lived the looping world so many times—and that she hopes to make a utopia. But what does this mean exactly? What is a utopia for Kaiser? Who is the “Minerva” she prays to and what part would Minerva play in all this? And what does pulling Sol Tower down have to do with anything? Heck, beyond the last reset (which was done for Yuuki's sake) we don't even know why loops occur in the first place!    Of course, mentioning important things in passing while never explaining them is hardly new for the show. What are the “Seven Crowns”? What does it mean to be a “Princess Knight”? How/why did Yuuki become Labyrista's? These are important questions and not knowing the answers leaves more than a few holes in this episode's climax.    Overall, the series has tried to make a show that works for both Princess Connect newbies and players of the game—and on some level it has. The emotional character arcs for the Gourmet Guild are well-build and well-defined. We've come to know their goals, motivations, and backstories—and it's easy to root for them. However, the lack of a clear explanation for the setting and the villain's motivations leaves the show with a giant hole in the middle. Though, given that this anime exists largely to get people to play the game, maybe that's the point: “Confused? I guess you'll just have to download the game then, won't you?”    Rating:                Random Thoughts:   •	We never did find out what the shadow did and what the real kaiser did in the story overall.
