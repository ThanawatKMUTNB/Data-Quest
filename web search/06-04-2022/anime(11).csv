Interest JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Anime Celebrates 10th Anniversary With New Visual, Collaboration, Exhibition, and More   posted on 2022-04-06 02:45 UTC-8 by Choo Sum Lee           This year marks the 10th anniversary of the JoJo's Bizarre Adventure anime, and a number of details surrounding its 10th Anniversary Project have been revealed.     First of all, a new key visual drawn by creator Hirohiko Araki to commemorate the occasion has been released:     Since 2022 also coincidentally marks the 10th anniversary of the Tokyo Skytree tower, a collaboration event between the anime and the tower – charmingly named ""JOJOTREE""  –  will be held from May 10 to August 9.     Throughout the event's duration, various photo spots on the tower's Tembo Galleria floor (situated 450 meters above ground) will be decorated with new visuals of JoJo characters. In addition, event-exclusive goods and café menus will be available, and special videos will be shown on the Skytree Round Theater®.      Additionally, ""JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Anime 10th Anniversary Exhibition,"" an exhibition tracing the 10-year history of the anime, will be held this summer. Also starting this summer is ""JOJO WORLD2,"" a pop-up theme park that will feature attractions that conjure up the world of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, mini-games with prizes featuring original illustrations, exclusive merchandise, photo spots, and more. Both ""JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Anime 10th Anniversary Exhibition"" and ""JOJO WORLD2"" will be held nationwide in Japan, starting in Ikebukuro, Tokyo.     Also, the anime music magazine Lisani! will release a special volume covering the 10-year history of the anime series titled Lis-Ani! JoJo's Bizarre Adventure The Animation Music Compendium this summer. The book will include interviews with artists, staff members, and voice actors who have sung the series' theme songs.     Finally, a new visual for JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: All-Star Battle R has been released. All-Star Battle R is a new version of the JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: All-Star Battle fighting game that will be launching this fall.

News Tohru Fujisawa's Soul Reviver Manga Gets Live-Action Japanese-Korean Show   posted on 2022-04-05 12:58 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda         Fujisawa, Manabu Akishige launched manga about bringing dead back to life    Hero's Inc. announced on Tuesday that Tohru Fujisawa and Manabu Akishige's Soul Reviver manga is inspiring an upcoming joint Japanese-South Korean live-action show. The show will debut in over-the-top streaming services in South Korea.    Japanese production company Robot and South Korean production company B.A. Entertainment are co-producing the show, through a partnership facilitated by the Visual Industry Promotion Organization since October of last year.    In the original manga, the dead can be brought back to life, if their souls can be restored before disappearing into the void. Between death and the void is the world of the dead, and two individuals — the former detective Ryūsuke Jin and the dead high school girl Clara Sekimachi — salvage souls in this realm.    Fujisawa created the scenario and original character designs, while Akishige drew the manga. The manga launched in Hero's Inc.'s Monthly Hero's magazine in 2011, and ended it in November 2014 with four volumes.    Shogakukan promoted the third volume with a 3D CG short in April 2013, and Kaizō Hayashi (Maiku Hama films, creative director for 7 Blades game) directed a nine-minute live-action short based on the manga in December 2013. The series also had a Hollywood live-action film adaptation in the works, with Annmarie Sairrino's AMMO Entertainment production company moving forward with the film. Edward Zwick (director, The Last Samurai, Glory, Courage Under Fire) and Marshall Herskovitz (producer, The Last Samurai, Traffic, I Am Sam) were once attached to the film via Herskovitz's The Bedford Falls Compan.    Fujisawa (GTO) began the Soul Reviver South series as the manga's ""second season"" in Monthly Hero's in December 2014, one month after the original manga ended. The second series ended in February 2016 with three volumes.    Update: Added correction regarding current status and production company of Soul Reviver's Hollywood live-acton film project.

News Tohru Fujisawa's Soul Reviver Manga Gets Live-Action Japanese-Korean Show   posted on 2022-04-05 12:58 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda         Fujisawa, Manabu Akishige launched manga about bringing dead back to life    Hero's Inc. announced on Tuesday that Tohru Fujisawa and Manabu Akishige's Soul Reviver manga is inspiring an upcoming joint Japanese-South Korean live-action show. The show will debut in over-the-top streaming services in South Korea.    Japanese production company Robot and South Korean production company B.A. Entertainment are co-producing the show, through a partnership facilitated by the Visual Industry Promotion Organization since October of last year.    In the original manga, the dead can be brought back to life, if their souls can be restored before disappearing into the void. Between death and the void is the world of the dead, and two individuals — the former detective Ryūsuke Jin and the dead high school girl Clara Sekimachi — salvage souls in this realm.    Fujisawa created the scenario and original character designs, while Akishige drew the manga. The manga launched in Hero's Inc.'s Monthly Hero's magazine in 2011, and ended it in November 2014 with four volumes.    Shogakukan promoted the third volume with a 3D CG short in April 2013, and Kaizō Hayashi (Maiku Hama films, creative director for 7 Blades game) directed a nine-minute live-action short based on the manga in December 2013. The series also had a Hollywood live-action film adaptation in the works, with Annmarie Sairrino's AMMO Entertainment production company moving forward with the film. Edward Zwick (director, The Last Samurai, Glory, Courage Under Fire) and Marshall Herskovitz (producer, The Last Samurai, Traffic, I Am Sam) were once attached to the film via Herskovitz's The Bedford Falls Compan.    Fujisawa (GTO) began the Soul Reviver South series as the manga's ""second season"" in Monthly Hero's in December 2014, one month after the original manga ended. The second series ended in February 2016 with three volumes.    Update: Added correction regarding current status and production company of Soul Reviver's Hollywood live-acton film project.

News Tohru Fujisawa's Soul Reviver Manga Gets Live-Action Japanese-Korean Show   posted on 2022-04-05 12:58 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda         Fujisawa, Manabu Akishige launched manga about bringing dead back to life    Hero's Inc. announced on Tuesday that Tohru Fujisawa and Manabu Akishige's Soul Reviver manga is inspiring an upcoming joint Japanese-South Korean live-action show. The show will debut in over-the-top streaming services in South Korea.    Japanese production company Robot and South Korean production company B.A. Entertainment are co-producing the show, through a partnership facilitated by the Visual Industry Promotion Organization since October of last year.    In the original manga, the dead can be brought back to life, if their souls can be restored before disappearing into the void. Between death and the void is the world of the dead, and two individuals — the former detective Ryūsuke Jin and the dead high school girl Clara Sekimachi — salvage souls in this realm.    Fujisawa created the scenario and original character designs, while Akishige drew the manga. The manga launched in Hero's Inc.'s Monthly Hero's magazine in 2011, and ended it in November 2014 with four volumes.    Shogakukan promoted the third volume with a 3D CG short in April 2013, and Kaizō Hayashi (Maiku Hama films, creative director for 7 Blades game) directed a nine-minute live-action short based on the manga in December 2013. The series also had a Hollywood live-action film adaptation in the works, with Annmarie Sairrino's AMMO Entertainment production company moving forward with the film. Edward Zwick (director, The Last Samurai, Glory, Courage Under Fire) and Marshall Herskovitz (producer, The Last Samurai, Traffic, I Am Sam) were once attached to the film via Herskovitz's The Bedford Falls Compan.    Fujisawa (GTO) began the Soul Reviver South series as the manga's ""second season"" in Monthly Hero's in December 2014, one month after the original manga ended. The second series ended in February 2016 with three volumes.    Update: Added correction regarding current status and production company of Soul Reviver's Hollywood live-acton film project.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove it. r=1-sinθ   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove It. r=1-sinθ (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 3.8              What is this?   Yukimura and Himuro are both graduate students working in the same lab and a prospective couple. However, despite feelings that seem obvious to their lab mates, the pair insist on scientifically quantifying ""love"" in order to empirically prove their attraction to one another. Their quest expands beyond their own lab and into their college's natural science department.    Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove it is based on Alifred Yamamoto's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                While this may be a season premiere, it sure doesn't feel like it—though that's not to say our characters haven't changed since we last saw them. The first season ended on an exceedingly high note with our main couple achieving the scientificly perfect romantic kiss. While the data for said kiss may be lost, the emotional effect on Yukimura and Himuro is all too evident. The two are more driven than ever to not only prove their “love formula,” but assert their love for each other through it.    The thing is, the perfect kiss has given the two a bit of an ego—after all, it was the single most romantic moment of their (romantically inexperienced) lives. Up until this point, Yukimura and Himuro have studied the love lives of those they had access to—e.g., Kotsuke's love for his 2D girlfriend and Kanade's unrequited love for her teacher, but the only truly reciprocal relationship they've been able to use as a reference point is their own—which neither are sure is “love” in the first place.    Enter Chris and Suiu. Our newest eccentric pair of scientists are a couple made up of a submissive yet passionate man and an extremely sensual and provocative woman. Not only have they been in a long-term relationship of four years, they are as into each other as Gomez and Morticia Addams. Threatened by a couple so obviously in love, what should be nothing more than a gathering of samples turns into a contest between the couples to determine which is more in love based on oxytocin levels.    While this makes for some of the worst science the two have been involved in, it shows just how desperate Yukimura and Himuro are—and how inexperienced. They completely forget that their goal is to simply prove that they are in love, instead of being the most in love couple in the world. While data from Chris and Suiu is important, it is not the baseline for romantic relationships. They would need to do a similar experiment with much tighter controlled variables and a sample size of hundreds to establish that. However, this doesn't stop Yukimura and Himuro from giving into the irrational fear that  Chris and Suiu might be the baseline. And should they fail to match up to the lovey-dovey pair, then they would be forced to choose between their feelings and the scientific truth to which they have devoted their lives. The whole situation is both good character-building and solid setup for comedic moments. And hopefully, after cooling down a bit, they'll be able to realize this and continue on with their scientific exploration of love.       Lynzee Loveridge  Rating:                It's been about two years since we last saw Ayame Himuro and Shinya Yukimura attempt to quantify their feelings for one another and honestly, I feel a little bad that this show has to compete with a somewhat similarly-themed (but immensely more popular) Kaguya-sama. Like that show, we have a primary couple that has caught the doki-dokis for each other but will not outright admit it. Himuro and Yukimura are dead set on gathering evidence to support their feelings, leading to smooching under the pretense of science.    The show has about one joke in its roster and the animation, both in terms of movement and color design, is a little lackluster. Science Fell in Love instead rides purely on charm and for the most part, I'd say it's successful. Himuro and Yukimura's awkwardness isn't overplayed; it could have easily devolved into ""oh god get on with it already"" but neither party is in denial and despite not putting a label on it, both are also enthusiastic about the relationship's romantic progression. They want to kiss and cuddle and thankfully the story finds ways to let them even if its under the guise of a scientific pretense.    The introduction of Chris and Suiu also helps shake things up. The saliva-obsessed ""courtesan"" and her lovestruck English boyfriend make for a fun counter to the less confident couple. I mean, I could do without the glittering, highly-detailed spit but since this episode centers entirely around the fluid and how to measure different hormones in it, I can let it go. Also glad to see the ""edutainment"" aspect return in order to teach us all how elaborate scientific equipment is used (and how your dryer is just another version of a centrifuge).    Science Fell in Love is a cute show. It's not going to do anything amazing, but there are worse ways to spend your time than with a group of dorks fumbling through their romance.     discuss this in the forum (112 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature                The Best and Worst of Winter 2022   Apr  6, 10:10                 anime    With the last few episodes trailing into Spring like an April's fool, it's time to look at the final ranking of the Winter 2022 season.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove it. r=1-sinθ   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove It. r=1-sinθ (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 3.8              What is this?   Yukimura and Himuro are both graduate students working in the same lab and a prospective couple. However, despite feelings that seem obvious to their lab mates, the pair insist on scientifically quantifying ""love"" in order to empirically prove their attraction to one another. Their quest expands beyond their own lab and into their college's natural science department.    Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove it is based on Alifred Yamamoto's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                While this may be a season premiere, it sure doesn't feel like it—though that's not to say our characters haven't changed since we last saw them. The first season ended on an exceedingly high note with our main couple achieving the scientificly perfect romantic kiss. While the data for said kiss may be lost, the emotional effect on Yukimura and Himuro is all too evident. The two are more driven than ever to not only prove their “love formula,” but assert their love for each other through it.    The thing is, the perfect kiss has given the two a bit of an ego—after all, it was the single most romantic moment of their (romantically inexperienced) lives. Up until this point, Yukimura and Himuro have studied the love lives of those they had access to—e.g., Kotsuke's love for his 2D girlfriend and Kanade's unrequited love for her teacher, but the only truly reciprocal relationship they've been able to use as a reference point is their own—which neither are sure is “love” in the first place.    Enter Chris and Suiu. Our newest eccentric pair of scientists are a couple made up of a submissive yet passionate man and an extremely sensual and provocative woman. Not only have they been in a long-term relationship of four years, they are as into each other as Gomez and Morticia Addams. Threatened by a couple so obviously in love, what should be nothing more than a gathering of samples turns into a contest between the couples to determine which is more in love based on oxytocin levels.    While this makes for some of the worst science the two have been involved in, it shows just how desperate Yukimura and Himuro are—and how inexperienced. They completely forget that their goal is to simply prove that they are in love, instead of being the most in love couple in the world. While data from Chris and Suiu is important, it is not the baseline for romantic relationships. They would need to do a similar experiment with much tighter controlled variables and a sample size of hundreds to establish that. However, this doesn't stop Yukimura and Himuro from giving into the irrational fear that  Chris and Suiu might be the baseline. And should they fail to match up to the lovey-dovey pair, then they would be forced to choose between their feelings and the scientific truth to which they have devoted their lives. The whole situation is both good character-building and solid setup for comedic moments. And hopefully, after cooling down a bit, they'll be able to realize this and continue on with their scientific exploration of love.       Lynzee Loveridge  Rating:                It's been about two years since we last saw Ayame Himuro and Shinya Yukimura attempt to quantify their feelings for one another and honestly, I feel a little bad that this show has to compete with a somewhat similarly-themed (but immensely more popular) Kaguya-sama. Like that show, we have a primary couple that has caught the doki-dokis for each other but will not outright admit it. Himuro and Yukimura are dead set on gathering evidence to support their feelings, leading to smooching under the pretense of science.    The show has about one joke in its roster and the animation, both in terms of movement and color design, is a little lackluster. Science Fell in Love instead rides purely on charm and for the most part, I'd say it's successful. Himuro and Yukimura's awkwardness isn't overplayed; it could have easily devolved into ""oh god get on with it already"" but neither party is in denial and despite not putting a label on it, both are also enthusiastic about the relationship's romantic progression. They want to kiss and cuddle and thankfully the story finds ways to let them even if its under the guise of a scientific pretense.    The introduction of Chris and Suiu also helps shake things up. The saliva-obsessed ""courtesan"" and her lovestruck English boyfriend make for a fun counter to the less confident couple. I mean, I could do without the glittering, highly-detailed spit but since this episode centers entirely around the fluid and how to measure different hormones in it, I can let it go. Also glad to see the ""edutainment"" aspect return in order to teach us all how elaborate scientific equipment is used (and how your dryer is just another version of a centrifuge).    Science Fell in Love is a cute show. It's not going to do anything amazing, but there are worse ways to spend your time than with a group of dorks fumbling through their romance.     discuss this in the forum (112 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature                The Best and Worst of Winter 2022   Apr  6, 10:10                 anime    With the last few episodes trailing into Spring like an April's fool, it's time to look at the final ranking of the Winter 2022 season.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove it. r=1-sinθ   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove It. r=1-sinθ (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 3.8              What is this?   Yukimura and Himuro are both graduate students working in the same lab and a prospective couple. However, despite feelings that seem obvious to their lab mates, the pair insist on scientifically quantifying ""love"" in order to empirically prove their attraction to one another. Their quest expands beyond their own lab and into their college's natural science department.    Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove it is based on Alifred Yamamoto's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                While this may be a season premiere, it sure doesn't feel like it—though that's not to say our characters haven't changed since we last saw them. The first season ended on an exceedingly high note with our main couple achieving the scientificly perfect romantic kiss. While the data for said kiss may be lost, the emotional effect on Yukimura and Himuro is all too evident. The two are more driven than ever to not only prove their “love formula,” but assert their love for each other through it.    The thing is, the perfect kiss has given the two a bit of an ego—after all, it was the single most romantic moment of their (romantically inexperienced) lives. Up until this point, Yukimura and Himuro have studied the love lives of those they had access to—e.g., Kotsuke's love for his 2D girlfriend and Kanade's unrequited love for her teacher, but the only truly reciprocal relationship they've been able to use as a reference point is their own—which neither are sure is “love” in the first place.    Enter Chris and Suiu. Our newest eccentric pair of scientists are a couple made up of a submissive yet passionate man and an extremely sensual and provocative woman. Not only have they been in a long-term relationship of four years, they are as into each other as Gomez and Morticia Addams. Threatened by a couple so obviously in love, what should be nothing more than a gathering of samples turns into a contest between the couples to determine which is more in love based on oxytocin levels.    While this makes for some of the worst science the two have been involved in, it shows just how desperate Yukimura and Himuro are—and how inexperienced. They completely forget that their goal is to simply prove that they are in love, instead of being the most in love couple in the world. While data from Chris and Suiu is important, it is not the baseline for romantic relationships. They would need to do a similar experiment with much tighter controlled variables and a sample size of hundreds to establish that. However, this doesn't stop Yukimura and Himuro from giving into the irrational fear that  Chris and Suiu might be the baseline. And should they fail to match up to the lovey-dovey pair, then they would be forced to choose between their feelings and the scientific truth to which they have devoted their lives. The whole situation is both good character-building and solid setup for comedic moments. And hopefully, after cooling down a bit, they'll be able to realize this and continue on with their scientific exploration of love.       Lynzee Loveridge  Rating:                It's been about two years since we last saw Ayame Himuro and Shinya Yukimura attempt to quantify their feelings for one another and honestly, I feel a little bad that this show has to compete with a somewhat similarly-themed (but immensely more popular) Kaguya-sama. Like that show, we have a primary couple that has caught the doki-dokis for each other but will not outright admit it. Himuro and Yukimura are dead set on gathering evidence to support their feelings, leading to smooching under the pretense of science.    The show has about one joke in its roster and the animation, both in terms of movement and color design, is a little lackluster. Science Fell in Love instead rides purely on charm and for the most part, I'd say it's successful. Himuro and Yukimura's awkwardness isn't overplayed; it could have easily devolved into ""oh god get on with it already"" but neither party is in denial and despite not putting a label on it, both are also enthusiastic about the relationship's romantic progression. They want to kiss and cuddle and thankfully the story finds ways to let them even if its under the guise of a scientific pretense.    The introduction of Chris and Suiu also helps shake things up. The saliva-obsessed ""courtesan"" and her lovestruck English boyfriend make for a fun counter to the less confident couple. I mean, I could do without the glittering, highly-detailed spit but since this episode centers entirely around the fluid and how to measure different hormones in it, I can let it go. Also glad to see the ""edutainment"" aspect return in order to teach us all how elaborate scientific equipment is used (and how your dryer is just another version of a centrifuge).    Science Fell in Love is a cute show. It's not going to do anything amazing, but there are worse ways to spend your time than with a group of dorks fumbling through their romance.     discuss this in the forum (112 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature                The Best and Worst of Winter 2022   Apr  6, 10:10                 anime    With the last few episodes trailing into Spring like an April's fool, it's time to look at the final ranking of the Winter 2022 season.

Dark Horse Books is Honored to Present Berserk Volume 41   Apr  5th 2022         Miura-Sensei's Final Volume of Berserk Arrives in November     MILWAUKIE, Ore., (April 4, 2022)— After 30-plus years and more than 3.5 million copies sold, Kentaro Miura's work on the beloved horror-fantasy manga comes to an end with Berserk Volume 41. Dark Horse Manga presents this final volume by Miura-sensei in English for the first time in trade paperback with a two-sided color poster insert.  Though released from the prison of her mind, Casca cannot escape reminders of the terrors she has experienced. And nothing triggers these harrowing memories more than Guts the Black Swordsman, who faced those same horrors in his relentless quest to see Casca healed. But could the reappearance of a strange, mute boy be the key to bringing peace to Casca's troubled soul?  “It is with great pride that Dark Horse will release Miura-sensei's last installment of his masterpiece, Berserk. His creativity and incredible storytelling are unmatched. And to be able to release his final work to his fans is an honor that cannot be understated,” said Mike Richardson, President and founder of Dark Horse Comics.

Dark Horse Books is Honored to Present Berserk Volume 41   Apr  5th 2022         Miura-Sensei's Final Volume of Berserk Arrives in November     MILWAUKIE, Ore., (April 4, 2022)— After 30-plus years and more than 3.5 million copies sold, Kentaro Miura's work on the beloved horror-fantasy manga comes to an end with Berserk Volume 41. Dark Horse Manga presents this final volume by Miura-sensei in English for the first time in trade paperback with a two-sided color poster insert.  Though released from the prison of her mind, Casca cannot escape reminders of the terrors she has experienced. And nothing triggers these harrowing memories more than Guts the Black Swordsman, who faced those same horrors in his relentless quest to see Casca healed. But could the reappearance of a strange, mute boy be the key to bringing peace to Casca's troubled soul?  “It is with great pride that Dark Horse will release Miura-sensei's last installment of his masterpiece, Berserk. His creativity and incredible storytelling are unmatched. And to be able to release his final work to his fans is an honor that cannot be understated,” said Mike Richardson, President and founder of Dark Horse Comics.  Berserk Volume 41 TPB will be available at comic stores November 9, 2022 and in bookstores November 22, 2022. It is available for pre-order on Amazon, Barnes & Noble, and at your local comic shop and bookstore. Berserk Volume 41 will retail for $14.99.

Dark Horse Books is Honored to Present Berserk Volume 41   Apr  5th 2022         Miura-Sensei's Final Volume of Berserk Arrives in November     MILWAUKIE, Ore., (April 4, 2022)— After 30-plus years and more than 3.5 million copies sold, Kentaro Miura's work on the beloved horror-fantasy manga comes to an end with Berserk Volume 41. Dark Horse Manga presents this final volume by Miura-sensei in English for the first time in trade paperback with a two-sided color poster insert.  Though released from the prison of her mind, Casca cannot escape reminders of the terrors she has experienced. And nothing triggers these harrowing memories more than Guts the Black Swordsman, who faced those same horrors in his relentless quest to see Casca healed. But could the reappearance of a strange, mute boy be the key to bringing peace to Casca's troubled soul?  “It is with great pride that Dark Horse will release Miura-sensei's last installment of his masterpiece, Berserk. His creativity and incredible storytelling are unmatched. And to be able to release his final work to his fans is an honor that cannot be understated,” said Mike Richardson, President and founder of Dark Horse Comics.  Berserk Volume 41 TPB will be available at comic stores November 9, 2022 and in bookstores November 22, 2022. It is available for pre-order on Amazon, Barnes & Noble, and at your local comic shop and bookstore. Berserk Volume 41 will retail for $14.99.

Sasaki and Miyano Episode 12  by Nicholas Dupree, Mar 30th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Sasaki and Miyano ?                     Community score: 4.7            Honestly, y'all are lucky to be getting an actual review here. A sizable portion of my brain was tempted to forego writing anything coherent and just post confetti gifs and this video before calling it a day. But editorial probably wouldn't be cool with that, so now I'm left to figure out how to package this bundle of squees and d'awws into something resembling a formal review.    Because really, this entire episode is a singleminded lead-up to the confession scene we've been waiting weeks to see. Like sure, there are some nice moments in the build-up. It's nice to get Hanzawa giving a concerned warning about the possible microaggressions that come with being a gay couple in a heteronormative society, and it's funny watching Hirano playing intermediary because these two idiots still haven't exchanged cell phone numbers. There's an especially nice moment showing Sasaki's internalized his lesson about boundaries from the previous arc, and he gives a direct apology about it later. Considering this particular moment was a misunderstanding I was worried the show would brush it off with Miyano insisting it wasn't a big deal, but they offer a lot more nuance to it, and emphasize that the key is for both our boys to honestly, earnestly communicate with one another.    And boy do they communicate once Miyano catches up with Sasaki. Like several unbroken minutes of him gushing out every feeling he's ever had about the guy, finally saying all the things left frustratingly unsaid across the show. It's a seriously charming moment that's only eclipsed by the ridiculously tender kiss scene that follows. It's already rare for romance anime to actually get to the kissing portion of their central relationship, but even when they do it's almost never with this level of intimacy in its staging and character animation. Just the way they animate the characters' fingers overlapping, interlocking, and separating communicates so much of their emotions without a word.    And that's basically all she wrote for SasaMiya. After three months of slow burn build up we climax (no, not like that) with a beautiful kiss, a little bit of humor as falling action, and then wave goodbye with the promise of some new anime project in the future. It's about as fitting a conclusion as you can ask for from this kind of show, but it's also not a ton to analyze. It's just really, really nice to see these two finally get together and share such a wonderful moment.    That's also more or less where I stand with SasaMiya. It's infectiously cute, mellow, and altogether pleasant. It's brought to life through some impeccable direction and a laser-focus on delivering low-stakes humor and romance. If you're looking for something to watch that goes down like warm porridge, this about as close to that ideal as you can get. And as a side-note, if you're in the mood for more and are up for a girls-centric story, maybe check out the Kase-san and... Cherry Blossoms OVA. So long as you've got patience, you're sure to be rewarded by both.

Sasaki and Miyano Episode 12  by Nicholas Dupree, Mar 30th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Sasaki and Miyano ?                     Community score: 4.7            Honestly, y'all are lucky to be getting an actual review here. A sizable portion of my brain was tempted to forego writing anything coherent and just post confetti gifs and this video before calling it a day. But editorial probably wouldn't be cool with that, so now I'm left to figure out how to package this bundle of squees and d'awws into something resembling a formal review.    Because really, this entire episode is a singleminded lead-up to the confession scene we've been waiting weeks to see. Like sure, there are some nice moments in the build-up. It's nice to get Hanzawa giving a concerned warning about the possible microaggressions that come with being a gay couple in a heteronormative society, and it's funny watching Hirano playing intermediary because these two idiots still haven't exchanged cell phone numbers. There's an especially nice moment showing Sasaki's internalized his lesson about boundaries from the previous arc, and he gives a direct apology about it later. Considering this particular moment was a misunderstanding I was worried the show would brush it off with Miyano insisting it wasn't a big deal, but they offer a lot more nuance to it, and emphasize that the key is for both our boys to honestly, earnestly communicate with one another.    And boy do they communicate once Miyano catches up with Sasaki. Like several unbroken minutes of him gushing out every feeling he's ever had about the guy, finally saying all the things left frustratingly unsaid across the show. It's a seriously charming moment that's only eclipsed by the ridiculously tender kiss scene that follows. It's already rare for romance anime to actually get to the kissing portion of their central relationship, but even when they do it's almost never with this level of intimacy in its staging and character animation. Just the way they animate the characters' fingers overlapping, interlocking, and separating communicates so much of their emotions without a word.    And that's basically all she wrote for SasaMiya. After three months of slow burn build up we climax (no, not like that) with a beautiful kiss, a little bit of humor as falling action, and then wave goodbye with the promise of some new anime project in the future. It's about as fitting a conclusion as you can ask for from this kind of show, but it's also not a ton to analyze. It's just really, really nice to see these two finally get together and share such a wonderful moment.    That's also more or less where I stand with SasaMiya. It's infectiously cute, mellow, and altogether pleasant. It's brought to life through some impeccable direction and a laser-focus on delivering low-stakes humor and romance. If you're looking for something to watch that goes down like warm porridge, this about as close to that ideal as you can get. And as a side-note, if you're in the mood for more and are up for a girls-centric story, maybe check out the Kase-san and... Cherry Blossoms OVA. So long as you've got patience, you're sure to be rewarded by both.

Community score: 4.7            Honestly, y'all are lucky to be getting an actual review here. A sizable portion of my brain was tempted to forego writing anything coherent and just post confetti gifs and this video before calling it a day. But editorial probably wouldn't be cool with that, so now I'm left to figure out how to package this bundle of squees and d'awws into something resembling a formal review.    Because really, this entire episode is a singleminded lead-up to the confession scene we've been waiting weeks to see. Like sure, there are some nice moments in the build-up. It's nice to get Hanzawa giving a concerned warning about the possible microaggressions that come with being a gay couple in a heteronormative society, and it's funny watching Hirano playing intermediary because these two idiots still haven't exchanged cell phone numbers. There's an especially nice moment showing Sasaki's internalized his lesson about boundaries from the previous arc, and he gives a direct apology about it later. Considering this particular moment was a misunderstanding I was worried the show would brush it off with Miyano insisting it wasn't a big deal, but they offer a lot more nuance to it, and emphasize that the key is for both our boys to honestly, earnestly communicate with one another.    And boy do they communicate once Miyano catches up with Sasaki. Like several unbroken minutes of him gushing out every feeling he's ever had about the guy, finally saying all the things left frustratingly unsaid across the show. It's a seriously charming moment that's only eclipsed by the ridiculously tender kiss scene that follows. It's already rare for romance anime to actually get to the kissing portion of their central relationship, but even when they do it's almost never with this level of intimacy in its staging and character animation. Just the way they animate the characters' fingers overlapping, interlocking, and separating communicates so much of their emotions without a word.    And that's basically all she wrote for SasaMiya. After three months of slow burn build up we climax (no, not like that) with a beautiful kiss, a little bit of humor as falling action, and then wave goodbye with the promise of some new anime project in the future. It's about as fitting a conclusion as you can ask for from this kind of show, but it's also not a ton to analyze. It's just really, really nice to see these two finally get together and share such a wonderful moment.    That's also more or less where I stand with SasaMiya. It's infectiously cute, mellow, and altogether pleasant. It's brought to life through some impeccable direction and a laser-focus on delivering low-stakes humor and romance. If you're looking for something to watch that goes down like warm porridge, this about as close to that ideal as you can get. And as a side-note, if you're in the mood for more and are up for a girls-centric story, maybe check out the Kase-san and... Cherry Blossoms OVA. So long as you've got patience, you're sure to be rewarded by both.
