I have received a spamming or abusive email from someone on this board!  phpBB 2 Issues Who wrote this bulletin board? Why isn't X feature available? Who do I contact about abusive and/or legal matters related to this board?              Login and Registration Issues    Why can't I log in?Have you registered? Seriously, you must register in order to log in. Have you been banned from the board? (A message will be displayed if you have.) If so, you should contact the webmaster or board administrator to find out why. If you have registered and are not banned and you still cannot log in then check and double-check your username and password. Usually this is the problem; if not, contact the board administrator -- they may have incorrect configuration settings for the board.Back to top        Why do I need to register at all?Requiring registration permits us more control over how people post. By requiring that people register we are able to  ban trolls and anyone else who doesn't follow the forum rules. We'd rather have a smaller but friendly and intelligent posting community than a free for all.Back to top        Why do I get logged off automatically?If you do not check the Log me in automatically box when you log in, the board will only keep you logged in for a preset time. This prevents misuse of your account by anyone else. To stay logged in, check the box during login. This is not recommended if you access the board from a shared computer, e.g. library, internet cafe, university cluster, etc.Back to top        How do I prevent my username from appearing in the online user listings?In your profile you will find an option Hide your online status; if you switch this on you'll only appear to board administrators or to yourself. You will be counted as a hidden user.Back to top        I've lost my password!Don't panic! While your password cannot be retrieved it can be reset. To do this go to the login page and click I've forgotten my password. Follow the instructions and you should be back online in no time.Back to top        I registered but cannot log in!Firstly check that you are entering the correct username and password. Does your account need activating? We require that all new registrations be activated. When you registered you were told this. You should have received an email, please follow the instructions in the email. If you did not receive the email (check in your junk folder!), are you sure your email address is valid? One reason activation is used is to reduce the possibility of rogue users abusing the board anonymously. If you are sure the email address you used is valid you can try re-sending an activation e-mail.Back to top        I registered in the past but cannot log in anymore!The most likely reasons for this are: you entered an incorrect username or password (check the email you were sent when you first registered) or the administrator has deleted your account for some reason. If it is the latter case then perhaps you did not post anything? It is usual for boards to periodically remove users who have not posted anything so as to reduce the size of the database. Try registering again and get involved in discussions.Back to top            User Preferences and settings    How do I change my settings?All your settings (if you are registered) are stored in the database. To alter them click the Profile link (under the forum tab). This will allow you to change all your settings.Back to top        The times are not correct!The times are almost certainly correct; however, what you may be seeing are times displayed in a timezone different from the one you are in. If this is the case, you should change your profile setting for the timezone to match your particular area, e.g. London, Paris, New York, Sydney, etc. Please note that changing the timezone, like most settings, can only be done by registered users. So if you are not registered, this is a good time to do so, if you pardon the pun!Back to top        I changed the timezone and the time is still wrong!If you are sure you have set the timezone correctly and the time is still different, the most likely answer is daylight savings time (or summer time as it is known in the UK and other places). The board is not designed to handle the changeovers between standard and daylight time so during summer months the time may be an hour different from the real local time.Back to top        How do I show an image below my username?That image is called an 'avatar', and you can upload it by going to your profileBack to top        Why is my Avatar replaced by another pictureSome free webhosts (ie: Tripod) do not permit off-site linking to their images. They do this to conserve their bandwidth, try using another server for you image.Back to top        How do I change my rank?You can't. Currently we do not employ an automatic Rank changing system; we feel that these place too much emphasis on the quantity of posts as opposed to the quality.Back to top        When I click the email link for a user it asks me to log in.Sorry, but only registered users can send email to people via the built-in email form (if the admin has enabled this feature). This is to prevent malicious use of the email system by anonymous users.Back to top            Posting Issues    How do I post a topic in a forum?Easy -- click the relevant button on either the forum or topic screens. You may need to register before you can post a message. The facilities available to you are listed at the bottom of the forum and topic screens (the You can post new topics, You can vote in polls, etc. list)Back to top        How do I edit or delete a post?Unless you are the board admin or forum moderator you can only edit or delete your own posts. You can edit a post  by clicking the edit button for the relevant post.  If someone has already replied to the post you will find a small piece of text output below the post when you return to the topic, this lists the number of times you edited it. This will not appear if no one has replied, it also will not appear if moderators or administrators edit the post (We generally leave a message saying what we altered and why). Please note that normal users cannot delete a post once someone has replied.Back to top        How do I add a signature to my post?To add a signature to a post you must first create one; this is done via your profile. Once created you can check the Add Signature box on the posting form to add your signature. You can also add a signature by default to all your posts by checking the appropriate radio box in your profile. You can still prevent a signature being added to individual posts by un-checking the add signature box on the posting form.Back to top        How do I create a poll?Creating a poll is easy -- when you post a new topic (or edit the first post of a topic, if you have permission) you should see a Add Poll form below the main posting box. If you cannot see this then you probably do not have rights to create polls. You should enter a title for the poll and then at least two options -- to set an option type in the poll question and click the Add option button. You can also set a time limit for the poll, 0 being an infinite amount. There will be a limit to the number of options you can list, which is set by the board administratorBack to top        How do I edit or delete a poll?As with posts, polls can only be edited by the original poster, a moderator, or board administrator. To edit a poll, click the first post in the topic, which always has the poll associated with it. If no one has cast a vote then users can delete the poll or edit any poll option. However, if people have already placed votes only moderators or administrators can edit or delete it; this is to prevent people rigging polls by changing options mid-way through a pollBack to top        Why can't I access a forum?Some forums may be limited to certain users or groups. To view, read, post, etc. you may need special authorization which only the forum moderator and board administrator can grant, so you should contact them.Back to top        Why can't I vote in polls?Only registered users can vote in polls so as to prevent spoofing of results. If you have registered and still cannot vote then you probably do not have appropriate access rights.Back to top            Formatting and Topic Types    What is BBCode?BBCode is a special implementation of HTML. Whether you can use BBCode is determined by the administrator. You can also disable it on a per post basis from the posting form. BBCode itself is similar in style to HTML: tags are enclosed in square braces [ and ] rather than < and > and it offers greater control over what and how something is displayed. For more information on BBCode see the guide which can be accessed from the posting page.Back to top        Can I use HTML?You are allowed to use HTML, but only certain tags work. This is a safety feature to prevent people abusing the board by using tags which may destroy the layout or cause other problems. You can enable/disable HTML on a per post basis from the posting form.Back to top        What are Smileys?Smileys, or Emoticons, are small graphical images which can be used to express some feeling using a short code, e.g. :) means happy, :( means sad. The full list of emoticons can be seen via the posting form. Try not to overuse smileys, though, as they can quickly render a post unreadable and a moderator may decide to edit them out or remove the post altogether.Back to top        Can I post Images?Images can indeed be shown in your posts. However, there is no facility at present for uploading images directly to this board. Therefore you must link to an image stored on a publicly accessible web server, e.g. http://www.some-unknown-place.net/my-picture.gif. You cannot link to pictures stored on your own PC (unless it is a publicly accessible server) nor to images stored behind authentication mechanisms such as Hotmail or Yahoo mailboxes, password-protected sites, etc. To display the image use either the BBCode [img] tag or appropriate HTML (if allowed).Back to top        What are Announcements?Announcements often contain important information and you should read them as soon as possible. Announcements appear at the top of every page in the forum to which they are posted. Only the administrators and moderators can post announcements.Back to top        What are Sticky topics?Sticky topics appear below any announcements in viewforum and only on the first page. They are often quite important so you should read them where possible. As with announcements only board administrator and moderators can post sticky topics in each forum.Back to top        What are Locked topics?Locked topics are set this way by either the forum moderator or board administrator. You cannot reply to locked topics and any poll contained inside is automatically ended. Topics may be locked for many reasons.Back to top            User Levels and Groups    What are Administrators?Administrators are people assigned the highest level of control over the entire board. These people can control all facets of board operation which include setting permissions, banning users, creating usergroups or moderators, etc. They also have full moderator capabilities in all the forums.Back to top        What are Moderators?Moderators are individuals (or groups of individuals) whose job it is to look after the running of the forums from day to day. They have the power to edit or delete posts and lock, unlock, move, delete and split topics in the forum they moderate. Generally moderators are there to prevent people going off-topic or posting abusive or offensive material.Back to top        What are Usergroups?Usergroups are a way in which board administrators can group users. Each user can belong to several groups (this differs from most other boards) and each group can be assigned individual access rights. This makes it easy for administrators to set up several users as moderators of a forum, or to give them access to a private forum, etc.Back to top        How do I join a Usergroup?To join a usergroup click the usergroup link on the page header (dependent on template design) and you can then view all usergroups. Not all groups are open access -- some are closed and some may even have hidden memberships. If the board is open then you can request to join it by clicking the appropriate button. The user group moderator will need to approve your request; they may ask why you want to join the group. Please do not pester a group moderator if they turn your request down -- they will have their reasons.Back to top        How do I become a Usergroup Moderator?Usergroups are initially created by the board administrator who also assigns a board moderator. If you are interested in creating a usergroup then your first point of contact should be the administrator, so try dropping them a private message.Back to top            Private Messaging    I cannot send private messages!You are probably not registered and/or not logged on.Back to top        I keep getting unwanted private messages!In the future we will be adding an ignore list to the private messaging system. For now, though, if you keep receiving unwanted private messages from someone, inform the board administrator -- they have the power to prevent a user from sending private messages at all.Back to top        I have received a spamming or abusive email from someone on this board!We are sorry to hear that. The email form feature of this board includes safeguards to try to track users who send such posts. You should email the board administrator with a full copy of the email you received and it is very important this include the headers (these list details of the user that sent the email). They can then take action.Back to top            phpBB 2 Issues    Who wrote this bulletin board?This software (in its unmodified form) is produced, released and is copyrighted phpBB Group.

I have received a spamming or abusive email from someone on this board!  phpBB 2 Issues Who wrote this bulletin board? Why isn't X feature available? Who do I contact about abusive and/or legal matters related to this board?              Login and Registration Issues    Why can't I log in?Have you registered? Seriously, you must register in order to log in. Have you been banned from the board? (A message will be displayed if you have.) If so, you should contact the webmaster or board administrator to find out why. If you have registered and are not banned and you still cannot log in then check and double-check your username and password. Usually this is the problem; if not, contact the board administrator -- they may have incorrect configuration settings for the board.Back to top        Why do I need to register at all?Requiring registration permits us more control over how people post. By requiring that people register we are able to  ban trolls and anyone else who doesn't follow the forum rules. We'd rather have a smaller but friendly and intelligent posting community than a free for all.Back to top        Why do I get logged off automatically?If you do not check the Log me in automatically box when you log in, the board will only keep you logged in for a preset time. This prevents misuse of your account by anyone else. To stay logged in, check the box during login. This is not recommended if you access the board from a shared computer, e.g. library, internet cafe, university cluster, etc.Back to top        How do I prevent my username from appearing in the online user listings?In your profile you will find an option Hide your online status; if you switch this on you'll only appear to board administrators or to yourself. You will be counted as a hidden user.Back to top        I've lost my password!Don't panic! While your password cannot be retrieved it can be reset. To do this go to the login page and click I've forgotten my password. Follow the instructions and you should be back online in no time.Back to top        I registered but cannot log in!Firstly check that you are entering the correct username and password. Does your account need activating? We require that all new registrations be activated. When you registered you were told this. You should have received an email, please follow the instructions in the email. If you did not receive the email (check in your junk folder!), are you sure your email address is valid? One reason activation is used is to reduce the possibility of rogue users abusing the board anonymously. If you are sure the email address you used is valid you can try re-sending an activation e-mail.Back to top        I registered in the past but cannot log in anymore!The most likely reasons for this are: you entered an incorrect username or password (check the email you were sent when you first registered) or the administrator has deleted your account for some reason. If it is the latter case then perhaps you did not post anything? It is usual for boards to periodically remove users who have not posted anything so as to reduce the size of the database. Try registering again and get involved in discussions.Back to top            User Preferences and settings    How do I change my settings?All your settings (if you are registered) are stored in the database. To alter them click the Profile link (under the forum tab). This will allow you to change all your settings.Back to top        The times are not correct!The times are almost certainly correct; however, what you may be seeing are times displayed in a timezone different from the one you are in. If this is the case, you should change your profile setting for the timezone to match your particular area, e.g. London, Paris, New York, Sydney, etc. Please note that changing the timezone, like most settings, can only be done by registered users. So if you are not registered, this is a good time to do so, if you pardon the pun!Back to top        I changed the timezone and the time is still wrong!If you are sure you have set the timezone correctly and the time is still different, the most likely answer is daylight savings time (or summer time as it is known in the UK and other places). The board is not designed to handle the changeovers between standard and daylight time so during summer months the time may be an hour different from the real local time.Back to top        How do I show an image below my username?That image is called an 'avatar', and you can upload it by going to your profileBack to top        Why is my Avatar replaced by another pictureSome free webhosts (ie: Tripod) do not permit off-site linking to their images. They do this to conserve their bandwidth, try using another server for you image.Back to top        How do I change my rank?You can't. Currently we do not employ an automatic Rank changing system; we feel that these place too much emphasis on the quantity of posts as opposed to the quality.Back to top        When I click the email link for a user it asks me to log in.Sorry, but only registered users can send email to people via the built-in email form (if the admin has enabled this feature). This is to prevent malicious use of the email system by anonymous users.Back to top            Posting Issues    How do I post a topic in a forum?Easy -- click the relevant button on either the forum or topic screens. You may need to register before you can post a message. The facilities available to you are listed at the bottom of the forum and topic screens (the You can post new topics, You can vote in polls, etc. list)Back to top        How do I edit or delete a post?Unless you are the board admin or forum moderator you can only edit or delete your own posts. You can edit a post  by clicking the edit button for the relevant post.  If someone has already replied to the post you will find a small piece of text output below the post when you return to the topic, this lists the number of times you edited it. This will not appear if no one has replied, it also will not appear if moderators or administrators edit the post (We generally leave a message saying what we altered and why). Please note that normal users cannot delete a post once someone has replied.Back to top        How do I add a signature to my post?To add a signature to a post you must first create one; this is done via your profile. Once created you can check the Add Signature box on the posting form to add your signature. You can also add a signature by default to all your posts by checking the appropriate radio box in your profile. You can still prevent a signature being added to individual posts by un-checking the add signature box on the posting form.Back to top        How do I create a poll?Creating a poll is easy -- when you post a new topic (or edit the first post of a topic, if you have permission) you should see a Add Poll form below the main posting box. If you cannot see this then you probably do not have rights to create polls. You should enter a title for the poll and then at least two options -- to set an option type in the poll question and click the Add option button. You can also set a time limit for the poll, 0 being an infinite amount. There will be a limit to the number of options you can list, which is set by the board administratorBack to top        How do I edit or delete a poll?As with posts, polls can only be edited by the original poster, a moderator, or board administrator. To edit a poll, click the first post in the topic, which always has the poll associated with it. If no one has cast a vote then users can delete the poll or edit any poll option. However, if people have already placed votes only moderators or administrators can edit or delete it; this is to prevent people rigging polls by changing options mid-way through a pollBack to top        Why can't I access a forum?Some forums may be limited to certain users or groups. To view, read, post, etc. you may need special authorization which only the forum moderator and board administrator can grant, so you should contact them.Back to top        Why can't I vote in polls?Only registered users can vote in polls so as to prevent spoofing of results. If you have registered and still cannot vote then you probably do not have appropriate access rights.Back to top            Formatting and Topic Types    What is BBCode?BBCode is a special implementation of HTML. Whether you can use BBCode is determined by the administrator. You can also disable it on a per post basis from the posting form. BBCode itself is similar in style to HTML: tags are enclosed in square braces [ and ] rather than < and > and it offers greater control over what and how something is displayed. For more information on BBCode see the guide which can be accessed from the posting page.Back to top        Can I use HTML?You are allowed to use HTML, but only certain tags work. This is a safety feature to prevent people abusing the board by using tags which may destroy the layout or cause other problems. You can enable/disable HTML on a per post basis from the posting form.Back to top        What are Smileys?Smileys, or Emoticons, are small graphical images which can be used to express some feeling using a short code, e.g. :) means happy, :( means sad. The full list of emoticons can be seen via the posting form. Try not to overuse smileys, though, as they can quickly render a post unreadable and a moderator may decide to edit them out or remove the post altogether.Back to top        Can I post Images?Images can indeed be shown in your posts. However, there is no facility at present for uploading images directly to this board. Therefore you must link to an image stored on a publicly accessible web server, e.g. http://www.some-unknown-place.net/my-picture.gif. You cannot link to pictures stored on your own PC (unless it is a publicly accessible server) nor to images stored behind authentication mechanisms such as Hotmail or Yahoo mailboxes, password-protected sites, etc. To display the image use either the BBCode [img] tag or appropriate HTML (if allowed).Back to top        What are Announcements?Announcements often contain important information and you should read them as soon as possible. Announcements appear at the top of every page in the forum to which they are posted. Only the administrators and moderators can post announcements.Back to top        What are Sticky topics?Sticky topics appear below any announcements in viewforum and only on the first page. They are often quite important so you should read them where possible. As with announcements only board administrator and moderators can post sticky topics in each forum.Back to top        What are Locked topics?Locked topics are set this way by either the forum moderator or board administrator. You cannot reply to locked topics and any poll contained inside is automatically ended. Topics may be locked for many reasons.Back to top            User Levels and Groups    What are Administrators?Administrators are people assigned the highest level of control over the entire board. These people can control all facets of board operation which include setting permissions, banning users, creating usergroups or moderators, etc. They also have full moderator capabilities in all the forums.Back to top        What are Moderators?Moderators are individuals (or groups of individuals) whose job it is to look after the running of the forums from day to day. They have the power to edit or delete posts and lock, unlock, move, delete and split topics in the forum they moderate. Generally moderators are there to prevent people going off-topic or posting abusive or offensive material.Back to top        What are Usergroups?Usergroups are a way in which board administrators can group users. Each user can belong to several groups (this differs from most other boards) and each group can be assigned individual access rights. This makes it easy for administrators to set up several users as moderators of a forum, or to give them access to a private forum, etc.Back to top        How do I join a Usergroup?To join a usergroup click the usergroup link on the page header (dependent on template design) and you can then view all usergroups. Not all groups are open access -- some are closed and some may even have hidden memberships. If the board is open then you can request to join it by clicking the appropriate button. The user group moderator will need to approve your request; they may ask why you want to join the group. Please do not pester a group moderator if they turn your request down -- they will have their reasons.Back to top        How do I become a Usergroup Moderator?Usergroups are initially created by the board administrator who also assigns a board moderator. If you are interested in creating a usergroup then your first point of contact should be the administrator, so try dropping them a private message.Back to top            Private Messaging    I cannot send private messages!You are probably not registered and/or not logged on.Back to top        I keep getting unwanted private messages!In the future we will be adding an ignore list to the private messaging system. For now, though, if you keep receiving unwanted private messages from someone, inform the board administrator -- they have the power to prevent a user from sending private messages at all.Back to top        I have received a spamming or abusive email from someone on this board!We are sorry to hear that. The email form feature of this board includes safeguards to try to track users who send such posts. You should email the board administrator with a full copy of the email you received and it is very important this include the headers (these list details of the user that sent the email). They can then take action.Back to top            phpBB 2 Issues    Who wrote this bulletin board?This software (in its unmodified form) is produced, released and is copyrighted phpBB Group.

I have received a spamming or abusive email from someone on this board!  phpBB 2 Issues Who wrote this bulletin board? Why isn't X feature available? Who do I contact about abusive and/or legal matters related to this board?              Login and Registration Issues    Why can't I log in?Have you registered? Seriously, you must register in order to log in. Have you been banned from the board? (A message will be displayed if you have.) If so, you should contact the webmaster or board administrator to find out why. If you have registered and are not banned and you still cannot log in then check and double-check your username and password. Usually this is the problem; if not, contact the board administrator -- they may have incorrect configuration settings for the board.Back to top        Why do I need to register at all?Requiring registration permits us more control over how people post. By requiring that people register we are able to  ban trolls and anyone else who doesn't follow the forum rules. We'd rather have a smaller but friendly and intelligent posting community than a free for all.Back to top        Why do I get logged off automatically?If you do not check the Log me in automatically box when you log in, the board will only keep you logged in for a preset time. This prevents misuse of your account by anyone else. To stay logged in, check the box during login. This is not recommended if you access the board from a shared computer, e.g. library, internet cafe, university cluster, etc.Back to top        How do I prevent my username from appearing in the online user listings?In your profile you will find an option Hide your online status; if you switch this on you'll only appear to board administrators or to yourself. You will be counted as a hidden user.Back to top        I've lost my password!Don't panic! While your password cannot be retrieved it can be reset. To do this go to the login page and click I've forgotten my password. Follow the instructions and you should be back online in no time.Back to top        I registered but cannot log in!Firstly check that you are entering the correct username and password. Does your account need activating? We require that all new registrations be activated. When you registered you were told this. You should have received an email, please follow the instructions in the email. If you did not receive the email (check in your junk folder!), are you sure your email address is valid? One reason activation is used is to reduce the possibility of rogue users abusing the board anonymously. If you are sure the email address you used is valid you can try re-sending an activation e-mail.Back to top        I registered in the past but cannot log in anymore!The most likely reasons for this are: you entered an incorrect username or password (check the email you were sent when you first registered) or the administrator has deleted your account for some reason. If it is the latter case then perhaps you did not post anything? It is usual for boards to periodically remove users who have not posted anything so as to reduce the size of the database. Try registering again and get involved in discussions.Back to top            User Preferences and settings    How do I change my settings?All your settings (if you are registered) are stored in the database. To alter them click the Profile link (under the forum tab). This will allow you to change all your settings.Back to top        The times are not correct!The times are almost certainly correct; however, what you may be seeing are times displayed in a timezone different from the one you are in. If this is the case, you should change your profile setting for the timezone to match your particular area, e.g. London, Paris, New York, Sydney, etc. Please note that changing the timezone, like most settings, can only be done by registered users. So if you are not registered, this is a good time to do so, if you pardon the pun!Back to top        I changed the timezone and the time is still wrong!If you are sure you have set the timezone correctly and the time is still different, the most likely answer is daylight savings time (or summer time as it is known in the UK and other places). The board is not designed to handle the changeovers between standard and daylight time so during summer months the time may be an hour different from the real local time.Back to top        How do I show an image below my username?That image is called an 'avatar', and you can upload it by going to your profileBack to top        Why is my Avatar replaced by another pictureSome free webhosts (ie: Tripod) do not permit off-site linking to their images. They do this to conserve their bandwidth, try using another server for you image.Back to top        How do I change my rank?You can't. Currently we do not employ an automatic Rank changing system; we feel that these place too much emphasis on the quantity of posts as opposed to the quality.Back to top        When I click the email link for a user it asks me to log in.Sorry, but only registered users can send email to people via the built-in email form (if the admin has enabled this feature). This is to prevent malicious use of the email system by anonymous users.Back to top            Posting Issues    How do I post a topic in a forum?Easy -- click the relevant button on either the forum or topic screens. You may need to register before you can post a message. The facilities available to you are listed at the bottom of the forum and topic screens (the You can post new topics, You can vote in polls, etc. list)Back to top        How do I edit or delete a post?Unless you are the board admin or forum moderator you can only edit or delete your own posts. You can edit a post  by clicking the edit button for the relevant post.  If someone has already replied to the post you will find a small piece of text output below the post when you return to the topic, this lists the number of times you edited it. This will not appear if no one has replied, it also will not appear if moderators or administrators edit the post (We generally leave a message saying what we altered and why). Please note that normal users cannot delete a post once someone has replied.Back to top        How do I add a signature to my post?To add a signature to a post you must first create one; this is done via your profile. Once created you can check the Add Signature box on the posting form to add your signature. You can also add a signature by default to all your posts by checking the appropriate radio box in your profile. You can still prevent a signature being added to individual posts by un-checking the add signature box on the posting form.Back to top        How do I create a poll?Creating a poll is easy -- when you post a new topic (or edit the first post of a topic, if you have permission) you should see a Add Poll form below the main posting box. If you cannot see this then you probably do not have rights to create polls. You should enter a title for the poll and then at least two options -- to set an option type in the poll question and click the Add option button. You can also set a time limit for the poll, 0 being an infinite amount. There will be a limit to the number of options you can list, which is set by the board administratorBack to top        How do I edit or delete a poll?As with posts, polls can only be edited by the original poster, a moderator, or board administrator. To edit a poll, click the first post in the topic, which always has the poll associated with it. If no one has cast a vote then users can delete the poll or edit any poll option. However, if people have already placed votes only moderators or administrators can edit or delete it; this is to prevent people rigging polls by changing options mid-way through a pollBack to top        Why can't I access a forum?Some forums may be limited to certain users or groups. To view, read, post, etc. you may need special authorization which only the forum moderator and board administrator can grant, so you should contact them.Back to top        Why can't I vote in polls?Only registered users can vote in polls so as to prevent spoofing of results. If you have registered and still cannot vote then you probably do not have appropriate access rights.Back to top            Formatting and Topic Types    What is BBCode?BBCode is a special implementation of HTML. Whether you can use BBCode is determined by the administrator. You can also disable it on a per post basis from the posting form. BBCode itself is similar in style to HTML: tags are enclosed in square braces [ and ] rather than < and > and it offers greater control over what and how something is displayed. For more information on BBCode see the guide which can be accessed from the posting page.Back to top        Can I use HTML?You are allowed to use HTML, but only certain tags work. This is a safety feature to prevent people abusing the board by using tags which may destroy the layout or cause other problems. You can enable/disable HTML on a per post basis from the posting form.Back to top        What are Smileys?Smileys, or Emoticons, are small graphical images which can be used to express some feeling using a short code, e.g. :) means happy, :( means sad. The full list of emoticons can be seen via the posting form. Try not to overuse smileys, though, as they can quickly render a post unreadable and a moderator may decide to edit them out or remove the post altogether.Back to top        Can I post Images?Images can indeed be shown in your posts. However, there is no facility at present for uploading images directly to this board. Therefore you must link to an image stored on a publicly accessible web server, e.g. http://www.some-unknown-place.net/my-picture.gif. You cannot link to pictures stored on your own PC (unless it is a publicly accessible server) nor to images stored behind authentication mechanisms such as Hotmail or Yahoo mailboxes, password-protected sites, etc. To display the image use either the BBCode [img] tag or appropriate HTML (if allowed).Back to top        What are Announcements?Announcements often contain important information and you should read them as soon as possible. Announcements appear at the top of every page in the forum to which they are posted. Only the administrators and moderators can post announcements.Back to top        What are Sticky topics?Sticky topics appear below any announcements in viewforum and only on the first page. They are often quite important so you should read them where possible. As with announcements only board administrator and moderators can post sticky topics in each forum.Back to top        What are Locked topics?Locked topics are set this way by either the forum moderator or board administrator. You cannot reply to locked topics and any poll contained inside is automatically ended. Topics may be locked for many reasons.Back to top            User Levels and Groups    What are Administrators?Administrators are people assigned the highest level of control over the entire board. These people can control all facets of board operation which include setting permissions, banning users, creating usergroups or moderators, etc. They also have full moderator capabilities in all the forums.Back to top        What are Moderators?Moderators are individuals (or groups of individuals) whose job it is to look after the running of the forums from day to day. They have the power to edit or delete posts and lock, unlock, move, delete and split topics in the forum they moderate. Generally moderators are there to prevent people going off-topic or posting abusive or offensive material.Back to top        What are Usergroups?Usergroups are a way in which board administrators can group users. Each user can belong to several groups (this differs from most other boards) and each group can be assigned individual access rights. This makes it easy for administrators to set up several users as moderators of a forum, or to give them access to a private forum, etc.Back to top        How do I join a Usergroup?To join a usergroup click the usergroup link on the page header (dependent on template design) and you can then view all usergroups. Not all groups are open access -- some are closed and some may even have hidden memberships. If the board is open then you can request to join it by clicking the appropriate button. The user group moderator will need to approve your request; they may ask why you want to join the group. Please do not pester a group moderator if they turn your request down -- they will have their reasons.Back to top        How do I become a Usergroup Moderator?Usergroups are initially created by the board administrator who also assigns a board moderator. If you are interested in creating a usergroup then your first point of contact should be the administrator, so try dropping them a private message.Back to top            Private Messaging    I cannot send private messages!You are probably not registered and/or not logged on.Back to top        I keep getting unwanted private messages!In the future we will be adding an ignore list to the private messaging system. For now, though, if you keep receiving unwanted private messages from someone, inform the board administrator -- they have the power to prevent a user from sending private messages at all.Back to top        I have received a spamming or abusive email from someone on this board!We are sorry to hear that. The email form feature of this board includes safeguards to try to track users who send such posts. You should email the board administrator with a full copy of the email you received and it is very important this include the headers (these list details of the user that sent the email). They can then take action.Back to top            phpBB 2 Issues    Who wrote this bulletin board?This software (in its unmodified form) is produced, released and is copyrighted phpBB Group.

I have received a spamming or abusive email from someone on this board!  phpBB 2 Issues Who wrote this bulletin board? Why isn't X feature available? Who do I contact about abusive and/or legal matters related to this board?              Login and Registration Issues    Why can't I log in?Have you registered? Seriously, you must register in order to log in. Have you been banned from the board? (A message will be displayed if you have.) If so, you should contact the webmaster or board administrator to find out why. If you have registered and are not banned and you still cannot log in then check and double-check your username and password. Usually this is the problem; if not, contact the board administrator -- they may have incorrect configuration settings for the board.Back to top        Why do I need to register at all?Requiring registration permits us more control over how people post. By requiring that people register we are able to  ban trolls and anyone else who doesn't follow the forum rules. We'd rather have a smaller but friendly and intelligent posting community than a free for all.Back to top        Why do I get logged off automatically?If you do not check the Log me in automatically box when you log in, the board will only keep you logged in for a preset time. This prevents misuse of your account by anyone else. To stay logged in, check the box during login. This is not recommended if you access the board from a shared computer, e.g. library, internet cafe, university cluster, etc.Back to top        How do I prevent my username from appearing in the online user listings?In your profile you will find an option Hide your online status; if you switch this on you'll only appear to board administrators or to yourself. You will be counted as a hidden user.Back to top        I've lost my password!Don't panic! While your password cannot be retrieved it can be reset. To do this go to the login page and click I've forgotten my password. Follow the instructions and you should be back online in no time.Back to top        I registered but cannot log in!Firstly check that you are entering the correct username and password. Does your account need activating? We require that all new registrations be activated. When you registered you were told this. You should have received an email, please follow the instructions in the email. If you did not receive the email (check in your junk folder!), are you sure your email address is valid? One reason activation is used is to reduce the possibility of rogue users abusing the board anonymously. If you are sure the email address you used is valid you can try re-sending an activation e-mail.Back to top        I registered in the past but cannot log in anymore!The most likely reasons for this are: you entered an incorrect username or password (check the email you were sent when you first registered) or the administrator has deleted your account for some reason. If it is the latter case then perhaps you did not post anything? It is usual for boards to periodically remove users who have not posted anything so as to reduce the size of the database. Try registering again and get involved in discussions.Back to top            User Preferences and settings    How do I change my settings?All your settings (if you are registered) are stored in the database. To alter them click the Profile link (under the forum tab). This will allow you to change all your settings.Back to top        The times are not correct!The times are almost certainly correct; however, what you may be seeing are times displayed in a timezone different from the one you are in. If this is the case, you should change your profile setting for the timezone to match your particular area, e.g. London, Paris, New York, Sydney, etc. Please note that changing the timezone, like most settings, can only be done by registered users. So if you are not registered, this is a good time to do so, if you pardon the pun!Back to top        I changed the timezone and the time is still wrong!If you are sure you have set the timezone correctly and the time is still different, the most likely answer is daylight savings time (or summer time as it is known in the UK and other places). The board is not designed to handle the changeovers between standard and daylight time so during summer months the time may be an hour different from the real local time.Back to top        How do I show an image below my username?That image is called an 'avatar', and you can upload it by going to your profileBack to top        Why is my Avatar replaced by another pictureSome free webhosts (ie: Tripod) do not permit off-site linking to their images. They do this to conserve their bandwidth, try using another server for you image.Back to top        How do I change my rank?You can't. Currently we do not employ an automatic Rank changing system; we feel that these place too much emphasis on the quantity of posts as opposed to the quality.Back to top        When I click the email link for a user it asks me to log in.Sorry, but only registered users can send email to people via the built-in email form (if the admin has enabled this feature). This is to prevent malicious use of the email system by anonymous users.Back to top            Posting Issues    How do I post a topic in a forum?Easy -- click the relevant button on either the forum or topic screens. You may need to register before you can post a message. The facilities available to you are listed at the bottom of the forum and topic screens (the You can post new topics, You can vote in polls, etc. list)Back to top        How do I edit or delete a post?Unless you are the board admin or forum moderator you can only edit or delete your own posts. You can edit a post  by clicking the edit button for the relevant post.  If someone has already replied to the post you will find a small piece of text output below the post when you return to the topic, this lists the number of times you edited it. This will not appear if no one has replied, it also will not appear if moderators or administrators edit the post (We generally leave a message saying what we altered and why). Please note that normal users cannot delete a post once someone has replied.Back to top        How do I add a signature to my post?To add a signature to a post you must first create one; this is done via your profile. Once created you can check the Add Signature box on the posting form to add your signature. You can also add a signature by default to all your posts by checking the appropriate radio box in your profile. You can still prevent a signature being added to individual posts by un-checking the add signature box on the posting form.Back to top        How do I create a poll?Creating a poll is easy -- when you post a new topic (or edit the first post of a topic, if you have permission) you should see a Add Poll form below the main posting box. If you cannot see this then you probably do not have rights to create polls. You should enter a title for the poll and then at least two options -- to set an option type in the poll question and click the Add option button. You can also set a time limit for the poll, 0 being an infinite amount. There will be a limit to the number of options you can list, which is set by the board administratorBack to top        How do I edit or delete a poll?As with posts, polls can only be edited by the original poster, a moderator, or board administrator. To edit a poll, click the first post in the topic, which always has the poll associated with it. If no one has cast a vote then users can delete the poll or edit any poll option. However, if people have already placed votes only moderators or administrators can edit or delete it; this is to prevent people rigging polls by changing options mid-way through a pollBack to top        Why can't I access a forum?Some forums may be limited to certain users or groups. To view, read, post, etc. you may need special authorization which only the forum moderator and board administrator can grant, so you should contact them.Back to top        Why can't I vote in polls?Only registered users can vote in polls so as to prevent spoofing of results. If you have registered and still cannot vote then you probably do not have appropriate access rights.Back to top            Formatting and Topic Types    What is BBCode?BBCode is a special implementation of HTML. Whether you can use BBCode is determined by the administrator. You can also disable it on a per post basis from the posting form. BBCode itself is similar in style to HTML: tags are enclosed in square braces [ and ] rather than < and > and it offers greater control over what and how something is displayed. For more information on BBCode see the guide which can be accessed from the posting page.Back to top        Can I use HTML?You are allowed to use HTML, but only certain tags work. This is a safety feature to prevent people abusing the board by using tags which may destroy the layout or cause other problems. You can enable/disable HTML on a per post basis from the posting form.Back to top        What are Smileys?Smileys, or Emoticons, are small graphical images which can be used to express some feeling using a short code, e.g. :) means happy, :( means sad. The full list of emoticons can be seen via the posting form. Try not to overuse smileys, though, as they can quickly render a post unreadable and a moderator may decide to edit them out or remove the post altogether.Back to top        Can I post Images?Images can indeed be shown in your posts. However, there is no facility at present for uploading images directly to this board. Therefore you must link to an image stored on a publicly accessible web server, e.g. http://www.some-unknown-place.net/my-picture.gif. You cannot link to pictures stored on your own PC (unless it is a publicly accessible server) nor to images stored behind authentication mechanisms such as Hotmail or Yahoo mailboxes, password-protected sites, etc. To display the image use either the BBCode [img] tag or appropriate HTML (if allowed).Back to top        What are Announcements?Announcements often contain important information and you should read them as soon as possible. Announcements appear at the top of every page in the forum to which they are posted. Only the administrators and moderators can post announcements.Back to top        What are Sticky topics?Sticky topics appear below any announcements in viewforum and only on the first page. They are often quite important so you should read them where possible. As with announcements only board administrator and moderators can post sticky topics in each forum.Back to top        What are Locked topics?Locked topics are set this way by either the forum moderator or board administrator. You cannot reply to locked topics and any poll contained inside is automatically ended. Topics may be locked for many reasons.Back to top            User Levels and Groups    What are Administrators?Administrators are people assigned the highest level of control over the entire board. These people can control all facets of board operation which include setting permissions, banning users, creating usergroups or moderators, etc. They also have full moderator capabilities in all the forums.Back to top        What are Moderators?Moderators are individuals (or groups of individuals) whose job it is to look after the running of the forums from day to day. They have the power to edit or delete posts and lock, unlock, move, delete and split topics in the forum they moderate. Generally moderators are there to prevent people going off-topic or posting abusive or offensive material.Back to top        What are Usergroups?Usergroups are a way in which board administrators can group users. Each user can belong to several groups (this differs from most other boards) and each group can be assigned individual access rights. This makes it easy for administrators to set up several users as moderators of a forum, or to give them access to a private forum, etc.Back to top        How do I join a Usergroup?To join a usergroup click the usergroup link on the page header (dependent on template design) and you can then view all usergroups. Not all groups are open access -- some are closed and some may even have hidden memberships. If the board is open then you can request to join it by clicking the appropriate button. The user group moderator will need to approve your request; they may ask why you want to join the group. Please do not pester a group moderator if they turn your request down -- they will have their reasons.Back to top        How do I become a Usergroup Moderator?Usergroups are initially created by the board administrator who also assigns a board moderator. If you are interested in creating a usergroup then your first point of contact should be the administrator, so try dropping them a private message.Back to top            Private Messaging    I cannot send private messages!You are probably not registered and/or not logged on.Back to top        I keep getting unwanted private messages!In the future we will be adding an ignore list to the private messaging system. For now, though, if you keep receiving unwanted private messages from someone, inform the board administrator -- they have the power to prevent a user from sending private messages at all.Back to top        I have received a spamming or abusive email from someone on this board!We are sorry to hear that. The email form feature of this board includes safeguards to try to track users who send such posts. You should email the board administrator with a full copy of the email you received and it is very important this include the headers (these list details of the user that sent the email). They can then take action.Back to top            phpBB 2 Issues    Who wrote this bulletin board?This software (in its unmodified form) is produced, released and is copyrighted phpBB Group. It is made available under the GNU General Public License and may be freely distributed; see link for more detailsBack to top        Why isn't X feature available?This software was written by and licensed through phpBB Group. If you believe a feature needs to be added then please visit the phpbb.com website and see what the phpBB Group has to say. Please do not post feature requests to the board at phpbb.com, as the Group uses sourceforge to handle tasking of new features. Please read through the forums and see what, if any, our position may already be for features and then follow the procedure given there.Back to top        Who do I contact about abusive and/or legal matters related to this board?You should e-mail [email protected] or PM one of the moderators or administrators. Please note that phpBB Group has absolutely no control and cannot in any way be held liable over anything on Anime News Network. If you do email phpBB Group about any third party use of this software then you should expect a terse response or no response at all.Back to top             All times are GMT - 5 Hours    Jump to: Select a forum   Site-related ---------------- Announcements & The Rules Talkback Encyclopedia Bugs & Technical Questions ANN Feedback   General ---------------- Anime Series Discussion Manga Music Events Novels Video Games Polls Contests and Games   Industry ---------------- Retail   For Subscribers ---------------- Community Feature requests Collection Spotlight Personal Sales           Powered by phpBB © 2001, 2005 phpBB Group           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature                The Best and Worst of Winter 2022   Apr  6, 10:10                 anime    With the last few episodes trailing into Spring like an April's fool, it's time to look at the final ranking of the Winter 2022 season.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   by The Anime News Network Editorial Team, Apr  1st 2022          Adblock+ breaks this page, consider whitelisting ANN   Welcome to Anime News Network's Spring 2022 Preview Guide! Here's how it goes: our team of critics write up their impressions instantly, to be posted here as they go along. Each critic will cover as many shows as they can handle, giving you alternate takes on most every show.    The guide is ongoing, organized by series and updated multiple times a day. Throughout the next week or two, we'll be updating as often as possible with new perspectives on new episodes from our team of critics. New reviews will be posted as soon as they're written, with each critic's name being added to the roster beneath the show's title. Check back a couple of times every day during the guide, and you're likely to see new shows pop up with multiple takes to enjoy!    Please remember that this is a preview guide. It is designed to give you a taste of the first episode of a show with a preliminary opinion and a few thoughts on whether or not the show has potential. These are not intended to be blanket judgments of these series as a whole. All reviews use the same ratings scale: 1-5, with 1 being the lowest.    Click on the survey at the top of each show's page to vote for your personal score and see how other people scored the show!

Here's how it goes: our team of critics write up their impressions instantly, to be posted here as they go along. Each critic will cover as many shows as they can handle, giving you alternate takes on most every show.    The guide is ongoing, organized by series and updated multiple times a day. Throughout the next week or two, we'll be updating as often as possible with new perspectives on new episodes from our team of critics. New reviews will be posted as soon as they're written, with each critic's name being added to the roster beneath the show's title. Check back a couple of times every day during the guide, and you're likely to see new shows pop up with multiple takes to enjoy!    Please remember that this is a preview guide. It is designed to give you a taste of the first episode of a show with a preliminary opinion and a few thoughts on whether or not the show has potential. These are not intended to be blanket judgments of these series as a whole. All reviews use the same ratings scale: 1-5, with 1 being the lowest.    Click on the survey at the top of each show's page to vote for your personal score and see how other people scored the show!

Not only being saved from Tencent's clutches but King of Fighters XV being an amazing game that respects legacy skill and wasn't dumbed down mechanically for the newest game like other franchises.    Plus it's still filled with fanservice which is always a plus.  The PC port is also the best version out of all of them which is usually not the case so it's nice they're focusing on developing proper PC versions from the start.  There's also new Metal Slug games coming out.  Not sure if it's all MiSK/Abdulaziz's doing or not but he does brags about his gamer and weeb status a lot.  But at any rate it seems to have been a great boon for SNK these past few years.

People aren't just upset about this because they think the games will be censored (although yes, that would suck), it's due to now being majority owned by a prince who blatantly had a journalist murdered. It doesn't really have anything to do with what is in SNK games right now. This isn't overlooking how it sucks that Tencent is buying up so much everywhere, it's just recognizing how much this instance sucks in a very particular way.

This really sucks...   My questions are: who is shaking hands / putting ink to paper to make this deal happen? Is SNK in a position to say no to the investment? Is this a pure economic buyout where you can't really say no?     livin_large wrote:    The PC port is also the best version out of all of them which is usually not the case so it's nice they're focusing on developing proper PC versions from the start.            I don't know where you got this idea. PS4 is actually the best version of the game currently. PS5 has too much input lag, XBox is a graveyard, and PC is rife with issues with much of it being related to matchmaking.

This really sucks...       I think it's more that putting money in KOF means giving some of it to a authoritarian murderer. You can still like it, it's not like that prince made the game himself to promote him. You can for example buy it used later to reduce amount of money that goes to his company. Or change nothing - China is horrible too and most of us still buy a ton things from them, it's not like you have a duty to boycott everything.

Not only being saved from Tencent's clutches but King of Fighters XV being an amazing game that respects legacy skill and wasn't dumbed down mechanically for the newest game like other franchises.    Plus it's still filled with fanservice which is always a plus.  The PC port is also the best version out of all of them which is usually not the case so it's nice they're focusing on developing proper PC versions from the start.  There's also new Metal Slug games coming out.  Not sure if it's all MiSK/Abdulaziz's doing or not but he does brags about his gamer and weeb status a lot.  But at any rate it seems to have been a great boon for SNK these past few years.

It doesn't really have anything to do with what is in SNK games right now.

This really sucks...   My questions are: who is shaking hands / putting ink to paper to make this deal happen? Is SNK in a position to say no to the investment? Is this a pure economic buyout where you can't really say no?     livin_large wrote:    The PC port is also the best version out of all of them which is usually not the case so it's nice they're focusing on developing proper PC versions from the start.            I don't know where you got this idea. PS4 is actually the best version of the game currently. PS5 has too much input lag, XBox is a graveyard, and PC is rife with issues with much of it being related to matchmaking.

This really sucks...       I think it's more that putting money in KOF means giving some of it to a authoritarian murderer. You can still like it, it's not like that prince made the game himself to promote him. You can for example buy it used later to reduce amount of money that goes to his company. Or change nothing - China is horrible too and most of us still buy a ton things from them, it's not like you have a duty to boycott everything.

This isn't overlooking how it sucks that Tencent is buying up so much everywhere, it's just recognizing how much this instance sucks in a very particular way.

Not only being saved from Tencent's clutches but King of Fighters XV being an amazing game that respects legacy skill and wasn't dumbed down mechanically for the newest game like other franchises.    Plus it's still filled with fanservice which is always a plus.  The PC port is also the best version out of all of them which is usually not the case so it's nice they're focusing on developing proper PC versions from the start.  There's also new Metal Slug games coming out.  Not sure if it's all MiSK/Abdulaziz's doing or not but he does brags about his gamer and weeb status a lot.  But at any rate it seems to have been a great boon for SNK these past few years.

Or change nothing - China is horrible too and most of us still buy a ton things from them, it's not like you have a duty to boycott everything.

Not only being saved from Tencent's clutches but King of Fighters XV being an amazing game that respects legacy skill and wasn't dumbed down mechanically for the newest game like other franchises.    Plus it's still filled with fanservice which is always a plus.  The PC port is also the best version out of all of them which is usually not the case so it's nice they're focusing on developing proper PC versions from the start.  There's also new Metal Slug games coming out.  Not sure if it's all MiSK/Abdulaziz's doing or not but he does brags about his gamer and weeb status a lot.

Not only being saved from Tencent's clutches but King of Fighters XV being an amazing game that respects legacy skill and wasn't dumbed down mechanically for the newest game like other franchises.    Plus it's still filled with fanservice which is always a plus.  The PC port is also the best version out of all of them which is usually not the case so it's nice they're focusing on developing proper PC versions from the start.  There's also new Metal Slug games coming out.  Not sure if it's all MiSK/Abdulaziz's doing or not but he does brags about his gamer and weeb status a lot.  But at any rate it seems to have been a great boon for SNK these past few years.

People aren't just upset about this because they think the games will be censored (although yes, that would suck), it's due to now being majority owned by a prince who blatantly had a journalist murdered. It doesn't really have anything to do with what is in SNK games right now. This isn't overlooking how it sucks that Tencent is buying up so much everywhere, it's just recognizing how much this instance sucks in a very particular way.

Is this a pure economic buyout where you can't really say no?     livin_large wrote:    The PC port is also the best version out of all of them which is usually not the case so it's nice they're focusing on developing proper PC versions from the start.

Interest Quintessential Quintuplets Voice Actors Compete For Cash at AnimeJapan Stage Event   posted on 2022-04-06 03:45 UTC-8 by Ken Iikura-Gross           AnimeJapan 2022 hosted a fun talk show featuring The Quintessential Quintuplets voice actors Yoshitsugu Matsuoka (Fuutaro Uesugi), Ayana Taketatsu (Nino Nakano), and Ayane Sakura (Yotsuba Nakano) ahead of the film's opening in May. But this was no ordinary talk show. The three were competing for a 10,000 yen (approximately 81.15 USD) gift certificate for Bic Camera, one of Japan's largest electronic stores.    The premise of the game was quite simple: Matsuoka, Taketatsu, and Sakura would have to answer three questions. The twist was Taketatsu and Sakura would only get points if their answer matched Matsuoka's. This meant Matsuoka could mess around with his answers if he wanted to hog the prize. There was, of course, a bit of time before the voice actors had to write their answers down, which meant Taketatsu and Sakura could grill Matsuoka to figure out his answer. On top of this, Taketatsu and Sakura impressed upon Matsuoka that they were at AnimeJapan to promote the upcoming movie, so he should answer truthfully—to whatever extent Matsuoka thought was the truth.     The games began with the simple question “What's on May 20?” Both Taketatsu and Sakura made sure Matsuoka knew the date and how important it was. Unrelenting, Matsuoka ensured the two women he knew what was on May 20. When the answers were revealed, each voice actor had the same answer: the movie's release day. However, Matsuoka threw in a little twist by changing up the kanji used for the word “release day,” kōkaibi (公開日), to the phrase “regretful day,” kōkaibi (後悔日). A fun little word play by Matsuoka, but clearly not the same answer as Taketatsu or Sakura—though they tried to argue in the spirit of the words being phonetically the same. Alas, Taketatsu and Sakura's plea's fell on deaf ears and Matsuoka was awarded the point.    The second question became a little personal for Matsuoka with the question, “What kind of dish would you want someone you're interested in to make?” Matsuoka insisted that the two women probably wouldn't want to know the answer, but Sakura was gunning for the prize. Thus, she showed great interest in Matsuoka's answer. Or so the audience was lead to believe as it was actually Taketatsu who lead the questioning so far as to ask if the dish was curry or hayashi rice. This clearly put Matsuoka in a tough spot as it looked as if he wanted to answer truthfully, but then again, prize. In the end, though, Matsuoka relented and when the answers were revealed, Taketatsu and Sakura's answers both matched Matsuoka's hayashi rice.    With the score tied up 1-1-1, the final question was the tiebreaker. Another personal question for Matsuoka: “What kind of date spot would you go to?” He mentioned it was somewhat outdoors, but not really a place where you can feel the change of seasons. A difficult hint for Taketatsu and Sakura, the two woman bent the rules a bit and asked a few more questions after their time had run out. All for the prize. And again, the three had the same answer: aquarium. Thus, giving the actresses the victory. Or so everyone thought until Sakura asked to see Taketatsu's answer once again. Upon further review it turned out Taketatsu had missed one stroke in the kanji kan (館) giving Sakura a distinct advantage over Taketatsu. Still, in the spirit of sportsmanship, they both had the same answer as Matsuoka. So, the tiebreaker went to the audience, with the clear and decisive winner being Sakura for the correct writing of the kanji.     This was a fun little game for the audience at AnimeJapan 2022 and those watching at home. We got to learn a bit about Matsuoka and the competitive, but in good fun, nature of Taketatsu and Sakura. It was also a good look into the harem race in The Quintessential Quintuplets, to be concluded in May. May the best girl win.        discuss this in the forum (2 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                Interest homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature                The Best and Worst of Winter 2022   Apr  6, 10:10                 anime    With the last few episodes trailing into Spring like an April's fool, it's time to look at the final ranking of the Winter 2022 season.

Interest Quintessential Quintuplets Voice Actors Compete For Cash at AnimeJapan Stage Event   posted on 2022-04-06 03:45 UTC-8 by Ken Iikura-Gross           AnimeJapan 2022 hosted a fun talk show featuring The Quintessential Quintuplets voice actors Yoshitsugu Matsuoka (Fuutaro Uesugi), Ayana Taketatsu (Nino Nakano), and Ayane Sakura (Yotsuba Nakano) ahead of the film's opening in May. But this was no ordinary talk show. The three were competing for a 10,000 yen (approximately 81.15 USD) gift certificate for Bic Camera, one of Japan's largest electronic stores.    The premise of the game was quite simple: Matsuoka, Taketatsu, and Sakura would have to answer three questions. The twist was Taketatsu and Sakura would only get points if their answer matched Matsuoka's. This meant Matsuoka could mess around with his answers if he wanted to hog the prize. There was, of course, a bit of time before the voice actors had to write their answers down, which meant Taketatsu and Sakura could grill Matsuoka to figure out his answer. On top of this, Taketatsu and Sakura impressed upon Matsuoka that they were at AnimeJapan to promote the upcoming movie, so he should answer truthfully—to whatever extent Matsuoka thought was the truth.     The games began with the simple question “What's on May 20?” Both Taketatsu and Sakura made sure Matsuoka knew the date and how important it was. Unrelenting, Matsuoka ensured the two women he knew what was on May 20. When the answers were revealed, each voice actor had the same answer: the movie's release day. However, Matsuoka threw in a little twist by changing up the kanji used for the word “release day,” kōkaibi (公開日), to the phrase “regretful day,” kōkaibi (後悔日). A fun little word play by Matsuoka, but clearly not the same answer as Taketatsu or Sakura—though they tried to argue in the spirit of the words being phonetically the same. Alas, Taketatsu and Sakura's plea's fell on deaf ears and Matsuoka was awarded the point.    The second question became a little personal for Matsuoka with the question, “What kind of dish would you want someone you're interested in to make?” Matsuoka insisted that the two women probably wouldn't want to know the answer, but Sakura was gunning for the prize. Thus, she showed great interest in Matsuoka's answer. Or so the audience was lead to believe as it was actually Taketatsu who lead the questioning so far as to ask if the dish was curry or hayashi rice. This clearly put Matsuoka in a tough spot as it looked as if he wanted to answer truthfully, but then again, prize. In the end, though, Matsuoka relented and when the answers were revealed, Taketatsu and Sakura's answers both matched Matsuoka's hayashi rice.    With the score tied up 1-1-1, the final question was the tiebreaker. Another personal question for Matsuoka: “What kind of date spot would you go to?” He mentioned it was somewhat outdoors, but not really a place where you can feel the change of seasons. A difficult hint for Taketatsu and Sakura, the two woman bent the rules a bit and asked a few more questions after their time had run out. All for the prize. And again, the three had the same answer: aquarium. Thus, giving the actresses the victory. Or so everyone thought until Sakura asked to see Taketatsu's answer once again. Upon further review it turned out Taketatsu had missed one stroke in the kanji kan (館) giving Sakura a distinct advantage over Taketatsu. Still, in the spirit of sportsmanship, they both had the same answer as Matsuoka. So, the tiebreaker went to the audience, with the clear and decisive winner being Sakura for the correct writing of the kanji.     This was a fun little game for the audience at AnimeJapan 2022 and those watching at home. We got to learn a bit about Matsuoka and the competitive, but in good fun, nature of Taketatsu and Sakura. It was also a good look into the harem race in The Quintessential Quintuplets, to be concluded in May. May the best girl win.        discuss this in the forum (2 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                Interest homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature                The Best and Worst of Winter 2022   Apr  6, 10:10                 anime    With the last few episodes trailing into Spring like an April's fool, it's time to look at the final ranking of the Winter 2022 season.

Interest Quintessential Quintuplets Voice Actors Compete For Cash at AnimeJapan Stage Event   posted on 2022-04-06 03:45 UTC-8 by Ken Iikura-Gross           AnimeJapan 2022 hosted a fun talk show featuring The Quintessential Quintuplets voice actors Yoshitsugu Matsuoka (Fuutaro Uesugi), Ayana Taketatsu (Nino Nakano), and Ayane Sakura (Yotsuba Nakano) ahead of the film's opening in May. But this was no ordinary talk show. The three were competing for a 10,000 yen (approximately 81.15 USD) gift certificate for Bic Camera, one of Japan's largest electronic stores.    The premise of the game was quite simple: Matsuoka, Taketatsu, and Sakura would have to answer three questions. The twist was Taketatsu and Sakura would only get points if their answer matched Matsuoka's. This meant Matsuoka could mess around with his answers if he wanted to hog the prize. There was, of course, a bit of time before the voice actors had to write their answers down, which meant Taketatsu and Sakura could grill Matsuoka to figure out his answer. On top of this, Taketatsu and Sakura impressed upon Matsuoka that they were at AnimeJapan to promote the upcoming movie, so he should answer truthfully—to whatever extent Matsuoka thought was the truth.     The games began with the simple question “What's on May 20?” Both Taketatsu and Sakura made sure Matsuoka knew the date and how important it was. Unrelenting, Matsuoka ensured the two women he knew what was on May 20. When the answers were revealed, each voice actor had the same answer: the movie's release day. However, Matsuoka threw in a little twist by changing up the kanji used for the word “release day,” kōkaibi (公開日), to the phrase “regretful day,” kōkaibi (後悔日). A fun little word play by Matsuoka, but clearly not the same answer as Taketatsu or Sakura—though they tried to argue in the spirit of the words being phonetically the same. Alas, Taketatsu and Sakura's plea's fell on deaf ears and Matsuoka was awarded the point.    The second question became a little personal for Matsuoka with the question, “What kind of dish would you want someone you're interested in to make?” Matsuoka insisted that the two women probably wouldn't want to know the answer, but Sakura was gunning for the prize. Thus, she showed great interest in Matsuoka's answer. Or so the audience was lead to believe as it was actually Taketatsu who lead the questioning so far as to ask if the dish was curry or hayashi rice. This clearly put Matsuoka in a tough spot as it looked as if he wanted to answer truthfully, but then again, prize. In the end, though, Matsuoka relented and when the answers were revealed, Taketatsu and Sakura's answers both matched Matsuoka's hayashi rice.    With the score tied up 1-1-1, the final question was the tiebreaker. Another personal question for Matsuoka: “What kind of date spot would you go to?” He mentioned it was somewhat outdoors, but not really a place where you can feel the change of seasons. A difficult hint for Taketatsu and Sakura, the two woman bent the rules a bit and asked a few more questions after their time had run out. All for the prize. And again, the three had the same answer: aquarium. Thus, giving the actresses the victory. Or so everyone thought until Sakura asked to see Taketatsu's answer once again. Upon further review it turned out Taketatsu had missed one stroke in the kanji kan (館) giving Sakura a distinct advantage over Taketatsu. Still, in the spirit of sportsmanship, they both had the same answer as Matsuoka. So, the tiebreaker went to the audience, with the clear and decisive winner being Sakura for the correct writing of the kanji.     This was a fun little game for the audience at AnimeJapan 2022 and those watching at home. We got to learn a bit about Matsuoka and the competitive, but in good fun, nature of Taketatsu and Sakura. It was also a good look into the harem race in The Quintessential Quintuplets, to be concluded in May. May the best girl win.        discuss this in the forum (2 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                Interest homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature                The Best and Worst of Winter 2022   Apr  6, 10:10                 anime    With the last few episodes trailing into Spring like an April's fool, it's time to look at the final ranking of the Winter 2022 season.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Black Rock Shooter: Dawn Fall   Apr  4th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Black Rock Shooter: Dawn Fall ?                     Community score: 4.2              What is this?   It is the year 2062, two decades after the failure of a massive workforce automation project. However, Artemis, the artificial intelligence at the core of that project, had decided to attack humanity, and the resulting war laid waste to Earth. A lone girl, Empress, wakes up in an underground laboratory at a base. She is one of three surviving guardians of humanity. However, she has no memories of what came before. All she knows is what a colonel of the peace-building force tells her. Artemis is constructing a space elevator to link the Moon and Earth, and Empress is ordered to destroy the space elevator before its completion. If the elevator is completed, the hordes of giant mechanized forces being mass-produced on the Moon will descend upon Earth.    Black Rock Shooter: Dawn Fall is the latest entry in the Black Rock Shooter franchise and streams on Disney+ in Japan on Sundays.    Note: The series still isn't available for streaming worldwide. Richard Eisenbeis lives in Japan and was able to watch the first episode there, albeit without subtitles.     How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Black Rock Shooter is one of those intellectual properties that I know the name of but little else. Luckily, since Dawn Fall is a reboot set in a completely new universe, that doesn't seem to matter. The setting is one we've all seen before: There's been a robot apocalypse of sorts and now humanity is on its last legs. However, there are a few AI who continue to fight for the human race—including our titular heroine, Black Rock Shooter.    This anime starts with the classic go-to for creating an audience POV character: amnesia. Not only does it allow Black Rock Shooter to ask all the dumb questions that any person living in the fictional world would already know the answers to, it also allows her to be super powerful without any explanation. Of course, the big drawback here is that, without memories, Black Rock Shooter has very little in the way of personality. All she knows is that she has to reach “lighthouse no. 8” and that she's not willing to abandon those in her care regardless of the tactical situation. It's a solid enough starting point, but for the moment she's not much of a character.    Unfortunately, neither are the other three main characters of this episode. We have the stereotypical protective big brother/sick little sister duo and a hardass military commander. Honestly, there's nothing more to them than that—which leaves the action to carry the show.    More than anything else, this first episode is a series of fight scenes. All of them are decently choreographed and show off the above average CG animation used in the show, further bolstered by a surprisingly rocking soundtrack. However, the black, brown, and grey color pallet can make it hard to see what is happening at times—especially during the fights that occur at night.    All in all, I'm not sure what to think of Dawn Fall. So far, it's little more than a pile of clichés—in both setting and characters. Maybe it will turn into something special down the line but this premiere is largely unimpressive.     discuss this in the forum (110 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature                The Best and Worst of Winter 2022   Apr  6, 10:10                 anime    With the last few episodes trailing into Spring like an April's fool, it's time to look at the final ranking of the Winter 2022 season.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Black Rock Shooter: Dawn Fall   Apr  4th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Black Rock Shooter: Dawn Fall ?                     Community score: 4.2              What is this?   It is the year 2062, two decades after the failure of a massive workforce automation project. However, Artemis, the artificial intelligence at the core of that project, had decided to attack humanity, and the resulting war laid waste to Earth. A lone girl, Empress, wakes up in an underground laboratory at a base. She is one of three surviving guardians of humanity. However, she has no memories of what came before. All she knows is what a colonel of the peace-building force tells her. Artemis is constructing a space elevator to link the Moon and Earth, and Empress is ordered to destroy the space elevator before its completion. If the elevator is completed, the hordes of giant mechanized forces being mass-produced on the Moon will descend upon Earth.    Black Rock Shooter: Dawn Fall is the latest entry in the Black Rock Shooter franchise and streams on Disney+ in Japan on Sundays.    Note: The series still isn't available for streaming worldwide. Richard Eisenbeis lives in Japan and was able to watch the first episode there, albeit without subtitles.     How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Black Rock Shooter is one of those intellectual properties that I know the name of but little else. Luckily, since Dawn Fall is a reboot set in a completely new universe, that doesn't seem to matter. The setting is one we've all seen before: There's been a robot apocalypse of sorts and now humanity is on its last legs. However, there are a few AI who continue to fight for the human race—including our titular heroine, Black Rock Shooter.    This anime starts with the classic go-to for creating an audience POV character: amnesia. Not only does it allow Black Rock Shooter to ask all the dumb questions that any person living in the fictional world would already know the answers to, it also allows her to be super powerful without any explanation. Of course, the big drawback here is that, without memories, Black Rock Shooter has very little in the way of personality. All she knows is that she has to reach “lighthouse no. 8” and that she's not willing to abandon those in her care regardless of the tactical situation. It's a solid enough starting point, but for the moment she's not much of a character.    Unfortunately, neither are the other three main characters of this episode. We have the stereotypical protective big brother/sick little sister duo and a hardass military commander. Honestly, there's nothing more to them than that—which leaves the action to carry the show.    More than anything else, this first episode is a series of fight scenes. All of them are decently choreographed and show off the above average CG animation used in the show, further bolstered by a surprisingly rocking soundtrack. However, the black, brown, and grey color pallet can make it hard to see what is happening at times—especially during the fights that occur at night.    All in all, I'm not sure what to think of Dawn Fall. So far, it's little more than a pile of clichés—in both setting and characters. Maybe it will turn into something special down the line but this premiere is largely unimpressive.     discuss this in the forum (110 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature                The Best and Worst of Winter 2022   Apr  6, 10:10                 anime    With the last few episodes trailing into Spring like an April's fool, it's time to look at the final ranking of the Winter 2022 season.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Black Rock Shooter: Dawn Fall   Apr  4th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Black Rock Shooter: Dawn Fall ?                     Community score: 4.2              What is this?   It is the year 2062, two decades after the failure of a massive workforce automation project. However, Artemis, the artificial intelligence at the core of that project, had decided to attack humanity, and the resulting war laid waste to Earth. A lone girl, Empress, wakes up in an underground laboratory at a base. She is one of three surviving guardians of humanity. However, she has no memories of what came before. All she knows is what a colonel of the peace-building force tells her. Artemis is constructing a space elevator to link the Moon and Earth, and Empress is ordered to destroy the space elevator before its completion. If the elevator is completed, the hordes of giant mechanized forces being mass-produced on the Moon will descend upon Earth.    Black Rock Shooter: Dawn Fall is the latest entry in the Black Rock Shooter franchise and streams on Disney+ in Japan on Sundays.    Note: The series still isn't available for streaming worldwide. Richard Eisenbeis lives in Japan and was able to watch the first episode there, albeit without subtitles.     How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Black Rock Shooter is one of those intellectual properties that I know the name of but little else. Luckily, since Dawn Fall is a reboot set in a completely new universe, that doesn't seem to matter. The setting is one we've all seen before: There's been a robot apocalypse of sorts and now humanity is on its last legs. However, there are a few AI who continue to fight for the human race—including our titular heroine, Black Rock Shooter.    This anime starts with the classic go-to for creating an audience POV character: amnesia. Not only does it allow Black Rock Shooter to ask all the dumb questions that any person living in the fictional world would already know the answers to, it also allows her to be super powerful without any explanation. Of course, the big drawback here is that, without memories, Black Rock Shooter has very little in the way of personality. All she knows is that she has to reach “lighthouse no. 8” and that she's not willing to abandon those in her care regardless of the tactical situation. It's a solid enough starting point, but for the moment she's not much of a character.    Unfortunately, neither are the other three main characters of this episode. We have the stereotypical protective big brother/sick little sister duo and a hardass military commander. Honestly, there's nothing more to them than that—which leaves the action to carry the show.    More than anything else, this first episode is a series of fight scenes. All of them are decently choreographed and show off the above average CG animation used in the show, further bolstered by a surprisingly rocking soundtrack. However, the black, brown, and grey color pallet can make it hard to see what is happening at times—especially during the fights that occur at night.    All in all, I'm not sure what to think of Dawn Fall. So far, it's little more than a pile of clichés—in both setting and characters. Maybe it will turn into something special down the line but this premiere is largely unimpressive.     discuss this in the forum (110 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature                The Best and Worst of Winter 2022   Apr  6, 10:10                 anime    With the last few episodes trailing into Spring like an April's fool, it's time to look at the final ranking of the Winter 2022 season.

Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Black Rock Shooter is one of those intellectual properties that I know the name of but little else. Luckily, since Dawn Fall is a reboot set in a completely new universe, that doesn't seem to matter. The setting is one we've all seen before: There's been a robot apocalypse of sorts and now humanity is on its last legs. However, there are a few AI who continue to fight for the human race—including our titular heroine, Black Rock Shooter.    This anime starts with the classic go-to for creating an audience POV character: amnesia. Not only does it allow Black Rock Shooter to ask all the dumb questions that any person living in the fictional world would already know the answers to, it also allows her to be super powerful without any explanation. Of course, the big drawback here is that, without memories, Black Rock Shooter has very little in the way of personality. All she knows is that she has to reach “lighthouse no. 8” and that she's not willing to abandon those in her care regardless of the tactical situation. It's a solid enough starting point, but for the moment she's not much of a character.    Unfortunately, neither are the other three main characters of this episode. We have the stereotypical protective big brother/sick little sister duo and a hardass military commander. Honestly, there's nothing more to them than that—which leaves the action to carry the show.    More than anything else, this first episode is a series of fight scenes. All of them are decently choreographed and show off the above average CG animation used in the show, further bolstered by a surprisingly rocking soundtrack. However, the black, brown, and grey color pallet can make it hard to see what is happening at times—especially during the fights that occur at night.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Fanfare of Adolescence   Apr  3rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Fanfare of Adolescence ?                     Community score: 3.0              What is this?   There's a competitive, three-year horse racing academy that trains boys to become jockeys. Those who wish to enter must not only pass an academic test but a physical and fitness test as well. Yū Arimura is a former popular idol who becomes enamored with horse racing after seeing it for the first time, and wants to join the academy. Shun Kazanami was raised on an island, and only experienced horse races through radio broadcasts growing up. Amane comes from a high-class family in England, and his father is a former jockey. The show follows these three 15-year-old boys and others at the academy.    Fanfare of Adolescence is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                It's hard to believe we've gotten two such diametrically opposed sports anime in one day! While Love All Play was pure grounded realism, Fanfare of Adolescence leans to the opposite side of the spectrum, all high emotion and contrived drama. It stops just short of superpowers, although one of the characters does have a preternatural connection with horses. Which one is better depends pretty much entirely on your preferences, but I'm going to be real with you – neither is very good, albeit for different reasons.    Going in, I knew that one of the big challenges for Fanfare of Adolescence was going to be its animation. Horses are notoriously difficult to draw and even harder to animate, and modern anime have resorted to all kinds of shortcuts to get around this complication. They almost never look good and at times are even comically bad. But I figured, of course an anime about jockeying would figure something out! Recruit some talented animators who could draw their way around knobbly knees and long faces and bring some majesty to these beautiful creatures.    But then the first horse showed up and it was all awkward, uncanny CG and oh dear, this is not going to be a good-looking series at all, is it?    Not that it would be a good-looking show, even if Yuu's brain didn't explode into a LiSA Frank nightmare every time he thought about equids. There's a ton of bizarre camera angles, including shots of legs, crotch shots as characters cross their legs, and on-the-nose visual metaphors involving two paths going through the woods interrupted by visions of horses made out of cherry blossoms. No, seriously.    All of this is in favor of a supremely contrived plot. If Yuu has never been on a horse before, how the heck did he make it into jockey school? The script makes such a big deal about how hard the school is to get into, but is that just because of its standard entrance exam? Why is Waver Velvet one of his classmates? Why did cherry blossoms appear when Shun catches Yuu? Is this actually BL? Not that I'd be complaining if it was…    Fanfare of Adolescence operates on the same kind of logic as male idol shows, where nobody acts quite like a person and things happen just because rather than any kind of internal logic. It's silly, and while it should be a fun ride for the right kind of fan, I doubt it'll be a runaway success.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Sports anime often begin with someone being charmed by a sport they know nothing about and being driven to learn it. Fanfare of Adolescence takes this common framework and makes it about the lead singer of a popular teen boy band who decides to throw away his career and become a jockey. It's a convenient, if somewhat ridiculous, setup that makes him both hated by the serious jockey students and eager to prove himself. It's not great but it works well enough for a first episode—and it helps that the other students feel like people rather than walking tropes.    What really got my eyes rolling, however, was the back half of the episode. That these kids, who are “serious” about becoming jockeys, know nothing about horses is pure insanity and hurts me on a deeply personal level. Everything they do in this episode is wrong at best and life-threatening at worst. The scene of Yuu and Shun galloping double as they try to catch the reins of a panicking racehorse had me livid—and that's before it's revealed that neither had even gotten on a horse before. It's so ludicrously stupid that I can't help but wonder if the writers had ever even talked to a person who had any experience with riding a horse before. Then comes all the layers of metaphysical bullshit—i.e., ghost horses and listening to the sounds of nature—and this couldn't have rubbed me the wrong way more.    And yet, despite all that, I don't regret watching this episode. For all its misconceptions about horseback riding, it is a master class in direction. Nearly every shot in this episode is visually interesting. What could have been a normal scene of Yuu walking down the street is instead enhanced by showing him reflected through convex mirrors. Massive wide shots are used to show when he is lost, and moments of extreme emotion are effectively conveyed through close-ups on his mouth. And that's before we get into the breathtaking beauty of the surreal moments of the episode. At this point, if Makoto Katō directed an anime about buttering toast I'd watch it. Add in a score penned by Hiroyuki Sawano and I am left torn. Is it possible to watch an anime with a story you hate just because you love everything else about it? I don't know, but I have a sneaking suspicion I'm going to find out.        James Beckett  Rating:               I'm going to have to use one of my ADHD Passes on this one, y'all. I'm on my meds, I swear, and I even had a half-cup of strong coffee just before watching Fanfare of Adolescence. I closed any distracting tabs, I avoided Wikipedia and Twitter at all costs, and I even put my phone in the other room. Even with my best-laid precautions, though, I had to restart this premiere three times just to get through the first ten minutes. My brain simply would not entertain the notion of being able to focus on Fanfare of Adolescence for more than a minute or two before it started to wander, keen on occupying my time with literally anything else. Twice, right around the time that the Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up guide our hero Yu past The World's Most Obvious Visual Metaphor, I got up to do chores.    I'm not into horse jockeying, personally, but that doesn't mean that I'm going to automatically dismiss a show for having depicting subject matter that doesn't specifically cater to my interests. I care about ice skating about as much as I care about horse sports, and that didn't stop me from loving the hell out of Yuri!!! on Ice. The problem with Fanfare of Adolescence is not that it is about a niche sport. The show simply makes the same mistake that a lot of really specific sports and hobby shows make: It assumes that, so long as the main gimmick is covered and you've got a cast of vaguely handsome anime boys (and girl) to throw at the screen, the audience won't notice that you've completely forgotten to come up with a decent story.    We're talking about a main character who is throwing away the life of a professional pop idol and abandoning his fame to pursue a career as a horse jockey. How on Earth does a guy like that end up being the least interesting member of a cast that is comprised of other guys whose only defining features are their hair styles? When the hilariously sincere Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up, and I finally made it through to the second half of the episode, I was hoping I might at least get some kicks out of the show's unintentional camp factor, but no, we can't even trust a goofy acid-trip phantom to stick around long enough to keep things interesting.    Instead, once the not-drama of Yu's arrival at Horse School is over with, we're treated to the similarly terrifying Actual Living Horses that the boys (and gal) have to deal with, and I'll give Fanfare of Adolescence this much: Even if the CGI horses look really awkward, I was kind of excited to watch them get all spooked and run around a bunch. I knew it was too much to ask for one of them to legitimately kick one of the characters in the head, although my hopes were briefly raised when ol' Yu somehow got it in his head that he could win a game of chicken against a 600-pund behemoth with stones for feet. Still, if nothing else, the show about horse racing was kind enough to have the riders and horses actually do stuff for a bit, and that kept my brain distracted long enough for me to get through the rest of the premiere relatively unscathed.    I didn't hate Fanfare of Adolescence, but it's tone and style are diametrically opposed to my own sensibilities, and it's going to take a hell of a lot more than C-tier characters and cookie-cutter cliches to win me over. I'm sure it will be just the thing for some folks, though, which means that, with any luck. Psychedelic Ghost Horse may yet ride again.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Let me start with what I really admire about this first episode: at the prestigious jockey academy our hero quits being an idol to attend, the token girl student is allowed to wear pants. That's right, her uniform is exactly like the boys' and no one is treating her ambitions as less than the boys' – in fact, they're much kinder to Eri than they are to Yu, the aforementioned former idol. It would have been so easy to take the typical anime road here and tart up her uniform, and that they didn't inclined me to take this a bit more seriously than I otherwise might have.    Although the phantom horse made out of sakura petals that guides Yu to the correct path to school is a bit much. As are the band-uniform look of the instructors, and Shun's preternatural nature skills that enable him to read the wind, stand motionless in the bow of a boat going full speed, and perfectly ride a horse for the first time ever while chasing another, spooked horse. There's definitely some imbalance in this episode, and that takes away from its more grounded moments, like the very real garbage poor Yu is getting for deciding to do something with his life that no one expected, and the body language of the horses. (Their ears, specifically.) It's hard to tell how closely this is going to stick to the realities of learning to work with and ride horses professionally and how much odd metaphysical stuff is going to get in the way of that.    The premise isn't bad, though, and it's not hard to get behind Yu's desire to do something different with his life. We can simultaneously see how he's very good at putting on a public face and how draining that is for him; one of his strongest moments in this episode is when he tells off the reporters at the end, preferring to be addressed by his real name instead of his stage name. His classmates' mixed reactions to his presence is also decently handled; most of them don't quite know what to do with him, while one is visibly annoyed by his presence, possibly suspecting that this is all some sort of publicity stunt. As with most sports shows, there are a lot of named characters all thrown at us right off the bat, but they're at least nicely color-coded for those of us with no memory for names. I don't love the look of the show, mostly because (ears aside) there's something just a little off about the way the horses are drawn and animated. This feels like a very middle-of-the-road introductory episode, and I suspect that your enthusiasm for horses may determine if you decide to follow it.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This show was going to have an uphill battle with me from the start. Not because of the premise – I'm not big on horse racing, sure, but I like sports stories and animals, so a series about horse jockeys certainly could be cool. No, my problem was with the title: Fanfare of Adolescence sounds like a fake, joke anime you'd see in a real show. It's flowery as hell without actually telling you anything about the story or characters, and you could stick the name on damn near any high school drama anime and it would fit just fine. It's a bad name and they should feel bad about it.    The other issue it ran into early on is that I just don't care about our main character's big conflict in this premiere. Arimura may be a perfectly nice guy with some ridiculous Horse Sense, but when his whole struggle is that he's suddenly quit being a super popular idol to become a horse jockey, and every piece of conflict through this episode is about the media hounding him, it's just hard to relate to any of it. I don't care about how his orientation is awkward because of all the press, or how some of his classmates think he's just doing this for attention. I want to see some gosh dang horses, racing or at rest, and get an idea of how all these characters relate to the creatures they'll presumably be working with for the whole season. Get to that instead of prefacing it with all this showbiz drama.    Thankfully, things do pick up a bit once a random accident sets a couple of horses loose, and our freshman jockeys have to try and wrangle them. It's certainly cliché, and the way it actually happens is rather ridiculous, but it lets us actually see the interesting part of this premise for the final few minutes of the premiere, at least. It's not exactly stunning material – Arimura and his new buddy ride a horse together, rein in a second, and have a hilariously over-the-top shiptease moment to cap it off – but it's a conflict I wouldn't find in any other sports show airing this season. And while the CG on the horses leaves something to be desired, it at least looks alright in motion and manages to sell the speed of the whole thing. It's a serviceable presentation of why you'd want to watch this show instead of any given show about cute anime boys in high school, and I wish the rest of this premiere had been more like it.    In all, the premiere evens out to being just sorta ok. It's not terrible, though it is fairly dull until somebody actually mounts a horse. The biggest flaw is that for all the focus on Arimura's character he doesn't really have much discernible personality, and his co-star is instantly more engaging as some kind of Horse Savant. I may stick around just to see if they can manage to leave the idol plotline behind after this, but for now it's iffy.     discuss this in the forum (112 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature                The Best and Worst of Winter 2022   Apr  6, 10:10                 anime    With the last few episodes trailing into Spring like an April's fool, it's time to look at the final ranking of the Winter 2022 season.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Fanfare of Adolescence   Apr  3rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Fanfare of Adolescence ?                     Community score: 3.0              What is this?   There's a competitive, three-year horse racing academy that trains boys to become jockeys. Those who wish to enter must not only pass an academic test but a physical and fitness test as well. Yū Arimura is a former popular idol who becomes enamored with horse racing after seeing it for the first time, and wants to join the academy. Shun Kazanami was raised on an island, and only experienced horse races through radio broadcasts growing up. Amane comes from a high-class family in England, and his father is a former jockey. The show follows these three 15-year-old boys and others at the academy.    Fanfare of Adolescence is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                It's hard to believe we've gotten two such diametrically opposed sports anime in one day! While Love All Play was pure grounded realism, Fanfare of Adolescence leans to the opposite side of the spectrum, all high emotion and contrived drama. It stops just short of superpowers, although one of the characters does have a preternatural connection with horses. Which one is better depends pretty much entirely on your preferences, but I'm going to be real with you – neither is very good, albeit for different reasons.    Going in, I knew that one of the big challenges for Fanfare of Adolescence was going to be its animation. Horses are notoriously difficult to draw and even harder to animate, and modern anime have resorted to all kinds of shortcuts to get around this complication. They almost never look good and at times are even comically bad. But I figured, of course an anime about jockeying would figure something out! Recruit some talented animators who could draw their way around knobbly knees and long faces and bring some majesty to these beautiful creatures.    But then the first horse showed up and it was all awkward, uncanny CG and oh dear, this is not going to be a good-looking series at all, is it?    Not that it would be a good-looking show, even if Yuu's brain didn't explode into a LiSA Frank nightmare every time he thought about equids. There's a ton of bizarre camera angles, including shots of legs, crotch shots as characters cross their legs, and on-the-nose visual metaphors involving two paths going through the woods interrupted by visions of horses made out of cherry blossoms. No, seriously.    All of this is in favor of a supremely contrived plot. If Yuu has never been on a horse before, how the heck did he make it into jockey school? The script makes such a big deal about how hard the school is to get into, but is that just because of its standard entrance exam? Why is Waver Velvet one of his classmates? Why did cherry blossoms appear when Shun catches Yuu? Is this actually BL? Not that I'd be complaining if it was…    Fanfare of Adolescence operates on the same kind of logic as male idol shows, where nobody acts quite like a person and things happen just because rather than any kind of internal logic. It's silly, and while it should be a fun ride for the right kind of fan, I doubt it'll be a runaway success.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Sports anime often begin with someone being charmed by a sport they know nothing about and being driven to learn it. Fanfare of Adolescence takes this common framework and makes it about the lead singer of a popular teen boy band who decides to throw away his career and become a jockey. It's a convenient, if somewhat ridiculous, setup that makes him both hated by the serious jockey students and eager to prove himself. It's not great but it works well enough for a first episode—and it helps that the other students feel like people rather than walking tropes.    What really got my eyes rolling, however, was the back half of the episode. That these kids, who are “serious” about becoming jockeys, know nothing about horses is pure insanity and hurts me on a deeply personal level. Everything they do in this episode is wrong at best and life-threatening at worst. The scene of Yuu and Shun galloping double as they try to catch the reins of a panicking racehorse had me livid—and that's before it's revealed that neither had even gotten on a horse before. It's so ludicrously stupid that I can't help but wonder if the writers had ever even talked to a person who had any experience with riding a horse before. Then comes all the layers of metaphysical bullshit—i.e., ghost horses and listening to the sounds of nature—and this couldn't have rubbed me the wrong way more.    And yet, despite all that, I don't regret watching this episode. For all its misconceptions about horseback riding, it is a master class in direction. Nearly every shot in this episode is visually interesting. What could have been a normal scene of Yuu walking down the street is instead enhanced by showing him reflected through convex mirrors. Massive wide shots are used to show when he is lost, and moments of extreme emotion are effectively conveyed through close-ups on his mouth. And that's before we get into the breathtaking beauty of the surreal moments of the episode. At this point, if Makoto Katō directed an anime about buttering toast I'd watch it. Add in a score penned by Hiroyuki Sawano and I am left torn. Is it possible to watch an anime with a story you hate just because you love everything else about it? I don't know, but I have a sneaking suspicion I'm going to find out.        James Beckett  Rating:               I'm going to have to use one of my ADHD Passes on this one, y'all. I'm on my meds, I swear, and I even had a half-cup of strong coffee just before watching Fanfare of Adolescence. I closed any distracting tabs, I avoided Wikipedia and Twitter at all costs, and I even put my phone in the other room. Even with my best-laid precautions, though, I had to restart this premiere three times just to get through the first ten minutes. My brain simply would not entertain the notion of being able to focus on Fanfare of Adolescence for more than a minute or two before it started to wander, keen on occupying my time with literally anything else. Twice, right around the time that the Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up guide our hero Yu past The World's Most Obvious Visual Metaphor, I got up to do chores.    I'm not into horse jockeying, personally, but that doesn't mean that I'm going to automatically dismiss a show for having depicting subject matter that doesn't specifically cater to my interests. I care about ice skating about as much as I care about horse sports, and that didn't stop me from loving the hell out of Yuri!!! on Ice. The problem with Fanfare of Adolescence is not that it is about a niche sport. The show simply makes the same mistake that a lot of really specific sports and hobby shows make: It assumes that, so long as the main gimmick is covered and you've got a cast of vaguely handsome anime boys (and girl) to throw at the screen, the audience won't notice that you've completely forgotten to come up with a decent story.    We're talking about a main character who is throwing away the life of a professional pop idol and abandoning his fame to pursue a career as a horse jockey. How on Earth does a guy like that end up being the least interesting member of a cast that is comprised of other guys whose only defining features are their hair styles? When the hilariously sincere Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up, and I finally made it through to the second half of the episode, I was hoping I might at least get some kicks out of the show's unintentional camp factor, but no, we can't even trust a goofy acid-trip phantom to stick around long enough to keep things interesting.    Instead, once the not-drama of Yu's arrival at Horse School is over with, we're treated to the similarly terrifying Actual Living Horses that the boys (and gal) have to deal with, and I'll give Fanfare of Adolescence this much: Even if the CGI horses look really awkward, I was kind of excited to watch them get all spooked and run around a bunch. I knew it was too much to ask for one of them to legitimately kick one of the characters in the head, although my hopes were briefly raised when ol' Yu somehow got it in his head that he could win a game of chicken against a 600-pund behemoth with stones for feet. Still, if nothing else, the show about horse racing was kind enough to have the riders and horses actually do stuff for a bit, and that kept my brain distracted long enough for me to get through the rest of the premiere relatively unscathed.    I didn't hate Fanfare of Adolescence, but it's tone and style are diametrically opposed to my own sensibilities, and it's going to take a hell of a lot more than C-tier characters and cookie-cutter cliches to win me over. I'm sure it will be just the thing for some folks, though, which means that, with any luck. Psychedelic Ghost Horse may yet ride again.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Let me start with what I really admire about this first episode: at the prestigious jockey academy our hero quits being an idol to attend, the token girl student is allowed to wear pants. That's right, her uniform is exactly like the boys' and no one is treating her ambitions as less than the boys' – in fact, they're much kinder to Eri than they are to Yu, the aforementioned former idol. It would have been so easy to take the typical anime road here and tart up her uniform, and that they didn't inclined me to take this a bit more seriously than I otherwise might have.    Although the phantom horse made out of sakura petals that guides Yu to the correct path to school is a bit much. As are the band-uniform look of the instructors, and Shun's preternatural nature skills that enable him to read the wind, stand motionless in the bow of a boat going full speed, and perfectly ride a horse for the first time ever while chasing another, spooked horse. There's definitely some imbalance in this episode, and that takes away from its more grounded moments, like the very real garbage poor Yu is getting for deciding to do something with his life that no one expected, and the body language of the horses. (Their ears, specifically.) It's hard to tell how closely this is going to stick to the realities of learning to work with and ride horses professionally and how much odd metaphysical stuff is going to get in the way of that.    The premise isn't bad, though, and it's not hard to get behind Yu's desire to do something different with his life. We can simultaneously see how he's very good at putting on a public face and how draining that is for him; one of his strongest moments in this episode is when he tells off the reporters at the end, preferring to be addressed by his real name instead of his stage name. His classmates' mixed reactions to his presence is also decently handled; most of them don't quite know what to do with him, while one is visibly annoyed by his presence, possibly suspecting that this is all some sort of publicity stunt. As with most sports shows, there are a lot of named characters all thrown at us right off the bat, but they're at least nicely color-coded for those of us with no memory for names. I don't love the look of the show, mostly because (ears aside) there's something just a little off about the way the horses are drawn and animated. This feels like a very middle-of-the-road introductory episode, and I suspect that your enthusiasm for horses may determine if you decide to follow it.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This show was going to have an uphill battle with me from the start. Not because of the premise – I'm not big on horse racing, sure, but I like sports stories and animals, so a series about horse jockeys certainly could be cool. No, my problem was with the title: Fanfare of Adolescence sounds like a fake, joke anime you'd see in a real show. It's flowery as hell without actually telling you anything about the story or characters, and you could stick the name on damn near any high school drama anime and it would fit just fine. It's a bad name and they should feel bad about it.    The other issue it ran into early on is that I just don't care about our main character's big conflict in this premiere. Arimura may be a perfectly nice guy with some ridiculous Horse Sense, but when his whole struggle is that he's suddenly quit being a super popular idol to become a horse jockey, and every piece of conflict through this episode is about the media hounding him, it's just hard to relate to any of it. I don't care about how his orientation is awkward because of all the press, or how some of his classmates think he's just doing this for attention. I want to see some gosh dang horses, racing or at rest, and get an idea of how all these characters relate to the creatures they'll presumably be working with for the whole season. Get to that instead of prefacing it with all this showbiz drama.    Thankfully, things do pick up a bit once a random accident sets a couple of horses loose, and our freshman jockeys have to try and wrangle them. It's certainly cliché, and the way it actually happens is rather ridiculous, but it lets us actually see the interesting part of this premise for the final few minutes of the premiere, at least. It's not exactly stunning material – Arimura and his new buddy ride a horse together, rein in a second, and have a hilariously over-the-top shiptease moment to cap it off – but it's a conflict I wouldn't find in any other sports show airing this season. And while the CG on the horses leaves something to be desired, it at least looks alright in motion and manages to sell the speed of the whole thing. It's a serviceable presentation of why you'd want to watch this show instead of any given show about cute anime boys in high school, and I wish the rest of this premiere had been more like it.    In all, the premiere evens out to being just sorta ok. It's not terrible, though it is fairly dull until somebody actually mounts a horse. The biggest flaw is that for all the focus on Arimura's character he doesn't really have much discernible personality, and his co-star is instantly more engaging as some kind of Horse Savant. I may stick around just to see if they can manage to leave the idol plotline behind after this, but for now it's iffy.     discuss this in the forum (112 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature                The Best and Worst of Winter 2022   Apr  6, 10:10                 anime    With the last few episodes trailing into Spring like an April's fool, it's time to look at the final ranking of the Winter 2022 season.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Fanfare of Adolescence   Apr  3rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Fanfare of Adolescence ?                     Community score: 3.0              What is this?   There's a competitive, three-year horse racing academy that trains boys to become jockeys. Those who wish to enter must not only pass an academic test but a physical and fitness test as well. Yū Arimura is a former popular idol who becomes enamored with horse racing after seeing it for the first time, and wants to join the academy. Shun Kazanami was raised on an island, and only experienced horse races through radio broadcasts growing up. Amane comes from a high-class family in England, and his father is a former jockey. The show follows these three 15-year-old boys and others at the academy.    Fanfare of Adolescence is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                It's hard to believe we've gotten two such diametrically opposed sports anime in one day! While Love All Play was pure grounded realism, Fanfare of Adolescence leans to the opposite side of the spectrum, all high emotion and contrived drama. It stops just short of superpowers, although one of the characters does have a preternatural connection with horses. Which one is better depends pretty much entirely on your preferences, but I'm going to be real with you – neither is very good, albeit for different reasons.    Going in, I knew that one of the big challenges for Fanfare of Adolescence was going to be its animation. Horses are notoriously difficult to draw and even harder to animate, and modern anime have resorted to all kinds of shortcuts to get around this complication. They almost never look good and at times are even comically bad. But I figured, of course an anime about jockeying would figure something out! Recruit some talented animators who could draw their way around knobbly knees and long faces and bring some majesty to these beautiful creatures.    But then the first horse showed up and it was all awkward, uncanny CG and oh dear, this is not going to be a good-looking series at all, is it?    Not that it would be a good-looking show, even if Yuu's brain didn't explode into a LiSA Frank nightmare every time he thought about equids. There's a ton of bizarre camera angles, including shots of legs, crotch shots as characters cross their legs, and on-the-nose visual metaphors involving two paths going through the woods interrupted by visions of horses made out of cherry blossoms. No, seriously.    All of this is in favor of a supremely contrived plot. If Yuu has never been on a horse before, how the heck did he make it into jockey school? The script makes such a big deal about how hard the school is to get into, but is that just because of its standard entrance exam? Why is Waver Velvet one of his classmates? Why did cherry blossoms appear when Shun catches Yuu? Is this actually BL? Not that I'd be complaining if it was…    Fanfare of Adolescence operates on the same kind of logic as male idol shows, where nobody acts quite like a person and things happen just because rather than any kind of internal logic. It's silly, and while it should be a fun ride for the right kind of fan, I doubt it'll be a runaway success.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Sports anime often begin with someone being charmed by a sport they know nothing about and being driven to learn it. Fanfare of Adolescence takes this common framework and makes it about the lead singer of a popular teen boy band who decides to throw away his career and become a jockey. It's a convenient, if somewhat ridiculous, setup that makes him both hated by the serious jockey students and eager to prove himself. It's not great but it works well enough for a first episode—and it helps that the other students feel like people rather than walking tropes.    What really got my eyes rolling, however, was the back half of the episode. That these kids, who are “serious” about becoming jockeys, know nothing about horses is pure insanity and hurts me on a deeply personal level. Everything they do in this episode is wrong at best and life-threatening at worst. The scene of Yuu and Shun galloping double as they try to catch the reins of a panicking racehorse had me livid—and that's before it's revealed that neither had even gotten on a horse before. It's so ludicrously stupid that I can't help but wonder if the writers had ever even talked to a person who had any experience with riding a horse before. Then comes all the layers of metaphysical bullshit—i.e., ghost horses and listening to the sounds of nature—and this couldn't have rubbed me the wrong way more.    And yet, despite all that, I don't regret watching this episode. For all its misconceptions about horseback riding, it is a master class in direction. Nearly every shot in this episode is visually interesting. What could have been a normal scene of Yuu walking down the street is instead enhanced by showing him reflected through convex mirrors. Massive wide shots are used to show when he is lost, and moments of extreme emotion are effectively conveyed through close-ups on his mouth. And that's before we get into the breathtaking beauty of the surreal moments of the episode. At this point, if Makoto Katō directed an anime about buttering toast I'd watch it. Add in a score penned by Hiroyuki Sawano and I am left torn. Is it possible to watch an anime with a story you hate just because you love everything else about it? I don't know, but I have a sneaking suspicion I'm going to find out.        James Beckett  Rating:               I'm going to have to use one of my ADHD Passes on this one, y'all. I'm on my meds, I swear, and I even had a half-cup of strong coffee just before watching Fanfare of Adolescence. I closed any distracting tabs, I avoided Wikipedia and Twitter at all costs, and I even put my phone in the other room. Even with my best-laid precautions, though, I had to restart this premiere three times just to get through the first ten minutes. My brain simply would not entertain the notion of being able to focus on Fanfare of Adolescence for more than a minute or two before it started to wander, keen on occupying my time with literally anything else. Twice, right around the time that the Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up guide our hero Yu past The World's Most Obvious Visual Metaphor, I got up to do chores.    I'm not into horse jockeying, personally, but that doesn't mean that I'm going to automatically dismiss a show for having depicting subject matter that doesn't specifically cater to my interests. I care about ice skating about as much as I care about horse sports, and that didn't stop me from loving the hell out of Yuri!!! on Ice. The problem with Fanfare of Adolescence is not that it is about a niche sport. The show simply makes the same mistake that a lot of really specific sports and hobby shows make: It assumes that, so long as the main gimmick is covered and you've got a cast of vaguely handsome anime boys (and girl) to throw at the screen, the audience won't notice that you've completely forgotten to come up with a decent story.    We're talking about a main character who is throwing away the life of a professional pop idol and abandoning his fame to pursue a career as a horse jockey. How on Earth does a guy like that end up being the least interesting member of a cast that is comprised of other guys whose only defining features are their hair styles? When the hilariously sincere Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up, and I finally made it through to the second half of the episode, I was hoping I might at least get some kicks out of the show's unintentional camp factor, but no, we can't even trust a goofy acid-trip phantom to stick around long enough to keep things interesting.    Instead, once the not-drama of Yu's arrival at Horse School is over with, we're treated to the similarly terrifying Actual Living Horses that the boys (and gal) have to deal with, and I'll give Fanfare of Adolescence this much: Even if the CGI horses look really awkward, I was kind of excited to watch them get all spooked and run around a bunch. I knew it was too much to ask for one of them to legitimately kick one of the characters in the head, although my hopes were briefly raised when ol' Yu somehow got it in his head that he could win a game of chicken against a 600-pund behemoth with stones for feet. Still, if nothing else, the show about horse racing was kind enough to have the riders and horses actually do stuff for a bit, and that kept my brain distracted long enough for me to get through the rest of the premiere relatively unscathed.    I didn't hate Fanfare of Adolescence, but it's tone and style are diametrically opposed to my own sensibilities, and it's going to take a hell of a lot more than C-tier characters and cookie-cutter cliches to win me over. I'm sure it will be just the thing for some folks, though, which means that, with any luck. Psychedelic Ghost Horse may yet ride again.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Let me start with what I really admire about this first episode: at the prestigious jockey academy our hero quits being an idol to attend, the token girl student is allowed to wear pants. That's right, her uniform is exactly like the boys' and no one is treating her ambitions as less than the boys' – in fact, they're much kinder to Eri than they are to Yu, the aforementioned former idol. It would have been so easy to take the typical anime road here and tart up her uniform, and that they didn't inclined me to take this a bit more seriously than I otherwise might have.    Although the phantom horse made out of sakura petals that guides Yu to the correct path to school is a bit much. As are the band-uniform look of the instructors, and Shun's preternatural nature skills that enable him to read the wind, stand motionless in the bow of a boat going full speed, and perfectly ride a horse for the first time ever while chasing another, spooked horse. There's definitely some imbalance in this episode, and that takes away from its more grounded moments, like the very real garbage poor Yu is getting for deciding to do something with his life that no one expected, and the body language of the horses. (Their ears, specifically.) It's hard to tell how closely this is going to stick to the realities of learning to work with and ride horses professionally and how much odd metaphysical stuff is going to get in the way of that.    The premise isn't bad, though, and it's not hard to get behind Yu's desire to do something different with his life. We can simultaneously see how he's very good at putting on a public face and how draining that is for him; one of his strongest moments in this episode is when he tells off the reporters at the end, preferring to be addressed by his real name instead of his stage name. His classmates' mixed reactions to his presence is also decently handled; most of them don't quite know what to do with him, while one is visibly annoyed by his presence, possibly suspecting that this is all some sort of publicity stunt. As with most sports shows, there are a lot of named characters all thrown at us right off the bat, but they're at least nicely color-coded for those of us with no memory for names. I don't love the look of the show, mostly because (ears aside) there's something just a little off about the way the horses are drawn and animated. This feels like a very middle-of-the-road introductory episode, and I suspect that your enthusiasm for horses may determine if you decide to follow it.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This show was going to have an uphill battle with me from the start. Not because of the premise – I'm not big on horse racing, sure, but I like sports stories and animals, so a series about horse jockeys certainly could be cool. No, my problem was with the title: Fanfare of Adolescence sounds like a fake, joke anime you'd see in a real show. It's flowery as hell without actually telling you anything about the story or characters, and you could stick the name on damn near any high school drama anime and it would fit just fine. It's a bad name and they should feel bad about it.    The other issue it ran into early on is that I just don't care about our main character's big conflict in this premiere. Arimura may be a perfectly nice guy with some ridiculous Horse Sense, but when his whole struggle is that he's suddenly quit being a super popular idol to become a horse jockey, and every piece of conflict through this episode is about the media hounding him, it's just hard to relate to any of it. I don't care about how his orientation is awkward because of all the press, or how some of his classmates think he's just doing this for attention. I want to see some gosh dang horses, racing or at rest, and get an idea of how all these characters relate to the creatures they'll presumably be working with for the whole season. Get to that instead of prefacing it with all this showbiz drama.    Thankfully, things do pick up a bit once a random accident sets a couple of horses loose, and our freshman jockeys have to try and wrangle them. It's certainly cliché, and the way it actually happens is rather ridiculous, but it lets us actually see the interesting part of this premise for the final few minutes of the premiere, at least. It's not exactly stunning material – Arimura and his new buddy ride a horse together, rein in a second, and have a hilariously over-the-top shiptease moment to cap it off – but it's a conflict I wouldn't find in any other sports show airing this season. And while the CG on the horses leaves something to be desired, it at least looks alright in motion and manages to sell the speed of the whole thing. It's a serviceable presentation of why you'd want to watch this show instead of any given show about cute anime boys in high school, and I wish the rest of this premiere had been more like it.    In all, the premiere evens out to being just sorta ok. It's not terrible, though it is fairly dull until somebody actually mounts a horse. The biggest flaw is that for all the focus on Arimura's character he doesn't really have much discernible personality, and his co-star is instantly more engaging as some kind of Horse Savant. I may stick around just to see if they can manage to leave the idol plotline behind after this, but for now it's iffy.     discuss this in the forum (112 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature                The Best and Worst of Winter 2022   Apr  6, 10:10                 anime    With the last few episodes trailing into Spring like an April's fool, it's time to look at the final ranking of the Winter 2022 season.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Fanfare of Adolescence   Apr  3rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Fanfare of Adolescence ?                     Community score: 3.0              What is this?   There's a competitive, three-year horse racing academy that trains boys to become jockeys. Those who wish to enter must not only pass an academic test but a physical and fitness test as well. Yū Arimura is a former popular idol who becomes enamored with horse racing after seeing it for the first time, and wants to join the academy. Shun Kazanami was raised on an island, and only experienced horse races through radio broadcasts growing up. Amane comes from a high-class family in England, and his father is a former jockey. The show follows these three 15-year-old boys and others at the academy.    Fanfare of Adolescence is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                It's hard to believe we've gotten two such diametrically opposed sports anime in one day! While Love All Play was pure grounded realism, Fanfare of Adolescence leans to the opposite side of the spectrum, all high emotion and contrived drama. It stops just short of superpowers, although one of the characters does have a preternatural connection with horses. Which one is better depends pretty much entirely on your preferences, but I'm going to be real with you – neither is very good, albeit for different reasons.    Going in, I knew that one of the big challenges for Fanfare of Adolescence was going to be its animation. Horses are notoriously difficult to draw and even harder to animate, and modern anime have resorted to all kinds of shortcuts to get around this complication. They almost never look good and at times are even comically bad. But I figured, of course an anime about jockeying would figure something out! Recruit some talented animators who could draw their way around knobbly knees and long faces and bring some majesty to these beautiful creatures.    But then the first horse showed up and it was all awkward, uncanny CG and oh dear, this is not going to be a good-looking series at all, is it?    Not that it would be a good-looking show, even if Yuu's brain didn't explode into a LiSA Frank nightmare every time he thought about equids. There's a ton of bizarre camera angles, including shots of legs, crotch shots as characters cross their legs, and on-the-nose visual metaphors involving two paths going through the woods interrupted by visions of horses made out of cherry blossoms. No, seriously.    All of this is in favor of a supremely contrived plot. If Yuu has never been on a horse before, how the heck did he make it into jockey school? The script makes such a big deal about how hard the school is to get into, but is that just because of its standard entrance exam? Why is Waver Velvet one of his classmates? Why did cherry blossoms appear when Shun catches Yuu? Is this actually BL? Not that I'd be complaining if it was…    Fanfare of Adolescence operates on the same kind of logic as male idol shows, where nobody acts quite like a person and things happen just because rather than any kind of internal logic. It's silly, and while it should be a fun ride for the right kind of fan, I doubt it'll be a runaway success.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Sports anime often begin with someone being charmed by a sport they know nothing about and being driven to learn it. Fanfare of Adolescence takes this common framework and makes it about the lead singer of a popular teen boy band who decides to throw away his career and become a jockey. It's a convenient, if somewhat ridiculous, setup that makes him both hated by the serious jockey students and eager to prove himself. It's not great but it works well enough for a first episode—and it helps that the other students feel like people rather than walking tropes.    What really got my eyes rolling, however, was the back half of the episode. That these kids, who are “serious” about becoming jockeys, know nothing about horses is pure insanity and hurts me on a deeply personal level. Everything they do in this episode is wrong at best and life-threatening at worst. The scene of Yuu and Shun galloping double as they try to catch the reins of a panicking racehorse had me livid—and that's before it's revealed that neither had even gotten on a horse before. It's so ludicrously stupid that I can't help but wonder if the writers had ever even talked to a person who had any experience with riding a horse before. Then comes all the layers of metaphysical bullshit—i.e., ghost horses and listening to the sounds of nature—and this couldn't have rubbed me the wrong way more.    And yet, despite all that, I don't regret watching this episode. For all its misconceptions about horseback riding, it is a master class in direction. Nearly every shot in this episode is visually interesting. What could have been a normal scene of Yuu walking down the street is instead enhanced by showing him reflected through convex mirrors. Massive wide shots are used to show when he is lost, and moments of extreme emotion are effectively conveyed through close-ups on his mouth. And that's before we get into the breathtaking beauty of the surreal moments of the episode. At this point, if Makoto Katō directed an anime about buttering toast I'd watch it. Add in a score penned by Hiroyuki Sawano and I am left torn. Is it possible to watch an anime with a story you hate just because you love everything else about it? I don't know, but I have a sneaking suspicion I'm going to find out.        James Beckett  Rating:               I'm going to have to use one of my ADHD Passes on this one, y'all. I'm on my meds, I swear, and I even had a half-cup of strong coffee just before watching Fanfare of Adolescence. I closed any distracting tabs, I avoided Wikipedia and Twitter at all costs, and I even put my phone in the other room. Even with my best-laid precautions, though, I had to restart this premiere three times just to get through the first ten minutes. My brain simply would not entertain the notion of being able to focus on Fanfare of Adolescence for more than a minute or two before it started to wander, keen on occupying my time with literally anything else. Twice, right around the time that the Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up guide our hero Yu past The World's Most Obvious Visual Metaphor, I got up to do chores.    I'm not into horse jockeying, personally, but that doesn't mean that I'm going to automatically dismiss a show for having depicting subject matter that doesn't specifically cater to my interests. I care about ice skating about as much as I care about horse sports, and that didn't stop me from loving the hell out of Yuri!!! on Ice. The problem with Fanfare of Adolescence is not that it is about a niche sport. The show simply makes the same mistake that a lot of really specific sports and hobby shows make: It assumes that, so long as the main gimmick is covered and you've got a cast of vaguely handsome anime boys (and girl) to throw at the screen, the audience won't notice that you've completely forgotten to come up with a decent story.    We're talking about a main character who is throwing away the life of a professional pop idol and abandoning his fame to pursue a career as a horse jockey. How on Earth does a guy like that end up being the least interesting member of a cast that is comprised of other guys whose only defining features are their hair styles? When the hilariously sincere Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up, and I finally made it through to the second half of the episode, I was hoping I might at least get some kicks out of the show's unintentional camp factor, but no, we can't even trust a goofy acid-trip phantom to stick around long enough to keep things interesting.    Instead, once the not-drama of Yu's arrival at Horse School is over with, we're treated to the similarly terrifying Actual Living Horses that the boys (and gal) have to deal with, and I'll give Fanfare of Adolescence this much: Even if the CGI horses look really awkward, I was kind of excited to watch them get all spooked and run around a bunch. I knew it was too much to ask for one of them to legitimately kick one of the characters in the head, although my hopes were briefly raised when ol' Yu somehow got it in his head that he could win a game of chicken against a 600-pund behemoth with stones for feet. Still, if nothing else, the show about horse racing was kind enough to have the riders and horses actually do stuff for a bit, and that kept my brain distracted long enough for me to get through the rest of the premiere relatively unscathed.    I didn't hate Fanfare of Adolescence, but it's tone and style are diametrically opposed to my own sensibilities, and it's going to take a hell of a lot more than C-tier characters and cookie-cutter cliches to win me over. I'm sure it will be just the thing for some folks, though, which means that, with any luck. Psychedelic Ghost Horse may yet ride again.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Fanfare of Adolescence   Apr  3rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Fanfare of Adolescence ?                     Community score: 3.0              What is this?   There's a competitive, three-year horse racing academy that trains boys to become jockeys. Those who wish to enter must not only pass an academic test but a physical and fitness test as well. Yū Arimura is a former popular idol who becomes enamored with horse racing after seeing it for the first time, and wants to join the academy. Shun Kazanami was raised on an island, and only experienced horse races through radio broadcasts growing up. Amane comes from a high-class family in England, and his father is a former jockey. The show follows these three 15-year-old boys and others at the academy.    Fanfare of Adolescence is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                It's hard to believe we've gotten two such diametrically opposed sports anime in one day! While Love All Play was pure grounded realism, Fanfare of Adolescence leans to the opposite side of the spectrum, all high emotion and contrived drama. It stops just short of superpowers, although one of the characters does have a preternatural connection with horses. Which one is better depends pretty much entirely on your preferences, but I'm going to be real with you – neither is very good, albeit for different reasons.    Going in, I knew that one of the big challenges for Fanfare of Adolescence was going to be its animation. Horses are notoriously difficult to draw and even harder to animate, and modern anime have resorted to all kinds of shortcuts to get around this complication. They almost never look good and at times are even comically bad. But I figured, of course an anime about jockeying would figure something out! Recruit some talented animators who could draw their way around knobbly knees and long faces and bring some majesty to these beautiful creatures.    But then the first horse showed up and it was all awkward, uncanny CG and oh dear, this is not going to be a good-looking series at all, is it?    Not that it would be a good-looking show, even if Yuu's brain didn't explode into a LiSA Frank nightmare every time he thought about equids. There's a ton of bizarre camera angles, including shots of legs, crotch shots as characters cross their legs, and on-the-nose visual metaphors involving two paths going through the woods interrupted by visions of horses made out of cherry blossoms. No, seriously.    All of this is in favor of a supremely contrived plot. If Yuu has never been on a horse before, how the heck did he make it into jockey school? The script makes such a big deal about how hard the school is to get into, but is that just because of its standard entrance exam? Why is Waver Velvet one of his classmates? Why did cherry blossoms appear when Shun catches Yuu? Is this actually BL? Not that I'd be complaining if it was…    Fanfare of Adolescence operates on the same kind of logic as male idol shows, where nobody acts quite like a person and things happen just because rather than any kind of internal logic. It's silly, and while it should be a fun ride for the right kind of fan, I doubt it'll be a runaway success.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Sports anime often begin with someone being charmed by a sport they know nothing about and being driven to learn it. Fanfare of Adolescence takes this common framework and makes it about the lead singer of a popular teen boy band who decides to throw away his career and become a jockey. It's a convenient, if somewhat ridiculous, setup that makes him both hated by the serious jockey students and eager to prove himself. It's not great but it works well enough for a first episode—and it helps that the other students feel like people rather than walking tropes.    What really got my eyes rolling, however, was the back half of the episode. That these kids, who are “serious” about becoming jockeys, know nothing about horses is pure insanity and hurts me on a deeply personal level. Everything they do in this episode is wrong at best and life-threatening at worst. The scene of Yuu and Shun galloping double as they try to catch the reins of a panicking racehorse had me livid—and that's before it's revealed that neither had even gotten on a horse before. It's so ludicrously stupid that I can't help but wonder if the writers had ever even talked to a person who had any experience with riding a horse before. Then comes all the layers of metaphysical bullshit—i.e., ghost horses and listening to the sounds of nature—and this couldn't have rubbed me the wrong way more.    And yet, despite all that, I don't regret watching this episode. For all its misconceptions about horseback riding, it is a master class in direction. Nearly every shot in this episode is visually interesting. What could have been a normal scene of Yuu walking down the street is instead enhanced by showing him reflected through convex mirrors. Massive wide shots are used to show when he is lost, and moments of extreme emotion are effectively conveyed through close-ups on his mouth. And that's before we get into the breathtaking beauty of the surreal moments of the episode. At this point, if Makoto Katō directed an anime about buttering toast I'd watch it. Add in a score penned by Hiroyuki Sawano and I am left torn. Is it possible to watch an anime with a story you hate just because you love everything else about it? I don't know, but I have a sneaking suspicion I'm going to find out.        James Beckett  Rating:               I'm going to have to use one of my ADHD Passes on this one, y'all. I'm on my meds, I swear, and I even had a half-cup of strong coffee just before watching Fanfare of Adolescence. I closed any distracting tabs, I avoided Wikipedia and Twitter at all costs, and I even put my phone in the other room. Even with my best-laid precautions, though, I had to restart this premiere three times just to get through the first ten minutes. My brain simply would not entertain the notion of being able to focus on Fanfare of Adolescence for more than a minute or two before it started to wander, keen on occupying my time with literally anything else. Twice, right around the time that the Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up guide our hero Yu past The World's Most Obvious Visual Metaphor, I got up to do chores.    I'm not into horse jockeying, personally, but that doesn't mean that I'm going to automatically dismiss a show for having depicting subject matter that doesn't specifically cater to my interests. I care about ice skating about as much as I care about horse sports, and that didn't stop me from loving the hell out of Yuri!!! on Ice. The problem with Fanfare of Adolescence is not that it is about a niche sport. The show simply makes the same mistake that a lot of really specific sports and hobby shows make: It assumes that, so long as the main gimmick is covered and you've got a cast of vaguely handsome anime boys (and girl) to throw at the screen, the audience won't notice that you've completely forgotten to come up with a decent story.    We're talking about a main character who is throwing away the life of a professional pop idol and abandoning his fame to pursue a career as a horse jockey. How on Earth does a guy like that end up being the least interesting member of a cast that is comprised of other guys whose only defining features are their hair styles? When the hilariously sincere Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up, and I finally made it through to the second half of the episode, I was hoping I might at least get some kicks out of the show's unintentional camp factor, but no, we can't even trust a goofy acid-trip phantom to stick around long enough to keep things interesting.    Instead, once the not-drama of Yu's arrival at Horse School is over with, we're treated to the similarly terrifying Actual Living Horses that the boys (and gal) have to deal with, and I'll give Fanfare of Adolescence this much: Even if the CGI horses look really awkward, I was kind of excited to watch them get all spooked and run around a bunch. I knew it was too much to ask for one of them to legitimately kick one of the characters in the head, although my hopes were briefly raised when ol' Yu somehow got it in his head that he could win a game of chicken against a 600-pund behemoth with stones for feet. Still, if nothing else, the show about horse racing was kind enough to have the riders and horses actually do stuff for a bit, and that kept my brain distracted long enough for me to get through the rest of the premiere relatively unscathed.    I didn't hate Fanfare of Adolescence, but it's tone and style are diametrically opposed to my own sensibilities, and it's going to take a hell of a lot more than C-tier characters and cookie-cutter cliches to win me over. I'm sure it will be just the thing for some folks, though, which means that, with any luck. Psychedelic Ghost Horse may yet ride again.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Let me start with what I really admire about this first episode: at the prestigious jockey academy our hero quits being an idol to attend, the token girl student is allowed to wear pants. That's right, her uniform is exactly like the boys' and no one is treating her ambitions as less than the boys' – in fact, they're much kinder to Eri than they are to Yu, the aforementioned former idol. It would have been so easy to take the typical anime road here and tart up her uniform, and that they didn't inclined me to take this a bit more seriously than I otherwise might have.    Although the phantom horse made out of sakura petals that guides Yu to the correct path to school is a bit much. As are the band-uniform look of the instructors, and Shun's preternatural nature skills that enable him to read the wind, stand motionless in the bow of a boat going full speed, and perfectly ride a horse for the first time ever while chasing another, spooked horse. There's definitely some imbalance in this episode, and that takes away from its more grounded moments, like the very real garbage poor Yu is getting for deciding to do something with his life that no one expected, and the body language of the horses. (Their ears, specifically.) It's hard to tell how closely this is going to stick to the realities of learning to work with and ride horses professionally and how much odd metaphysical stuff is going to get in the way of that.    The premise isn't bad, though, and it's not hard to get behind Yu's desire to do something different with his life. We can simultaneously see how he's very good at putting on a public face and how draining that is for him; one of his strongest moments in this episode is when he tells off the reporters at the end, preferring to be addressed by his real name instead of his stage name. His classmates' mixed reactions to his presence is also decently handled; most of them don't quite know what to do with him, while one is visibly annoyed by his presence, possibly suspecting that this is all some sort of publicity stunt. As with most sports shows, there are a lot of named characters all thrown at us right off the bat, but they're at least nicely color-coded for those of us with no memory for names. I don't love the look of the show, mostly because (ears aside) there's something just a little off about the way the horses are drawn and animated. This feels like a very middle-of-the-road introductory episode, and I suspect that your enthusiasm for horses may determine if you decide to follow it.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This show was going to have an uphill battle with me from the start. Not because of the premise – I'm not big on horse racing, sure, but I like sports stories and animals, so a series about horse jockeys certainly could be cool. No, my problem was with the title: Fanfare of Adolescence sounds like a fake, joke anime you'd see in a real show. It's flowery as hell without actually telling you anything about the story or characters, and you could stick the name on damn near any high school drama anime and it would fit just fine. It's a bad name and they should feel bad about it.    The other issue it ran into early on is that I just don't care about our main character's big conflict in this premiere. Arimura may be a perfectly nice guy with some ridiculous Horse Sense, but when his whole struggle is that he's suddenly quit being a super popular idol to become a horse jockey, and every piece of conflict through this episode is about the media hounding him, it's just hard to relate to any of it. I don't care about how his orientation is awkward because of all the press, or how some of his classmates think he's just doing this for attention. I want to see some gosh dang horses, racing or at rest, and get an idea of how all these characters relate to the creatures they'll presumably be working with for the whole season. Get to that instead of prefacing it with all this showbiz drama.    Thankfully, things do pick up a bit once a random accident sets a couple of horses loose, and our freshman jockeys have to try and wrangle them. It's certainly cliché, and the way it actually happens is rather ridiculous, but it lets us actually see the interesting part of this premise for the final few minutes of the premiere, at least. It's not exactly stunning material – Arimura and his new buddy ride a horse together, rein in a second, and have a hilariously over-the-top shiptease moment to cap it off – but it's a conflict I wouldn't find in any other sports show airing this season. And while the CG on the horses leaves something to be desired, it at least looks alright in motion and manages to sell the speed of the whole thing. It's a serviceable presentation of why you'd want to watch this show instead of any given show about cute anime boys in high school, and I wish the rest of this premiere had been more like it.    In all, the premiere evens out to being just sorta ok. It's not terrible, though it is fairly dull until somebody actually mounts a horse. The biggest flaw is that for all the focus on Arimura's character he doesn't really have much discernible personality, and his co-star is instantly more engaging as some kind of Horse Savant. I may stick around just to see if they can manage to leave the idol plotline behind after this, but for now it's iffy.     discuss this in the forum (112 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,{}

The show follows these three 15-year-old boys and others at the academy.    Fanfare of Adolescence is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                It's hard to believe we've gotten two such diametrically opposed sports anime in one day! While Love All Play was pure grounded realism, Fanfare of Adolescence leans to the opposite side of the spectrum, all high emotion and contrived drama. It stops just short of superpowers, although one of the characters does have a preternatural connection with horses. Which one is better depends pretty much entirely on your preferences, but I'm going to be real with you – neither is very good, albeit for different reasons.    Going in, I knew that one of the big challenges for Fanfare of Adolescence was going to be its animation. Horses are notoriously difficult to draw and even harder to animate, and modern anime have resorted to all kinds of shortcuts to get around this complication. They almost never look good and at times are even comically bad. But I figured, of course an anime about jockeying would figure something out! Recruit some talented animators who could draw their way around knobbly knees and long faces and bring some majesty to these beautiful creatures.    But then the first horse showed up and it was all awkward, uncanny CG and oh dear, this is not going to be a good-looking series at all, is it?    Not that it would be a good-looking show, even if Yuu's brain didn't explode into a LiSA Frank nightmare every time he thought about equids. There's a ton of bizarre camera angles, including shots of legs, crotch shots as characters cross their legs, and on-the-nose visual metaphors involving two paths going through the woods interrupted by visions of horses made out of cherry blossoms. No, seriously.    All of this is in favor of a supremely contrived plot. If Yuu has never been on a horse before, how the heck did he make it into jockey school? The script makes such a big deal about how hard the school is to get into, but is that just because of its standard entrance exam? Why is Waver Velvet one of his classmates? Why did cherry blossoms appear when Shun catches Yuu? Is this actually BL? Not that I'd be complaining if it was…    Fanfare of Adolescence operates on the same kind of logic as male idol shows, where nobody acts quite like a person and things happen just because rather than any kind of internal logic. It's silly, and while it should be a fun ride for the right kind of fan, I doubt it'll be a runaway success.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Sports anime often begin with someone being charmed by a sport they know nothing about and being driven to learn it. Fanfare of Adolescence takes this common framework and makes it about the lead singer of a popular teen boy band who decides to throw away his career and become a jockey. It's a convenient, if somewhat ridiculous, setup that makes him both hated by the serious jockey students and eager to prove himself. It's not great but it works well enough for a first episode—and it helps that the other students feel like people rather than walking tropes.    What really got my eyes rolling, however, was the back half of the episode. That these kids, who are “serious” about becoming jockeys, know nothing about horses is pure insanity and hurts me on a deeply personal level. Everything they do in this episode is wrong at best and life-threatening at worst. The scene of Yuu and Shun galloping double as they try to catch the reins of a panicking racehorse had me livid—and that's before it's revealed that neither had even gotten on a horse before. It's so ludicrously stupid that I can't help but wonder if the writers had ever even talked to a person who had any experience with riding a horse before. Then comes all the layers of metaphysical bullshit—i.e., ghost horses and listening to the sounds of nature—and this couldn't have rubbed me the wrong way more.    And yet, despite all that, I don't regret watching this episode. For all its misconceptions about horseback riding, it is a master class in direction. Nearly every shot in this episode is visually interesting. What could have been a normal scene of Yuu walking down the street is instead enhanced by showing him reflected through convex mirrors. Massive wide shots are used to show when he is lost, and moments of extreme emotion are effectively conveyed through close-ups on his mouth. And that's before we get into the breathtaking beauty of the surreal moments of the episode. At this point, if Makoto Katō directed an anime about buttering toast I'd watch it. Add in a score penned by Hiroyuki Sawano and I am left torn. Is it possible to watch an anime with a story you hate just because you love everything else about it? I don't know, but I have a sneaking suspicion I'm going to find out.        James Beckett  Rating:               I'm going to have to use one of my ADHD Passes on this one, y'all. I'm on my meds, I swear, and I even had a half-cup of strong coffee just before watching Fanfare of Adolescence. I closed any distracting tabs, I avoided Wikipedia and Twitter at all costs, and I even put my phone in the other room. Even with my best-laid precautions, though, I had to restart this premiere three times just to get through the first ten minutes. My brain simply would not entertain the notion of being able to focus on Fanfare of Adolescence for more than a minute or two before it started to wander, keen on occupying my time with literally anything else. Twice, right around the time that the Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up guide our hero Yu past The World's Most Obvious Visual Metaphor, I got up to do chores.    I'm not into horse jockeying, personally, but that doesn't mean that I'm going to automatically dismiss a show for having depicting subject matter that doesn't specifically cater to my interests. I care about ice skating about as much as I care about horse sports, and that didn't stop me from loving the hell out of Yuri!!! on Ice. The problem with Fanfare of Adolescence is not that it is about a niche sport. The show simply makes the same mistake that a lot of really specific sports and hobby shows make: It assumes that, so long as the main gimmick is covered and you've got a cast of vaguely handsome anime boys (and girl) to throw at the screen, the audience won't notice that you've completely forgotten to come up with a decent story.    We're talking about a main character who is throwing away the life of a professional pop idol and abandoning his fame to pursue a career as a horse jockey. How on Earth does a guy like that end up being the least interesting member of a cast that is comprised of other guys whose only defining features are their hair styles? When the hilariously sincere Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up, and I finally made it through to the second half of the episode, I was hoping I might at least get some kicks out of the show's unintentional camp factor, but no, we can't even trust a goofy acid-trip phantom to stick around long enough to keep things interesting.    Instead, once the not-drama of Yu's arrival at Horse School is over with, we're treated to the similarly terrifying Actual Living Horses that the boys (and gal) have to deal with, and I'll give Fanfare of Adolescence this much: Even if the CGI horses look really awkward, I was kind of excited to watch them get all spooked and run around a bunch. I knew it was too much to ask for one of them to legitimately kick one of the characters in the head, although my hopes were briefly raised when ol' Yu somehow got it in his head that he could win a game of chicken against a 600-pund behemoth with stones for feet. Still, if nothing else, the show about horse racing was kind enough to have the riders and horses actually do stuff for a bit, and that kept my brain distracted long enough for me to get through the rest of the premiere relatively unscathed.    I didn't hate Fanfare of Adolescence, but it's tone and style are diametrically opposed to my own sensibilities, and it's going to take a hell of a lot more than C-tier characters and cookie-cutter cliches to win me over. I'm sure it will be just the thing for some folks, though, which means that, with any luck. Psychedelic Ghost Horse may yet ride again.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Let me start with what I really admire about this first episode: at the prestigious jockey academy our hero quits being an idol to attend, the token girl student is allowed to wear pants. That's right, her uniform is exactly like the boys' and no one is treating her ambitions as less than the boys' – in fact, they're much kinder to Eri than they are to Yu, the aforementioned former idol. It would have been so easy to take the typical anime road here and tart up her uniform, and that they didn't inclined me to take this a bit more seriously than I otherwise might have.    Although the phantom horse made out of sakura petals that guides Yu to the correct path to school is a bit much. As are the band-uniform look of the instructors, and Shun's preternatural nature skills that enable him to read the wind, stand motionless in the bow of a boat going full speed, and perfectly ride a horse for the first time ever while chasing another, spooked horse. There's definitely some imbalance in this episode, and that takes away from its more grounded moments, like the very real garbage poor Yu is getting for deciding to do something with his life that no one expected, and the body language of the horses. (Their ears, specifically.) It's hard to tell how closely this is going to stick to the realities of learning to work with and ride horses professionally and how much odd metaphysical stuff is going to get in the way of that.    The premise isn't bad, though, and it's not hard to get behind Yu's desire to do something different with his life. We can simultaneously see how he's very good at putting on a public face and how draining that is for him; one of his strongest moments in this episode is when he tells off the reporters at the end, preferring to be addressed by his real name instead of his stage name. His classmates' mixed reactions to his presence is also decently handled; most of them don't quite know what to do with him, while one is visibly annoyed by his presence, possibly suspecting that this is all some sort of publicity stunt. As with most sports shows, there are a lot of named characters all thrown at us right off the bat, but they're at least nicely color-coded for those of us with no memory for names. I don't love the look of the show, mostly because (ears aside) there's something just a little off about the way the horses are drawn and animated. This feels like a very middle-of-the-road introductory episode, and I suspect that your enthusiasm for horses may determine if you decide to follow it.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This show was going to have an uphill battle with me from the start. Not because of the premise – I'm not big on horse racing, sure, but I like sports stories and animals, so a series about horse jockeys certainly could be cool. No, my problem was with the title: Fanfare of Adolescence sounds like a fake, joke anime you'd see in a real show. It's flowery as hell without actually telling you anything about the story or characters, and you could stick the name on damn near any high school drama anime and it would fit just fine. It's a bad name and they should feel bad about it.    The other issue it ran into early on is that I just don't care about our main character's big conflict in this premiere. Arimura may be a perfectly nice guy with some ridiculous Horse Sense, but when his whole struggle is that he's suddenly quit being a super popular idol to become a horse jockey, and every piece of conflict through this episode is about the media hounding him, it's just hard to relate to any of it. I don't care about how his orientation is awkward because of all the press, or how some of his classmates think he's just doing this for attention. I want to see some gosh dang horses, racing or at rest, and get an idea of how all these characters relate to the creatures they'll presumably be working with for the whole season. Get to that instead of prefacing it with all this showbiz drama.    Thankfully, things do pick up a bit once a random accident sets a couple of horses loose, and our freshman jockeys have to try and wrangle them. It's certainly cliché, and the way it actually happens is rather ridiculous, but it lets us actually see the interesting part of this premise for the final few minutes of the premiere, at least. It's not exactly stunning material – Arimura and his new buddy ride a horse together, rein in a second, and have a hilariously over-the-top shiptease moment to cap it off – but it's a conflict I wouldn't find in any other sports show airing this season. And while the CG on the horses leaves something to be desired, it at least looks alright in motion and manages to sell the speed of the whole thing. It's a serviceable presentation of why you'd want to watch this show instead of any given show about cute anime boys in high school, and I wish the rest of this premiere had been more like it.    In all, the premiere evens out to being just sorta ok. It's not terrible, though it is fairly dull until somebody actually mounts a horse. The biggest flaw is that for all the focus on Arimura's character he doesn't really have much discernible personality, and his co-star is instantly more engaging as some kind of Horse Savant. I may stick around just to see if they can manage to leave the idol plotline behind after this, but for now it's iffy.     discuss this in the forum (112 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives      ",positive,en,{}

Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Sports anime often begin with someone being charmed by a sport they know nothing about and being driven to learn it. Fanfare of Adolescence takes this common framework and makes it about the lead singer of a popular teen boy band who decides to throw away his career and become a jockey. It's a convenient, if somewhat ridiculous, setup that makes him both hated by the serious jockey students and eager to prove himself. It's not great but it works well enough for a first episode—and it helps that the other students feel like people rather than walking tropes.    What really got my eyes rolling, however, was the back half of the episode. That these kids, who are “serious” about becoming jockeys, know nothing about horses is pure insanity and hurts me on a deeply personal level. Everything they do in this episode is wrong at best and life-threatening at worst. The scene of Yuu and Shun galloping double as they try to catch the reins of a panicking racehorse had me livid—and that's before it's revealed that neither had even gotten on a horse before. It's so ludicrously stupid that I can't help but wonder if the writers had ever even talked to a person who had any experience with riding a horse before. Then comes all the layers of metaphysical bullshit—i.e., ghost horses and listening to the sounds of nature—and this couldn't have rubbed me the wrong way more.    And yet, despite all that, I don't regret watching this episode. For all its misconceptions about horseback riding, it is a master class in direction. Nearly every shot in this episode is visually interesting. What could have been a normal scene of Yuu walking down the street is instead enhanced by showing him reflected through convex mirrors. Massive wide shots are used to show when he is lost, and moments of extreme emotion are effectively conveyed through close-ups on his mouth. And that's before we get into the breathtaking beauty of the surreal moments of the episode. At this point, if Makoto Katō directed an anime about buttering toast I'd watch it. Add in a score penned by Hiroyuki Sawano and I am left torn. Is it possible to watch an anime with a story you hate just because you love everything else about it? I don't know, but I have a sneaking suspicion I'm going to find out.        James Beckett  Rating:               I'm going to have to use one of my ADHD Passes on this one, y'all. I'm on my meds, I swear, and I even had a half-cup of strong coffee just before watching Fanfare of Adolescence. I closed any distracting tabs, I avoided Wikipedia and Twitter at all costs, and I even put my phone in the other room. Even with my best-laid precautions, though, I had to restart this premiere three times just to get through the first ten minutes. My brain simply would not entertain the notion of being able to focus on Fanfare of Adolescence for more than a minute or two before it started to wander, keen on occupying my time with literally anything else. Twice, right around the time that the Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up guide our hero Yu past The World's Most Obvious Visual Metaphor, I got up to do chores.    I'm not into horse jockeying, personally, but that doesn't mean that I'm going to automatically dismiss a show for having depicting subject matter that doesn't specifically cater to my interests. I care about ice skating about as much as I care about horse sports, and that didn't stop me from loving the hell out of Yuri!!! on Ice. The problem with Fanfare of Adolescence is not that it is about a niche sport. The show simply makes the same mistake that a lot of really specific sports and hobby shows make: It assumes that, so long as the main gimmick is covered and you've got a cast of vaguely handsome anime boys (and girl) to throw at the screen, the audience won't notice that you've completely forgotten to come up with a decent story.    We're talking about a main character who is throwing away the life of a professional pop idol and abandoning his fame to pursue a career as a horse jockey. How on Earth does a guy like that end up being the least interesting member of a cast that is comprised of other guys whose only defining features are their hair styles? When the hilariously sincere Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up, and I finally made it through to the second half of the episode, I was hoping I might at least get some kicks out of the show's unintentional camp factor, but no, we can't even trust a goofy acid-trip phantom to stick around long enough to keep things interesting.    Instead, once the not-drama of Yu's arrival at Horse School is over with, we're treated to the similarly terrifying Actual Living Horses that the boys (and gal) have to deal with, and I'll give Fanfare of Adolescence this much: Even if the CGI horses look really awkward, I was kind of excited to watch them get all spooked and run around a bunch. I knew it was too much to ask for one of them to legitimately kick one of the characters in the head, although my hopes were briefly raised when ol' Yu somehow got it in his head that he could win a game of chicken against a 600-pund behemoth with stones for feet. Still, if nothing else, the show about horse racing was kind enough to have the riders and horses actually do stuff for a bit, and that kept my brain distracted long enough for me to get through the rest of the premiere relatively unscathed.    I didn't hate Fanfare of Adolescence, but it's tone and style are diametrically opposed to my own sensibilities, and it's going to take a hell of a lot more than C-tier characters and cookie-cutter cliches to win me over. I'm sure it will be just the thing for some folks, though, which means that, with any luck. Psychedelic Ghost Horse may yet ride again.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Let me start with what I really admire about this first episode: at the prestigious jockey academy our hero quits being an idol to attend, the token girl student is allowed to wear pants. That's right, her uniform is exactly like the boys' and no one is treating her ambitions as less than the boys' – in fact, they're much kinder to Eri than they are to Yu, the aforementioned former idol. It would have been so easy to take the typical anime road here and tart up her uniform, and that they didn't inclined me to take this a bit more seriously than I otherwise might have.    Although the phantom horse made out of sakura petals that guides Yu to the correct path to school is a bit much. As are the band-uniform look of the instructors, and Shun's preternatural nature skills that enable him to read the wind, stand motionless in the bow of a boat going full speed, and perfectly ride a horse for the first time ever while chasing another, spooked horse. There's definitely some imbalance in this episode, and that takes away from its more grounded moments, like the very real garbage poor Yu is getting for deciding to do something with his life that no one expected, and the body language of the horses. (Their ears, specifically.) It's hard to tell how closely this is going to stick to the realities of learning to work with and ride horses professionally and how much odd metaphysical stuff is going to get in the way of that.    The premise isn't bad, though, and it's not hard to get behind Yu's desire to do something different with his life. We can simultaneously see how he's very good at putting on a public face and how draining that is for him; one of his strongest moments in this episode is when he tells off the reporters at the end, preferring to be addressed by his real name instead of his stage name. His classmates' mixed reactions to his presence is also decently handled; most of them don't quite know what to do with him, while one is visibly annoyed by his presence, possibly suspecting that this is all some sort of publicity stunt. As with most sports shows, there are a lot of named characters all thrown at us right off the bat, but they're at least nicely color-coded for those of us with no memory for names. I don't love the look of the show, mostly because (ears aside) there's something just a little off about the way the horses are drawn and animated. This feels like a very middle-of-the-road introductory episode, and I suspect that your enthusiasm for horses may determine if you decide to follow it.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This show was going to have an uphill battle with me from the start. Not because of the premise – I'm not big on horse racing, sure, but I like sports stories and animals, so a series about horse jockeys certainly could be cool. No, my problem was with the title: Fanfare of Adolescence sounds like a fake, joke anime you'd see in a real show. It's flowery as hell without actually telling you anything about the story or characters, and you could stick the name on damn near any high school drama anime and it would fit just fine. It's a bad name and they should feel bad about it.    The other issue it ran into early on is that I just don't care about our main character's big conflict in this premiere. Arimura may be a perfectly nice guy with some ridiculous Horse Sense, but when his whole struggle is that he's suddenly quit being a super popular idol to become a horse jockey, and every piece of conflict through this episode is about the media hounding him, it's just hard to relate to any of it. I don't care about how his orientation is awkward because of all the press, or how some of his classmates think he's just doing this for attention. I want to see some gosh dang horses, racing or at rest, and get an idea of how all these characters relate to the creatures they'll presumably be working with for the whole season. Get to that instead of prefacing it with all this showbiz drama.    Thankfully, things do pick up a bit once a random accident sets a couple of horses loose, and our freshman jockeys have to try and wrangle them. It's certainly cliché, and the way it actually happens is rather ridiculous, but it lets us actually see the interesting part of this premise for the final few minutes of the premiere, at least. It's not exactly stunning material – Arimura and his new buddy ride a horse together, rein in a second, and have a hilariously over-the-top shiptease moment to cap it off – but it's a conflict I wouldn't find in any other sports show airing this season. And while the CG on the horses leaves something to be desired, it at least looks alright in motion and manages to sell the speed of the whole thing. It's a serviceable presentation of why you'd want to watch this show instead of any given show about cute anime boys in high school, and I wish the rest of this premiere had been more like it.    In all, the premiere evens out to being just sorta ok. It's not terrible, though it is fairly dull until somebody actually mounts a horse. The biggest flaw is that for all the focus on Arimura's character he doesn't really have much discernible personality, and his co-star is instantly more engaging as some kind of Horse Savant. I may stick around just to see if they can manage to leave the idol plotline behind after this, but for now it's iffy.     discuss this in the forum (112 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives    ",positive,en,{}

Community score: 3.0              What is this?   There's a competitive, three-year horse racing academy that trains boys to become jockeys. Those who wish to enter must not only pass an academic test but a physical and fitness test as well. Yū Arimura is a former popular idol who becomes enamored with horse racing after seeing it for the first time, and wants to join the academy. Shun Kazanami was raised on an island, and only experienced horse races through radio broadcasts growing up. Amane comes from a high-class family in England, and his father is a former jockey. The show follows these three 15-year-old boys and others at the academy.    Fanfare of Adolescence is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                It's hard to believe we've gotten two such diametrically opposed sports anime in one day! While Love All Play was pure grounded realism, Fanfare of Adolescence leans to the opposite side of the spectrum, all high emotion and contrived drama. It stops just short of superpowers, although one of the characters does have a preternatural connection with horses. Which one is better depends pretty much entirely on your preferences, but I'm going to be real with you – neither is very good, albeit for different reasons.    Going in, I knew that one of the big challenges for Fanfare of Adolescence was going to be its animation. Horses are notoriously difficult to draw and even harder to animate, and modern anime have resorted to all kinds of shortcuts to get around this complication. They almost never look good and at times are even comically bad. But I figured, of course an anime about jockeying would figure something out! Recruit some talented animators who could draw their way around knobbly knees and long faces and bring some majesty to these beautiful creatures.    But then the first horse showed up and it was all awkward, uncanny CG and oh dear, this is not going to be a good-looking series at all, is it?    Not that it would be a good-looking show, even if Yuu's brain didn't explode into a LiSA Frank nightmare every time he thought about equids. There's a ton of bizarre camera angles, including shots of legs, crotch shots as characters cross their legs, and on-the-nose visual metaphors involving two paths going through the woods interrupted by visions of horses made out of cherry blossoms. No, seriously.    All of this is in favor of a supremely contrived plot. If Yuu has never been on a horse before, how the heck did he make it into jockey school? The script makes such a big deal about how hard the school is to get into, but is that just because of its standard entrance exam? Why is Waver Velvet one of his classmates? Why did cherry blossoms appear when Shun catches Yuu? Is this actually BL? Not that I'd be complaining if it was…    Fanfare of Adolescence operates on the same kind of logic as male idol shows, where nobody acts quite like a person and things happen just because rather than any kind of internal logic.

My brain simply would not entertain the notion of being able to focus on Fanfare of Adolescence for more than a minute or two before it started to wander, keen on occupying my time with literally anything else. Twice, right around the time that the Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up guide our hero Yu past The World's Most Obvious Visual Metaphor, I got up to do chores.    I'm not into horse jockeying, personally, but that doesn't mean that I'm going to automatically dismiss a show for having depicting subject matter that doesn't specifically cater to my interests. I care about ice skating about as much as I care about horse sports, and that didn't stop me from loving the hell out of Yuri!!! on Ice. The problem with Fanfare of Adolescence is not that it is about a niche sport. The show simply makes the same mistake that a lot of really specific sports and hobby shows make: It assumes that, so long as the main gimmick is covered and you've got a cast of vaguely handsome anime boys (and girl) to throw at the screen, the audience won't notice that you've completely forgotten to come up with a decent story.    We're talking about a main character who is throwing away the life of a professional pop idol and abandoning his fame to pursue a career as a horse jockey. How on Earth does a guy like that end up being the least interesting member of a cast that is comprised of other guys whose only defining features are their hair styles? When the hilariously sincere Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up, and I finally made it through to the second half of the episode, I was hoping I might at least get some kicks out of the show's unintentional camp factor, but no, we can't even trust a goofy acid-trip phantom to stick around long enough to keep things interesting.    Instead, once the not-drama of Yu's arrival at Horse School is over with, we're treated to the similarly terrifying Actual Living Horses that the boys (and gal) have to deal with, and I'll give Fanfare of Adolescence this much: Even if the CGI horses look really awkward, I was kind of excited to watch them get all spooked and run around a bunch. I knew it was too much to ask for one of them to legitimately kick one of the characters in the head, although my hopes were briefly raised when ol' Yu somehow got it in his head that he could win a game of chicken against a 600-pund behemoth with stones for feet. Still, if nothing else, the show about horse racing was kind enough to have the riders and horses actually do stuff for a bit, and that kept my brain distracted long enough for me to get through the rest of the premiere relatively unscathed.    I didn't hate Fanfare of Adolescence, but it's tone and style are diametrically opposed to my own sensibilities, and it's going to take a hell of a lot more than C-tier characters and cookie-cutter cliches to win me over. I'm sure it will be just the thing for some folks, though, which means that, with any luck. Psychedelic Ghost Horse may yet ride again.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Let me start with what I really admire about this first episode: at the prestigious jockey academy our hero quits being an idol to attend, the token girl student is allowed to wear pants. That's right, her uniform is exactly like the boys' and no one is treating her ambitions as less than the boys' – in fact, they're much kinder to Eri than they are to Yu, the aforementioned former idol. It would have been so easy to take the typical anime road here and tart up her uniform, and that they didn't inclined me to take this a bit more seriously than I otherwise might have.    Although the phantom horse made out of sakura petals that guides Yu to the correct path to school is a bit much. As are the band-uniform look of the instructors, and Shun's preternatural nature skills that enable him to read the wind, stand motionless in the bow of a boat going full speed, and perfectly ride a horse for the first time ever while chasing another, spooked horse. There's definitely some imbalance in this episode, and that takes away from its more grounded moments, like the very real garbage poor Yu is getting for deciding to do something with his life that no one expected, and the body language of the horses. (Their ears, specifically.) It's hard to tell how closely this is going to stick to the realities of learning to work with and ride horses professionally and how much odd metaphysical stuff is going to get in the way of that.    The premise isn't bad, though, and it's not hard to get behind Yu's desire to do something different with his life. We can simultaneously see how he's very good at putting on a public face and how draining that is for him; one of his strongest moments in this episode is when he tells off the reporters at the end, preferring to be addressed by his real name instead of his stage name. His classmates' mixed reactions to his presence is also decently handled; most of them don't quite know what to do with him, while one is visibly annoyed by his presence, possibly suspecting that this is all some sort of publicity stunt. As with most sports shows, there are a lot of named characters all thrown at us right off the bat, but they're at least nicely color-coded for those of us with no memory for names. I don't love the look of the show, mostly because (ears aside) there's something just a little off about the way the horses are drawn and animated. This feels like a very middle-of-the-road introductory episode, and I suspect that your enthusiasm for horses may determine if you decide to follow it.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This show was going to have an uphill battle with me from the start. Not because of the premise – I'm not big on horse racing, sure, but I like sports stories and animals, so a series about horse jockeys certainly could be cool. No, my problem was with the title: Fanfare of Adolescence sounds like a fake, joke anime you'd see in a real show. It's flowery as hell without actually telling you anything about the story or characters, and you could stick the name on damn near any high school drama anime and it would fit just fine. It's a bad name and they should feel bad about it.    The other issue it ran into early on is that I just don't care about our main character's big conflict in this premiere. Arimura may be a perfectly nice guy with some ridiculous Horse Sense, but when his whole struggle is that he's suddenly quit being a super popular idol to become a horse jockey, and every piece of conflict through this episode is about the media hounding him, it's just hard to relate to any of it. I don't care about how his orientation is awkward because of all the press, or how some of his classmates think he's just doing this for attention. I want to see some gosh dang horses, racing or at rest, and get an idea of how all these characters relate to the creatures they'll presumably be working with for the whole season. Get to that instead of prefacing it with all this showbiz drama.    Thankfully, things do pick up a bit once a random accident sets a couple of horses loose, and our freshman jockeys have to try and wrangle them. It's certainly cliché, and the way it actually happens is rather ridiculous, but it lets us actually see the interesting part of this premise for the final few minutes of the premiere, at least. It's not exactly stunning material – Arimura and his new buddy ride a horse together, rein in a second, and have a hilariously over-the-top shiptease moment to cap it off – but it's a conflict I wouldn't find in any other sports show airing this season. And while the CG on the horses leaves something to be desired, it at least looks alright in motion and manages to sell the speed of the whole thing. It's a serviceable presentation of why you'd want to watch this show instead of any given show about cute anime boys in high school, and I wish the rest of this premiere had been more like it.    In all, the premiere evens out to being just sorta ok. It's not terrible, though it is fairly dull until somebody actually mounts a horse. The biggest flaw is that for all the focus on Arimura's character he doesn't really have much discernible personality, and his co-star is instantly more engaging as some kind of Horse Savant. I may stick around just to see if they can manage to leave the idol plotline behind after this, but for now it's iffy.   ",positive,en,{}
06-04-2022,anime,12,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/preview-guide/2022/spring/fanfare-of-adolescence/.183511,Fanfare of Adolescence - The Spring 2022 Preview Guide - Anime News Network:SEA,"            How would you rate episode 1 of Fanfare of Adolescence ?                     Community score: 3.0              What is this?   There's a competitive, three-year horse racing academy that trains boys to become jockeys. Those who wish to enter must not only pass an academic test but a physical and fitness test as well. Yū Arimura is a former popular idol who becomes enamored with horse racing after seeing it for the first time, and wants to join the academy. Shun Kazanami was raised on an island, and only experienced horse races through radio broadcasts growing up. Amane comes from a high-class family in England, and his father is a former jockey. The show follows these three 15-year-old boys and others at the academy.    Fanfare of Adolescence is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                It's hard to believe we've gotten two such diametrically opposed sports anime in one day! While Love All Play was pure grounded realism, Fanfare of Adolescence leans to the opposite side of the spectrum, all high emotion and contrived drama. It stops just short of superpowers, although one of the characters does have a preternatural connection with horses. Which one is better depends pretty much entirely on your preferences, but I'm going to be real with you – neither is very good, albeit for different reasons.    Going in, I knew that one of the big challenges for Fanfare of Adolescence was going to be its animation. Horses are notoriously difficult to draw and even harder to animate, and modern anime have resorted to all kinds of shortcuts to get around this complication. They almost never look good and at times are even comically bad. But I figured, of course an anime about jockeying would figure something out! Recruit some talented animators who could draw their way around knobbly knees and long faces and bring some majesty to these beautiful creatures.    But then the first horse showed up and it was all awkward, uncanny CG and oh dear, this is not going to be a good-looking series at all, is it?    Not that it would be a good-looking show, even if Yuu's brain didn't explode into a LiSA Frank nightmare every time he thought about equids. There's a ton of bizarre camera angles, including shots of legs, crotch shots as characters cross their legs, and on-the-nose visual metaphors involving two paths going through the woods interrupted by visions of horses made out of cherry blossoms. No, seriously.    All of this is in favor of a supremely contrived plot. If Yuu has never been on a horse before, how the heck did he make it into jockey school? The script makes such a big deal about how hard the school is to get into, but is that just because of its standard entrance exam? Why is Waver Velvet one of his classmates? Why did cherry blossoms appear when Shun catches Yuu? Is this actually BL? Not that I'd be complaining if it was…    Fanfare of Adolescence operates on the same kind of logic as male idol shows, where nobody acts quite like a person and things happen just because rather than any kind of internal logic. It's silly, and while it should be a fun ride for the right kind of fan, I doubt it'll be a runaway success.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Sports anime often begin with someone being charmed by a sport they know nothing about and being driven to learn it. Fanfare of Adolescence takes this common framework and makes it about the lead singer of a popular teen boy band who decides to throw away his career and become a jockey. It's a convenient, if somewhat ridiculous, setup that makes him both hated by the serious jockey students and eager to prove himself. It's not great but it works well enough for a first episode—and it helps that the other students feel like people rather than walking tropes.    What really got my eyes rolling, however, was the back half of the episode. That these kids, who are “serious” about becoming jockeys, know nothing about horses is pure insanity and hurts me on a deeply personal level. Everything they do in this episode is wrong at best and life-threatening at worst. The scene of Yuu and Shun galloping double as they try to catch the reins of a panicking racehorse had me livid—and that's before it's revealed that neither had even gotten on a horse before. It's so ludicrously stupid that I can't help but wonder if the writers had ever even talked to a person who had any experience with riding a horse before. Then comes all the layers of metaphysical bullshit—i.e., ghost horses and listening to the sounds of nature—and this couldn't have rubbed me the wrong way more.    And yet, despite all that, I don't regret watching this episode. For all its misconceptions about horseback riding, it is a master class in direction. Nearly every shot in this episode is visually interesting. What could have been a normal scene of Yuu walking down the street is instead enhanced by showing him reflected through convex mirrors. Massive wide shots are used to show when he is lost, and moments of extreme emotion are effectively conveyed through close-ups on his mouth. And that's before we get into the breathtaking beauty of the surreal moments of the episode. At this point, if Makoto Katō directed an anime about buttering toast I'd watch it. Add in a score penned by Hiroyuki Sawano and I am left torn. Is it possible to watch an anime with a story you hate just because you love everything else about it? I don't know, but I have a sneaking suspicion I'm going to find out.        James Beckett  Rating:               I'm going to have to use one of my ADHD Passes on this one, y'all. I'm on my meds, I swear, and I even had a half-cup of strong coffee just before watching Fanfare of Adolescence. I closed any distracting tabs, I avoided Wikipedia and Twitter at all costs, and I even put my phone in the other room. Even with my best-laid precautions, though, I had to restart this premiere three times just to get through the first ten minutes.

Life with an Ordinary Guy Who Reincarnated into a Total Fantasy Knockout Episode 12  by Nicholas Dupree, Mar 31st 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Fantasy Bishōjo Juniku Ojisan to ?                     Community score: 4.1            My god they actually did it. No, they didn't commit to Tachibana and Jinguuji as a trashboi OTP, but for the first time in possibly the entire show, they actually let our central couple have a sincere moment of connection and vulnerability. And they even managed to extricate that annoying brainwashing part without it getting in the way of the important stuff! Good on ya, show.    Though my (incredibly biased) favorite part of this finale is definitely Schwartz von Lichtenstein Lohengramm of all people having to be the emotionally mature adult in the situation, and straight-up tell Jinguuji that there's nothing wrong or shameful about showing he cares about Tachibana. This boy may be a dipstick in SAO cosplay, but even he knows that It's important to tell your friends how much they mean to you, because otherwise they'll never know. You know you've got some serious emotional hang-ups when a chuuni high-schooler is your relationship counselor.    It's a good thing Jinguuji regains his super strength here, because it turns out he's got a whole airport of baggage he's been carrying around. We'd seen bits and pieces of his past and a less-than-happy family life, but here we see just how deep that all burrowed. He was raised not just in a strict and traditional household, but one that sought to stomp out any perceived weakness or vulnerability in Jinguuji as a child, teaching him that relying on others was shameful, and to remain stoic no matter what. It's a toxic mindset that he only barely escaped thanks to Tachibana's friendship, but it's left him all but incapable of being emotionally honest or vulnerable with anyone. But with the help of Love Doctor Schwartz, and with his only real friendship on the line, he's finally able to open up.    By which I mean he opens up the entire Hoover Dam and floods millions of metric tons of emotions on Tachibana all at once. It's astounding just how long his Friendship Rant goes on without pause, and even more impressive that it so masterfully straddles the line between sincere sentiment and the sardonic humor the show is built upon. You really do get the sense that all the little quirks to Tachibana's personality, from mundane things like how he likes animals, to how much he considers others around him, are important enough to Jinguuji that he's got them all committed to memory. The romantic subtext there is obvious to everyone except Jinguuji himself, but of course we can't actually resolve that, so instead Tachibana just blushes into another dimension at the onslaught of affection. Thus their initial game of Gay Chicken is back in full force, ready to drive both these idiots crazy until they finally admit their feelings.    It's a great punchline to go out on, and only slightly hampered by the need to stretch out the denouement to lead into a potential second season. Not that I'd be unhappy if a sequel happened – one of my biggest disappointments with the show is how its extended cast has largely been left by the wayside, so the idea of Yggie and the other characters all venturing out on their own journeys with the promise of encountering our heroes again is a good one. I'd just prefer if the show hadn't spent quite so long on what amounts to “and their adventures continued!” coda.    On the whole though, Total Fantasy Knockout has been a fun time. It's had its weaker episodes and clunky jokes, but at its best this series could be a crass and loud blast.  I just wish it had been at its best more often than it was, because there are a couple episodes that are total riots, balancing the various characters and punchlines perfectly, while more than a few averaged out to “okay” after meandering around with weak gags for far too long. As it stands it's still a solid comedy, and one of the more entertaining isekai of this season, but I can't give it a particularly strong recommendation. I can, however, hope it does well enough that they actually give us a full Schwartz spin-off.

Life with an Ordinary Guy Who Reincarnated into a Total Fantasy Knockout Episode 12  by Nicholas Dupree, Mar 31st 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Fantasy Bishōjo Juniku Ojisan to ?                     Community score: 4.1            My god they actually did it. No, they didn't commit to Tachibana and Jinguuji as a trashboi OTP, but for the first time in possibly the entire show, they actually let our central couple have a sincere moment of connection and vulnerability. And they even managed to extricate that annoying brainwashing part without it getting in the way of the important stuff! Good on ya, show.    Though my (incredibly biased) favorite part of this finale is definitely Schwartz von Lichtenstein Lohengramm of all people having to be the emotionally mature adult in the situation, and straight-up tell Jinguuji that there's nothing wrong or shameful about showing he cares about Tachibana. This boy may be a dipstick in SAO cosplay, but even he knows that It's important to tell your friends how much they mean to you, because otherwise they'll never know. You know you've got some serious emotional hang-ups when a chuuni high-schooler is your relationship counselor.    It's a good thing Jinguuji regains his super strength here, because it turns out he's got a whole airport of baggage he's been carrying around. We'd seen bits and pieces of his past and a less-than-happy family life, but here we see just how deep that all burrowed. He was raised not just in a strict and traditional household, but one that sought to stomp out any perceived weakness or vulnerability in Jinguuji as a child, teaching him that relying on others was shameful, and to remain stoic no matter what. It's a toxic mindset that he only barely escaped thanks to Tachibana's friendship, but it's left him all but incapable of being emotionally honest or vulnerable with anyone. But with the help of Love Doctor Schwartz, and with his only real friendship on the line, he's finally able to open up.    By which I mean he opens up the entire Hoover Dam and floods millions of metric tons of emotions on Tachibana all at once. It's astounding just how long his Friendship Rant goes on without pause, and even more impressive that it so masterfully straddles the line between sincere sentiment and the sardonic humor the show is built upon. You really do get the sense that all the little quirks to Tachibana's personality, from mundane things like how he likes animals, to how much he considers others around him, are important enough to Jinguuji that he's got them all committed to memory. The romantic subtext there is obvious to everyone except Jinguuji himself, but of course we can't actually resolve that, so instead Tachibana just blushes into another dimension at the onslaught of affection. Thus their initial game of Gay Chicken is back in full force, ready to drive both these idiots crazy until they finally admit their feelings.    It's a great punchline to go out on, and only slightly hampered by the need to stretch out the denouement to lead into a potential second season. Not that I'd be unhappy if a sequel happened – one of my biggest disappointments with the show is how its extended cast has largely been left by the wayside, so the idea of Yggie and the other characters all venturing out on their own journeys with the promise of encountering our heroes again is a good one. I'd just prefer if the show hadn't spent quite so long on what amounts to “and their adventures continued!” coda.    On the whole though, Total Fantasy Knockout has been a fun time. It's had its weaker episodes and clunky jokes, but at its best this series could be a crass and loud blast.  I just wish it had been at its best more often than it was, because there are a couple episodes that are total riots, balancing the various characters and punchlines perfectly, while more than a few averaged out to “okay” after meandering around with weak gags for far too long. As it stands it's still a solid comedy, and one of the more entertaining isekai of this season, but I can't give it a particularly strong recommendation. I can, however, hope it does well enough that they actually give us a full Schwartz spin-off.

What will you do with your time in Rigbarth? ― It's a little hard to talk about the Story of Seasons games (and their Rune Factory spin-offs). Not because of the complicated legal snarl involving the Story of Seasons and Harvest Moon branding, but because on the merits that most games woul...                    game review          2 comments       Chocobo GP   Mar 18, 00:00 2 comments                 games    Chocobo GP is a big improvement and an even greater risk. It's sharper, tighter, more enjoyable...and now competing directly with the latest Mario Kart on Nintendo's home turf. ― The original Chocobo Racing was not an astounding game, but it was a cleverly-positioned one. It offered the PlayStation owners of 1999 an answer to the Nintendo 64's Mario Kart while dusting itself with Final Fantasy refere...                           game review          8 comments       Persona 4 Arena Ultimax Review   Mar 11, 01:21 8 comments                 games    Now that Persona 4 Arena Ultimax is out on modern platforms with a massive adoption rate, the question is how much is in here for a single-playing Persona? The answer is an inspiring ""Quite a bit!"" ― The rerelease of 2014's Persona 4 Arena Ultimax finds itself in an odd situation for such a thing. The fighting game scene has ballooned into an even bigger, better place in the eight years since, so put...                    game review          1 comment       Jujutsu Kaisen: Escape From the Cursed Spirit of the Abandoned School   Feb 26, 01:00 1 comment                 games    Gojo assigns you to a mission to help the first-year students investigate a creepy abandoned school. Can you and the others use your techniques -- and your smarts -- to exorcise the cursed spirit before it's too late? ― When you think of an anime world you would want to live in, Jujutsu Kaisen probably isn't at the top of your list, if it is even on the list. But it's possible you've dreamed of going...                    game review          1 comment       Atelier Sophie 2: Alchemist of the Mysterious Dream   Feb 24, 22:00 1 comment                 games    The Nintendo Switch struggles to handle this new entry in the Atelier franchise, but beyond its technical issues the world of Erde Wiege introduces players to characters that quickly come to feel like longtime friends. ― There are three things I've come to expect from the Atelier series: cozy atmosphere, charming character writing, and breezy combat. The series is content to dwell within that realm, ...                    game review          6 comments       The King of Fighters XV   Feb 24, 01:00 6 comments                 games    The King of Fighters XV doesn't find the series at its prettiest, boldest, or most densely populated and varied in characters. Yet this might be the most accessible it's ever been. ― If anyone ever asks you how many The King of Fighters games there are, resist the temptation to say fifteen. That may be the number on this latest flagship entry, but this is a vast and complicated series with many, many...                    game review          25 comments       REVIEW: Pokémon Legends: Arceus   Feb 20, 01:00 25 comments                 games    While the plot left much to be desired, Pokémon Legends: Arceus brings new energy and possibilities to the franchise. ― For years, it seems the big ask of Pokémon fans has been that the franchise innovate itself in a meaningful way. Pokémon Legends: Arceus seems to be Game Freak's response to that request, and I'd go out on a limb to say that it's exactly the sort of thing we've been waiting for. It ...                    game review          21 comments       Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl   Jan 18, 01:20 21 comments                 games    As a fan, it pains me to see an entry to one of my favorite franchises fall to such low lows. But what exactly are the decisions that got us here? ― Unlike animation, video games are in large part a disposable medium. Games once hailed as era-defining breakthrough titles upon their release often become antiquated and awkward within a little less than a decade. And so we see a plethora of remakes and ...                    game review          3 comments       Clockwork Aquario   Dec 17, 04:00 3 comments                 games    The arcade game Clockwork Aquario finally arrives on modern systems after disappearing twenty-eight years ago. Is it a mere relic or a true deep-cut gem? ― Some games are delayed. Others are canceled. And then there's the unique and bizarre journey of Clockwork Aquario. Westone, creators of the Wonder Boy and Monster World games, tested this colorful side-scroller in arcades several times back in 199...                    game review          3 comments       Metallic Child   Dec 14, 01:00 3 comments                 games    Metallic Child's narrative is instantly compelling and the dialogue that accompanies its characters is entertaining to boot. ― I initially wasn't expecting much from this quietly released indie “rouge-lite” game, but found myself sad to see it go by the time I reached its ending. The greatest appeal of Metallic Child comes from the way it applies the aesthetics of the Japanese Action-RPGs without hol...                    game review          8 comments       Cupid Parasite   Dec  7, 01:00 8 comments                 games    A game with this many strengths is easy to recommend, which is why it's unfortunate that the current game is ridden with typos, ill-fitting text, and the telltale signs of a hastily edited machine translation. ― Cupid Parasite opens with some of the trashiest male love interests you could possibly imagine. One guy is exclusively interested in meeting women who are already ""taken."" Another literally c...                    game review          7 comments       Danganronpa Decadence   Nov 30, 02:00 7 comments                 games    Danganronpa Decadence offers a bit of new content, gameplay, and interactions between cast members, but this little something extra hardly feels decadent. ― Over ten years ago, the first Danganronpa game came out on the PlayStation Portable. Even back then, Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc was a standout of the visual novel genre, combining detective work and dating sim elements in a way that weirdly...                    game review          16 comments       Shin Megami Tensei V   Nov  5, 01:00 16 comments                 games    While SMT fans have no doubt chomped at the bit in anticipation of a new numbered entry arriving on consoles, some might still want to cling to the memory of Nocturne. Is this new, untested Shin Megami Tensei worth the plunge? ― Shin Megami Tensei V has one glaring problem it has to contend with: Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne HD Remaster was released just this past May. While SMT fans have no doub...                    game review          11 comments       Metroid Dread   Oct 28, 00:00 11 comments                 games    The gameplay of Dread is similarly spectacular. A lot of the DNA from Samus Returns – Mercury Steam's first Metroid project – is present here, albeit with the fat shaved off the bones. ― Before diving into the meat of this review, I feel it's important to mention that it is coming from a newcomer to the series, and that I ran some short stints into Metroid: Zero Mission and Fusion in order to lend so...                    game review          2 comments       Demon Slayer: The Hinokami Chronicles   Oct 14, 00:04 2 comments                 games    Being one of the most acclaimed anime of the past few years partially due to its stellar animation and fight scenes, a Demon Slayer fighting game felt like it was only a matter of time. ― Being one of the most acclaimed anime of the past few years partially due to its stellar animation and fight scenes, a Demon Slayer fighting game felt like it was only a matter of time.

Its aesthetically varied character designs, lewd but narratively significant fanservice (think Darling in the Franxx), and twistedly i...                    game review          3 comments       Samurai Warriors 5   Aug 12, 03:00 3 comments                 games    The most creatively bankrupt aspect of Samurai Warriors 5 is by and large its combat. ― While I've called Dynasty Warrior's gameplay recipe outdated before, the franchise has gone out of its way to prove me wrong recently, with games like Age of Calamity and Persona 5 Strikers exceeding my expectations. These games have their own unique mechanics that add some much-needed depth to Warrior's combat wh...                    game review          4 comments       Shadowverse: Champion's Battle   Aug 10, 21:00 4 comments                 games    Take on the role of Hiro Ryugasaki as you engage in card duels to save your school club! ― Coming straight from Cygames, Shadowverse: Champion's Battle is a story-based adaptation of the collectible card game app. You play as a youth who meets up with Hiro Ryugasaki, protagonist of the Shadowverse anime, and joins Tensei Academy's Shadowverse club. It seems the club is suffering from a lack of member...                    game review          10 comments       Fuga: Melodies of Steel   Aug  4, 00:00 10 comments                 games    It's a challenge to take on a brutal World War II retelling with imagery and characters cute enough to populate Maple Town, but CyberConnect2 sticks with it, and it's paid off. ― Cyberconnect2 is best known as the developer of gorgeous anime-to-game adaptations stretching from Naruto and .hack to JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. In their heart of hearts, however, company president/CEO Hiroshi Matsuyama and ...                    game review          4 comments       NEO: The World Ends With You   Jul 27, 01:00 4 comments                 games    Well, it took fourteen years, but NEO: The World Ends with You is finally here, and it's every bit as stylish, engrossing, and outright fun as its predecessor. ― When the original The World Ends with You launched all the way back in 2007 on the Nintendo DS, it won attention and praise for its unorthodox storytelling and gameplay. It used many of the features of the Nintendo DS in experimental ways an...                    game review          4 comments       Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin   Jul 25, 00:00 4 comments                 games    It's easy to say that Monster Hunter Stories 2 provided the most enjoyable gameplay experience I've had within the genre in recent years. ― The monster-collecting genre might be one of the most criminally under-represented in gaming. Aside from the Pokémon games and the steady trickle of indie projects inspired by that franchise, it's practically barren. It is my hope that Monster Hunter Stories 2 wi...                    game review          4 comments       Akiba's Trip: Hellbound & Debriefed   Jul 21, 00:00 4 comments                 games    Akiba's Trip: Hellbound and Debriefed is a cheeky romp through anime fandom mecca with plenty of fun references. But sadly, it's also just shy of the mark to make it a must-have. ― Akiba's Trip: Hellbound and Debriefed is a lot of things. It's a remaster of a 10-year-old PlayStation Portable game. It's a cheeky romp through anime fandom mecca with plenty of fun references. But sadly, it's also just s...                    game review                MARS RED Edge of the Nightmare   Jul 13, 00:00                 games    If you enjoyed the show, the story acts as a nice companion to the events of the anime, and several familiar characters from the Code Zero crew like Takeuchi, Suwa, and Kurusu all play key roles. ― Whenever a major new anime hits the scene, there's a mobile game to accompany it, like clockwork. Many of these games remain Japanese exclusives, with only a handful releasing globally. Additionally, many ...                    game review          9 comments       Death end re;Quest   Jul  6, 03:00 9 comments                 games    Death end proves me dead wrong: it demonstrates not only Idea Factory's ability to put out quality titles, but that they can also be trusted to take real creative risks and create unique games – something all too rare in today's market. ― I wasn't expecting much from Death end re;Quest when I first picked it up. It's a product of Compile Heart, which is itself a subsidiary of Idea Factory – a studio ...                    game review          5 comments       No More Heroes 1 & 2   Jun 30, 00:00 5 comments                 games    The No More Heroes franchise is first and foremost a celebration of video games. ― The No More Heroes franchise is first and foremost a celebration of video games.

Branden Johnson finds out if this edition really lives up to all the hype. ― The level of excitement in the Smash Bros. fan community has probably never been higher. For all intents and purposes, this is the game. The one that has everything we could possibly want (okay, except for Waluigi)....                    game review          26 comments       Pokémon: Let's Go!   2018 Nov 21, 02:15 26 comments                 games    Pokémon fans can explore the Kanto region like never before in this high-def remake of the classic Yellow Version, but has Generation 1 aged gracefully? Branden Johnson finds out. ― I missed the Pokemon train entirely the first time around. It's strange; I love JRPGs, and I was the perfect age when Pokemon Red and Blue hit the Gameboy in the 90s. Whatever the reasons, I haven't played a single Pokemo...                    game review          2 comments       SNK 40th Anniversary Collection   2018 Nov 16, 02:22 2 comments                 games    SNK delivers a history lesson with an anthology of early arcade and NES titles. Todd finds out how well these games have held up in this new game for the Switch. ― What made SNK a cult favorite game company? Was it the Neo Geo, which delivered arcade-perfect games at home for just two hundred dollars per cartridge? Was it the Neo Geo Pocket Color, a well-made and vastly underappreciated handheld syst...                    game review          7 comments       My Hero: One's Justice (PlayStation 4)   2018 Oct 24, 23:43 7 comments                 games    My Hero One’s Justice captures the essence of its source material, and offers a fine experience for anyone looking to cross blows as their My Hero Academia favorites. ― The anime franchise tie-in brawler is a venerable gaming institution, with Bandai Namco having published similar efforts for franchises like Naruto and Dragon Ball in the past. On the other hand, One's Justice developer Byking are rel...                    game review          2 comments       Fist of the North Star: Paradise Lost   2018 Oct 12, 00:00 2 comments                 games    The classic head-exploding action of Fist of the North Star is poured into the Yakuza gameplay mold, but do these two great tastes taste great together? Daryl Surat scours the wasteland to find out. ― The last few years have marked a surge in popularity among English-language fans of both Sega's long-running Yakuza series of videogames as well as—to a lesser extent—the formative trope-establishing Sh...                    game review          7 comments       Mega Man 11   2018 Oct  2, 23:36 7 comments                 anime    It's Mega Man's big chance for a comeback, and it's not what some fans might expect. We dig into a video-game icon's return! ― Don't let the number fool you. This may be the eleventh or twelfth central Mega Man title. It may be backed by several spin-off series. Yet it's been nearly a decade since the last full-blown game in the series. Even then, Mega Man 9 and 10 were deliberate throwbacks, built t...                    game review          4 comments       Capcom Beat 'Em Up Bundle   2018 Sep 24, 23:00 4 comments                 games    Capcom resurrects a bunch of their classic arcade brawlers with a seven-game collection. Do they still put up a fight? ― Brawlers. Beat 'Em Ups. Belt-Scrollers. Double Dragon Clones. Punk Punching Parades. Those Arcade Games That Mom And Dad Always Said Were Too Violent For You Back in 1988. Whatever you call them, they never quite got their moment on top. True, they were staples of arcades in the la...                    game review          7 comments       Import Review: My Hero One's Justice   2018 Sep 18, 23:00 7 comments                 games    My Hero Academia arrives on consoles and PC as a fully-featured arena brawler bursting with everyone's favorite heroes, but does it go PLUS ULTRA?

Branden Johnson gets lost in the world of Monster Hunter. ― I've long aspired to be the sort of person who is into Monster Hunter. It's a real “gamer” series: brutal difficulty, complex systems, a strong community. Being a fan of Dark Souls and Bloodborne, I figured I would get into Monster Hunter, if I could...                    game review          9 comments       Review: Fate/Grand Order Arcade   2018 Aug 22, 01:14 9 comments                 games    The smash hit Fate smartphone game gets an extra-fancy new arcade edition in Japan that actually prints out physical cards for you to take home - but it doesn't come cheap! Richard Eisenbeis took the plunge, here's his report. ―  The Fate franchise is massive and sprawling. There are numerous games, TV anime, movies, novels, drama CDs, and manga. But while the franchise originally became popular duri...                    game review          2 comments       Persona 3: Dancing Moon Night & Persona 5: Dancing Star Night   2018 Aug  8, 22:00 2 comments                 games    In the wake of Persona 4's successful rhythm game, its siblings are getting in on the action!

Richard Eisenbeis has the answers in our full review. ― Following in the footsteps of 2015's Persona 4: Dancing All Night, Persona 3: Dancing Moon Night and Persona 5: Dancing Star Night are a pair of rhythm/music games that showcase the awesome soundtracks of Pe...                    game review          19 comments       Valkyria Chronicles 4   2018 Aug  6, 22:00 19 comments                 anime    Whether you're a longtime fan of the series or a newcomer, Valkyria Chronicles 4 doesn't disappoint. Richard Eisenbeis delivers his full review of the newest entry in this TRPG saga. ― The Valkyria Chronicles series is a piece of historical fiction set in a world much like our own. However, instead of coal or oil, it is the mysterious mineral ragnite—which can do anything from cure wounds to power a ...                    game review          2 comments       Sushi Striker: The Way of Sushido   2018 Jul 22, 22:00 2 comments                 games    This quirky puzzle game for the Nintendo Switch and 3DS is sure to win over fans of absurd humor and fast-paced strategy. Branden Johnson elaborates. ― Nailing absurdist humor is tricky. If you wink too much at the audience, it can be eye roll-inducing, and if you aren't polished enough in your presentation, you run the risk of your audience laughing at you, not with you. But Nintendo has pulled it o...                    game review          2 comments       Review: Little Witch Academia: Chamber of Time   2018 May 23, 22:00 2 comments                 games    This dungeon-crawling action RPG boasts all the style of Studio Trigger's hit series, but not so much the substance. Todd Ciolek digs into this magical adventure. ― It's neither original nor unkind to say that Little Witch Academia stood out on appearances. The series is a charming tale of a misfit at a magical academy, a fantasy staple since well before Harry Potter, but it might not have leapt from...                    game review          3 comments       REVIEW: Sword Art Online: Fatal Bullet   2018 Mar 24, 23:49 3 comments                 games    This run-and-gun RPG for the PS4 allows SAO fans to interact with all their favorite characters in a brand-new story. But is it fun to play? Branden Johnson finds out. ― Unpopular opinion time: my least favorite arc in Sword Art Online was Gun Gale Online. Not that it was bad, just that it felt lacking compared to the two storylines that preceded it. So my expectations going into Sword Art Online: Fa...                    game review          6 comments       Ni no Kuni II:Revenant Kingdom   2018 Mar 21, 22:45 6 comments                 games    It took 8 years for a Ni no Kuni sequel to finally surface, and now that it's here, there's both good news and bad for this lavish Studio Ghibli-esque action RPG. ― Ni no Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch was a bit too traditional for me. As a lover of RPGs and the films of Hayao Miyazaki, I figured it would be right up my alley. An RPG that looks and sounds like a real Studio Ghibli film is basically a...                    game review          4 comments       GAME REVIEW: Attack on Titan 2   2018 Mar 16, 22:00 4 comments                 games    This sequel to the first action game in the franchise from KOEI-TECMO and Omega Force makes significant improvements on its predecessor, but is it worth a purchase? Heidi Kemps has the answers. ― Omega Force's record with anime and manga adaptations is a bit spotty. We've had disappointments like Fist of the North Star: Ken's Rage and Berserk and the Band of the Hawk, but we've also had some real win...                    game review          3 comments       REVIEW: Dragon Ball FighterZ   2018 Jan 29, 23:00 3 comments                 games    Dustin Bailey has the full rundown on the most hotly anticipated DBZ fighting game of all time. Find out if FighterZ lives up to all the hype! ― Dragon Ball FighterZ isn't just a good game for fans of Dragon Ball—it's a great game period, a best-in-class fighter that looks great and is fun to play at any level. That it's crafted with loving reverence to one of the most popular anime on the planet is ...                    game review          4 comments       River City: Rival Showdown   2017 Dec 20, 23:03 4 comments                 games    The open-world gameplay of this breezy beat-em-up returns on the Nintendo 3DS. Heidi breaks down how this game stacks up against its predecessors for prior fans and newcomers alike. ― For being such a long-running game franchise, the Kunio-kun series of beat-em-ups is quite a confusing mess. It's a beat-em-up series about a bunch of high school delinquents fighting for turf and showing who's the toug...                    game review          3 comments       Resident Evil Revelations Collection   2017 Nov 28, 22:00 3 comments                 games    Both RE: Revelations games have arrived in a special re-release for the Nintendo Switch, but is there anything new in this edition worth picking up?

Todd Ciolek finds out. ― Etrian Odyssey games ask a lot. They require you to pace around dungeon grids full of nasty enemies. They require you to map out levels in the tradition of the hardest RPGs of 1986. They require you to try again and again, even after a sudden and vicious encounter wipes out yo...                    game review          7 comments       Cyberdimension Neptunia: 4 Goddesses Online   2017 Oct 11, 22:15 7 comments                 games    Is this super-meta RPG worth playing for more than its jokes and fanservice? Todd Ciolek finds out. ― Neptunia is a series of inexhaustible potential. The central RPGs feature anime heroines who represent various game consoles and companies, and that makes for rampant and excusable genre parody. Put the characters in a pop-idol simulation or a strategy-RPG and you're not just cynically exploiting a m...                    game review          21 comments       Super NES Classic Edition   2017 Oct  5, 22:00 21 comments                 games    With heaps of 16-bit classics to choose from including the never-before-released Star Fox 2, the Super NES Classic is a retro gamer's dream.

What will you do with your time in Rigbarth? ― It's a little hard to talk about the Story of Seasons games (and their Rune Factory spin-offs).

It's sharper, tighter, more enjoyable...and now competing directly with the latest Mario Kart on Nintendo's home turf. ― The original Chocobo Racing was not an astounding game, but it was a cleverly-positioned one.

But what exactly are the decisions that got us here? ― Unlike animation, video games are in large part a disposable medium. Games once hailed as era-defining breakthrough titles upon their release often become antiquated and awkward within a little less than a decade.

It's a beat-em-up series about a bunch of high school delinquents fighting for turf and showing who's the toug...                    game review          3 comments       Resident Evil Revelations Collection   2017 Nov 28, 22:00 3 comments                 games    Both RE: Revelations games have arrived in a special re-release for the Nintendo Switch, but is there anything new in this edition worth picking up? Dave Riley finds out. ― With the release of a new console, the Switch, comes the expected glut of HD ports, and Resident Evil Revelations, which has been ported to on average a console and a half per year since its original release on the 3DS in 2012, is...                    game review          10 comments       Etrian Odyssey V: Beyond the Myth   2017 Oct 21, 22:00 10 comments                 games    Does the newest entry in this difficult RPG series still hurt good enough to be worth the challenge? Todd Ciolek finds out. ― Etrian Odyssey games ask a lot. They require you to pace around dungeon grids full of nasty enemies. They require you to map out levels in the tradition of the hardest RPGs of 1986. They require you to try again and again, even after a sudden and vicious encounter wipes out yo...                    game review          7 comments       Cyberdimension Neptunia: 4 Goddesses Online   2017 Oct 11, 22:15 7 comments                 games    Is this super-meta RPG worth playing for more than its jokes and fanservice? Todd Ciolek finds out. ― Neptunia is a series of inexhaustible potential. The central RPGs feature anime heroines who represent various game consoles and companies, and that makes for rampant and excusable genre parody. Put the characters in a pop-idol simulation or a strategy-RPG and you're not just cynically exploiting a m...                    game review          21 comments       Super NES Classic Edition   2017 Oct  5, 22:00 21 comments                 games    With heaps of 16-bit classics to choose from including the never-before-released Star Fox 2, the Super NES Classic is a retro gamer's dream.

Dustin Bailey gets into it. ― The new story mode in Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite has all the characters trapped in a pair of worlds awkwardly smashed together out of pieces from their respective universes.

What will you do with your time in Rigbarth? ― It's a little hard to talk about the Story of Seasons games (and their Rune Factory spin-offs). Not because of the complicated legal snarl involving the Story of Seasons and Harvest Moon branding, but because on the merits that most games woul...                    game review          2 comments       Chocobo GP   Mar 18, 00:00 2 comments                 games    Chocobo GP is a big improvement and an even greater risk. It's sharper, tighter, more enjoyable...and now competing directly with the latest Mario Kart on Nintendo's home turf. ― The original Chocobo Racing was not an astounding game, but it was a cleverly-positioned one. It offered the PlayStation owners of 1999 an answer to the Nintendo 64's Mario Kart while dusting itself with Final Fantasy refere...                           game review          8 comments       Persona 4 Arena Ultimax Review   Mar 11, 01:21 8 comments                 games    Now that Persona 4 Arena Ultimax is out on modern platforms with a massive adoption rate, the question is how much is in here for a single-playing Persona? The answer is an inspiring ""Quite a bit!"" ― The rerelease of 2014's Persona 4 Arena Ultimax finds itself in an odd situation for such a thing. The fighting game scene has ballooned into an even bigger, better place in the eight years since, so put...                    game review          1 comment       Jujutsu Kaisen: Escape From the Cursed Spirit of the Abandoned School   Feb 26, 01:00 1 comment                 games    Gojo assigns you to a mission to help the first-year students investigate a creepy abandoned school. Can you and the others use your techniques -- and your smarts -- to exorcise the cursed spirit before it's too late? ― When you think of an anime world you would want to live in, Jujutsu Kaisen probably isn't at the top of your list, if it is even on the list. But it's possible you've dreamed of going...                    game review          1 comment       Atelier Sophie 2: Alchemist of the Mysterious Dream   Feb 24, 22:00 1 comment                 games    The Nintendo Switch struggles to handle this new entry in the Atelier franchise, but beyond its technical issues the world of Erde Wiege introduces players to characters that quickly come to feel like longtime friends. ― There are three things I've come to expect from the Atelier series: cozy atmosphere, charming character writing, and breezy combat. The series is content to dwell within that realm, ...                    game review          6 comments       The King of Fighters XV   Feb 24, 01:00 6 comments                 games    The King of Fighters XV doesn't find the series at its prettiest, boldest, or most densely populated and varied in characters. Yet this might be the most accessible it's ever been. ― If anyone ever asks you how many The King of Fighters games there are, resist the temptation to say fifteen. That may be the number on this latest flagship entry, but this is a vast and complicated series with many, many...                    game review          25 comments       REVIEW: Pokémon Legends: Arceus   Feb 20, 01:00 25 comments                 games    While the plot left much to be desired, Pokémon Legends: Arceus brings new energy and possibilities to the franchise. ― For years, it seems the big ask of Pokémon fans has been that the franchise innovate itself in a meaningful way. Pokémon Legends: Arceus seems to be Game Freak's response to that request, and I'd go out on a limb to say that it's exactly the sort of thing we've been waiting for. It ...                    game review          21 comments       Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl   Jan 18, 01:20 21 comments                 games    As a fan, it pains me to see an entry to one of my favorite franchises fall to such low lows. But what exactly are the decisions that got us here? ― Unlike animation, video games are in large part a disposable medium. Games once hailed as era-defining breakthrough titles upon their release often become antiquated and awkward within a little less than a decade. And so we see a plethora of remakes and ...                    game review          3 comments       Clockwork Aquario   Dec 17, 04:00 3 comments                 games    The arcade game Clockwork Aquario finally arrives on modern systems after disappearing twenty-eight years ago. Is it a mere relic or a true deep-cut gem? ― Some games are delayed. Others are canceled. And then there's the unique and bizarre journey of Clockwork Aquario. Westone, creators of the Wonder Boy and Monster World games, tested this colorful side-scroller in arcades several times back in 199...                    game review          3 comments       Metallic Child   Dec 14, 01:00 3 comments                 games    Metallic Child's narrative is instantly compelling and the dialogue that accompanies its characters is entertaining to boot. ― I initially wasn't expecting much from this quietly released indie “rouge-lite” game, but found myself sad to see it go by the time I reached its ending. The greatest appeal of Metallic Child comes from the way it applies the aesthetics of the Japanese Action-RPGs without hol...                    game review          8 comments       Cupid Parasite   Dec  7, 01:00 8 comments                 games    A game with this many strengths is easy to recommend, which is why it's unfortunate that the current game is ridden with typos, ill-fitting text, and the telltale signs of a hastily edited machine translation. ― Cupid Parasite opens with some of the trashiest male love interests you could possibly imagine. One guy is exclusively interested in meeting women who are already ""taken."" Another literally c...                    game review          7 comments       Danganronpa Decadence   Nov 30, 02:00 7 comments                 games    Danganronpa Decadence offers a bit of new content, gameplay, and interactions between cast members, but this little something extra hardly feels decadent. ― Over ten years ago, the first Danganronpa game came out on the PlayStation Portable. Even back then, Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc was a standout of the visual novel genre, combining detective work and dating sim elements in a way that weirdly...                    game review          16 comments       Shin Megami Tensei V   Nov  5, 01:00 16 comments                 games    While SMT fans have no doubt chomped at the bit in anticipation of a new numbered entry arriving on consoles, some might still want to cling to the memory of Nocturne. Is this new, untested Shin Megami Tensei worth the plunge? ― Shin Megami Tensei V has one glaring problem it has to contend with: Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne HD Remaster was released just this past May. While SMT fans have no doub...                    game review          11 comments       Metroid Dread   Oct 28, 00:00 11 comments                 games    The gameplay of Dread is similarly spectacular. A lot of the DNA from Samus Returns – Mercury Steam's first Metroid project – is present here, albeit with the fat shaved off the bones. ― Before diving into the meat of this review, I feel it's important to mention that it is coming from a newcomer to the series, and that I ran some short stints into Metroid: Zero Mission and Fusion in order to lend so...                    game review          2 comments       Demon Slayer: The Hinokami Chronicles   Oct 14, 00:04 2 comments                 games    Being one of the most acclaimed anime of the past few years partially due to its stellar animation and fight scenes, a Demon Slayer fighting game felt like it was only a matter of time. ― Being one of the most acclaimed anime of the past few years partially due to its stellar animation and fight scenes, a Demon Slayer fighting game felt like it was only a matter of time.

Its aesthetically varied character designs, lewd but narratively significant fanservice (think Darling in the Franxx), and twistedly i...                    game review          3 comments       Samurai Warriors 5   Aug 12, 03:00 3 comments                 games    The most creatively bankrupt aspect of Samurai Warriors 5 is by and large its combat. ― While I've called Dynasty Warrior's gameplay recipe outdated before, the franchise has gone out of its way to prove me wrong recently, with games like Age of Calamity and Persona 5 Strikers exceeding my expectations. These games have their own unique mechanics that add some much-needed depth to Warrior's combat wh...                    game review          4 comments       Shadowverse: Champion's Battle   Aug 10, 21:00 4 comments                 games    Take on the role of Hiro Ryugasaki as you engage in card duels to save your school club! ― Coming straight from Cygames, Shadowverse: Champion's Battle is a story-based adaptation of the collectible card game app. You play as a youth who meets up with Hiro Ryugasaki, protagonist of the Shadowverse anime, and joins Tensei Academy's Shadowverse club. It seems the club is suffering from a lack of member...                    game review          10 comments       Fuga: Melodies of Steel   Aug  4, 00:00 10 comments                 games    It's a challenge to take on a brutal World War II retelling with imagery and characters cute enough to populate Maple Town, but CyberConnect2 sticks with it, and it's paid off. ― Cyberconnect2 is best known as the developer of gorgeous anime-to-game adaptations stretching from Naruto and .hack to JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. In their heart of hearts, however, company president/CEO Hiroshi Matsuyama and ...                    game review          4 comments       NEO: The World Ends With You   Jul 27, 01:00 4 comments                 games    Well, it took fourteen years, but NEO: The World Ends with You is finally here, and it's every bit as stylish, engrossing, and outright fun as its predecessor. ― When the original The World Ends with You launched all the way back in 2007 on the Nintendo DS, it won attention and praise for its unorthodox storytelling and gameplay. It used many of the features of the Nintendo DS in experimental ways an...                    game review          4 comments       Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin   Jul 25, 00:00 4 comments                 games    It's easy to say that Monster Hunter Stories 2 provided the most enjoyable gameplay experience I've had within the genre in recent years. ― The monster-collecting genre might be one of the most criminally under-represented in gaming. Aside from the Pokémon games and the steady trickle of indie projects inspired by that franchise, it's practically barren. It is my hope that Monster Hunter Stories 2 wi...                    game review          4 comments       Akiba's Trip: Hellbound & Debriefed   Jul 21, 00:00 4 comments                 games    Akiba's Trip: Hellbound and Debriefed is a cheeky romp through anime fandom mecca with plenty of fun references. But sadly, it's also just shy of the mark to make it a must-have. ― Akiba's Trip: Hellbound and Debriefed is a lot of things. It's a remaster of a 10-year-old PlayStation Portable game. It's a cheeky romp through anime fandom mecca with plenty of fun references. But sadly, it's also just s...                    game review                MARS RED Edge of the Nightmare   Jul 13, 00:00                 games    If you enjoyed the show, the story acts as a nice companion to the events of the anime, and several familiar characters from the Code Zero crew like Takeuchi, Suwa, and Kurusu all play key roles. ― Whenever a major new anime hits the scene, there's a mobile game to accompany it, like clockwork. Many of these games remain Japanese exclusives, with only a handful releasing globally. Additionally, many ...                    game review          9 comments       Death end re;Quest   Jul  6, 03:00 9 comments                 games    Death end proves me dead wrong: it demonstrates not only Idea Factory's ability to put out quality titles, but that they can also be trusted to take real creative risks and create unique games – something all too rare in today's market. ― I wasn't expecting much from Death end re;Quest when I first picked it up.

However, despite this, it is not a direct sequel to the previous game, Fate...                    game review          8 comments       REVIEW: Steins;Gate Elite   2019 Mar  8, 01:00 8 comments                 games    This remastered version of the sci fi visual novel classic is finally available with new footage and features for fans to discover all over again.

Branden Johnson finds out if this edition really lives up to all the hype. ― The level of excitement in the Smash Bros. fan community has probably never been higher.

Branden Johnson finds out. ― I missed the Pokemon train entirely the first time around. It's strange; I love JRPGs, and I was the perfect age when Pokemon Red and Blue hit the Gameboy in the 90s.

We dig into a video-game icon's return! ― Don't let the number fool you. This may be the eleventh or twelfth central Mega Man title. It may be backed by several spin-off series. Yet it's been nearly a decade since the last full-blown game in the series. Even then, Mega Man 9 and 10 were deliberate throwbacks, built t...                    game review          4 comments       Capcom Beat 'Em Up Bundle   2018 Sep 24, 23:00 4 comments                 games    Capcom resurrects a bunch of their classic arcade brawlers with a seven-game collection.

Branden Johnson elaborates. ― Nailing absurdist humor is tricky. If you wink too much at the audience, it can be eye roll-inducing, and if you aren't polished enough in your presentation, you run the risk of your audience laughing at you, not with you. But Nintendo has pulled it o...                    game review          2 comments       Review: Little Witch Academia: Chamber of Time   2018 May 23, 22:00 2 comments                 games    This dungeon-crawling action RPG boasts all the style of Studio Trigger's hit series, but not so much the substance. Todd Ciolek digs into this magical adventure. ― It's neither original nor unkind to say that Little Witch Academia stood out on appearances. The series is a charming tale of a misfit at a magical academy, a fantasy staple since well before Harry Potter, but it might not have leapt from...                    game review          3 comments       REVIEW: Sword Art Online: Fatal Bullet   2018 Mar 24, 23:49 3 comments                 games    This run-and-gun RPG for the PS4 allows SAO fans to interact with all their favorite characters in a brand-new story. But is it fun to play? Branden Johnson finds out. ― Unpopular opinion time: my least favorite arc in Sword Art Online was Gun Gale Online.

As a lover of RPGs and the films of Hayao Miyazaki, I figured it would be right up my alley. An RPG that looks and sounds like a real Studio Ghibli film is basically a...                    game review          4 comments       GAME REVIEW: Attack on Titan 2   2018 Mar 16, 22:00 4 comments                 games    This sequel to the first action game in the franchise from KOEI-TECMO and Omega Force makes significant improvements on its predecessor, but is it worth a purchase? Heidi Kemps has the answers. ― Omega Force's record with anime and manga adaptations is a bit spotty.

Heidi breaks down how this game stacks up against its predecessors for prior fans and newcomers alike. ― For being such a long-running game franchise, the Kunio-kun series of beat-em-ups is quite a confusing mess. It's a beat-em-up series about a bunch of high school delinquents fighting for turf and showing who's the toug...                    game review          3 comments       Resident Evil Revelations Collection   2017 Nov 28, 22:00 3 comments                 games    Both RE: Revelations games have arrived in a special re-release for the Nintendo Switch, but is there anything new in this edition worth picking up?

Todd Ciolek finds out. ― Etrian Odyssey games ask a lot. They require you to pace around dungeon grids full of nasty enemies. They require you to map out levels in the tradition of the hardest RPGs of 1986. They require you to try again and again, even after a sudden and vicious encounter wipes out yo...                    game review          7 comments       Cyberdimension Neptunia: 4 Goddesses Online   2017 Oct 11, 22:15 7 comments                 games    Is this super-meta RPG worth playing for more than its jokes and fanservice? Todd Ciolek finds out. ― Neptunia is a series of inexhaustible potential. The central RPGs feature anime heroines who represent various game consoles and companies, and that makes for rampant and excusable genre parody. Put the characters in a pop-idol simulation or a strategy-RPG and you're not just cynically exploiting a m...                    game review          21 comments       Super NES Classic Edition   2017 Oct  5, 22:00 21 comments                 games    With heaps of 16-bit classics to choose from including the never-before-released Star Fox 2, the Super NES Classic is a retro gamer's dream.

What will you do with your time in Rigbarth? ― It's a little hard to talk about the Story of Seasons games (and their Rune Factory spin-offs). Not because of the complicated legal snarl involving the Story of Seasons and Harvest Moon branding, but because on the merits that most games woul...                    game review          2 comments       Chocobo GP   Mar 18, 00:00 2 comments                 games    Chocobo GP is a big improvement and an even greater risk. It's sharper, tighter, more enjoyable...and now competing directly with the latest Mario Kart on Nintendo's home turf. ― The original Chocobo Racing was not an astounding game, but it was a cleverly-positioned one. It offered the PlayStation owners of 1999 an answer to the Nintendo 64's Mario Kart while dusting itself with Final Fantasy refere...                           game review          8 comments       Persona 4 Arena Ultimax Review   Mar 11, 01:21 8 comments                 games    Now that Persona 4 Arena Ultimax is out on modern platforms with a massive adoption rate, the question is how much is in here for a single-playing Persona? The answer is an inspiring ""Quite a bit!"" ― The rerelease of 2014's Persona 4 Arena Ultimax finds itself in an odd situation for such a thing. The fighting game scene has ballooned into an even bigger, better place in the eight years since, so put...                    game review          1 comment       Jujutsu Kaisen: Escape From the Cursed Spirit of the Abandoned School   Feb 26, 01:00 1 comment                 games    Gojo assigns you to a mission to help the first-year students investigate a creepy abandoned school. Can you and the others use your techniques -- and your smarts -- to exorcise the cursed spirit before it's too late? ― When you think of an anime world you would want to live in, Jujutsu Kaisen probably isn't at the top of your list, if it is even on the list. But it's possible you've dreamed of going...                    game review          1 comment       Atelier Sophie 2: Alchemist of the Mysterious Dream   Feb 24, 22:00 1 comment                 games    The Nintendo Switch struggles to handle this new entry in the Atelier franchise, but beyond its technical issues the world of Erde Wiege introduces players to characters that quickly come to feel like longtime friends. ― There are three things I've come to expect from the Atelier series: cozy atmosphere, charming character writing, and breezy combat.

That may be the number on this latest flagship entry, but this is a vast and complicated series with many, many...                    game review          25 comments       REVIEW: Pokémon Legends: Arceus   Feb 20, 01:00 25 comments                 games    While the plot left much to be desired, Pokémon Legends: Arceus brings new energy and possibilities to the franchise. ― For years, it seems the big ask of Pokémon fans has been that the franchise innovate itself in a meaningful way. Pokémon Legends: Arceus seems to be Game Freak's response to that request, and I'd go out on a limb to say that it's exactly the sort of thing we've been waiting for.

But what exactly are the decisions that got us here? ― Unlike animation, video games are in large part a disposable medium. Games once hailed as era-defining breakthrough titles upon their release often become antiquated and awkward within a little less than a decade. And so we see a plethora of remakes and ...                    game review          3 comments       Clockwork Aquario   Dec 17, 04:00 3 comments                 games    The arcade game Clockwork Aquario finally arrives on modern systems after disappearing twenty-eight years ago. Is it a mere relic or a true deep-cut gem? ― Some games are delayed. Others are canceled. And then there's the unique and bizarre journey of Clockwork Aquario. Westone, creators of the Wonder Boy and Monster World games, tested this colorful side-scroller in arcades several times back in 199...                    game review          3 comments       Metallic Child   Dec 14, 01:00 3 comments                 games    Metallic Child's narrative is instantly compelling and the dialogue that accompanies its characters is entertaining to boot. ― I initially wasn't expecting much from this quietly released indie “rouge-lite” game, but found myself sad to see it go by the time I reached its ending. The greatest appeal of Metallic Child comes from the way it applies the aesthetics of the Japanese Action-RPGs without hol...                    game review          8 comments       Cupid Parasite   Dec  7, 01:00 8 comments                 games    A game with this many strengths is easy to recommend, which is why it's unfortunate that the current game is ridden with typos, ill-fitting text, and the telltale signs of a hastily edited machine translation. ― Cupid Parasite opens with some of the trashiest male love interests you could possibly imagine.

Even back then, Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc was a standout of the visual novel genre, combining detective work and dating sim elements in a way that weirdly...                    game review          16 comments       Shin Megami Tensei V   Nov  5, 01:00 16 comments                 games    While SMT fans have no doubt chomped at the bit in anticipation of a new numbered entry arriving on consoles, some might still want to cling to the memory of Nocturne.

It offered the PlayStation owners of 1999 an answer to the Nintendo 64's Mario Kart while dusting itself with Final Fantasy refere...                           game review          8 comments       Persona 4 Arena Ultimax Review   Mar 11, 01:21 8 comments                 games    Now that Persona 4 Arena Ultimax is out on modern platforms with a massive adoption rate, the question is how much is in here for a single-playing Persona? The answer is an inspiring ""Quite a bit!"" ― The rerelease of 2014's Persona 4 Arena Ultimax finds itself in an odd situation for such a thing.

But what exactly are the decisions that got us here? ― Unlike animation, video games are in large part a disposable medium.

Heidi breaks down how this game stacks up against its predecessors for prior fans and newcomers alike. ― For being such a long-running game franchise, the Kunio-kun series of beat-em-ups is quite a confusing mess. It's a beat-em-up series about a bunch of high school delinquents fighting for turf and showing who's the toug...                    game review          3 comments       Resident Evil Revelations Collection   2017 Nov 28, 22:00 3 comments                 games    Both RE: Revelations games have arrived in a special re-release for the Nintendo Switch, but is there anything new in this edition worth picking up?

Todd Ciolek finds out. ― Etrian Odyssey games ask a lot. They require you to pace around dungeon grids full of nasty enemies. They require you to map out levels in the tradition of the hardest RPGs of 1986. They require you to try again and again, even after a sudden and vicious encounter wipes out yo...                    game review          7 comments       Cyberdimension Neptunia: 4 Goddesses Online   2017 Oct 11, 22:15 7 comments                 games    Is this super-meta RPG worth playing for more than its jokes and fanservice? Todd Ciolek finds out. ― Neptunia is a series of inexhaustible potential. The central RPGs feature anime heroines who represent various game consoles and companies, and that makes for rampant and excusable genre parody. Put the characters in a pop-idol simulation or a strategy-RPG and you're not just cynically exploiting a m...                    game review          21 comments       Super NES Classic Edition   2017 Oct  5, 22:00 21 comments                 games    With heaps of 16-bit classics to choose from including the never-before-released Star Fox 2, the Super NES Classic is a retro gamer's dream.

What will you do with your time in Rigbarth? ― It's a little hard to talk about the Story of Seasons games (and their Rune Factory spin-offs). Not because of the complicated legal snarl involving the Story of Seasons and Harvest Moon branding, but because on the merits that most games woul...                    game review          2 comments       Chocobo GP   Mar 18, 00:00 2 comments                 games    Chocobo GP is a big improvement and an even greater risk. It's sharper, tighter, more enjoyable...and now competing directly with the latest Mario Kart on Nintendo's home turf. ― The original Chocobo Racing was not an astounding game, but it was a cleverly-positioned one. It offered the PlayStation owners of 1999 an answer to the Nintendo 64's Mario Kart while dusting itself with Final Fantasy refere...                           game review          8 comments       Persona 4 Arena Ultimax Review   Mar 11, 01:21 8 comments                 games    Now that Persona 4 Arena Ultimax is out on modern platforms with a massive adoption rate, the question is how much is in here for a single-playing Persona? The answer is an inspiring ""Quite a bit!"" ― The rerelease of 2014's Persona 4 Arena Ultimax finds itself in an odd situation for such a thing. The fighting game scene has ballooned into an even bigger, better place in the eight years since, so put...                    game review          1 comment       Jujutsu Kaisen: Escape From the Cursed Spirit of the Abandoned School   Feb 26, 01:00 1 comment                 games    Gojo assigns you to a mission to help the first-year students investigate a creepy abandoned school. Can you and the others use your techniques -- and your smarts -- to exorcise the cursed spirit before it's too late? ― When you think of an anime world you would want to live in, Jujutsu Kaisen probably isn't at the top of your list, if it is even on the list. But it's possible you've dreamed of going...                    game review          1 comment       Atelier Sophie 2: Alchemist of the Mysterious Dream   Feb 24, 22:00 1 comment                 games    The Nintendo Switch struggles to handle this new entry in the Atelier franchise, but beyond its technical issues the world of Erde Wiege introduces players to characters that quickly come to feel like longtime friends. ― There are three things I've come to expect from the Atelier series: cozy atmosphere, charming character writing, and breezy combat.

Yet this might be the most accessible it's ever been. ― If anyone ever asks you how many The King of Fighters games there are, resist the temptation to say fifteen. That may be the number on this latest flagship entry, but this is a vast and complicated series with many, many...                    game review          25 comments       REVIEW: Pokémon Legends: Arceus   Feb 20, 01:00 25 comments                 games    While the plot left much to be desired, Pokémon Legends: Arceus brings new energy and possibilities to the franchise. ― For years, it seems the big ask of Pokémon fans has been that the franchise innovate itself in a meaningful way. Pokémon Legends: Arceus seems to be Game Freak's response to that request, and I'd go out on a limb to say that it's exactly the sort of thing we've been waiting for.

But what exactly are the decisions that got us here? ― Unlike animation, video games are in large part a disposable medium. Games once hailed as era-defining breakthrough titles upon their release often become antiquated and awkward within a little less than a decade. And so we see a plethora of remakes and ...                    game review          3 comments       Clockwork Aquario   Dec 17, 04:00 3 comments                 games    The arcade game Clockwork Aquario finally arrives on modern systems after disappearing twenty-eight years ago. Is it a mere relic or a true deep-cut gem? ― Some games are delayed. Others are canceled. And then there's the unique and bizarre journey of Clockwork Aquario. Westone, creators of the Wonder Boy and Monster World games, tested this colorful side-scroller in arcades several times back in 199...                    game review          3 comments       Metallic Child   Dec 14, 01:00 3 comments                 games    Metallic Child's narrative is instantly compelling and the dialogue that accompanies its characters is entertaining to boot. ― I initially wasn't expecting much from this quietly released indie “rouge-lite” game, but found myself sad to see it go by the time I reached its ending. The greatest appeal of Metallic Child comes from the way it applies the aesthetics of the Japanese Action-RPGs without hol...                    game review          8 comments       Cupid Parasite   Dec  7, 01:00 8 comments                 games    A game with this many strengths is easy to recommend, which is why it's unfortunate that the current game is ridden with typos, ill-fitting text, and the telltale signs of a hastily edited machine translation. ― Cupid Parasite opens with some of the trashiest male love interests you could possibly imagine. One guy is exclusively interested in meeting women who are already ""taken.""

Even back then, Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc was a standout of the visual novel genre, combining detective work and dating sim elements in a way that weirdly...                    game review          16 comments       Shin Megami Tensei V   Nov  5, 01:00 16 comments                 games    While SMT fans have no doubt chomped at the bit in anticipation of a new numbered entry arriving on consoles, some might still want to cling to the memory of Nocturne. Is this new, untested Shin Megami Tensei worth the plunge? ― Shin Megami Tensei V has one glaring problem it has to contend with: Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne HD Remaster was released just this past May. While SMT fans have no doub...                    game review          11 comments       Metroid Dread   Oct 28, 00:00 11 comments                 games    The gameplay of Dread is similarly spectacular. A lot of the DNA from Samus Returns – Mercury Steam's first Metroid project – is present here, albeit with the fat shaved off the bones. ― Before diving into the meat of this review, I feel it's important to mention that it is coming from a newcomer to the series, and that I ran some short stints into Metroid: Zero Mission and Fusion in order to lend so...                    game review          2 comments       Demon Slayer: The Hinokami Chronicles   Oct 14, 00:04 2 comments                 games    Being one of the most acclaimed anime of the past few years partially due to its stellar animation and fight scenes, a Demon Slayer fighting game felt like it was only a matter of time. ― Being one of the most acclaimed anime of the past few years partially due to its stellar animation and fight scenes, a Demon Slayer fighting game felt like it was only a matter of time.

Its aesthetically varied character designs, lewd but narratively significant fanservice (think Darling in the Franxx), and twistedly i...                    game review          3 comments       Samurai Warriors 5   Aug 12, 03:00 3 comments                 games    The most creatively bankrupt aspect of Samurai Warriors 5 is by and large its combat. ― While I've called Dynasty Warrior's gameplay recipe outdated before, the franchise has gone out of its way to prove me wrong recently, with games like Age of Calamity and Persona 5 Strikers exceeding my expectations. These games have their own unique mechanics that add some much-needed depth to Warrior's combat wh...                    game review          4 comments       Shadowverse: Champion's Battle   Aug 10, 21:00 4 comments                 games    Take on the role of Hiro Ryugasaki as you engage in card duels to save your school club! ― Coming straight from Cygames, Shadowverse: Champion's Battle is a story-based adaptation of the collectible card game app. You play as a youth who meets up with Hiro Ryugasaki, protagonist of the Shadowverse anime, and joins Tensei Academy's Shadowverse club.

In their heart of hearts, however, company president/CEO Hiroshi Matsuyama and ...                    game review          4 comments       NEO: The World Ends With You   Jul 27, 01:00 4 comments                 games    Well, it took fourteen years, but NEO: The World Ends with You is finally here, and it's every bit as stylish, engrossing, and outright fun as its predecessor. ― When the original The World Ends with You launched all the way back in 2007 on the Nintendo DS, it won attention and praise for its unorthodox storytelling and gameplay. It used many of the features of the Nintendo DS in experimental ways an...                    game review          4 comments       Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin   Jul 25, 00:00 4 comments                 games    It's easy to say that Monster Hunter Stories 2 provided the most enjoyable gameplay experience I've had within the genre in recent years. ― The monster-collecting genre might be one of the most criminally under-represented in gaming. Aside from the Pokémon games and the steady trickle of indie projects inspired by that franchise, it's practically barren. It is my hope that Monster Hunter Stories 2 wi...                    game review          4 comments       Akiba's Trip: Hellbound & Debriefed   Jul 21, 00:00 4 comments                 games    Akiba's Trip: Hellbound and Debriefed is a cheeky romp through anime fandom mecca with plenty of fun references. But sadly, it's also just shy of the mark to make it a must-have. ― Akiba's Trip: Hellbound and Debriefed is a lot of things. It's a remaster of a 10-year-old PlayStation Portable game. It's a cheeky romp through anime fandom mecca with plenty of fun references.

Many of these games remain Japanese exclusives, with only a handful releasing globally.

Grant Jones revisits the franchise to see if the games still hold up to their legacy. ― The Ninja Gaiden Master Collection is hard to talk about in isolation.

But while the franchise originally became popular duri...                    game review          2 comments       Persona 3: Dancing Moon Night & Persona 5: Dancing Star Night   2018 Aug  8, 22:00 2 comments                 games    In the wake of Persona 4's successful rhythm game, its siblings are getting in on the action! Which of these two new games should you play? Richard Eisenbeis has the answers in our full review. ― Following in the footsteps of 2015's Persona 4: Dancing All Night, Persona 3: Dancing Moon Night and Persona 5: Dancing Star Night are a pair of rhythm/music games that showcase the awesome soundtracks of Pe...                    game review          19 comments       Valkyria Chronicles 4   2018 Aug  6, 22:00 19 comments                 anime    Whether you're a longtime fan of the series or a newcomer, Valkyria Chronicles 4 doesn't disappoint. Richard Eisenbeis delivers his full review of the newest entry in this TRPG saga. ― The Valkyria Chronicles series is a piece of historical fiction set in a world much like our own. However, instead of coal or oil, it is the mysterious mineral ragnite—which can do anything from cure wounds to power a ...                    game review          2 comments       Sushi Striker: The Way of Sushido   2018 Jul 22, 22:00 2 comments                 games    This quirky puzzle game for the Nintendo Switch and 3DS is sure to win over fans of absurd humor and fast-paced strategy. Branden Johnson elaborates. ― Nailing absurdist humor is tricky. If you wink too much at the audience, it can be eye roll-inducing, and if you aren't polished enough in your presentation, you run the risk of your audience laughing at you, not with you. But Nintendo has pulled it o...                    game review          2 comments       Review: Little Witch Academia: Chamber of Time   2018 May 23, 22:00 2 comments                 games    This dungeon-crawling action RPG boasts all the style of Studio Trigger's hit series, but not so much the substance. Todd Ciolek digs into this magical adventure. ― It's neither original nor unkind to say that Little Witch Academia stood out on appearances. The series is a charming tale of a misfit at a magical academy, a fantasy staple since well before Harry Potter, but it might not have leapt from...                    game review          3 comments       REVIEW: Sword Art Online: Fatal Bullet   2018 Mar 24, 23:49 3 comments                 games    This run-and-gun RPG for the PS4 allows SAO fans to interact with all their favorite characters in a brand-new story. But is it fun to play? Branden Johnson finds out. ― Unpopular opinion time: my least favorite arc in Sword Art Online was Gun Gale Online. Not that it was bad, just that it felt lacking compared to the two storylines that preceded it. So my expectations going into Sword Art Online: Fa...                    game review          6 comments       Ni no Kuni II:Revenant Kingdom   2018 Mar 21, 22:45 6 comments                 games    It took 8 years for a Ni no Kuni sequel to finally surface, and now that it's here, there's both good news and bad for this lavish Studio Ghibli-esque action RPG. ― Ni no Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch was a bit too traditional for me. As a lover of RPGs and the films of Hayao Miyazaki, I figured it would be right up my alley. An RPG that looks and sounds like a real Studio Ghibli film is basically a...                    game review          4 comments       GAME REVIEW: Attack on Titan 2   2018 Mar 16, 22:00 4 comments                 games    This sequel to the first action game in the franchise from KOEI-TECMO and Omega Force makes significant improvements on its predecessor, but is it worth a purchase?

Find out if FighterZ lives up to all the hype! ― Dragon Ball FighterZ isn't just a good game for fans of Dragon Ball—it's a great game period, a best-in-class fighter that looks great and is fun to play at any level.

Heidi breaks down how this game stacks up against its predecessors for prior fans and newcomers alike. ― For being such a long-running game franchise, the Kunio-kun series of beat-em-ups is quite a confusing mess. It's a beat-em-up series about a bunch of high school delinquents fighting for turf and showing who's the toug...                    game review          3 comments       Resident Evil Revelations Collection   2017 Nov 28, 22:00 3 comments                 games    Both RE: Revelations games have arrived in a special re-release for the Nintendo Switch, but is there anything new in this edition worth picking up?

Todd Ciolek finds out. ― Etrian Odyssey games ask a lot. They require you to pace around dungeon grids full of nasty enemies. They require you to map out levels in the tradition of the hardest RPGs of 1986. They require you to try again and again, even after a sudden and vicious encounter wipes out yo...                    game review          7 comments       Cyberdimension Neptunia: 4 Goddesses Online   2017 Oct 11, 22:15 7 comments                 games    Is this super-meta RPG worth playing for more than its jokes and fanservice? Todd Ciolek finds out. ― Neptunia is a series of inexhaustible potential. The central RPGs feature anime heroines who represent various game consoles and companies, and that makes for rampant and excusable genre parody. Put the characters in a pop-idol simulation or a strategy-RPG and you're not just cynically exploiting a m...                    game review          21 comments       Super NES Classic Edition   2017 Oct  5, 22:00 21 comments                 games    With heaps of 16-bit classics to choose from including the never-before-released Star Fox 2, the Super NES Classic is a retro gamer's dream.

What will you do with your time in Rigbarth? ― It's a little hard to talk about the Story of Seasons games (and their Rune Factory spin-offs).

It offered the PlayStation owners of 1999 an answer to the Nintendo 64's Mario Kart while dusting itself with Final Fantasy refere...                           game review          8 comments       Persona 4 Arena Ultimax Review   Mar 11, 01:21 8 comments                 games    Now that Persona 4 Arena Ultimax is out on modern platforms with a massive adoption rate, the question is how much is in here for a single-playing Persona? The answer is an inspiring ""Quite a bit!"" ― The rerelease of 2014's Persona 4 Arena Ultimax finds itself in an odd situation for such a thing.

But what exactly are the decisions that got us here? ― Unlike animation, video games are in large part a disposable medium.

Branden Johnson finds out. ― I missed the Pokemon train entirely the first time around. It's strange; I love JRPGs, and I was the perfect age when Pokemon Red and Blue hit the Gameboy in the 90s.

We dig into a video-game icon's return! ― Don't let the number fool you. This may be the eleventh or twelfth central Mega Man title. It may be backed by several spin-off series. Yet it's been nearly a decade since the last full-blown game in the series. Even then, Mega Man 9 and 10 were deliberate throwbacks, built t...                    game review          4 comments       Capcom Beat 'Em Up Bundle   2018 Sep 24, 23:00 4 comments                 games    Capcom resurrects a bunch of their classic arcade brawlers with a seven-game collection.

Branden Johnson elaborates. ― Nailing absurdist humor is tricky.

Todd Ciolek digs into this magical adventure. ― It's neither original nor unkind to say that Little Witch Academia stood out on appearances. The series is a charming tale of a misfit at a magical academy, a fantasy staple since well before Harry Potter, but it might not have leapt from...                    game review          3 comments       REVIEW: Sword Art Online: Fatal Bullet   2018 Mar 24, 23:49 3 comments                 games    This run-and-gun RPG for the PS4 allows SAO fans to interact with all their favorite characters in a brand-new story.

Todd Ciolek finds out. ― Etrian Odyssey games ask a lot. They require you to pace around dungeon grids full of nasty enemies. They require you to map out levels in the tradition of the hardest RPGs of 1986. They require you to try again and again, even after a sudden and vicious encounter wipes out yo...                    game review          7 comments       Cyberdimension Neptunia: 4 Goddesses Online   2017 Oct 11, 22:15 7 comments                 games    Is this super-meta RPG worth playing for more than its jokes and fanservice? Todd Ciolek finds out. ― Neptunia is a series of inexhaustible potential. The central RPGs feature anime heroines who represent various game consoles and companies, and that makes for rampant and excusable genre parody. Put the characters in a pop-idol simulation or a strategy-RPG and you're not just cynically exploiting a m...                    game review          21 comments       Super NES Classic Edition   2017 Oct  5, 22:00 21 comments                 games    With heaps of 16-bit classics to choose from including the never-before-released Star Fox 2, the Super NES Classic is a retro gamer's dream.

But what exactly are the decisions that got us here? ― Unlike animation, video games are in large part a disposable medium.

They require you to map out levels in the tradition of the hardest RPGs of 1986. They require you to try again and again, even after a sudden and vicious encounter wipes out yo...                    game review          7 comments       Cyberdimension Neptunia: 4 Goddesses Online   2017 Oct 11, 22:15 7 comments                 games    Is this super-meta RPG worth playing for more than its jokes and fanservice? Todd Ciolek finds out. ― Neptunia is a series of inexhaustible potential.

Review   by Nicholas Dupree, Mar 27th 2022       Soul Eater - The Perfect Edition GN 4-6                      Synopsis:             Medusa's scheme is barreling forward, and it's left to Maka, Soul, and their fellow students to stop her servants from awakening the hellacious Kishin sealed beneath Death City. But standing between our heroes and their goal is a rematch with the deranged Demon Sword Ragnarok and his unhinged Meister, Crona. Can Maka and Soul overcome the foe who all but slaughtered them before, even as the malicious black blood in Soul's body continues to fester? If they can't, a madness 800 years in the making will be unleashed upon an unwitting world.      Review:         Synopsis:        Medusa's scheme is barreling forward, and it's left to Maka, Soul, and their fellow students to stop her servants from awakening the hellacious Kishin sealed beneath Death City. But standing between our heroes and their goal is a rematch with the deranged Demon Sword Ragnarok and his unhinged Meister, Crona. Can Maka and Soul overcome the foe who all but slaughtered them before, even as the malicious black blood in Soul's body continues to fester? If they can't, a madness 800 years in the making will be unleashed upon an unwitting world.     Review:            Volume four of The Perfect Edition sees Soul Eater in pure, shonen action mode. It's the classic setup of an evil villain waiting at the end of a gauntlet of enemies, with each of our major characters getting a battle against an established baddie as they duke it out for the fate of the world. The main event is the rematch between Maka, Soul, and the Ragnarok duo, and it's some Grade A shonen fighting goodness. While the various beats it hits are pretty standard, they're delivered with the series' signature style and Ohkubo's exaggerated choreography, and thus land with a ton of impact, especially once “mad” Maka takes over and delivers some of the goofiest creepy-cute faces ever put to page.    Though the fight itself ends on a bit of a let down. Much is made about Maka resonating with Soul and giving into the black blood, but that ends up not mattering much as the fight resolves in a classic power of friendship conclusion. Don't get me wrong: Crona's backstory is emotionally affecting, and Maka reaching out to them with unconditional compassion is probably the best character moment in the series so far. But it doesn't quite match the tension and personal stakes that led up to it, and it leaves the whole black blood storyline feeling anticlimactic when it should be a huge turning point.    But the star of the show here is the Kishin himself, as the rest of the cast predictably fail to prevent his awakening. The sequence of Free and Eruka approaching his resting place is the most palpable horror in the manga so far, and it's followed up by a gloriously gross sequence of body horror as the Kishin literally puts himself back together skin-first. In classic Big Bad fashion he crushes our heroes with barely a whisper, and the only downside is that his fight with Lord Death has to be cut short so we can set up for the next arc. Again, that's predictable for this kind of shonen story, but it's still a tiny bit deflating to close things out with the new, dangerous villain running away. This is also supposed to be a sample of what Lord Death is capable of himself, and it winds up a pretty underwhelming showing for the guy.    Fittingly, Volume 5 is all about establishing the new conflict, introducing new characters on both sides as Ashura's awakening stirs up the rest of the world. On the good guys side, we're introduced to three of Lord Death's other Death Scythe weapons, each with their own quirks and powers. And like much of Ohkubo's extended cast, they're a mixed bag to start, as we initially learn about them through their singular comedic gimmicks. Marie Mjolnir has a great design and likable personality, but she's also obsessed with finding a husband, and that joke gets old fast. Similarly, Justin Law is a great fighter and has an interesting backstory as a solo Demon Weapon who became a Death Scythe at just 13, but his joke about always having his earbuds in wears out its welcome in record time. Azusa Yumi has probably the coolest powers of any Weapon outside Tsubaki, but is defined as the by-the-books straightwoman of the group and doesn't get much to do initially. They're not terrible, but by the end of the volume I was really wishing to see them get serious and stop goofing around. This formula works well with the kids because we already know their personalities beyond the tired gimmicks, but it's a chore to get through with a ton of new people.    The real treats come with the new villains introduced. Ashura himself is still off in the distance, but his resurrection spurs the revival of Arachne, a powerful spider-themed witch who immediately steals any page she's on. Her subordinate weapon, Giriko, leaves a little to be desired, as he initially just feels like a meaner version of Free. But his chainsaw powers make for some wild fights that more than made up for his retread personality. Their diminutive old butler(?) Mr. Mosquito has a striking, cartoony design that makes him stand out among Ohkubo's other villains, and his condescending attitude towards Giriko breathes a lot of life to this new primary villain group. Add in Medusa returning – by possessing the body of an innocent little girl, no less – and we have a great new villain group even before the return of Mifune, who's been forced to fight on their side under threat to Angela's life.    The following volume is more scattered, as we now need to introduce a common goal for the sides to scrap over while Ashura remains a looming hypothetical threat. This comes in the form of a search for the Demon Tools, designed centuries ago by a mysterious sorcerer named Eibon and scattered across the world. Volume 6 is bookended with two different quests for these tools, and makes for some of the best action in the series so far.    Kid's skateboard race against an enchanted train across the desert is a real highlight. It's a fast-paced and unique action setpiece, coupled with a three-way fight between Kid and both Arachne and Medusa's cronies that works as great spectacle and a nice highlight for the main kid who had the least to do in the previous arc. The closing battle in a snowy maelstrom doesn't get a conclusion in this volume, but it's got a lot of great, classic shonen moments for some of the side cast. Sid and his partner Mira, along with Death Scythe Azusa, have a fantastic and tactical fight against Mifune that shows off Ohkubo's improved eye for melee combat, packed with lots of inventive twists involving both the snowy landscape and Sid's zombie body. Meanwhile a secondary team of DWMA students actually get to shine instead of Maka and co, which is always welcome in battle series with huge casts. The big, important fight is of course being saved for our main crew, but it's still nice that Kirikou and his team can show off their stuff for a bit.    Outside of the action, the forces of darkness are still active in other ways. Ashura's awakening is causing a stirring of madness among the general populous, and especially in Dr. Stein, who's slowly being consumed by his inner darkness. But the real kicker is when Medusa slithers back into Crona's life just as they're starting to make friends at DWMA, and convinces her abused child to betray them and become her spy inside the school. After the progress we saw Crona make after their fight with Maka, it's genuinely heartbreaking to see this backslide, retreating into the madness and fear that once defined their entire personhood. It's by far the most affecting character arc right now by miles, easily eclipsing the rather pat teamwork lessons Maka and Black Star deal with during a training chapter here.    Unfortunately there is one big, obnoxious zit on volume six's face, and its name is Excalibur. For reasons I can't comprehend, the story interrupts itself for a full-length comedy chapter about Hero, a total gag character, teaming up with Excalibur to take over the school and get revenge on everyone who looks down on him. As somebody who also loves committing to overlong comedic bits for the sole purpose of annoying the reader, I can at least appreciate the idea behind Excalibur, but that doesn't make his dialogue any less of a chore to sit through. Add in some much un-needed skirt flipping and boob groping jokes and you have a chapter comprising all the worst elements of Soul Eater here, breaking up the rising tension of its story and character arcs. Maybe this would have worked better in the original collected volumes, but with The Perfect Edition's expanded chapter count per-book, it absolutely kills the tension while reading the volume on its own.    Other than that blemish, these volumes represent a solid, if somewhat inconsistent, new arc for Soul Eater's overarching story. The biggest complaint – besides Excalibur – is that the expanding scope of the story leaves Maka and Soul feeling underutilized and out of focus. That's perhaps to be expected as a series with such a huge cast goes on, but after their partnership defined so much of the conflict before this, it feels like the series doesn't quite know what to do with them besides occasionally hinting at the return of the black blood demon. But on its own, this is an effective, often thrilling chunk of storytelling and offers some fantastic highlights.

Review   by Nicholas Dupree, Mar 27th 2022       Soul Eater - The Perfect Edition GN 4-6                      Synopsis:             Medusa's scheme is barreling forward, and it's left to Maka, Soul, and their fellow students to stop her servants from awakening the hellacious Kishin sealed beneath Death City. But standing between our heroes and their goal is a rematch with the deranged Demon Sword Ragnarok and his unhinged Meister, Crona. Can Maka and Soul overcome the foe who all but slaughtered them before, even as the malicious black blood in Soul's body continues to fester? If they can't, a madness 800 years in the making will be unleashed upon an unwitting world.      Review:         Synopsis:        Medusa's scheme is barreling forward, and it's left to Maka, Soul, and their fellow students to stop her servants from awakening the hellacious Kishin sealed beneath Death City. But standing between our heroes and their goal is a rematch with the deranged Demon Sword Ragnarok and his unhinged Meister, Crona. Can Maka and Soul overcome the foe who all but slaughtered them before, even as the malicious black blood in Soul's body continues to fester? If they can't, a madness 800 years in the making will be unleashed upon an unwitting world.     Review:            Volume four of The Perfect Edition sees Soul Eater in pure, shonen action mode. It's the classic setup of an evil villain waiting at the end of a gauntlet of enemies, with each of our major characters getting a battle against an established baddie as they duke it out for the fate of the world. The main event is the rematch between Maka, Soul, and the Ragnarok duo, and it's some Grade A shonen fighting goodness. While the various beats it hits are pretty standard, they're delivered with the series' signature style and Ohkubo's exaggerated choreography, and thus land with a ton of impact, especially once “mad” Maka takes over and delivers some of the goofiest creepy-cute faces ever put to page.    Though the fight itself ends on a bit of a let down. Much is made about Maka resonating with Soul and giving into the black blood, but that ends up not mattering much as the fight resolves in a classic power of friendship conclusion. Don't get me wrong: Crona's backstory is emotionally affecting, and Maka reaching out to them with unconditional compassion is probably the best character moment in the series so far. But it doesn't quite match the tension and personal stakes that led up to it, and it leaves the whole black blood storyline feeling anticlimactic when it should be a huge turning point.    But the star of the show here is the Kishin himself, as the rest of the cast predictably fail to prevent his awakening. The sequence of Free and Eruka approaching his resting place is the most palpable horror in the manga so far, and it's followed up by a gloriously gross sequence of body horror as the Kishin literally puts himself back together skin-first. In classic Big Bad fashion he crushes our heroes with barely a whisper, and the only downside is that his fight with Lord Death has to be cut short so we can set up for the next arc. Again, that's predictable for this kind of shonen story, but it's still a tiny bit deflating to close things out with the new, dangerous villain running away. This is also supposed to be a sample of what Lord Death is capable of himself, and it winds up a pretty underwhelming showing for the guy.    Fittingly, Volume 5 is all about establishing the new conflict, introducing new characters on both sides as Ashura's awakening stirs up the rest of the world. On the good guys side, we're introduced to three of Lord Death's other Death Scythe weapons, each with their own quirks and powers. And like much of Ohkubo's extended cast, they're a mixed bag to start, as we initially learn about them through their singular comedic gimmicks. Marie Mjolnir has a great design and likable personality, but she's also obsessed with finding a husband, and that joke gets old fast. Similarly, Justin Law is a great fighter and has an interesting backstory as a solo Demon Weapon who became a Death Scythe at just 13, but his joke about always having his earbuds in wears out its welcome in record time. Azusa Yumi has probably the coolest powers of any Weapon outside Tsubaki, but is defined as the by-the-books straightwoman of the group and doesn't get much to do initially. They're not terrible, but by the end of the volume I was really wishing to see them get serious and stop goofing around. This formula works well with the kids because we already know their personalities beyond the tired gimmicks, but it's a chore to get through with a ton of new people.    The real treats come with the new villains introduced. Ashura himself is still off in the distance, but his resurrection spurs the revival of Arachne, a powerful spider-themed witch who immediately steals any page she's on. Her subordinate weapon, Giriko, leaves a little to be desired, as he initially just feels like a meaner version of Free. But his chainsaw powers make for some wild fights that more than made up for his retread personality. Their diminutive old butler(?) Mr. Mosquito has a striking, cartoony design that makes him stand out among Ohkubo's other villains, and his condescending attitude towards Giriko breathes a lot of life to this new primary villain group. Add in Medusa returning – by possessing the body of an innocent little girl, no less – and we have a great new villain group even before the return of Mifune, who's been forced to fight on their side under threat to Angela's life.    The following volume is more scattered, as we now need to introduce a common goal for the sides to scrap over while Ashura remains a looming hypothetical threat. This comes in the form of a search for the Demon Tools, designed centuries ago by a mysterious sorcerer named Eibon and scattered across the world. Volume 6 is bookended with two different quests for these tools, and makes for some of the best action in the series so far.    Kid's skateboard race against an enchanted train across the desert is a real highlight. It's a fast-paced and unique action setpiece, coupled with a three-way fight between Kid and both Arachne and Medusa's cronies that works as great spectacle and a nice highlight for the main kid who had the least to do in the previous arc. The closing battle in a snowy maelstrom doesn't get a conclusion in this volume, but it's got a lot of great, classic shonen moments for some of the side cast. Sid and his partner Mira, along with Death Scythe Azusa, have a fantastic and tactical fight against Mifune that shows off Ohkubo's improved eye for melee combat, packed with lots of inventive twists involving both the snowy landscape and Sid's zombie body. Meanwhile a secondary team of DWMA students actually get to shine instead of Maka and co, which is always welcome in battle series with huge casts. The big, important fight is of course being saved for our main crew, but it's still nice that Kirikou and his team can show off their stuff for a bit.    Outside of the action, the forces of darkness are still active in other ways. Ashura's awakening is causing a stirring of madness among the general populous, and especially in Dr. Stein, who's slowly being consumed by his inner darkness. But the real kicker is when Medusa slithers back into Crona's life just as they're starting to make friends at DWMA, and convinces her abused child to betray them and become her spy inside the school. After the progress we saw Crona make after their fight with Maka, it's genuinely heartbreaking to see this backslide, retreating into the madness and fear that once defined their entire personhood. It's by far the most affecting character arc right now by miles, easily eclipsing the rather pat teamwork lessons Maka and Black Star deal with during a training chapter here.    Unfortunately there is one big, obnoxious zit on volume six's face, and its name is Excalibur. For reasons I can't comprehend, the story interrupts itself for a full-length comedy chapter about Hero, a total gag character, teaming up with Excalibur to take over the school and get revenge on everyone who looks down on him. As somebody who also loves committing to overlong comedic bits for the sole purpose of annoying the reader, I can at least appreciate the idea behind Excalibur, but that doesn't make his dialogue any less of a chore to sit through. Add in some much un-needed skirt flipping and boob groping jokes and you have a chapter comprising all the worst elements of Soul Eater here, breaking up the rising tension of its story and character arcs. Maybe this would have worked better in the original collected volumes, but with The Perfect Edition's expanded chapter count per-book, it absolutely kills the tension while reading the volume on its own.    Other than that blemish, these volumes represent a solid, if somewhat inconsistent, new arc for Soul Eater's overarching story.

Review   by Nicholas Dupree, Mar 27th 2022       Soul Eater - The Perfect Edition GN 4-6                      Synopsis:             Medusa's scheme is barreling forward, and it's left to Maka, Soul, and their fellow students to stop her servants from awakening the hellacious Kishin sealed beneath Death City. But standing between our heroes and their goal is a rematch with the deranged Demon Sword Ragnarok and his unhinged Meister, Crona. Can Maka and Soul overcome the foe who all but slaughtered them before, even as the malicious black blood in Soul's body continues to fester? If they can't, a madness 800 years in the making will be unleashed upon an unwitting world.      Review:         Synopsis:        Medusa's scheme is barreling forward, and it's left to Maka, Soul, and their fellow students to stop her servants from awakening the hellacious Kishin sealed beneath Death City. But standing between our heroes and their goal is a rematch with the deranged Demon Sword Ragnarok and his unhinged Meister, Crona. Can Maka and Soul overcome the foe who all but slaughtered them before, even as the malicious black blood in Soul's body continues to fester? If they can't, a madness 800 years in the making will be unleashed upon an unwitting world.     Review:            Volume four of The Perfect Edition sees Soul Eater in pure, shonen action mode. It's the classic setup of an evil villain waiting at the end of a gauntlet of enemies, with each of our major characters getting a battle against an established baddie as they duke it out for the fate of the world. The main event is the rematch between Maka, Soul, and the Ragnarok duo, and it's some Grade A shonen fighting goodness. While the various beats it hits are pretty standard, they're delivered with the series' signature style and Ohkubo's exaggerated choreography, and thus land with a ton of impact, especially once “mad” Maka takes over and delivers some of the goofiest creepy-cute faces ever put to page.    Though the fight itself ends on a bit of a let down. Much is made about Maka resonating with Soul and giving into the black blood, but that ends up not mattering much as the fight resolves in a classic power of friendship conclusion. Don't get me wrong: Crona's backstory is emotionally affecting, and Maka reaching out to them with unconditional compassion is probably the best character moment in the series so far. But it doesn't quite match the tension and personal stakes that led up to it, and it leaves the whole black blood storyline feeling anticlimactic when it should be a huge turning point.    But the star of the show here is the Kishin himself, as the rest of the cast predictably fail to prevent his awakening. The sequence of Free and Eruka approaching his resting place is the most palpable horror in the manga so far, and it's followed up by a gloriously gross sequence of body horror as the Kishin literally puts himself back together skin-first. In classic Big Bad fashion he crushes our heroes with barely a whisper, and the only downside is that his fight with Lord Death has to be cut short so we can set up for the next arc. Again, that's predictable for this kind of shonen story, but it's still a tiny bit deflating to close things out with the new, dangerous villain running away. This is also supposed to be a sample of what Lord Death is capable of himself, and it winds up a pretty underwhelming showing for the guy.    Fittingly, Volume 5 is all about establishing the new conflict, introducing new characters on both sides as Ashura's awakening stirs up the rest of the world. On the good guys side, we're introduced to three of Lord Death's other Death Scythe weapons, each with their own quirks and powers. And like much of Ohkubo's extended cast, they're a mixed bag to start, as we initially learn about them through their singular comedic gimmicks. Marie Mjolnir has a great design and likable personality, but she's also obsessed with finding a husband, and that joke gets old fast. Similarly, Justin Law is a great fighter and has an interesting backstory as a solo Demon Weapon who became a Death Scythe at just 13, but his joke about always having his earbuds in wears out its welcome in record time. Azusa Yumi has probably the coolest powers of any Weapon outside Tsubaki, but is defined as the by-the-books straightwoman of the group and doesn't get much to do initially. They're not terrible, but by the end of the volume I was really wishing to see them get serious and stop goofing around. This formula works well with the kids because we already know their personalities beyond the tired gimmicks, but it's a chore to get through with a ton of new people.    The real treats come with the new villains introduced. Ashura himself is still off in the distance, but his resurrection spurs the revival of Arachne, a powerful spider-themed witch who immediately steals any page she's on. Her subordinate weapon, Giriko, leaves a little to be desired, as he initially just feels like a meaner version of Free. But his chainsaw powers make for some wild fights that more than made up for his retread personality. Their diminutive old butler(?) Mr. Mosquito has a striking, cartoony design that makes him stand out among Ohkubo's other villains, and his condescending attitude towards Giriko breathes a lot of life to this new primary villain group. Add in Medusa returning – by possessing the body of an innocent little girl, no less – and we have a great new villain group even before the return of Mifune, who's been forced to fight on their side under threat to Angela's life.    The following volume is more scattered, as we now need to introduce a common goal for the sides to scrap over while Ashura remains a looming hypothetical threat. This comes in the form of a search for the Demon Tools, designed centuries ago by a mysterious sorcerer named Eibon and scattered across the world. Volume 6 is bookended with two different quests for these tools, and makes for some of the best action in the series so far.    Kid's skateboard race against an enchanted train across the desert is a real highlight. It's a fast-paced and unique action setpiece, coupled with a three-way fight between Kid and both Arachne and Medusa's cronies that works as great spectacle and a nice highlight for the main kid who had the least to do in the previous arc. The closing battle in a snowy maelstrom doesn't get a conclusion in this volume, but it's got a lot of great, classic shonen moments for some of the side cast. Sid and his partner Mira, along with Death Scythe Azusa, have a fantastic and tactical fight against Mifune that shows off Ohkubo's improved eye for melee combat, packed with lots of inventive twists involving both the snowy landscape and Sid's zombie body. Meanwhile a secondary team of DWMA students actually get to shine instead of Maka and co, which is always welcome in battle series with huge casts. The big, important fight is of course being saved for our main crew, but it's still nice that Kirikou and his team can show off their stuff for a bit.    Outside of the action, the forces of darkness are still active in other ways. Ashura's awakening is causing a stirring of madness among the general populous, and especially in Dr. Stein, who's slowly being consumed by his inner darkness. But the real kicker is when Medusa slithers back into Crona's life just as they're starting to make friends at DWMA, and convinces her abused child to betray them and become her spy inside the school. After the progress we saw Crona make after their fight with Maka, it's genuinely heartbreaking to see this backslide, retreating into the madness and fear that once defined their entire personhood. It's by far the most affecting character arc right now by miles, easily eclipsing the rather pat teamwork lessons Maka and Black Star deal with during a training chapter here.    Unfortunately there is one big, obnoxious zit on volume six's face, and its name is Excalibur. For reasons I can't comprehend, the story interrupts itself for a full-length comedy chapter about Hero, a total gag character, teaming up with Excalibur to take over the school and get revenge on everyone who looks down on him. As somebody who also loves committing to overlong comedic bits for the sole purpose of annoying the reader, I can at least appreciate the idea behind Excalibur, but that doesn't make his dialogue any less of a chore to sit through. Add in some much un-needed skirt flipping and boob groping jokes and you have a chapter comprising all the worst elements of Soul Eater here, breaking up the rising tension of its story and character arcs. Maybe this would have worked better in the original collected volumes, but with The Perfect Edition's expanded chapter count per-book, it absolutely kills the tension while reading the volume on its own.    Other than that blemish, these volumes represent a solid, if somewhat inconsistent, new arc for Soul Eater's overarching story. The biggest complaint – besides Excalibur – is that the expanding scope of the story leaves Maka and Soul feeling underutilized and out of focus. That's perhaps to be expected as a series with such a huge cast goes on, but after their partnership defined so much of the conflict before this, it feels like the series doesn't quite know what to do with them besides occasionally hinting at the return of the black blood demon. But on its own, this is an effective, often thrilling chunk of storytelling and offers some fantastic highlights.             Grade:      Overall : B+ Story : B+ Art : A  + Entertaining new villains, fantastic action highlights, Crona's arc is the most compelling drama in the series so far − Some anticlimactic finishes, new heroes take some time to warm up to, Excalibur is here            discuss this in the forum |        bookmark/share with:                  				Add this manga to 				               Production Info:        Story & Art: Atsushi Ohkubo   Full encyclopedia details aboutSoul Eater (manga)        Review homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature                The Best and Worst of Winter 2022   Apr  6, 10:10                 anime    With the last few episodes trailing into Spring like an April's fool, it's time to look at the final ranking of the Winter 2022 season.

Azusa Yumi has probably the coolest powers of any Weapon outside Tsubaki, but is defined as the by-the-books straightwoman of the group and doesn't get much to do initially. They're not terrible, but by the end of the volume I was really wishing to see them get serious and stop goofing around. This formula works well with the kids because we already know their personalities beyond the tired gimmicks, but it's a chore to get through with a ton of new people.    The real treats come with the new villains introduced. Ashura himself is still off in the distance, but his resurrection spurs the revival of Arachne, a powerful spider-themed witch who immediately steals any page she's on. Her subordinate weapon, Giriko, leaves a little to be desired, as he initially just feels like a meaner version of Free. But his chainsaw powers make for some wild fights that more than made up for his retread personality. Their diminutive old butler(?) Mr. Mosquito has a striking, cartoony design that makes him stand out among Ohkubo's other villains, and his condescending attitude towards Giriko breathes a lot of life to this new primary villain group. Add in Medusa returning – by possessing the body of an innocent little girl, no less – and we have a great new villain group even before the return of Mifune, who's been forced to fight on their side under threat to Angela's life.    The following volume is more scattered, as we now need to introduce a common goal for the sides to scrap over while Ashura remains a looming hypothetical threat. This comes in the form of a search for the Demon Tools, designed centuries ago by a mysterious sorcerer named Eibon and scattered across the world. Volume 6 is bookended with two different quests for these tools, and makes for some of the best action in the series so far.    Kid's skateboard race against an enchanted train across the desert is a real highlight. It's a fast-paced and unique action setpiece, coupled with a three-way fight between Kid and both Arachne and Medusa's cronies that works as great spectacle and a nice highlight for the main kid who had the least to do in the previous arc. The closing battle in a snowy maelstrom doesn't get a conclusion in this volume, but it's got a lot of great, classic shonen moments for some of the side cast. Sid and his partner Mira, along with Death Scythe Azusa, have a fantastic and tactical fight against Mifune that shows off Ohkubo's improved eye for melee combat, packed with lots of inventive twists involving both the snowy landscape and Sid's zombie body. Meanwhile a secondary team of DWMA students actually get to shine instead of Maka and co, which is always welcome in battle series with huge casts. The big, important fight is of course being saved for our main crew, but it's still nice that Kirikou and his team can show off their stuff for a bit.    Outside of the action, the forces of darkness are still active in other ways. Ashura's awakening is causing a stirring of madness among the general populous, and especially in Dr. Stein, who's slowly being consumed by his inner darkness. But the real kicker is when Medusa slithers back into Crona's life just as they're starting to make friends at DWMA, and convinces her abused child to betray them and become her spy inside the school. After the progress we saw Crona make after their fight with Maka, it's genuinely heartbreaking to see this backslide, retreating into the madness and fear that once defined their entire personhood. It's by far the most affecting character arc right now by miles, easily eclipsing the rather pat teamwork lessons Maka and Black Star deal with during a training chapter here.    Unfortunately there is one big, obnoxious zit on volume six's face, and its name is Excalibur. For reasons I can't comprehend, the story interrupts itself for a full-length comedy chapter about Hero, a total gag character, teaming up with Excalibur to take over the school and get revenge on everyone who looks down on him. As somebody who also loves committing to overlong comedic bits for the sole purpose of annoying the reader, I can at least appreciate the idea behind Excalibur, but that doesn't make his dialogue any less of a chore to sit through. Add in some much un-needed skirt flipping and boob groping jokes and you have a chapter comprising all the worst elements of Soul Eater here, breaking up the rising tension of its story and character arcs. Maybe this would have worked better in the original collected volumes, but with The Perfect Edition's expanded chapter count per-book, it absolutely kills the tension while reading the volume on its own.    Other than that blemish, these volumes represent a solid, if somewhat inconsistent, new arc for Soul Eater's overarching story. The biggest complaint – besides Excalibur – is that the expanding scope of the story leaves Maka and Soul feeling underutilized and out of focus. That's perhaps to be expected as a series with such a huge cast goes on, but after their partnership defined so much of the conflict before this, it feels like the series doesn't quite know what to do with them besides occasionally hinting at the return of the black blood demon. But on its own, this is an effective, often thrilling chunk of storytelling and offers some fantastic highlights.             Grade:      Overall : B+ Story : B+ Art : A  + Entertaining new villains, fantastic action highlights, Crona's arc is the most compelling drama in the series so far − Some anticlimactic finishes, new heroes take some time to warm up to, Excalibur is here            discuss this in the forum |        bookmark/share with:                  				Add this manga to 				               Production Info:        Story & Art: Atsushi Ohkubo   Full encyclopedia details aboutSoul Eater (manga)        Review homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature                The Best and Worst of Winter 2022   Apr  6, 10:10                 anime    With the last few episodes trailing into Spring like an April's fool, it's time to look at the final ranking of the Winter 2022 season.

I don't know if print is up for consideration, but Shucream has already put out two titles by Keri Kusabi in English digitally on Bookwalker and MangaPlaza.   Personally I'd be happy if they just expanded the range of ebook stores they're planning on selling their books on, because they have a title by akabeko coming up in their lineup, but I don't want to buy on either platform they're using right now.

News A Couple of Cuckoos Anime Reveals Half-Year Run, Mini-Anime, Opening Sequence   posted on 2022-04-06 19:53 UTC-8 by Egan Loo          Kiyoe Yoshioka performs opening song ""Dekoboko""    The official website for the television anime of Miki Yoshikawa's A Couple of Cuckoos (Kakkō no Iinazuke) manga posted the main anime's continuous half-year run, mini-anime, and clean opening sequence on Wednesday. Kiyoe Yoshioka performs the opening theme song ""Dekoboko"" (Bumpy).        The anime will run for two cours (quarters of the year) with no breaks in between. The spinoff mini anime Kakkō no Iikagen will premiere on Kadokawa Anime's YouTube channel on April 28.       Kodansha Comics publishes the manga in English, and it describes the romantic comedy:    16-year-old super-studier Nagi Umino, second-year student at the Megurogawa Academy high school, was switched at birth. On his way to a dinner to meet his birth parents, he accidentally meets the brash, outspoken, Erika Amano, who is determined to make Nagi her fake boyfriend as she never wants to actually marry. But once Nagi makes it to dinner, he finds his parents have decided to resolve the hospital switch by conveniently having him marry the daughter his birth parents raised...who turns out to be none other than Erika herself!   The anime will star Kaito Ishikawa as Nagi Umino, Akari Kitō as Erika Amano, and Nao Tōyama as Hiro Segawa. Other cast members include:     Ryohei Kimura as Yōhei Umino, Nagi's father  Yōko Hikasa as Namie Umino, Nagi's mother  Toshiyuki Morikawa as Sōichirō Amano, Erika's father  Yukiko Aruga as Rituko Amano, Erika's mother   Hiroaki Akagi (Karakai Jōzu no Takagi-san, Those Snow White Notes) is the chief director of the anime and Yoshiyuki Shirahata (episode director for Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle, Great Pretender) is directing the anime at Shinei Animation and Synergy SP. Yasuhiro Nakanishi (Kaguya-sama: Love is War both seasons, Toilet-Bound Hanako-kun) is overseeing the series scripts, and Aya Takano (Karakai Jōzu no Takagi-san, Polar Bear's Café) is designing the characters. Ikimono-gakari vocalist Kiyoe Yoshioka performs the opening theme song ""Dekoboko"" (Rough), as heard in the video above.    Sangatsu no Phantasia performs the anime's ending theme song ""Shikaku Unmei"" (Square Destiny).    The anime will premiere in the NUMAnimation programming block on TV Asahi and its affiliates on April 23. Crunchyroll will stream the anime outside Japan.

News A Couple of Cuckoos Anime Reveals Half-Year Run, Mini-Anime, Opening Sequence   posted on 2022-04-06 19:53 UTC-8 by Egan Loo          Kiyoe Yoshioka performs opening song ""Dekoboko""    The official website for the television anime of Miki Yoshikawa's A Couple of Cuckoos (Kakkō no Iinazuke) manga posted the main anime's continuous half-year run, mini-anime, and clean opening sequence on Wednesday. Kiyoe Yoshioka performs the opening theme song ""Dekoboko"" (Bumpy).        The anime will run for two cours (quarters of the year) with no breaks in between. The spinoff mini anime Kakkō no Iikagen will premiere on Kadokawa Anime's YouTube channel on April 28.       Kodansha Comics publishes the manga in English, and it describes the romantic comedy:    16-year-old super-studier Nagi Umino, second-year student at the Megurogawa Academy high school, was switched at birth. On his way to a dinner to meet his birth parents, he accidentally meets the brash, outspoken, Erika Amano, who is determined to make Nagi her fake boyfriend as she never wants to actually marry. But once Nagi makes it to dinner, he finds his parents have decided to resolve the hospital switch by conveniently having him marry the daughter his birth parents raised...who turns out to be none other than Erika herself!   The anime will star Kaito Ishikawa as Nagi Umino, Akari Kitō as Erika Amano, and Nao Tōyama as Hiro Segawa. Other cast members include:     Ryohei Kimura as Yōhei Umino, Nagi's father  Yōko Hikasa as Namie Umino, Nagi's mother  Toshiyuki Morikawa as Sōichirō Amano, Erika's father  Yukiko Aruga as Rituko Amano, Erika's mother   Hiroaki Akagi (Karakai Jōzu no Takagi-san, Those Snow White Notes) is the chief director of the anime and Yoshiyuki Shirahata (episode director for Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle, Great Pretender) is directing the anime at Shinei Animation and Synergy SP. Yasuhiro Nakanishi (Kaguya-sama: Love is War both seasons, Toilet-Bound Hanako-kun) is overseeing the series scripts, and Aya Takano (Karakai Jōzu no Takagi-san, Polar Bear's Café) is designing the characters. Ikimono-gakari vocalist Kiyoe Yoshioka performs the opening theme song ""Dekoboko"" (Rough), as heard in the video above.    Sangatsu no Phantasia performs the anime's ending theme song ""Shikaku Unmei"" (Square Destiny).    The anime will premiere in the NUMAnimation programming block on TV Asahi and its affiliates on April 23. Crunchyroll will stream the anime outside Japan.    Yoshikawa (Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches, Yankee-kun to Megane-chan) launched the A Couple of Cuckoos (Kakkō no Iinazuke) manga in Kodansha's Weekly Shōnen Magazine in January 2020. Kodansha published the manga's 11th compiled book volume on Thursday. The manga received a novel that shipped in April 2021.    Shueisha's Young Jump magazine revealed in February that Yoshikawa's manga will have a collaboration with Aka Akasaka and Mengo Yokoyari's Oshi no Ko manga.
