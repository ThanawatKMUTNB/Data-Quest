By Louis Kemner Published 2 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    WARNING: The following contains spoilers for Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove It Season 2, Episode 1, now streaming on Crunchyroll. Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove It is a charming edutainment anime series starring the lovestruck grad students Himuro Ayame and Yukimura Shinya, who are determined to use the power of science to ascertain whether their mutual affection is genuine. Only hard data can prove their love, or so they believed in Season 1. Season 2 has now begun, and the premiere episode calls into question everything Shinya and Ayame hold dear about their relationship and their scientific methods. The new power couple, Fujiwara Suyiu and Chris Florette, recently challenged them to a battle of what true love really is, transforming the series into a true battle shonen title in the process.  RELATED: Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie: Everything to Know Before the Anime Starts How Science Fell In Love Became A Battle Shonen                  During the events of Season 1, Science Fell in Love was best compared to other ""battle of wits"" romantic series such as Kaguya-sama: Love is War -- which, incidentally, is also returning in the Spring 2022 anime season. Kaguya-Sama and Science Fell in Love both feature intelligent but romantically clueless main lovers who would rather use tricks, traps and exhaustive analysis than tried-and-true romantic gestures, since these characters are too smart (and too proud) for their own good. However, unlike Shinomiya Kaguya and Shirogane Miyuki, Shinya and Ayame aren't trying to force a confession out of the other, although they are willing to question and disprove each other's methods during these experiments. And while the cool-headed kuudere Yukimura Shinya often tries to keep the lovey-dovey Ayame at bay, he certainly loves her back, and she is more her teammate than her rival. So, they need an external foe to face, and Season 2 gives them one -- the Chris-Suiu pair. Shinya and Ayame are no longer merely testing each other's theories or questioning their worthiness in this relationship. They now have a shonen-style rivalry on their hands, complete with Dragon Ball Z-inspired visuals and even a combat system to match. Chris and his playful sadodere girlfriend Suiu are a real power couple who don't feel like they need to prove anything at all, and they have superior oxytocin levels as well. In Season 2's first episode, for example, Shinya and Ayame took on the Chris-Suiu pair in a series of experiments, only to get trounced by the lab results. Their oxytocin levels can't compare to Chris and Suiu's, and Chris even questions the validity of Ayame and Shinya's entire relationship. Now Ayame and Shinya have a rival party to prove themselves to, and as shonen underdogs, they'll have to get resourceful and fight hard against a foe that has all the advantages. This man-vs-man conflict changes the tone of Science Fell in Love, although it's not clear how long that might last. RELATED: How My Dress-Up Darling's Marin and Gojo Built Anime's Healthiest Friendship The Future Of Science Fell In Love                  So far, it's hard to say whether this new two-vs-two rivalry will define most of Science Fell in Love's second season or if this shonen-style rivalry will only last for one or two episodes before the story moves on to something entirely different. Chris and Suiu might become major players in Season 2 as a well-established couple to challenge the Shinya-Ayame pair, but they might just as easily fade into the background to make room for other new characters to be introduced and interact with the protagonists. Either way, Science Fell in Love has the potential to continue its shonen battle theme, and it's possible that Chris and Suiu are merely the first couple of several to challenge Shinya and Ayame. Season 1 kept itself confined to the main characters, but it's time to expand the scope of the story, and Ayame and Shinya already got a taste of what it's like to compare their budding romance with that of other couples. They were humiliated in the season's first battle, but given how curious and persistent these lab lovebirds are, this challenge will likely motivate them to keep it up and fight more romantic battles in the future until they can score a decisive victory. Science is more than lab coats and beakers -- it's about testing and challenging data, exploring new ideas, comparing things and more. Combined with concrete battle systems such as comparing oxytocin levels, this may allow Science Fell in Love to permanently alter its narrative in Season 2 and leave behind the Kaguya-style antics of Season 1. Now is the time to challenge Ayame and Shinya in new ways, and they appear eager for that challenge. They'll take on all comers to calculate which couple is truly the best.

By Louis Kemner Published 4 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    WARNING: The following contains spoilers for episode 1 of Aharen-san is Indecipherable, ""Isn't This Too Close?"", now streaming on Crunchyroll. The Spring 2022 anime season is here, and it brings a variety of wholesome new and returning anime with it, including Aharen-san is Indecipherable. This brand-new anime is set in a typical high school where the ordinary but kind Raido gets to know his quiet next-door neighbor in class, Aharen Reina. Episode 1 of Aharen-san is Indecipherable launches a heartwarming relationship between Raido and his tiny classmate, and in the process, Aharen-san viewers should be reminded of similar anime shows such as Komi Can't Communicate, which also streams this season. However, there are a few factors setting these two high school series apart.  RELATED: Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie: Everything to Know Before the Anime Starts                  In Episode 1 of Aharen-san is Indecipherable, the ordinary student Raido glances at the tiny student to his left, the shy kuudere Aharen Reina, who hardly says a word in class, even when the teacher calls on her. Stranger still, when Raido speaks to her, Aharen responds with silent lip movements and little more. Raido can't tell if Aharen is really quiet, or even if she intends to be heard at all. Raido, however, is not the type to just give up on a mystery or leave a lonely person alone, as his actions during Episode 1 prove. Similar to Komi Can't Communicate's protagonist Tadano Hitohto, Raido is a plain guy with a heart of gold, and he sets the story into motion when he resolves to become Aharen's friend and have his first proper conversation with her. He must suspect that Aharen is terribly lonely, and he is proven right later in the episode. Bit by bit, Raido builds a relationship with Aharen and learns the truth: Aharen is a perfectly normal girl who wants to have friends, but she is difficult to hear, and the other girls in her middle school class thought she was weird and pushed her out of their social group. By now, Aharen is a typical anime kuudere; a soft-spoken and unexpressive character who will only express their loving side to the right person and under the right circumstances. Aharen's personality also has elements of the dandere archetype; a meek and shy character who has trouble asserting themselves, much like Komi Shoko herself. Aharen is more of a kuudere than a dandere, but she has enough dandere elements to have overlap with Komi, including having difficulty communicating with others. The series could almost be called Aharen Can't Communicate. RELATED: Science Fell in Love's Season Premiere Continues Anime's New Sadodere Trend                  The rest of Episode 1 continues to build thematic ties with Komi Can't Communicate, which allows viewers to make some loose predictions about where the story and the character arcs may go from here. Even if Aharen is a bit more assertive and expressive than Komi, she still has a long way to go when it comes to communication, expressing her affection and making friends. The way she is now, Aharen has a tentative friendship with Raido, but the two of them have not yet figured out a pattern for their relationship, and things are in flux between them. Aharen must figure out how to balance her assertive side vs. her dandere side as a balanced kuudere, and for his part, Raido must find a way to always understand Aharen when she speaks and enable her without making her too reckless.

If so, Raido must prepare himself to become Aharen's first friend and her first boyfriend. They should both exercise caution and fully understand their own and each other's emotions before committing to anything big, however, since Aharen is just now coming out of her Komi-style shell, and she has to learn to walk before she can run. That's what Komi did, and it should serve Aharen well too.

By Louis Kemner Published 4 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    WARNING: The following contains spoilers for episode 1 of Aharen-san is Indecipherable, ""Isn't This Too Close?"", now streaming on Crunchyroll. The Spring 2022 anime season is here, and it brings a variety of wholesome new and returning anime with it, including Aharen-san is Indecipherable. This brand-new anime is set in a typical high school where the ordinary but kind Raido gets to know his quiet next-door neighbor in class, Aharen Reina. Episode 1 of Aharen-san is Indecipherable launches a heartwarming relationship between Raido and his tiny classmate, and in the process, Aharen-san viewers should be reminded of similar anime shows such as Komi Can't Communicate, which also streams this season. However, there are a few factors setting these two high school series apart.  RELATED: Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie: Everything to Know Before the Anime Starts                  In Episode 1 of Aharen-san is Indecipherable, the ordinary student Raido glances at the tiny student to his left, the shy kuudere Aharen Reina, who hardly says a word in class, even when the teacher calls on her. Stranger still, when Raido speaks to her, Aharen responds with silent lip movements and little more. Raido can't tell if Aharen is really quiet, or even if she intends to be heard at all. Raido, however, is not the type to just give up on a mystery or leave a lonely person alone, as his actions during Episode 1 prove. Similar to Komi Can't Communicate's protagonist Tadano Hitohto, Raido is a plain guy with a heart of gold, and he sets the story into motion when he resolves to become Aharen's friend and have his first proper conversation with her. He must suspect that Aharen is terribly lonely, and he is proven right later in the episode. Bit by bit, Raido builds a relationship with Aharen and learns the truth: Aharen is a perfectly normal girl who wants to have friends, but she is difficult to hear, and the other girls in her middle school class thought she was weird and pushed her out of their social group. By now, Aharen is a typical anime kuudere; a soft-spoken and unexpressive character who will only express their loving side to the right person and under the right circumstances. Aharen's personality also has elements of the dandere archetype; a meek and shy character who has trouble asserting themselves, much like Komi Shoko herself. Aharen is more of a kuudere than a dandere, but she has enough dandere elements to have overlap with Komi, including having difficulty communicating with others. The series could almost be called Aharen Can't Communicate. RELATED: Science Fell in Love's Season Premiere Continues Anime's New Sadodere Trend                  The rest of Episode 1 continues to build thematic ties with Komi Can't Communicate, which allows viewers to make some loose predictions about where the story and the character arcs may go from here. Even if Aharen is a bit more assertive and expressive than Komi, she still has a long way to go when it comes to communication, expressing her affection and making friends. The way she is now, Aharen has a tentative friendship with Raido, but the two of them have not yet figured out a pattern for their relationship, and things are in flux between them. Aharen must figure out how to balance her assertive side vs. her dandere side as a balanced kuudere, and for his part, Raido must find a way to always understand Aharen when she speaks and enable her without making her too reckless. Aharen appears somewhat impressionable in Episode 1, and if Raido isn't careful, he might accidentally encourage Aharen to go way overboard and step into megadere territory. Despite these differences though, Aharen-san is Indecipherable seems likely to follow the same basic story beats as Komi Can't Communicate, including Aharen slowly but surely gaining confidence as she discovers how to make new friends, and her life may become vastly enriched in the process. She will have Raido to thank for all this, and she may express her gratitude through sheer affection and personal loyalty, similar to how Komi eventually developed a crush on her first friend, Tadano. If so, Raido must prepare himself to become Aharen's first friend and her first boyfriend. They should both exercise caution and fully understand their own and each other's emotions before committing to anything big, however, since Aharen is just now coming out of her Komi-style shell, and she has to learn to walk before she can run. That's what Komi did, and it should serve Aharen well too.

What’s the Meaning Behind the Name of This Popular Kyoto Animation Series? Here's a look into the origin and significance of Kyoto Animation's popular mystery anime, Hyouka.      By Ederlyn Peralta Published 5 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    The popular Kyoto Animation series Hyouka is based on a 2001 Japanese mystery novel of the same name by Honobu Yonezawa. The story centers on Kamiyama High School’s Classic Literature Club, which was on the verge of being abolished until Hotaro Oreki’s older sister requested that she join the club. Oreki and the other members of the club -- Eru Chitanda, Satoshi Fukube and Mayaka Ibara -- spend their time solving peculiar mysteries that happen at their school. Hyouka is considered one of the most popular and critically acclaimed anime series produced by Kyoto Animation. Yet, many fans have wondered where the show got its strange name for the title. This mystery can be solved by looking into the first major story arc, where fans get a detailed explanation for Hyouka's title.  RELATED: Over a Decade On, Kimi ni Todoke is Still a Masterpiece of the Romance Anime Genre                  In Episode 3, “The Circumstances of the Classic Lit Club’s Scion,” Chitanda tells Oreki that she joined the Classic Literature Club because of her uncle, Jun Sekitani. She asks Oreki to help her recall a memory of when she talked about the Classic Literature Club with her uncle. This memory is further triggered when she discovers the club’s cultural festival anthology, Hyouka. In the anthology, the opening remarks talk about Sekitani. Soon after, Oreki, Chitanda and the other members hunt for the truth about what happened to him as a student at Kamiyama High School -- and the origin of the club’s anthology name, Hyouka. The answers unfold in Episode 5, “The Truth About the Historic Classic Lit Club.” The group visits the school's librarian, Yōko Kōriyama, who happened to be the president of the Classic Literature Club when Sekitani was involved in the school riots. It's explained that the riots occurred because the faculty wanted to shorten the cultural festival from five days to two days. The students went on strike against the school, which eventually led to an accidental fire at its combat sports facility. Sekitani was forced to take the blame for the riots while the true mastermind remained in the shadows. Chitanda's uncle ends up being expelled from school, but his last request was to have the club’s anthology named Hyouka. RELATED: Science Fell in Love: The Best Lessons of the Science Bear, Rikekuma                  Oreki discovers that the title Hyouka is an oronym: a sequence of words that sound the same as a different sequence in the English language. In Japanese, ""hyouka"" means ""frozen treat,"" while in English the term translates to ice cream -- and the oronym for “ice cream” is “I scream.” At first glance the wordplay seems playful, but it’s referencing something more serious. The title represents Sekitani’s silent frustration and agony for being wrongly expelled. His intention was to send a message to future club members that they should be strong when confronted with the injustices of the world. After discovering the origin of the anthology’s name, “hyouka” becomes a lingering nuance throughout the rest of the series. The Classic Literature Club solves more light-hearted mysteries in contrast to the situation involving Sekitani, but the message of being strong remains relevant as the group must overcome challenges they encounter when solving mysteries.

RELATED: Science Fell in Love: The Best Lessons of the Science Bear, Rikekuma                  Oreki discovers that the title Hyouka is an oronym: a sequence of words that sound the same as a different sequence in the English language. In Japanese, ""hyouka"" means ""frozen treat,"" while in English the term translates to ice cream -- and the oronym for “ice cream” is “I scream.” At first glance the wordplay seems playful, but it’s referencing something more serious. The title represents Sekitani’s silent frustration and agony for being wrongly expelled. His intention was to send a message to future club members that they should be strong when confronted with the injustices of the world. After discovering the origin of the anthology’s name, “hyouka” becomes a lingering nuance throughout the rest of the series. The Classic Literature Club solves more light-hearted mysteries in contrast to the situation involving Sekitani, but the message of being strong remains relevant as the group must overcome challenges they encounter when solving mysteries.

By Louis Kemner Published 19 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    My Dress-Up Darling was an unexpected smash hit of the Winter 2022 anime season, a shojo-style seinen anime series all about the joy of cosplay and the more wholesome side of otaku culture. It is based on the ongoing manga of the same name, so there's no better time for new fans to dive right in and see what the story is all about. At first glance, My Dress-Up Darling appears to be yet another slice-of-life anime series set in a typical Japanese high school, but that is only part of the truth. The series also represents what a healthy and meaningful relationship between two very different people should look like, and it can even double as an edutainment anime that teaches viewers all about how cosplay and modeling work. It has a lot to give in both anime or manga form.  RELATED: My Dress-Up Darling Celebrates Season Finale With New Artwork The Plot Of My Dress-Up Darling                  My Dress-Up Darling's plot focuses on the two main protagonists, the shy doll-maker Gojo Wakana and the cosplay-loving Kitagawa Marin -- and their budding relationship. They meet early in the story as a classic case of opposites attracting, and most importantly, their respective skills and interests align perfectly. Gojo is a studious and handy boy who has experience making doll clothes, while Marin is confident enough to dress up at cosplay events and even perform amateur modeling for magazines. They soon form an exciting new friendship and cosplay partnership, pooling their talents to create the ultimate cosplay one seam, button and wig at a time. Gojo explores a whole new world as he learns more about cosplay and attends events with his new friend Marin, which helps him break out of his shell without making him too uncomfortable in a new lifestyle. Meanwhile, Marin develops her first crush when Gojo calls her beautiful, like a perfect hina doll, and she can't wait to explore the possibility of a true romance with him. She's testing the waters of emotion but isn't yet ready to dive into the world of love until she can master cosplay. Symbolic scenes in the anime allude to this, that Marin can't just dive into her amorous feelings without thinking things through first. In the meantime, she has other new friends such as the sisters Shinju and Sajuna to keep her busy. She might even learn from them -- so long as Sajuna doesn't try to steal Gojo away from her.

Afam will pilot the ASW-G-35 Gundam Hajiroboshi, a mobile suit that shares many design elements with Mikazuki Augus' Gundam Barbatos from the original series. Urdr Hunt's premiere in Japan will also be accompanied by the broadcast of a new ""Special Edition"" of the 2015 anime on Japanese TV. The new version of the show condenses its story from 50 episodes to just nine, but despite the truncated runtime, the show's producers are promising the addition of new ""animation cuts."" The new release will also feature a new opening sequence and theme song, ""Blaze,"" which is performed by the Japanese rock band Man With a Mission. An international release for the new cut of the series has yet to be announced.

By Louis Kemner Published 15 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    Science Fell in Love So I Tried to Prove It is a returning rom-com anime of the spring 2022 anime season. Its story takes place in Saitama University, where a small handful of grad student scientists are determined to use every experiment and formula in the book to determine if they are truly in love. Only the most rigorous testing will reveal the romantic answers in this charming series. It's been a few years since Season 1 of Science Fell in Love so as the much-anticipated Season 2 begins, new and returning fans alike will want to know the main cast and see what makes them tick as both scientists and people. Some of them embody classic anime archetypes and tropes, while others are truly one of a kind.  RELATED: The Best Rom-Com Anime to Watch After Horimiya Yukimura Shinya, The Cool-Headed Love Interest                  Yukimura Shinya is one of the two main lovers in Science Fell in Love, though he doesn't always act like the lovestruck young man he is. In fact, Shinya is a recent example of the kuudere character archetype, a confident character who hides their warm, fuzzy emotions behind a cool and aloof exterior. One day, Shinya received an unexpected love confession from his lab partner Himuro Ayame. While he doesn't like to show it, he is secretly hoping with all his might that their budding romance is genuine -- and will do anything to prove it. Shinya is also the one who, in his boyhood, inspired Ayame to embrace her love of science rather than feel ashamed of it, which may be what drew her to him in the first place. Between the two, Shinya is far less likely to make emotional outbursts or act on a whim, but he might secretly admire Ayame for doing so. That's the kuudere way. RELATED: The Best Light Novel Series With Ridiculously Long Titles Himuro Ayame, The Lovestruck Lab Partner                  The lovely Himuro Ayame is Shinya's lab partner and #1 admirer ever since she received kind words of encouragement from him in her girlhood. For years Ayame has loved science and the answers it can provide for life's everyday questions. Now she's ready to use every formula, instrument and experiment she can think of to determine whether her overflowing affection for Shinya is genuine -- or just superficial attraction. Ayame is more of a poetic romantic than Shinya, being a believer in romantic gestures and more likely to listen to her heart, but she also can't forget her duty as a scientist. Ayame is equally likely to consult a data chart or run experiments on her own heart rate as she is to consult a friend about her feelings, making her better balanced but also slightly more vulnerable than Shinya. She is known for having a real temper when she thinks her love is being threatened. RELATED: Chihayafuru Has Hinted at Potential Romance - But It Isn't Necessary Ibarada Ena Likes To Tease Her Lab Partners                  Shinya and Ayame aren't alone in that lab at Saitama University. They have a few friends who tag along for the ride and comment on their endless love experiments, including the tiny but surprisingly tough Ibarada Ena, who loves sweet snacks, all kinds of video games and frilly clothes under her white lab coat. So far, it doesn't seem Ena has a crush of her own in Science Fell in Love but she does support Shinya and Ayame's budding romance in her own way, sometimes providing input or corrections for Shinya and Ayame's experiments. Ena is also a childhood friend of Inukai Kosuke -- and has him wrapped around her little finger, so to speak. RELATED: The Real-Life Science Behind Science Fell in Love So I Tried to Prove it Inukai Kosuke Loves 2-D Girls                  Inukai Kosuke is Science Fell in Love's comic relief, a somewhat sloppy but well-meaning scientist who is more passionate about dating sim games and waifu pillows than finding work as a scientist after he graduates from Saitama University. He's usually the butt of the jokes, though he is also a trustworthy ally of Shinya's and a good friend to Ena, even if they make fun of him sometimes. Kosuke also delivered a quirky but well thought-out presentation on video game theory at a conference in Okinawa late in Season 1. RELATED: Ranking of Kings: What Exactly Is Miranjo and King Bosse's Relationship? Kanade Kotonoha Believes In True Love, Too                  One of Ayame's best friends in the lab is the easygoing Kanade Kotonoha, who has been a believer in true love ever since her high school days when she nursed a serious crush on a handsome male teacher who helped encourage her curiosity about the world. She plays a minor supporting role in Science Fell in Love as a trustworthy ally to Ayame. While Kanade is easily annoyed or flabbergasted by the romantic love antics around her, she dearly wants her friends to find true happiness and let love blossom between them. RELATED: The Most Anticipated New & Returning Anime Releases of the Spring 2022 Season Rikekuma Is The Science Bear                  A bonus character is the science bear Rikekuma, a stuffed animal that can think and speak like a person.

06-04-2022,anime,5,0,https://www.cbr.com/science-fell-in-love-anime-main-cast/,Meet the Science Fell in Love Anime's Main Characters,"   Science Fell in Love: Meet the Main Cast of Characters As the new season of Science Fell in Love begins in Spring 2022, fans may need a reminder of who's who in this edutainment anime.     By Louis Kemner Published 15 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    Science Fell in Love So I Tried to Prove It is a returning rom-com anime of the spring 2022 anime season. Its story takes place in Saitama University, where a small handful of grad student scientists are determined to use every experiment and formula in the book to determine if they are truly in love. Only the most rigorous testing will reveal the romantic answers in this charming series. It's been a few years since Season 1 of Science Fell in Love so as the much-anticipated Season 2 begins, new and returning fans alike will want to know the main cast and see what makes them tick as both scientists and people. Some of them embody classic anime archetypes and tropes, while others are truly one of a kind.  RELATED: The Best Rom-Com Anime to Watch After Horimiya Yukimura Shinya, The Cool-Headed Love Interest                  Yukimura Shinya is one of the two main lovers in Science Fell in Love, though he doesn't always act like the lovestruck young man he is. In fact, Shinya is a recent example of the kuudere character archetype, a confident character who hides their warm, fuzzy emotions behind a cool and aloof exterior. One day, Shinya received an unexpected love confession from his lab partner Himuro Ayame. While he doesn't like to show it, he is secretly hoping with all his might that their budding romance is genuine -- and will do anything to prove it. Shinya is also the one who, in his boyhood, inspired Ayame to embrace her love of science rather than feel ashamed of it, which may be what drew her to him in the first place. Between the two, Shinya is far less likely to make emotional outbursts or act on a whim, but he might secretly admire Ayame for doing so. That's the kuudere way. RELATED: The Best Light Novel Series With Ridiculously Long Titles Himuro Ayame, The Lovestruck Lab Partner                  The lovely Himuro Ayame is Shinya's lab partner and #1 admirer ever since she received kind words of encouragement from him in her girlhood. For years Ayame has loved science and the answers it can provide for life's everyday questions. Now she's ready to use every formula, instrument and experiment she can think of to determine whether her overflowing affection for Shinya is genuine -- or just superficial attraction. Ayame is more of a poetic romantic than Shinya, being a believer in romantic gestures and more likely to listen to her heart, but she also can't forget her duty as a scientist. Ayame is equally likely to consult a data chart or run experiments on her own heart rate as she is to consult a friend about her feelings, making her better balanced but also slightly more vulnerable than Shinya. She is known for having a real temper when she thinks her love is being threatened. RELATED: Chihayafuru Has Hinted at Potential Romance - But It Isn't Necessary Ibarada Ena Likes To Tease Her Lab Partners                  Shinya and Ayame aren't alone in that lab at Saitama University. They have a few friends who tag along for the ride and comment on their endless love experiments, including the tiny but surprisingly tough Ibarada Ena, who loves sweet snacks, all kinds of video games and frilly clothes under her white lab coat. So far, it doesn't seem Ena has a crush of her own in Science Fell in Love but she does support Shinya and Ayame's budding romance in her own way, sometimes providing input or corrections for Shinya and Ayame's experiments. Ena is also a childhood friend of Inukai Kosuke -- and has him wrapped around her little finger, so to speak. RELATED: The Real-Life Science Behind Science Fell in Love So I Tried to Prove it Inukai Kosuke Loves 2-D Girls                  Inukai Kosuke is Science Fell in Love's comic relief, a somewhat sloppy but well-meaning scientist who is more passionate about dating sim games and waifu pillows than finding work as a scientist after he graduates from Saitama University. He's usually the butt of the jokes, though he is also a trustworthy ally of Shinya's and a good friend to Ena, even if they make fun of him sometimes. Kosuke also delivered a quirky but well thought-out presentation on video game theory at a conference in Okinawa late in Season 1. RELATED: Ranking of Kings: What Exactly Is Miranjo and King Bosse's Relationship? Kanade Kotonoha Believes In True Love, Too                  One of Ayame's best friends in the lab is the easygoing Kanade Kotonoha, who has been a believer in true love ever since her high school days when she nursed a serious crush on a handsome male teacher who helped encourage her curiosity about the world. She plays a minor supporting role in Science Fell in Love as a trustworthy ally to Ayame. While Kanade is easily annoyed or flabbergasted by the romantic love antics around her, she dearly wants her friends to find true happiness and let love blossom between them. RELATED: The Most Anticipated New & Returning Anime Releases of the Spring 2022 Season Rikekuma Is The Science Bear                  A bonus character is the science bear Rikekuma, a stuffed animal that can think and speak like a person. In between scenes, the sharp-tongued Rikekuma will deliver short lectures and expand on the ideas, theories and references mentioned in the episode. No one can scientifically verify how a teddy bear can do all this, but that's just part of the fun. Even Science Fell in Love can bend the truth a little.

By Ryan McCarthy Published 23 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    WARNING: The following contains spoilers for Attack on Titan Season 4, Episode 28, ""The Dawn of Humanity,"" now streaming on Funimation, Hulu and Crunchyroll. Eren Jaeger has done some pretty terrible things in the Final Season of Attack on Titan and telling his foster sister, Mikasa Ackerman, that he's always hated her is easily the second-worst. The finale of The Final Season: Part Two included a flashback that added another layer of cruelty to Eren's harsh words for her by revealing that he was straight-up lying. Armin Arlert was certainly right for leaping across a table to assault Eren for hurting Mikasa, and it turned out he was right again in his belief that Eren made everything up when he berated them both.  Eren's whole thing in Attack on Titan is freedom -- freedom from Titans and freedom for Eldians. As a result of feeling like he's lived in a cage his whole life, he's developed an intense hatred for anyone who submits to oppression. After Eren padded his villainy stat sheet by slaughtering innocents in Marley and overthrowing Paradis Island's military via assassination and poisoning, he decided to cement his case for biggest jerk in the world by telling Mikasa he's always hated her. Mikasa had spent all her time in the Final Season up to that point defending Eren by saying he must be brainwashed by Zeke and Yelena, and her reward was a slap in the face from the person she loved most. RELATED: Attack on Titan: The Rumbling Really Is Unstoppable                  A good lie has a bit of truth mixed into it, and Eren used Mikasa's long history of sudden headaches to support his gaslighting. As a descendant of the Ackerman clan -- a group of warriors who protected the king by manifesting the power of Titans in human form -- Mikasa had an awakening of her power when Eren saved her from some crooks when they were kids. While it is true that Mikasa's power awakened in response to Eren's call to action, it was not because she'd mistaken him for her host that she's genetically hardwired to protect. Rather, it was because Eren inspired her and when he gave her his scarf, she devoted herself to him not out of compulsion, but love. During that infamous table scene, Eren told Mikasa that her so-called compulsion to protect him makes her nothing more than a mindless slave with no will of her own. Eren's hatred for slavery is well known, so his alleged reason for hating Mikasa was very convincing, so much so that it brought Mikasa to tears and made the famously pacifistic Armin ready to throw hands. Eren even claimed that his half-brother, Zeke Jaeger, was the one who'd confirmed that Ackermans ""activate"" to defend their host. However, a flashback to the actual conversation revealed that Zeke said no such thing. RELATED: Attack on Titan: Floch Wasn't the Only One Eren Told About His Plan                  In fact, Zeke said the exact opposite of what Eren claimed he did in a brotherly heart-to-heart that was, tragically, all Zeke had ever wanted with Eren. When Eren voiced his insecurity about why Mikasa is so devoted to him as an Ackerman, Zeke told him that he'd never heard of this ""activation to defend a host"" thing Eren was going on about. What Zeke actually said was that it's more likely that Mikasa just likes Eren so much that she'll tear apart Titans for him. It's still unclear why Eren was out here just inventing mean things to say to people, but what's certain is that he's got a lot of apologies to make once the Rumbling is over -- assuming he or anyone else survives, that is. The picture of why Eren has decided to destroy the entire world beyond Paradis Island is becoming clearer. However, it's not yet clear why telling Mikasa that he's always hated her was a necessary part of his plan. It's obviously not true, given he once tried to fistfight a Titan in his human form to protect her. Eren and Mikasa have always had a complex relationship as she played the role of his protector while he didn't like feeling inferior to her -- but to say that he's always hated her is just bogus. Hopefully, when Attack on Titan's Final Season: Part Three premieres in 2023, an explanation will be given for why Eren lied to Mikasa about having always hated her.

RELATED: Attack on Titan: The Rumbling Really Is Unstoppable                  A good lie has a bit of truth mixed into it, and Eren used Mikasa's long history of sudden headaches to support his gaslighting. As a descendant of the Ackerman clan -- a group of warriors who protected the king by manifesting the power of Titans in human form -- Mikasa had an awakening of her power when Eren saved her from some crooks when they were kids. While it is true that Mikasa's power awakened in response to Eren's call to action, it was not because she'd mistaken him for her host that she's genetically hardwired to protect. Rather, it was because Eren inspired her and when he gave her his scarf, she devoted herself to him not out of compulsion, but love. During that infamous table scene, Eren told Mikasa that her so-called compulsion to protect him makes her nothing more than a mindless slave with no will of her own. Eren's hatred for slavery is well known, so his alleged reason for hating Mikasa was very convincing, so much so that it brought Mikasa to tears and made the famously pacifistic Armin ready to throw hands. Eren even claimed that his half-brother, Zeke Jaeger, was the one who'd confirmed that Ackermans ""activate"" to defend their host. However, a flashback to the actual conversation revealed that Zeke said no such thing. RELATED: Attack on Titan: Floch Wasn't the Only One Eren Told About His Plan                  In fact, Zeke said the exact opposite of what Eren claimed he did in a brotherly heart-to-heart that was, tragically, all Zeke had ever wanted with Eren. When Eren voiced his insecurity about why Mikasa is so devoted to him as an Ackerman, Zeke told him that he'd never heard of this ""activation to defend a host"" thing Eren was going on about. What Zeke actually said was that it's more likely that Mikasa just likes Eren so much that she'll tear apart Titans for him. It's still unclear why Eren was out here just inventing mean things to say to people, but what's certain is that he's got a lot of apologies to make once the Rumbling is over -- assuming he or anyone else survives, that is. The picture of why Eren has decided to destroy the entire world beyond Paradis Island is becoming clearer. However, it's not yet clear why telling Mikasa that he's always hated her was a necessary part of his plan. It's obviously not true, given he once tried to fistfight a Titan in his human form to protect her. Eren and Mikasa have always had a complex relationship as she played the role of his protector while he didn't like feeling inferior to her -- but to say that he's always hated her is just bogus. Hopefully, when Attack on Titan's Final Season: Part Three premieres in 2023, an explanation will be given for why Eren lied to Mikasa about having always hated her.

By Louis Kemner Published 1 day ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    My Dress-Up Darling, a popular shojo-style seinen anime series in the Winter 2022 anime season, is the story of an unlikely friendship between the outgoing Kitagawa Marin and the shy Gojo Wakana. They didn't have much in common at first but shared a passion for cosplay and fabric, and soon became excellent cosplay partners and friends. These two characters play off each other well and enrich one another's daily lives during their adventure to make the best cosplay ever, but notably, Marin hardly takes advantage of her strong personality when it comes to Gojo. She does tease him like a Nagatoro-style sadodere sometimes but otherwise respects who and what he is, and that's important. Here's how My Dress-Up Darling's co-leads built a somewhat erotic but fundamentally wholesome friendship together.  RELATED: My Dress-Up Darling Celebrates Season Finale With New Artwork How Marin Respects Gojo's Boundaries in My Dress-Up Darling                  At first glance, it seems all Marin ever does is toy with Gojo and annoy him with her flamboyant fan service and unpredictable, whimsical behavior. That's true on some level, but Marin proved herself a true friend by respecting him for who he is. She knows she can tease Gojo and show him a new world beyond his own while not trying to change his personality or worldview in the process. It's common for stories, anime or otherwise, to portray a quiet introvert like Gojo coming out of their shell and joining the extroverts, but this message can do more harm than good in many cases. Introverts don't need extroverts to ""fix"" them. Instead, Marin understands Gojo's shy and hardworking nature and chooses to make the most of it in their partnership without ever calling his personality into question. Never once in My Dress-Up Darling does she state or even imply that he needs to change his ways to suit her, nor does she suggest that he's inferior to her by being so reserved and timid. Marin clearly prefers more outgoing and lively friends like herself but can also appreciate what Gojo brings to their partnership, cosplay and otherwise. Marin almost sees Gojo's introverted, down-to-earth nature as a novelty to be admired, and would probably feel guilty if she accidentally forced him to change his ways to suit her own lifestyle. She enjoys sharing her daily life with him throughout My Dress-Up Darling and even teases him, but also maintains the boundary between them. She doesn't want Gojo to become someone he's not, which is an important way to respect who and what he is. Teasing is one thing -- trying to invalidate an introvert's lifestyle is something else entirely. RELATED: My Dress-Up Darling Embodies Horimiya's Best Storytelling Themes How Marin & Gojo Mesh As Contrasting Characters                  Marin realized from the very start that she and Gojo are very different people with different self-images, backgrounds and personalities, and she respects this in all the ways that count. Being friends with him means finding common ground, and she does just that. In fact, the two also find ways to make up for each other's weaknesses, which means that having two Marin-type personalities in this relationship would have held the partnership back. Marin needs what only Gojo, as he is, can provide. Otherwise, she would have sought help from one of her gal-pals instead. She respects Gojo not just as a friend but also as a skilled partner who can do things she can't, and vice versa. Due to being a hardworking, humble introvert, Gojo is ideal for work-intensive tasks that call for diligence rather than charisma and social skills, and sure enough, he quietly toils away all night to finish a costume for Marin in record time. He also channels My Hero Academia's Midoriya Izuku and patiently studies other people's techniques, taking meaningful notes while being humble enough to learn anything he must about cosplay. This is exactly the partner Marin needed, and as she respects and admires Gojo's nature, she has the patience to stand back and let him do his thing. Throughout My Dress-Up Darling, she treats him carefully so he can focus on his work and enjoy it. Marin may tease Gojo but she never questions his methods or personality. She knows how to keep her business partner happy and let him find validation in this work his own way -- and the results speak for themselves.

By Timothy Donohoo Published 7 days ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    Neon Genesis Evangelion was a landmark series for both the mecha anime genre as well as anime in general. A dark and psychological deconstruction of the genre, the show completely upended everything about mecha shows while dripping with subtext. Of course, this success saw many imitators try to emulate the formula, although one of these supposed copies get an unfair reputation because of it. RahXephon is seen by many as merely an Evangelion wannabe, but the series is so much more. Although the two certainly share some similar themes and concepts, they handle them in vastly different ways, all while being far different from each other than many realize. There are even elements that RahXephon does better than its supposed ""inspiration,"" making its criticisms more than premature.  RELATED: How Gundam Creator Yoshiyuki Tomino's ""Aura Battler Dunbine"" Influenced Isekai What Is RahXephon?                  RahXephon is set in a world where Japan has been ravaged by interdimensional invaders known as Mulians, or Mu. These creatures, almost indistinguishable from humans beyond their blue blood, pilot powerful clay ""Dolems"" in order to take over and encapsulate Tokyo. Encasing it in a ring barrier, the Mu are warred against by humanity, namely the defense research agency TERRA. The protagonist is Ayato Kamina, a seemingly normal young man who becomes entangled with TERRA and comes to pilot the mysterious ""RahXephon"" weapon against the Dolems. While it's considered a mecha or robot, it, like the Dolems themselves, is made out of clay. In the ensuing battles against the invaders, Kamina learns more about himself as well as his old friend Haruka, whose history together Kamina had come to forget. The result is as much of a love story as it is a mecha series, although there are definitely intentional influences from old-school Super Robot anime of the 1970s. However, a much more contemporary fellow mecha is what many assume was the real inspiration. Why RahXephon Isn't Just an Evangelion Ripoff                  Many critics of RahXephon have noted the similarities between it and Evangelion, and these comparisons are not unfounded. Both have a young man being forced to pilot a robot that may or may not represent his mother at the behest of a secret organization, all while he has strange sexual tension with another mother figure. That's not to mention the swathes of subtext, symbolism and similarly unorthodox designs of the Dolems and the Angels in Evangelion. While this is all fair, it's what RahXephon does with these themes that helps differentiate it from the real Evangelion ripoffs. RELATED: Gundam’s Iron-Blooded Orphans Spinoff Trailer Introduces a Slew of New Characters and Mecha Whereas Evangelion tends to have tons of arguably irrelevant religious iconography, RahXephon's symbolism feels much more natural and organic to its themes. Said themes typically involve music, arguably making it closer to fellow mecha show Eureka Seven. Ironically, despite all the religious symbolism in Evangelion, it's RahXephon that actually directly addresses anything religious. For instance, one episode takes place during Christmas, and the non-Christian TERRA crew discuss what such a holiday means to them. While it could be argued by some that the show is ""dumber"" for talking about these concepts, it helps to make all of its symbolism much more than just cool Easter Eggs. Likewise, the use of topics such as ancient civilizations feels like a fittingly intentional throwback to classic shows such as Godmars. Another element that RahXephon does better than Evangelion is its protagonist. While he has his groan-worthy moments, Kamina is much more proactive and less whiny than Shinji Ikari, which also helps to make the plot move along better. Although some of the side characters in RahXephon aren't quite as strong as Asuka or Rei, the main character, and arguably the Misato stand-in as well, are much more enjoyable characters. This all comes together to make a show that's sadly too covered in by the shadow of Evangelion, when in reality, it's more of a celebration of the mecha genre than the former ever was.

Kaguya-sama: What's the Score Heading Into Season 3? Love is a battlefield in Kaguya-sama: Love Is War, so here's a rundown of everyone's win/loss record heading into Season 3.     By Ryan McCarthy Published 18 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    The battle between Shinomiya Kaguya and Shirogane Miyuki is set to resume with the Season 3 premiere of Kaguya-sama: Love Is War on April 7th, 2022. Student Council shenanigans are imminent as President Shirogane and Vice President Shinomiya will continue trying to get the other to confess their love. Any given episode of Kaguya-sama is typically comprised of one-to-four segments of head-empty tomfoolery, at the end of which the narrator usually declares a winner and/or loser. With the love-grudge match ready to continue, here's a look at each character's win/loss record so far. The scoreboard of Kaguya-sama can be tricky to keep track of considering Shirogane and Shinomiya sometimes both win or lose. Going strictly by what the series' narrator says, there appears to be a difference between an actual tie and an instance in which Shirogane and Shinomiya both won or lost, so the scoreboard reflects that distinction. And although the love war is solely being fought between the two co-leads, the supporting cast occasionally find themselves as the winner or loser of any given bout.  RELATED: Kaguya-sama: Love is War Season 3 to Premiere in US Theaters Shinomiya Kaguya Vs. Shirogane Miyuki                  Perhaps unsurprisingly, Shinomiya is dominating the matchup with Shirogane. As of Season 2's finale, her win/loss record stands at 23 wins and 16 losses. Shirogane, on the other hand, holds a losing record of 15 wins and 24 losses. If Shinomiya and Shirogane are the only competitors, shouldn't their records be inverses of one another? Ordinarily yes, but the narrator has declared them co-winners and co-losers on several occasions, which has skewed their final tallies away from a traditional score. There have only been two instances in which the narrator declared an official tie, giving Shinomiya a commanding lead of 23-16-2 over Shirogane's 15-24-2. Not only is Shinomiya currently in the lead, but she's held it for nearly the entire series to this point. She emerged victorious from Season 1 by picking up 12 wins to Shirogane's nine. Season 2 of Kaguya-sama saw Shinomiya defend her title, winning 11 matches while Shirogane escaped with a mere six wins. It's a good thing they don’t seem to be keeping track of the score themselves -- Shirogane would give up all hope knowing how badly he's losing while Shinomiya's overconfidence from her winning record would likely lead to her own downfall. RELATED: Kaguya-sama Reveals Season 3 Premiere Date With Ultra Romantic Teaser Trailer What's Everyone Else's Score In Kaguya-sama: Love Is War?                  Although it's rare, supporting characters like Fujiwara Chika and Ishigami Yu -- and even minor ones like Shirogane Kei and Kashiwagi Nagisa -- have found themselves on Kaguya-sama's scoreboard. Considering none of the supporting cast is actually a part of the battle between Shinomiya and Shirogane, they only get a win or a loss if they've had a good or bad experience in a segment that's not focused on the titular war of love. To this point, Fujiwara and Ishigami are the only supporting characters who have picked up a win. Secretary Fujiwara's win/loss record is an unflattering three wins and five losses, which would surely devastate her if she were counting. Ishigami, hilariously, is the only character in the series other than Shinomiya who does not have a losing record. The gloomy Student Council Treasurer is currently batting .500 with three wins and three losses. Iino Miko and Hayasaka Ai each have zero wins and two losses, while Shirogane Kei and Kashiwagi Nagisa each have a single loss to their names on the scoreboard. RELATED: The Most Anticipated New & Returning Rom-Com Anime of Spring 2022 Who's Going To Win Kaguya-sama: Love Is War?                  Going by the numbers, Shinomiya's lead makes her most likely to emerge victorious if this petty battle of pride ever comes to an end. However, considering this battle is the premise of the entire series, it's unlikely to end any time soon -- if at all. Shirogane has a lot of ground to cover, but Kaguya-sama isn't just about the numbers. Despite their records, Shinomiya and Shirogane have proved countless times that they are well-matched with one another. The only thing keeping them apart at this point is pride -- and Fujiwara's inability to read the room.

06-04-2022,anime,1,0,https://www.cbr.com/kaguya-sama-characters-win-loss-record-before-season-3/,Kaguya-sama: Every Character's Win/Loss Record Going Into Season 3,"   Kaguya-sama: What's the Score Heading Into Season 3? Love is a battlefield in Kaguya-sama: Love Is War, so here's a rundown of everyone's win/loss record heading into Season 3.     By Ryan McCarthy Published 18 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    The battle between Shinomiya Kaguya and Shirogane Miyuki is set to resume with the Season 3 premiere of Kaguya-sama: Love Is War on April 7th, 2022. Student Council shenanigans are imminent as President Shirogane and Vice President Shinomiya will continue trying to get the other to confess their love. Any given episode of Kaguya-sama is typically comprised of one-to-four segments of head-empty tomfoolery, at the end of which the narrator usually declares a winner and/or loser. With the love-grudge match ready to continue, here's a look at each character's win/loss record so far. The scoreboard of Kaguya-sama can be tricky to keep track of considering Shirogane and Shinomiya sometimes both win or lose. Going strictly by what the series' narrator says, there appears to be a difference between an actual tie and an instance in which Shirogane and Shinomiya both won or lost, so the scoreboard reflects that distinction. And although the love war is solely being fought between the two co-leads, the supporting cast occasionally find themselves as the winner or loser of any given bout.  RELATED: Kaguya-sama: Love is War Season 3 to Premiere in US Theaters Shinomiya Kaguya Vs. Shirogane Miyuki                  Perhaps unsurprisingly, Shinomiya is dominating the matchup with Shirogane. As of Season 2's finale, her win/loss record stands at 23 wins and 16 losses. Shirogane, on the other hand, holds a losing record of 15 wins and 24 losses. If Shinomiya and Shirogane are the only competitors, shouldn't their records be inverses of one another? Ordinarily yes, but the narrator has declared them co-winners and co-losers on several occasions, which has skewed their final tallies away from a traditional score. There have only been two instances in which the narrator declared an official tie, giving Shinomiya a commanding lead of 23-16-2 over Shirogane's 15-24-2. Not only is Shinomiya currently in the lead, but she's held it for nearly the entire series to this point. She emerged victorious from Season 1 by picking up 12 wins to Shirogane's nine. Season 2 of Kaguya-sama saw Shinomiya defend her title, winning 11 matches while Shirogane escaped with a mere six wins. It's a good thing they don’t seem to be keeping track of the score themselves -- Shirogane would give up all hope knowing how badly he's losing while Shinomiya's overconfidence from her winning record would likely lead to her own downfall.

Although it's rare, supporting characters like Fujiwara Chika and Ishigami Yu -- and even minor ones like Shirogane Kei and Kashiwagi Nagisa -- have found themselves on Kaguya-sama's scoreboard. Considering none of the supporting cast is actually a part of the battle between Shinomiya and Shirogane, they only get a win or a loss if they've had a good or bad experience in a segment that's not focused on the titular war of love. To this point, Fujiwara and Ishigami are the only supporting characters who have picked up a win. Secretary Fujiwara's win/loss record is an unflattering three wins and five losses, which would surely devastate her if she were counting. Ishigami, hilariously, is the only character in the series other than Shinomiya who does not have a losing record. The gloomy Student Council Treasurer is currently batting .500 with three wins and three losses. Iino Miko and Hayasaka Ai each have zero wins and two losses, while Shirogane Kei and Kashiwagi Nagisa each have a single loss to their names on the scoreboard.

Going by the numbers, Shinomiya's lead makes her most likely to emerge victorious if this petty battle of pride ever comes to an end. However, considering this battle is the premise of the entire series, it's unlikely to end any time soon -- if at all. Shirogane has a lot of ground to cover, but Kaguya-sama isn't just about the numbers. Despite their records, Shinomiya and Shirogane have proved countless times that they are well-matched with one another. The only thing keeping them apart at this point is pride -- and Fujiwara's inability to read the room.

Dragon Ball Super: Why Was Majin Buu Dropped From the Tournament of Power? Majin Buu has a ton of power underneath his comical girth, but he sadly didn't get to show it off during Dragon Ball Super's Tournament of Power.     By Timothy Donohoo Published 21 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    Dragon Ball Super has added several new layers to the famous franchise, all the while bringing back elements and characters that had been somewhat looked over or hadn't been prominent in a while. One of these is Majin Buu. Though he was the final villain in Dragon Ball Z, he wasn't featured very prominently in the now non-canon Dragon Ball GT, making it somewhat easier to forget him. Sadly, Super has knocked him backward as much as it's pushed him forward. Though Dragon Ball Super brought Buu back into the limelight in a more overtly heroic fashion, it failed to feature him in one of its biggest arcs. Buu's absence during the Tournament of Power was explained in-universe, but it still feels awfully hackneyed. Here's a look at the most likely true reasons for Buu not showing his stuff at the Tournament of Power.  RELATED: Dragon Ball Super Artist Draws New Super Hero Characters in Classic Style Buu Failed the Written Test to Enter the Tournament of Power                  The Tournament of Power in Dragon Ball Super is as grandiose as it sounds and quite deadly in nature. Held between the various universes within the multiverse, the fighters representing each one battle for much more than mere titles. Any team that loses will have their universe destroyed, as the idea behind the tournament is that the Grand Zeno believes there are far too many universes in existence. Majin Buu was initially part of Universe 7's team, which represents the primary realm of Dragon Ball Super. The arrogant Saiyan prince Vegeta actually questioned this, as Buu was known to be weaker after splitting from his evil incarnation. Goku, however, noted how much incredible power Buu still had, and that he'd be a vital asset to their team. Unfortunately, through failing the written test to enter the tournament as well as falling asleep before a fight, Buu was unable to help protect Universe 7. This forced Goku to recruit Frieza in order to have enough team members. RELATED: Dragon Ball Super: How Mai Became a Child Again & How Old She Really Is Why Did Toriyama Drop Buu From the Tournament of Power?                  Though the narrative reasons for Buu being absent during the Tournament of Power are plain as day, it still doesn't explain why he was left out after Goku even explained how useful he'd be. Part of it was likely the potential of Goku having to fight on the same team as Frieza -- the slave broker of his species -- in order to protect their universe. This not only provides for some gravitas, but it also helps that Frieza is a much more popular villain than Buu. It could be argued that Buu was too silly of a character to be able to compete in the serious nature of the Tournament of Power. This is backed up by his falling into a lazy stupor, as well as his not being smart enough to even pass the written part of the entrance. Despite these setbacks, he, as Goku pointed out, was still an incredibly powerful fighter. In fact, the real reason for Buu's being written out of the Tournament of Power is likely that he was too powerful. The tail end of Dragon Ball Z saw Buu put quite a hurtin' on the powerful Vegeta, and more recently in Super he had trained to gain a more svelte, robust form. Buu also had incredible abilities such as immense stamina, healing other fighters and the power to turn opponents into candy. This logically could have made him too tough for anyone the Tournament of Power would have thrown at him. After all, even Buu would've gotten serious if innocent people like Hercule were threatened, and he was no slouch when it came to using his powers at opportune times. Sadly he was unable to show off his true potential in helping determine the fate of his universe, with Super rendering him a slovenly goofball -- at least for now.

By Michael Lacerna Published 21 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    The Rising of the Shield Hero's long-awaited second season will premiere on Crunchyroll at exactly 6:00 A.M. PST on April 6. The simulcast of the series was previously confirmed for April 6, the same day that the show will be broadcast in Japan, but in a testament to just how anticipated the isekai series' new continuation is, Crunchyroll announced the specific time that the show will be available for streaming on its platform. The show will be available in the following territories: North America, Central America, South America, Europe, Africa, Oceania, the Middle East, and CIS. RELATED: The Best Anime to Watch After The Rising of the Shield Hero  The show will return roughly two years after the completion of the show's first, 25-episode long season. Upon its premiere in 2019, the series received some criticism for its use of a false sexual assault allegation as a plot point, but the show has since become a hit with both fans and many critics alike, with praise being directed towards its memorable cast of characters and its willingness to shake up well-worn isekai genre tropes. The first season was such a hit that the show's producers immediately announced that the series was being renewed for a second and third season, which is a rarity amongst anime productions. The second season was originally scheduled to premiere in the fall of 2021, but was delayed to its current release date. The second season will see some notable changes to the series' crew: while the first season was helmed by director Takao Abo, who previously worked on the mecha anime Macross Frontier and Eureka Seven, the second season will instead be directed by Masato Jinbo, who directed both seasons of Restaurant to Another World. Production on the second season will be split between Kinema Citrus, which produced the anime's first season, and South Korean animation studio DR Movie. The voice cast from the original season will return to reprise their roles for Season 2, where they will be joined by Kana Hanazawa, who previously starred in Durarara!! and Cells at Work. Hanazawa will voice the mysterious Ost Horai, the latest addition to Naofumi's adventuring party. RELATED: Rising of the Shield Hero and Bofuri Collide in Isekai Crossover Promotion The new season of the show sees Naofumi, the eponymous Shield Hero, and his two most trusted traveling companions, Raphtalia and Filo, setting out on a journey to stop the rampage of a massive legendary beast, the Spirit Tortoise. The Shield Hero franchise originally began in 2012 as a web novel series by author Aneko Yusagi. Yusagi's original work has since been adapted into a manga and a light novel series, which are now available in English from One Peace Press.

By Christian Markle Published Mar 27, 2022      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    WARNING: The following contains spoilers for Attack on Titan Season 4, Episode 27, ""Retrospective,"" now streaming on Funimation, Hulu and Crunchyroll. The death of Sasha Braus hurt not only the fans but also her regiment, since she is one of the best snipers of the Survey Corps and Attack on Titan in general. The latest episode of the anime unveiled the Survey Corps' new ally to be as efficient as the late potato lover when it comes to sharpshooting. While she may not replace the group's beloved friends, her skills prove to be a great asset for the success of Hange's small resistance group. Sasha proved her superior aiming skills multiple times. The most noteworthy of which was when she covered for the Survey Corps members during their raid on Liberio. Perhaps the biggest mistake she committed back then was not eliminating the young Gabi, who ended up being her murderer. Now, Gabi is taking on Sasha's role.  RELATED: Attack on Titan Marks the Return of the Anime's Earliest Antagonist                     Even though Gabi was initially a loyal Marleyan supremacist, she turned over a new leaf after learning the truth about Paradis Island from Sasha's very own family. Eren's sinister plan solidified her resolve to fight and save her hometown. She owned up her mistakes and begged the furious Jean for his help to stop Eren. During Armin and Connie's attempt to trick Floch and the Jaegerists into peacefully giving them Azumiboto's flying boat, Floch took notice of their plan and declared them as traitors. Floch ordered the destruction of the boat, which resulted in a bloodbath. After Connie murdered Daz and Samuel and no other Jaegerist could blow the ship, Floch took the matter to his own hand. However, Gabi was able to shoot him down, resulting in Floch's thunder spear barely missing the ship. While this impressive feat greatly helped the resistance, it wasn't just a lucky shot. Even before the Survey Corps attacked Liberio, Gabi was already shown as a dependable warrior. In fact, she was able to singlehandedly take out an armored train during her debut. Floch was also not the first victim of Gabi's sharpshooting. As most fans know and hate, Gabi took Sasha's life with a single shot. She was also able to snipe Eren, resulting in the latter's beheading, as they attempt to prevent the brothers from making contact. RELATED: Attack on Titan: Falco Debuts the New Jaw Titan - and It's a Game-Changer                  Gabi taking up Sasha's role is also not an unprecedented event. Sasha's most epic moment was when she saved the young Kaya from a Titan with only a wooden bow and arrows. She bravely jumped into the Titan's head and sunk an arrow into its eye, giving them a window to escape. During Zeke's mass Titanification, Kaya found herself in a similar situation. That time, however, it wasn't her big sister Sasha who saved her. It was Gabi, who she briefly saw as Sasha. That brief moment of resemblance may have been a foreshadowing of the young girl assuming her victim's role. Gabi may have been -- and probably still is -- one of the most hated characters in Attack on Titan, but she has been redeeming herself bit by bit in the latest episodes of the anime. With her covering the members of the resistance from a good distance, the Eren-killing group may be able to move more freely, albeit only slightly.

By Ryan McCarthy Published 20 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    WARNING: The following contains spoilers for Attack on Titan Season 4, Episode 28, ""The Dawn of Humanity,"" now streaming on Funimation, Hulu and Crunchyroll. The finale of Attack on Titan, The Final Season: Part Two harkened back to the series' beginning in the darkest of ways. When a young Bertholdt Hoover used his Colossal Titan to destroy the gate of Shiganshina so that Titans could get in, Eren Jaeger's mother was eaten right in front of him. After evacuating, a tearful and rage-filled Eren declared he was going to kill every single Titan in the world. Fast forward to Season 4, Episode 28, ""The Dawn of Humanity"" and Eren is still saying ""kill them all"" -- but now he's saying it while using Titans to wipe out humanity.  When a young Eren Jaeger declared he would rid the world of Titans himself, it appeared to be little more than wishful thinking. At the time, even Mindless Titans were unstoppable as humanity within the Walls knew next to nothing about their greatest enemy and didn't even know about the existence of their actual enemy. At the start of Attack on Titan, there was nothing Eren hated more than Titans, and who could've guessed that becoming one himself would still be considered ""simpler times"" in retrospect. As things spun out of control on Paradis Island with the reveal of several spies from beyond the Walls who could become Titans, even Eren couldn't keep track of who his enemy was anymore. RELATED: Attack on Titan: The Rumbling Really Is Unstoppable                  After the defeat of Zeke Jaeger, Reiner Braun and Bertholdt Hoover in Shiganshina when humanity within the Walls reclaimed their lost territory, Eren finally accessed his father's basement and learned the truth of the world. The nation of Marley became Eren's new enemy when he learned that they'd been the ones turning people into Titans and sending them to Paradis Island to wreak havoc on the unsuspecting population. The revelation that humanity was not only thriving beyond the Walls but also trying to kill them, was a lot for Eren to take in all at once and understandably warped his identity on a fundamental level. Eren's heart was broken when the citizens of Paradis Island finally defeated Titans and reclaimed their territory, only to learn that even more enemies awaited them across the very sea that Eren and Armin had longed to visit. Eren had always felt like he was trapped in a cage while growing up inside the Walls, with the threat of a Titan invasion looming over every moment. The fact that the outside world he'd grown up wanting to visit was just another cage surrounded by enemies officially shifted his pathological hatred from Titans to everyone outside the Walls. RELATED: Attack on Titan: Floch Wasn't the Only One Eren Told About His Plan                  The war between Marley and Paradis Island is long and complicated, but Marleyans aren't the only people who despise Eldians. Just about the only thing that the entire outside world of Attack on Titan agrees on is that Eldians are Island Devils who should be eliminated. Now that Eren has obtained the Founding Titan, he has chosen to save Paradis Island by destroying every inch of the world beyond its shores. ""The Dawn of Humanity"" saw Eren become the very thing that drove him to this point in the first place as his Founding Titan descended upon a helpless city, slaughtering countless innocent civilians who don't even understand what's happening or why. Eren's original ""kill them all"" was a reasonable emotion to feel toward the clear-cut enemy of the series, Titans. Now the world of Attack on Titan has become infinitely more complex and Eren's latest ""kill them all,"" is understandable, but not sympathetic. His journey from protagonist to antagonist has been a poignant, emotional character evolution of an angry boy growing into a vengeful man. Things are looking pretty grim -- and are likely to get even worse -- once Attack on Titan's Final Season returns for Part Three in 2023 as Eren Jaeger's war against the world comes to a head.

By C. M. Ramsburg Published Mar 24, 2022      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    WARNING: The following contains spoilers for Episode 47 of Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon, ""Father and Daughter,"" now streaming on Crunchyroll, Funimation and Hulu. Yashahime finally completes its greatest arc yet after the conclusion of Sesshōmaru and Kirinmaru's long-standing rivalry as the Great Beast Kings of the East and West. When the two fight in front of Rin, the series' biggest antagonist suddenly has a change of heart that will redirect the plot and change everyone's future. While fans rejoice as peace is restored and the entire cast of both Inuyasha and Yashahime are reunited for the first time, several major characters die before the next chapter of the sequel series begins.  RELATED: Should Moroha Have Been Yashahime's Main Character?                  In Episode 47 of Yashahime, Rion remains in control of the Grim Butterfly as Moroha and Setsuna work to cut her threads of fate that reveal her undying love for her father Kirinmaru. However, Towa remains locked in her solo fight against Mr. Kirin when Riku comes to her rescue. While they manage to take down Mr. Kirin, Riku is fatally wounded and dies in the process. When he dies in Towa's arms, Riku finally admits how much he loves her and wants her to live for his sake. While the rest of the cast encircles the Grim Butterfly to contain it, the final showdown between the two most powerful demons in Yashahime's world is taking place at the Tree of Ages where Sesshōmaru and Kirinmaru go head-to-head. When Jaken advises Rin to flee the battlefield to safety, Sesshōmaru shockingly instructs his wife to stay and watch his fight with Kirinmaru instead. During their action-packed clash, Kirinmaru can't help but imagine the face of his helpless daughter Rion whenever he looks at Rin. As a human, her presence reminds him of his humanity and love for his daughter who was killed in front of him. Kirinmaru gets distracted and is ultimately defeated by Sesshōmaru before asking the Great Dog Demon to kill him. However, Rion can sense that her father fell in battle and uses the red threads of fate to bring him to her in the Grim Butterfly as Sesshōmaru, Rin and Jaken follow them. After successfully freeing Rion, the loving parents meet up with their twin daughters and niece. Towa allows Rion to use her body momentarily to live long enough to reconnect with Kirinmaru as he arrives. The two finally tell each other how they feel before agreeing to leave this world together to reunite with Zero in the afterlife. When Rion's spirit departs for the final time, Towa's consciousness is restored as the Bakuseiken and Zanseiken merge together to form the legendary sword known as the Sword of Amatsumikaboshi. RELATED: Yashahime: How Inuyasha Completed His Powerful Transition to Fatherhood                  After father and daughter depart for the afterlife and the Grim Butterfly disappears, everyone's favorite characters and their families gather around the Tree of Ages to celebrate. Rin finally fulfills her promise and hugs both Towa and Setsuna now that they're safe from their enemies. Sesshōmaru watches them while admitting to Jaken that he showed mercy on Kirinmaru and Rion because he knew that's what his daughters wanted. Jaken notes how happy Sesshōmaru looks when he's watching his wife and daughters hug, exposing the immense character development the powerful demon had undergone. Moroha happily stands beside her parents Inuyasha and Kagome, the three of them smiling at each other with pure joy at being together as a family after 14 difficult years apart. Behind them, Sango and Miroku stand beside their three children and Kohaku. Other notable attendees of the reunion include Shippo, Takechiyo, Hachi and Kirara, who are expected to become more consistent supporting characters throughout the rest of Yashahime. While fans rejoice at the epic reunion they waited two seasons for, they must also come to terms with the deaths of the characters they've grown to love. Riku's sudden death was a shock, but there is still hope he'll live on after many viewers noticed a horn-shaped object inside Towa's body when it was restored. With Rion and Kirinmaru now out of the picture, the series must create a new overarching antagonist and conflict to drive the plot forward. Previews of Episode 48 allude to a brand new chapter starting in Yashahime and with the entire cast finally reunited, fans can expect original Inuyasha characters to play a much bigger role in the future.

By Louis Kemner Published 32 minutes ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    WARNING: The following contains spoilers for episode 1 of Aharen-san is Indecipherable, ""Isn't This Too Close?"", now streaming on Crunchyroll. The Spring 2022 anime season has arrived, and it features more than a few wholesome anime series, including the brand-new Aharen-san is Indecipherable, which feels like a sister to the ongoing series Komi Can't Communicate. Both anime shows feature a heroine who has trouble speaking to others, but even so, Aharen and Komi have their differences. These slice-of-life heroines are both shy girls who can't easily form friendships or romances with the people around them, but their personalities differ on a fundamental level, which helps set Aharen-san apart. While Komi Shoko is a traditional dandere anime character, Aharen Reina is a twist on the kuudere archetype, and that makes her more compelling than ever.  RELATED: Science Fell in Love's Season Premiere Continues Anime's New Sadodere Trend                  In the course of just one episode, Aharen-san is Indecipherable establishes its namesake heroine as not just a kuudere anime character like Nifuji Hirotaka or Sohma Yuki, but one who is made more complex with elements from other -dere types, too. In anime, the -dere archetypes usually describe how a character expresses their affection, with hot-headed tsunderes being prickly and defensive before opening up, kuuderes being aloof and cool-headed before opening up to their chosen love interest and so on. A kuudere in particular simply chooses to not get too involved with the people around them; they are quiet and unexpressive as a matter of preference. This sets them apart from dandere characters like Shoko, who are shy and unassertive to the point of putting themselves down out of excessive modesty or insecurity. It could be said that danderes are less in control of their behavior than kuuderes are, but Aharen Reina blurs the line between these archetypes plus adds a little more. In the series premiere, Aharen is compelling not just because of her cuteness or the humor of her silent mouth movements, but because she has the assertive nature of a kuudere combined with the insecurities of a dandere, making her something entirely new in modern anime. She is quiet and aloof by choice, as a true kuudere, and she is self-assured when she expresses affection for her new friend, her high school classmate Raido. At the same time, Aharen is insecure about her difficulty speaking to others and being heard, and she has unpleasant memories of her female classmates rejecting her offers of friendship in middle school. Aharen is ""once bitten, twice shy,"" but she is only insecure about her ability to express herself, not her worthiness as a friend. Self-doubt and self-depreciation are major symptoms of being a dandere, but Aharen lacks those. She knows she can be a good friend to someone, but the barrier of silence stands in her way. For a time, she had chosen to give up trying to overcome that obstacle, but now she's fighting to be heard, and Raido wants to listen. RELATED: How My Dress-Up Darling's Marin and Gojo Built Anime's Healthiest Friendship                  Aharen's unusual combination of kuudere and dandere not only sets her apart in the story of Aharen-san is Indecipherable but also allows fans to make general predictions about the future of her character arc, her relationship with Raido and the story's overall tone. Fans can compare her hybrid -dere antics to similar characters such as Nifuji Hirotaka from Wotakoi and certainly Komi Shoko from Komi Can't Communicate, to make some guesses about what she might say or do next. In Episode 1, for example, Aharen chooses to only stay in Raido's company and direct all her affection toward him, kuudere-style, which suggests that she may act jealously in future episodes if anyone else tries to be Raido's friend. Aharen isn't necessarily a petty or selfish person, but it's clear that this new friendship is an important and symbolic step for her, and she might overreact and shoo away anyone else who wants her to share Raido with them. If so, this will likely happen in a humorous rather than dramatic way, given the series' rom-com tone. It's also possible that Aharen and Raido's relationship will become romantic sooner than expected, especially given Aharen's slight megadere streak, and she might get in over her head. In that case, her dandere side may take over, and she could get flustered and retreat back into her shell, which may take Raido by surprise. Aharen isn't afraid to assertively express her affection to Raido, but once a certain point is reached, she may lose her nerve and rethink her relationship with him. She will have to determine if she has the courage to get serious with Raido and let her kuudere nature triumph over her dandere insecurities.

06-04-2022,anime,8,0,https://www.cbr.com/aharen-san-episode-1-premiere-kuudere-anime-archetype/,Aharen-San Showcases the Potential of the Kuudere Archetype,"   Aharen-San Redefines the Possibilities of Kuudere Anime Characters Aharen Reina is a classic anime kuudere whose personality is deepened with dandere and even megadere elements.     By Louis Kemner Published 32 minutes ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    WARNING: The following contains spoilers for episode 1 of Aharen-san is Indecipherable, ""Isn't This Too Close?"", now streaming on Crunchyroll. The Spring 2022 anime season has arrived, and it features more than a few wholesome anime series, including the brand-new Aharen-san is Indecipherable, which feels like a sister to the ongoing series Komi Can't Communicate. Both anime shows feature a heroine who has trouble speaking to others, but even so, Aharen and Komi have their differences. These slice-of-life heroines are both shy girls who can't easily form friendships or romances with the people around them, but their personalities differ on a fundamental level, which helps set Aharen-san apart. While Komi Shoko is a traditional dandere anime character, Aharen Reina is a twist on the kuudere archetype, and that makes her more compelling than ever.  RELATED: Science Fell in Love's Season Premiere Continues Anime's New Sadodere Trend                  In the course of just one episode, Aharen-san is Indecipherable establishes its namesake heroine as not just a kuudere anime character like Nifuji Hirotaka or Sohma Yuki, but one who is made more complex with elements from other -dere types, too. In anime, the -dere archetypes usually describe how a character expresses their affection, with hot-headed tsunderes being prickly and defensive before opening up, kuuderes being aloof and cool-headed before opening up to their chosen love interest and so on. A kuudere in particular simply chooses to not get too involved with the people around them; they are quiet and unexpressive as a matter of preference. This sets them apart from dandere characters like Shoko, who are shy and unassertive to the point of putting themselves down out of excessive modesty or insecurity. It could be said that danderes are less in control of their behavior than kuuderes are, but Aharen Reina blurs the line between these archetypes plus adds a little more. In the series premiere, Aharen is compelling not just because of her cuteness or the humor of her silent mouth movements, but because she has the assertive nature of a kuudere combined with the insecurities of a dandere, making her something entirely new in modern anime. She is quiet and aloof by choice, as a true kuudere, and she is self-assured when she expresses affection for her new friend, her high school classmate Raido. At the same time, Aharen is insecure about her difficulty speaking to others and being heard, and she has unpleasant memories of her female classmates rejecting her offers of friendship in middle school. Aharen is ""once bitten, twice shy,"" but she is only insecure about her ability to express herself, not her worthiness as a friend. Self-doubt and self-depreciation are major symptoms of being a dandere, but Aharen lacks those. She knows she can be a good friend to someone, but the barrier of silence stands in her way. For a time, she had chosen to give up trying to overcome that obstacle, but now she's fighting to be heard, and Raido wants to listen. RELATED: How My Dress-Up Darling's Marin and Gojo Built Anime's Healthiest Friendship                  Aharen's unusual combination of kuudere and dandere not only sets her apart in the story of Aharen-san is Indecipherable but also allows fans to make general predictions about the future of her character arc, her relationship with Raido and the story's overall tone. Fans can compare her hybrid -dere antics to similar characters such as Nifuji Hirotaka from Wotakoi and certainly Komi Shoko from Komi Can't Communicate, to make some guesses about what she might say or do next. In Episode 1, for example, Aharen chooses to only stay in Raido's company and direct all her affection toward him, kuudere-style, which suggests that she may act jealously in future episodes if anyone else tries to be Raido's friend. Aharen isn't necessarily a petty or selfish person, but it's clear that this new friendship is an important and symbolic step for her, and she might overreact and shoo away anyone else who wants her to share Raido with them. If so, this will likely happen in a humorous rather than dramatic way, given the series' rom-com tone. It's also possible that Aharen and Raido's relationship will become romantic sooner than expected, especially given Aharen's slight megadere streak, and she might get in over her head. In that case, her dandere side may take over, and she could get flustered and retreat back into her shell, which may take Raido by surprise. Aharen isn't afraid to assertively express her affection to Raido, but once a certain point is reached, she may lose her nerve and rethink her relationship with him.

Coco's life changes after she witnesses a wizard casting spells without using his own innate power, but through the use of mysterious runes. Coco realizes she can achieve her dreams through the use of these runes, but her use of this ancient and potentially dangerous form of witchcraft threatens to shake up the foundation of the magical society in which she lives. The series was created by Shirahama in 2016 and continues to be serialized to this day. The manga has been a big hit in Japan, where it has sold more than 2.5 million copies. Witch Hat Atelier has been lauded for its optimistic tone, memorable characters and for Shirahama's distinctively detailed art style, with some critics drawing favorable comparisons between it and the works of Studio Ghibli and the Harry Potter series. The series has been awarded with numerous honors, including the prestigious Taisho Manga Award in 2018, and both the Eisner and Harvey Awards in 2020. An on-going spin-off series, entitled Witch Hat Kitchen, premiered in 2019.

The series has been awarded with numerous honors, including the prestigious Taisho Manga Award in 2018, and both the Eisner and Harvey Awards in 2020. An on-going spin-off series, entitled Witch Hat Kitchen, premiered in 2019. RELATED: Witch Hat Atelier Is a Must-Read for Fans of The Owl House Shirahama is also known to audiences in the West for her work with DC and Marvel comics, where she has created cover art for series such as Batgirl and the Birds of Prey, Nightwing and Star Wars: Doctor Aphra. She most recently worked with DC in 2019, when she created a variant cover for Wonder Woman #63. The first eight volumes of the Witch Hat Atelier manga are available in English in both print and digital formats from Kodansha USA. A ninth volume is scheduled to be released next June. Details about the anime adaptation's release outside of Japan have also not been announced at this time.

Prior to Part 2's finale, many fans suspected that there would be more to the series than this season, as there still remains several chapters worth of content from Hajime Isayama's original manga to adapt. Studio MAPPA confirmed that Part 3 was in production with a short teaser trailer that was released following the premiere of the 12th episode from Part 2. Isayama's Attack on Titan manga was first published in 2009. The manga is published by Kodansha, who picked up the series after Isayama's draft was infamously rejected by Shueisha, the publisher of the world's most popular manga magazine, Shonen Jump. Isayama has gotten the last laugh however, as his series has become one of the biggest entertainment franchises to come out of Japan in over a decade, with the manga now holding a worldwide circulation of over 100 million copies.

MAPPA's work on the first part of The Final Season was initially derided for not looking as good as Wit's seasons, but those issues have appeared to have either been addressed or simply ignored as most fans were absorbed in the hype for the series' finale.

By Jonathon Greenall Published 6 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    Some anime and manga creators are well known worldwide. For instance, mention Hideaki Anno to an anime fan and many will instantly realize who you're talking about. However, others remain largely unknown despite creating -- or having a significant role in -- legendary shows. Nowhere is this better displayed than with Kunihiko Ikuhara, as despite being a massive part of anime history, the famously eccentric Penguindrum creator isn't as well known as his contemporaries. Ikuhara recently made headlines when he announced he would be changing his name to Bonsoir Ikuhara, a move that turned out to be a creative promotion for his new musical project called Teiko BonBon. However, this isn't the only time the famous creator has bucked the trend and followed his own path.  Related: Spy X Family Creator Shares Adorable New Art for Series’ Anniversary                  Kunihiko Ikuhara joined Toei Animation in 1986, with his earliest role coming as assistant director on several Toei shows, including Maple Town Monogatari, Akuma-kun and Mōretsu Atarō. However, most American anime fans' first exposure to him will have been his work on Sailor Moon. Ikuhara directed several episodes of the legendary magical girl show, starting with Episode 6, ""Protect the Melody of Love: Usagi Plays Cupid."" During the second season, Sailor Moon R, Ikuhara would become the series' director, taking over from Junichi Sato. He also directed Sailor Moon R: The Movie, cementing him as a visionary director with an eye for impressive and memorable visuals. However, Ikuhara got annoyed with the lack of creative control Toei offered him and eventually left the company. After this, he would join up with several other creatives to form the art collective Be-Papas. RELATED: Tower of God's Cat and Dog Mini-Arc Is a Shakespearean Tragedy Be-Papas consisted of Ikuhara, shojo artist Chiho Saito, Neon Genesis Evangelion animation supervisor Shinya Hasegawa, former Sailor Moon writer Yōji Enokido and producer Yuuichirou Okuro. The name, according to Okuro, was a reference to the group growing up by stepping out on their own. Be-Papas would work on the legendary manga and anime Revolutionary Girl Utena. The manga came out in 1996 with the anime soon following in 1997, and both quickly cemented themselves as cult classics. Ikuhara took the director role for the anime, leading to the show's unique visual style. He would also reprise this role for the feature film, Adolescence of Utena in 1999, which presented a different take on the themes and story of Utena and showed Ikuhara's ability to create moving and symbolic sequences. After the Adolescence of Utena's release, Be-Papas disbanded -- but this was far from the end for Ikuhara. In 2001 he would team up with Seinosuke Ito and Chiho Saito to release the manga The World Exists for Me. He would also write the serialized novel Nokemono to Hanayome which ran between 2006-2017, and worked on several other projects covering everything from manga to music. Related: How Gundam Creator Yoshiyuki Tomino's ""Aura Battler Dunbine"" Influenced Isekai                  In 2011, Ikuhara returned to the director's chair to direct the supernatural mystery series Penguindrum, which he created and also co-wrote with Takayo Ikami. The series will be re-released later this year in the form of a remastered, updated and re-edited film titled Re:cycle of Penguindrum. Aside from that, he has directed and worked on several anime shows in the interim. In 2015 he directed Yurikuma Arashi, a series based on a manga he wrote. Then in 2019, Ikuhara created and co-directed Sarazanmai, an anime about students who turn into kappas. However, Ikuhara isn't just known for his creative work. He is famous for being extremely open in interviews, often giving clever, funny or surreal answers to questions. He's also known for his eccentric fashion choices; an image of him and Nagano Mamoru cosplaying as Sailor Venus and Mars is frequently reposted by fans. This is on top of his habit of changing his pseudonym depending on his current project, making Bonsoir Ikuhara just one in a long line of name changes. Kunihiko Ikuhara is a legendary anime creator who has rightfully earned a legion of dedicated fans. From his early work to the crowning achievement that was Revolutionary Girl Utena, Ikuhara has shown how versatile anime is as a storytelling and artistic medium.

By Jonathon Greenall Published 6 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    Some anime and manga creators are well known worldwide. For instance, mention Hideaki Anno to an anime fan and many will instantly realize who you're talking about. However, others remain largely unknown despite creating -- or having a significant role in -- legendary shows. Nowhere is this better displayed than with Kunihiko Ikuhara, as despite being a massive part of anime history, the famously eccentric Penguindrum creator isn't as well known as his contemporaries. Ikuhara recently made headlines when he announced he would be changing his name to Bonsoir Ikuhara, a move that turned out to be a creative promotion for his new musical project called Teiko BonBon. However, this isn't the only time the famous creator has bucked the trend and followed his own path.  Related: Spy X Family Creator Shares Adorable New Art for Series’ Anniversary                  Kunihiko Ikuhara joined Toei Animation in 1986, with his earliest role coming as assistant director on several Toei shows, including Maple Town Monogatari, Akuma-kun and Mōretsu Atarō. However, most American anime fans' first exposure to him will have been his work on Sailor Moon. Ikuhara directed several episodes of the legendary magical girl show, starting with Episode 6, ""Protect the Melody of Love: Usagi Plays Cupid."" During the second season, Sailor Moon R, Ikuhara would become the series' director, taking over from Junichi Sato. He also directed Sailor Moon R: The Movie, cementing him as a visionary director with an eye for impressive and memorable visuals. However, Ikuhara got annoyed with the lack of creative control Toei offered him and eventually left the company. After this, he would join up with several other creatives to form the art collective Be-Papas. RELATED: Tower of God's Cat and Dog Mini-Arc Is a Shakespearean Tragedy Be-Papas consisted of Ikuhara, shojo artist Chiho Saito, Neon Genesis Evangelion animation supervisor Shinya Hasegawa, former Sailor Moon writer Yōji Enokido and producer Yuuichirou Okuro. The name, according to Okuro, was a reference to the group growing up by stepping out on their own. Be-Papas would work on the legendary manga and anime Revolutionary Girl Utena. The manga came out in 1996 with the anime soon following in 1997, and both quickly cemented themselves as cult classics. Ikuhara took the director role for the anime, leading to the show's unique visual style. He would also reprise this role for the feature film, Adolescence of Utena in 1999, which presented a different take on the themes and story of Utena and showed Ikuhara's ability to create moving and symbolic sequences. After the Adolescence of Utena's release, Be-Papas disbanded -- but this was far from the end for Ikuhara. In 2001 he would team up with Seinosuke Ito and Chiho Saito to release the manga The World Exists for Me. He would also write the serialized novel Nokemono to Hanayome which ran between 2006-2017, and worked on several other projects covering everything from manga to music. Related: How Gundam Creator Yoshiyuki Tomino's ""Aura Battler Dunbine"" Influenced Isekai                  In 2011, Ikuhara returned to the director's chair to direct the supernatural mystery series Penguindrum, which he created and also co-wrote with Takayo Ikami. The series will be re-released later this year in the form of a remastered, updated and re-edited film titled Re:cycle of Penguindrum. Aside from that, he has directed and worked on several anime shows in the interim. In 2015 he directed Yurikuma Arashi, a series based on a manga he wrote. Then in 2019, Ikuhara created and co-directed Sarazanmai, an anime about students who turn into kappas. However, Ikuhara isn't just known for his creative work. He is famous for being extremely open in interviews, often giving clever, funny or surreal answers to questions. He's also known for his eccentric fashion choices; an image of him and Nagano Mamoru cosplaying as Sailor Venus and Mars is frequently reposted by fans. This is on top of his habit of changing his pseudonym depending on his current project, making Bonsoir Ikuhara just one in a long line of name changes. Kunihiko Ikuhara is a legendary anime creator who has rightfully earned a legion of dedicated fans. From his early work to the crowning achievement that was Revolutionary Girl Utena, Ikuhara has shown how versatile anime is as a storytelling and artistic medium. Hopefully, Re:cycle of Penguindrum and his upcoming projects get Ikuhara even more attention from fans in North America and across the world.

By Michael Lacerna Published 5 days ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    A massive new Fullmetal Alchemist statue has been unveiled, but it might be one of the costliest exchanges in the series' history. Good Smile Company is now taking preorders on its new Edward and Alphonse Elric statue. The massive statue is 16 inches tall and 17 inches wide, and depicts the brothers in battle as Ed transmutes his automail arm into a dagger and Al transforms the ground to give his older sibling a boost. True to the series' law of equivalent exchange, the highly detailed and sizable figure comes with an equally hefty price tag: $2,199.99 USD. The preorder window for the statue will close on May 11, though hardcore fans will want to scrounge together the funds quickly, however, as Good Smile warns only a limited number of the statues will be produced and the preorder window may close early if orders meet the production limit.

Fullmetal Alchemist was created by celebrated manga author and artist Hiromu Arakawa in 2001. The series was one of the most popular manga series of the early '00s, achieving a global circulation of over 80 million copies. The series tells the story of two brothers, Edward and Alphonse Elric, who use their natural talent in alchemy -- the ability to transform one object into another -- to try to resurrect their beloved mother after she suddenly passes away. The attempt goes horribly awry and costs Ed an arm and a leg, while Al loses his entire body and is only able to survive by having his soul anchored to an old suit of armor. Devastated by their losses, the two brothers join their country's military force, where they work as State Alchemists as they try to find a legendary artifact that will let them undo their biggest mistake. RELATED: Fullmetal Alchemist's Promised Day Arrives in Action-Packed Live Action Trailer Arakawa's critically acclaimed manga received two anime adaptations: the first was produced in 2003, before the manga was completed, and consequently features a substantially different story line and ending. A second anime, entitled Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood, premiered in 2009. The second series was a much more faithful rendition of Arakawa's original work and is now generally regarded as the superior adaptation. The series has also been adapted into a series of live-action movies, the first of which was released in 2017. The second and third entries in the trilogy are scheduled to be released in Japan later this year. Both anime series are now available for streaming on Hulu and Crunchyroll, while the manga is available in English from VIZ Media and Yen Press.

By Marc York Published 3 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    WARNING: The following contains major spoilers for Attack on Titan: The Final Season Part 2, now streaming on Funimation, Hulu and Crunchyroll. Attack on Titan: The Final Season Part 2 has officially wrapped, and on a chilling note. Eren Yeager, in his enormous Founding Titan form, has finally made landfall with his legion of Wall Titans. Even the combined military might of the entire world is powerless to stop the coming onslaught. Meanwhile, Eren's friends are on their way to stop him, although they obviously won't make it before a sizeable chunk of the human population beyond Paradis Island is trampled. However, this is all supposed to end, it certainly won't be pretty. What's really bothering fans, though, is that they won't be able to see the stunning conclusion until 2023.  With another year to go before Attack on Titan finally truly concludes, anime-only viewers are left to wonder about a lot of things. One would think that all of the major questions of AOT would have been answered by now. Anything along the lines of ""Eren starts the Rumbling"" sounds like it would be the ultimate spoiler for the series. Despite that, however, there are still things left unanswered that people want to know about. Before Attack on Titan can conclude for real (i.e., no more ""Parts""), it will have to at least give fans the answers they've been craving. RELATED: Marco's Final Words on Attack on Titan Are the Anime's Most Important What is the mysterious, spine-like creature?                  Attack on Titan Episode 80, ""From You, 2,000 Years Ago,"" finally introduced the source of Titans in the world. Thousands of years ago, a young Ymir stumbled into a pool of water beneath a tree and almost drowns, However, she is intercepted by a creature swimming in the water and transformed into what is now known as the Founding Titan. In the present day, Eren, the false inheritor of the Founding Titan, has his head shot off and almost dies. However, the same creature that saved Ymir all those millennia ago emerges from Eren's body and attaches itself to his head, thus transforming him into the new Founding Titan. Nobody is quite sure what to make of this thing. Many have likened it to the hallucigenia, a real-life organism that lived in the Cambrian Period. What it really is and where it came from baffles even some manga readers. RELATED: How Would Attack on Titan Have Changed If Erwin Became the Colossal Titan? How can the Rumbling be stopped?                  Nobody seems certain about what to do to stop the Rumbling. The united armies of the world tried firing at the Wall Titans, but there are far too many of them. Not even the united armies of the world could gather the firepower to stop millions upon millions of colossi. Eren's friends are on their way to stop him, but there's no telling how they'll do it. Armin wants to believe that they'll be able to talk some sense into Eren to get him to stop. The others are more convinced that they'll be forced to kill him. Even if Eren's friends decide to stop him with force, there's no telling how Eren himself will respond. With the powers of the Founding Titan, he doesn't even have to fight them directly; he could just brainwash them into not fighting him. Why he hasn't simply done this already remains a mystery. RELATED: Attack on Titan's New Antagonist May Have Topped Shiganshina's Death Toll Where are Eren and Zeke?                  Eren's current whereabouts are unknown. That is to say, the location of his real body is unknown. Obviously, it has to be somewhere along the skeleton so massive that not even the word ""colossal"" can't describe it, but that's part of the problem. For one thing, much of the Founding Titan is a giant skeleton, including the nape of the neck where the Titan Shifters would normally reside. That means Eren has to be somewhere else along this massive body; for all anyone knows, he could have transformed completely into the Titan itself. Zeke's whereabouts are similarly unknown. The last anyone saw of him was in Episode 80; as Eren was turning into the Founding Titan, Zeke was apparently overtaken by the hallucigenia. That implies that, like Eren, he's located somewhere along the Founding Titan's body. It's even possible that he's become one with the Founding Titan along with Eren. RELATED: Attack on Titan: The Scouts Found Their New Sniper Who will survive?                  This is the question everyone must ask even if they don't like the answer. For all of the beloved characters who have died in AOT already, there are still so many fan-favorites for whom audiences will have to wave a tearful goodbye. It hurts, but it's going to happen. It's just a question of who will, in fact, kick the bucket. Obviously, the Titan Shifters are fated to die within the next 13 years, but that doesn't mean some of them won't die in this final battle. Reiner, in particular, seems to be looking for just the right place to die. Besides the Titan Shifters, there are plenty of beloved characters with targets on their heads. Neither Jean nor Connie nor anyone else going up against Eren and his titans is safe, not even Levi. If main characters are meant to die, there's no better place than the series finale. RELATED: Attack on Titan's Latest Joke Has a Tragic Connection In what format will the anime conclude?                  This doesn't necessarily pertain to the narrative, but it's something a lot of people have been wondering about. Even manga readers have no idea how the anime staff is planning on handling the grand finale of AOT. Apparently, the ""Final Season"" is being divided into an additional third part. Fans have a couple of ideas for how the last chapters of AOT will be adapted. The simple answer would be to adapt the remaining chapters into more episodes. However, many fans say that the grand finale will be a feature-length film; these are only rumors, but it remains entirely plausible. It's important to remember that there are only nine chapters of AOT left to adapt. This seems like too few chapters to make the ideal 12-episode cour, but it might be just right for a film. In any case, everyone's desperate to know how everything will end for the anime.

The official Twitter account for the One Piece confirmed that Episode 1014, entitled ""Marco's Tears! The Bond of the Whitebeard Pirates,"" will air on April 17, followed by the release of Episode 1015, ""Straw Hat Luffy - The Man Who Will Become the Pirate King"" on April 24. Similarly, the official Twitter account for Digmon: Ghost Game confirmed that the series will also resume broadcasting new episodes on April 17 as well. The new releases will be the first episodes of each series to air since Toei Animation was affected by a hacking incident on March 6, in which an unauthorized third party accessed the company's private network and caused a shutdown of the studio's systems, resulting in several productions being hit with indefinite delays.

The film was originally scheduled to be released on April 22 in Japan, with a North American premiere to follow sometime this summer. Goku and friends' latest theatrical outing was indefinitely delayed following the incident, and a new release date for the highly anticipated movie has yet to be announced. Production on Toei Animation's other big anime movie, One Piece Film: Red, appears to be going smoothly, as the studio has been releasing a steady stream of new information and art from the film in recent weeks. Most recently, the studio revealed full-color art for Luffy, Nami and Zoro's new costumes. The movie sees the Straw Hat Pirates traveling to a new island for a music festival for a new adventure that will focus on Red-Haired Shanks, the pirate captain who inspired Luffy to follow in his footsteps, and a new, as-yet unnamed female character, who appears to be a singer of some kind. The movie will be released in Japan on Aug. 6. Details about the film's international release have yet to be announced. RELATED: One Piece: The True Nature of Luffy's Devil Fruit, Explained Toei Animation was originally founded in 1948 and is one of Japan's oldest and most well-known animation companies. The studio has worked on some of the most iconic anime series of all time, including Mazinger Z, Dragon Ball, Saint Seiya, Sailor Moon and Yu-Gi-Oh. Despite working on some of the biggest anime series in history, the studio has had a strained relationship with fans in recent years, and has been criticized for its heavy-handed approach to protecting its copyrights online. In 2021, the company kicked off a controversy about fair use policies when it used copyright strikes to remove hundreds of reviews of its shows off of YouTube. The incident caused YouTube to implement new policies to protect reviewers.

Majin Buu has a ton of power underneath his comical girth, but he sadly didn't get to show it off during Dragon Ball Super's Tournament of Power.  21 hours ago                      Movies   CBR's Morbius Guide: News, Easter Eggs, Reviews, Theories and Rumors  Morbius, the next Marvel legend, is continuing to build Sony's Spider-Man Universe with the tragic tale of an anti-hero Living Vampire.  1 day ago                      Movies   Before Morbius, How Sony Set Up the Sinister Six With Amazing Spider-Man 2  Morbius tries to put the Sinister Six on the big screen, but this wasn't Sony's first attempt at uniting the team of Spider-Man villains.  3 days ago                      Anime   Is Samurai Flamenco Just a Failed Version of Tiger & Bunny?  After a jarring tonal shift in its seventh episode, did Samurai Flamenco end up becoming just a lesser version of Tiger & Bunny?  3 days ago                      Anime   DanMachi: How to Get Started With the Anime, Manga & Light Novels  Is It Wrong to Pick Up Girls In a Dungeon? has a long-winded title, and it's fittingly seen many light novels, manga, anime and OVAs since 2013.  3 days ago                      Movies   Morbius’ Post-Credits Scene May Connect to Another Spider-Man Franchise  The Vulture somehow recovers his winged suit after the end of Morbius, and it may mean that he's in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man universe.  4 days ago                      TV   Godzilla: The Series Redeemed the Terrible 1998 Film  The 1998 Godzilla movie may have been terrible, but its animated sequel was everything that it wasn't, delivering Godzilla action that fans wanted.  4 days ago                      Anime   Tegami Bachi Is a Forgotten Shonen Anime Masterpiece  Eschewing typical shonen anime tropes for steampunk fantasy in an atmospheric and beautiful world, Tegami Bachi is a sadly overlooked classic.  4 days ago                      Movies   How the MCU's Vulture Lands in Morbius' Universe  The Vulture flies his way into Sony's Spider-Man Universe, though the explanation for how he does so is still incredibly nonsensical.  4 days ago                      Anime   Why Was Southern Cross' 'Robotech' Season Such a Flop?

By Komla Kwao Published 22 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    My Hero Academia's UA Traitor was finally revealed after years of their identity being hinted at. In a surprise twist, Class 1-A's most dazzling hero, Aoyama Yuga, was revealed to be All For One's spy within the school. Aoyama took no pride in his job, referring to himself as a despicable villain once he was caught. He recently aided the heroes in their plan to entrap All For One, but a closer look at some of Aoyama's actions during the Provisional Hero License exam reveals he'd been trying to leave the villain boss's employ for quite some time. Shortly after the first test in the exam began, Class 1-A found themselves separated by the rumbling effect of Shindo's Vibrate Quirk. Since that test hinged on teamwork, most of them began to look for their classmates immediately after they regained their bearings. Interestingly, Aoyama chose to hide behind a rock until he was found by Tenya Iida. Aoyama's cowardice was quite uncharacteristic for a student of the hero course -- but it makes sense if he was intentionally trying to fail the exam.  RELATED: My Hero Academia Reboots as a Sports Anime for April Fools                  Unlike many of the other Class 1-A students, Aoyama has never shown any particularly strong desire to become a hero in MHA. He was born Quirkless, and as a child admired heroes as many others did. To allow their son to chase his dream, Aoyama’s parents sought a Quirk for him from All For One -- but that gift came at a terrible price. The repayment demanded by the villain was their loyalty; he ordered Aoyama to enroll in UA and then forced him to leak sensitive information to the League of Villains. On the outside the boy was living his dream life, but he continued to sink into deeper despair with every task he completed for AFO. Spying for All For One isn't a job one could just opt out of, but as Aoyama must have realized, it couldn't be helped if he was no longer around Class 1-A because he failed his Provisional License exam. Understanding that he no longer intended to pass the exam puts his lack of enthusiasm upon reuniting with Iida -- and his actions later on -- into perspective. Upon meeting Iida, Aoyama initially scoffed at his class rep's determination to locate all of 1-A before passing the test himself, but Iida's earnest desire to serve the class reminded him of his own dreams of being a hero. His classmate's conviction triggered a flashback; young Aoyama was questioning his parents about why he was different. Before his traitor status and former Quirklessness were revealed, it was natural to assume he was referencing his laser's side effect -- now it's clear that Aoyama was asking why he didn't have a Quirk like everyone else in My Hero Academia. RELATED: MHA Artist Shares Menacing New Dabi Portrait                  The duo traveled together, but the combined might of the other schools targeting UA meant their chances of passing were quite slim. Realizing he was slowing Iida down, Aoyama decided to sacrifice himself so his class rep could pass. He fired a continuous stream of his navel laser into the sky, creating a pillar of light that could be seen from every corner of the arena and making himself an obvious target. He advised Iida to speed through the crowd that was heading toward them and take advantage of their tunnel vision to pass the test, but his plan backfired. Along with the rival schools that charged for Aoyama, the Class 1-A students who hadn't passed the test yet recognized the laser all too well. In an instant, the whole class had assembled around Aoyama and Iida. Using their tried and tested combo moves against their opponents, they completely decimated their rivals. The reinforcements were exactly what Aoyama and Iida needed to turn the tide, and both managed to pass by the skin of their teeth. However, in contrast to his classmates' more jubilant expressions upon passing, Aoyama simply remarked pensively ""Well that means my twinkle won't stop, huh?"" His job for All For One hadn't come to an end yet.

Surprisingly, he shares many qualities with another villain protagonist.     By Ryan Bridges Published 17 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    Eren Jaeger has unleashed the Wall Titans of Paradis and has begun his march on the world. Eren's plan to save Paradis will cost the lives of millions of innocent people and goes against everything that his friends stand for. Now that the Rumbling has started, Eren has solidified his position as Attack on Titan's true villain. Eren shares a lot of qualities with another villain protagonist: Light Yagami from Death Note. Both characters occupy a similar role in their respective stories. Light and Eren are characters with sympathetic goals, but the way they go about achieving these goals is heinous. Ever since Eren's heel turn, he has been acting more as Light would. Two of the most popular villain main characters in anime share a lot of similarities despite being from very different worlds.  RELATED: Fullmetal Alchemist Handles Politics Better Than Attack on Titan Both Light and Eren Want to Create a Perfect World                  One shared quality between Light and Eren is that both characters become disillusioned with the world. Light was disgusted with the level of crime and violence that plagued his world. Similarly, Eren was devastated to discover that the world of freedom he envisioned was marred by oppression and hatred. When the world didn't match the idealized version they wanted, both characters decided to do something about it. From the moment that Light received the Death Note, his goal was to create a world without injustice or evil. Light believes that he can make a world that has only good and honest people in it. This perfect world would be of his own design and follow his moral system. Light is ambitious and willing to do whatever it takes to achieve his goal. Eren's end goal is very similar to Light's; he wants to make a world of freedom where he and his friends can live how they want. Eren desires a world without walls where he and his friends can travel and see all the wonders they heard about as children. Creating this world of freedom is Eren's driving motivation, and just like Light, he is willing to do anything to make this a reality. Light and Eren are Manipulators                  These two villains understand that the world is not going to change just because they want it to. Some people oppose their plans and are ready to fight to the death to stop them. Eren and Light are willing to manipulate anyone, even their close friends and family, to get what they want. Both characters have displayed skills that make them master manipulators. RELATED: Attack on Titan: How Floch Grew From a Coward to a Fearless Soldier Light spends most of the series deceiving those around him and using their trust to his advantage. He routinely abuses the love and trust that Misa has for him, often putting her in dangerous situations so that he can avoid the risk while progressing his plans. Light also exploits his father's position in the police to gain information on the investigation against him. To start the Rumbling, Eren needed access to an Eldian with royal blood. His half-brother Zeke fulfilled that need perfectly, so he became one of the many people that Eren would use. Eren lied to Zeke and convinced him that he supported the plan to euthanize all Eldians. When the time came to enact the plan, Eren betrayed his brother, overthrew the government and turned against his friends, all for his true goal. Both Eren and Light will ruthlessly use those around them no matter how close they may be. No Cost is Too High For Light and Eren                  The worlds that Light and Eren are trying to create require a massacre. An enormous amount of people will have to die to achieve their goals. The people that Eren and Light need to kill aren't just criminals or bigoted tyrants who might deserve death. Innocent people who have nothing to do with their plans will be sacrificed for their greater ambitions too. Regardless of the number of people who would die in the progress, both Eren and Light believe that the deaths are worth it. Throughout Death Note, Light kills scores of police officers and civilians who get in his way. Even those who aren't interfering in Light's plans might still find themselves sacrificed so that Light can avoid capture. Likewise, the Rumbling won't solely wipe out Marely; millions of children and other innocents who have never harmed an Eldian will die in the process. For these two villains, no amount of death and carnage is too high a price for their dreams to come true.

06-04-2022,anime,2,0,https://www.cbr.com/attack-on-titan-eren-jaeger-death-note-light-yagami-similarities/,AoT's Eren Jaeger Is Similar to Death Note's Light Yagami,"   Attack on Titan’s Eren Jaeger Has Become the New Light Yagami Eren Jaeger has become the ultimate villain of Attack on Titan. Surprisingly, he shares many qualities with another villain protagonist.     By Ryan Bridges Published 17 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    Eren Jaeger has unleashed the Wall Titans of Paradis and has begun his march on the world. Eren's plan to save Paradis will cost the lives of millions of innocent people and goes against everything that his friends stand for. Now that the Rumbling has started, Eren has solidified his position as Attack on Titan's true villain. Eren shares a lot of qualities with another villain protagonist: Light Yagami from Death Note. Both characters occupy a similar role in their respective stories. Light and Eren are characters with sympathetic goals, but the way they go about achieving these goals is heinous. Ever since Eren's heel turn, he has been acting more as Light would. Two of the most popular villain main characters in anime share a lot of similarities despite being from very different worlds.  RELATED: Fullmetal Alchemist Handles Politics Better Than Attack on Titan Both Light and Eren Want to Create a Perfect World                  One shared quality between Light and Eren is that both characters become disillusioned with the world. Light was disgusted with the level of crime and violence that plagued his world. Similarly, Eren was devastated to discover that the world of freedom he envisioned was marred by oppression and hatred. When the world didn't match the idealized version they wanted, both characters decided to do something about it. From the moment that Light received the Death Note, his goal was to create a world without injustice or evil. Light believes that he can make a world that has only good and honest people in it. This perfect world would be of his own design and follow his moral system. Light is ambitious and willing to do whatever it takes to achieve his goal. Eren's end goal is very similar to Light's; he wants to make a world of freedom where he and his friends can live how they want. Eren desires a world without walls where he and his friends can travel and see all the wonders they heard about as children. Creating this world of freedom is Eren's driving motivation, and just like Light, he is willing to do anything to make this a reality. Light and Eren are Manipulators                  These two villains understand that the world is not going to change just because they want it to. Some people oppose their plans and are ready to fight to the death to stop them. Eren and Light are willing to manipulate anyone, even their close friends and family, to get what they want. Both characters have displayed skills that make them master manipulators. RELATED: Attack on Titan: How Floch Grew From a Coward to a Fearless Soldier Light spends most of the series deceiving those around him and using their trust to his advantage. He routinely abuses the love and trust that Misa has for him, often putting her in dangerous situations so that he can avoid the risk while progressing his plans. Light also exploits his father's position in the police to gain information on the investigation against him. To start the Rumbling, Eren needed access to an Eldian with royal blood. His half-brother Zeke fulfilled that need perfectly, so he became one of the many people that Eren would use. Eren lied to Zeke and convinced him that he supported the plan to euthanize all Eldians. When the time came to enact the plan, Eren betrayed his brother, overthrew the government and turned against his friends, all for his true goal. Both Eren and Light will ruthlessly use those around them no matter how close they may be. No Cost is Too High For Light and Eren                  The worlds that Light and Eren are trying to create require a massacre. An enormous amount of people will have to die to achieve their goals. The people that Eren and Light need to kill aren't just criminals or bigoted tyrants who might deserve death. Innocent people who have nothing to do with their plans will be sacrificed for their greater ambitions too. Regardless of the number of people who would die in the progress, both Eren and Light believe that the deaths are worth it. Throughout Death Note, Light kills scores of police officers and civilians who get in his way. Even those who aren't interfering in Light's plans might still find themselves sacrificed so that Light can avoid capture. Likewise, the Rumbling won't solely wipe out Marely; millions of children and other innocents who have never harmed an Eldian will die in the process. For these two villains, no amount of death and carnage is too high a price for their dreams to come true.

A genuine masterpiece. if you are not fond of a lot of symbolism and a ""Show, not Tell"" visual storytelling technique in this show, then this is not for you.   let alone the most controversial theme of this anime. I know, a lot of people tried nitpicking the show about discrimination and racism on the first cour that they forgot how well written these characters are. I must say that's just 10% of the show, hating the show because of the theme won't work on me. It only serves as a drive for the character development. If you compare 86 Eighty-six to its predecessors that shares the same theme (Aldnoah, Code Geass both R1 and Akito the Exiled, FMAB, Shingeki no Kyojin etc...). is that it dives deeper into characterization instead of just leaving it as if it did not affect the character at all. I've never felt like this in 11 years since the FMA: Brotherhood. Do people just like to hate what's popular and forget the main point of the story? I love every anime that was produced earlier and up to this date.    So for the review, this is just my summary and will not go into details. I'm not that vocal when it comes to anime review.   Storyline 10/10: A balanced dialogue and more visual storytelling compared to most anime, attention to detail are top-notch, a lot of foreshadowing and symbolism. So for the story, the first cour covers their everyday life on the frontline while the second cour focuses on the 86's (especially Shin's) experience and relationship with the new peaceful environment they're in, finding their purpose in life only to return back again. Moving on from the battlefield takes a LOT of time, especially when fighting till death is their daily routine. The pacing is great, just enough to understand whole point of the story. We can see the main antagonist of the story (Legion) are evolving both their strategy and military strength. The world building you will see in the anime is just the beginning and will get 20/10 better as soon as the next arc kicks in.   Art 10/10: Art is good, not to mention the great use of CGI animation, probably one of the best mechanical CGI I've seen that just felt right. Thanks I-IV for the mechanical designs you made for 86, The design is so great that it convinces me that it can be made in real life, compared to other mecha counterpart, this is the first one I think(my experience) that is supported by real life technical req. and blueprints inspired from world war 2 and cold war era. Its just that accurate.  Characters 10/10: Characters are very well-written, as much as the 86's tries to fit in, we can see their struggles on the society/environment they're in. We got new characters that vital on the next arc and beyond (further character development will come soon). What I like on 86 Eighty-six is that not one of them have a victim mentality, a character that knows their responsibility upholding their morals ever since the previous spearhead squadron's founding. Seeing our Reaper, slowly regaining his emotion and become more human than he was before he put his brother to rest was an honest heartbreaking moment. If anything a person would say its your regular shounen? then you are a lost soul.   Sound 10/10: the soundtrack are amazing, thanks to Amazarashi, Kohta Yamamoto, and Hiroyuki Sawano. especially the last two endings. The opening music is a total banger and the ending song from episode 23 (epilogue of vol. 3) LilaS sang by Honoka Takahashi. Everything was spot-on emotional and meaningful. Not one 86 Eighty-six fans can forget.   ""I won't forget"".   Overall 11/10: This has to be the best season 1 with sequel, ending of an anime that no one in the anime series ever reached before which rivals the so called 'best' from any generation, to see the weakest arc get adapted into a masterpiece? I would highly recommend this show. Again, lot of symbolism and a ""Show, not Tell"" visual storytelling since the first cour thanks to passionate director, staffs and author herself, Asato Asato. If not this year, then sooner or later, 86 Eighty-six will get the fame and recognition it deserves.    Helpful       report                          ",positive,en,{}

They may be released and financed under the company name, but it is men and women, sometimes from around the world, who are the ones that actually put pen to paper (or stylus and mouse to screen, rather) to produce the content we care about. The studios’ management is involved as well, but the current landscape of the anime industry is often not friendly to its staff, sometimes dumping projects on them with no time to get them finished or rushing them out the door despite their lacking quality. More and more stories like these are becoming documented, and it’s important to acknowledge them.  ""Tokyo 24th Ward"" was a Winter 2022 anime that regrettably got this problem. One month before the show started airing, key animation director Kiminori Itou vocally stated on Twitter that he was not optimistic about the project, and that the amount of time given to the production paled in comparison to CloverWorks’ other two shows that aired this season, Akebi’s Sailor Uniform and My Dress-Up Darling. This puts ""Tokyo 24th Ward"" in a weird light – if it succeeded despite itself, it would be all the more impressive. If it failed, it would likely be the result of the series not having enough time to pull itself together. Whether that is the result of CloverWorks themselves, or Aniplex, the company that licensed it, we can only guess. Either way, it is the end product that determines an outcome like that.  The series takes place in a futuristic, economically-divided ward that might be integrated into the larger city of Tokyo. After their friend Asumi dies in a fire at their old elementary school, childhood friends Shuta, Ran, and Koki all receive a mysterious phone call at the same time from someone claiming to be Asumi. Upon answering the call, they receive a vision of one of their friends and her dog stuck on a railroad track and must decide whether to allow the train to hit them or slow down the train and risk hurting the passengers. <play that sequence> The phone call also imbues them with enhanced abilities, as they spring into action to try and resolve this rather-literal Trolley Problem. As time passes, more Trolley Problem complications will be presented that the three friends must contend with, and it will test the boundaries of their friendships, the ward, and whatever is causing these things to happen.  One of the Trolley Problem’s caveats in practical application, among many, is that it presents two moral extremes for which there is no possible alternative, which dangerously runs the risk of being too disconnected or disassociated from real life to have any significant meaning (even if one can cherry-pick actual stories of Trolley Problem-esque occurrences). An additional downside is that it can reduce a person’s perception of a situation down to its numerical value rather than an empathic value, which doesn’t necessarily bode well for psychological interpretation. To put it another way as Spock did, one could look at the Problem and argue that “the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few,” without understanding the resulting implications for who lives and who dies and the world beyond the problem’s framework. Thus, a story using the Trolley Problem starts on a fundamentally shaky ground because it needs to frame the scenarios as being justifiable both in terms of setting them up and the extremes it presents.  The fact that ""Tokyo 24th Ward"" takes place in a futuristic setting allows its incorporation of the Trolley Problem to work more seamlessly than it would otherwise. Because the series utilizes advanced machines, surveillance, and revolves primarily around the lives of its three main characters, the Problems read as being the expected result of things not occurring within expected parameters. The machines not doing what they’re supposed to be doing, or actually doing precisely what they’re supposed to be doing but in an unforeseen manner, is why the Trolley Problems themselves manifest. Shuta, Ran, and Koki all have various outlooks on the Problems, which helps fuel the conflict surrounding the moralistic decisions they face, as well as their tolerance of each other’s reasoning.  But as far as the three friends are concerned, their chemistry together, regardless of being fractured from Asumi’s death, isn’t pleasant to watch. Shuta fashions himself as the hero of the 24th Ward and upset that he failed to save Asumi, but fails moreso to have a character beyond being a “nice guy” with a superhero ideology, and sadly not much in the way of intelligence. Wanting to help people is certainly noble, but the more-fascinating relationship among the mains, the one between Ran and Koki, is such because they are at complete odds with one another – Ran is a graffiti artist that uses his talents to convey messages, while Koki is a by-the-book, calculating individual with a penchant for siding with law and order. They naturally gravitate towards different circles and schools of thought.  Interestingly enough, for people who supposedly care so much about Asumi, including the fact that Koki is her brother, it is mind-boggling that Shuta, Ran, and Koki never at any point have an earnest conversation about whether it really is Asumi talking to them, or someone pretending to be her. Especially given the crazy happenings that led to the events in episode one’s climax, one would reasonably expect that there would be some kind of brainstorming session to determine what precisely happened. Even if no conclusion had been reached, even if tempers get particularly flared, or even absent any agreement, this is a conversation that needed to happen. Months in-universe transpire without that dialogue.  The reason for this is because, without Asumi’s insistence that when the three are working together that anything is possible, the narrative doesn’t really have a friendship to cultivate for them. The show plays up the chasm between the three in light of Asumi’s death, which makes sense. But whether through flashback or present-time events, we see little evidence of an earnestness between the mains that existed beforehand. Hence, a dialogue taking place evaluating the truth of whether Asumi called them after the first episode cannot happen because the connection via friendship is, more or less, nonexistent.   Instead, the second episode follows the Ward putting on a cooking festival for the residents, resulting in a controversy over someone buying up all the cabbage. This handling of storytelling priority is a part of what makes ""Tokyo 24th Ward"" so bewildering; the series will propose plots or threads that are theoretically interesting, but shies away from exploring many of them. And when it does try to explore some of those threads, its sense of dramaturgy makes for some questionable decisions. During that same cooking festival arc, the three main characters are outside a warehouse and are deciding whether to bust in and get the cabbage they need for their friend’s okonomiyaki recipe, only to be told by someone that they don’t need to do that because they found some more cabbage lying around that they could use. There’s a build-up that insinuates some kind of action-style sequence will occur, only to pull the rug out from under itself by saying that such a thing wasn’t necessary in the first place. <play that sequence>  The roster of secondary characters is wide, and it’s rather sad that they tend to be vastly more interesting and theoretically-compelling than most stories involving the trio. Given the outcomes of some of the Trolley Problems that take place, the secondaries occasionally have to face the ramifications of the trio’s decisions. Kozue is one particular character who stands out in this respect, as an entire episode is centered around her in the aftershock of what happened. But she, like many others, is stymied by ""Tokyo 24th Ward"" having her take actions or decisions that either lead to unspectacular payoffs via poor buildup or head-scratching choices.   And unfortunately, not even the overall animation or aesthetic can carry the show along, either. It seems that Kiminori Itou’s frustrations make themselves most evident in this regard. Despite the decent look of the cityscape and the ward itself, the character designs are rather uninteresting or are, at worst, horribly off-model. Watching this show from week-to-week made it feel like the show got quite shortchanged in regards to the animation side of production, and given that episodes were delayed twice with a mid-series recap thrown in, this really becomes a nuisance. That doesn’t mean that there are no moments that don’t work, because some do. But given the level of animation CloverWorks is capable of, they are few and far between. <Asumi call sequence>  Perhaps the biggest frustration within ""Tokyo 24th Ward"" is that the various ideas that are on display here are indeed more than capable of filling out a twelve-episode narrative. But as presented, it is oversaturated and cannot accommodate everything in a satisfactory manner. The result is a slew of concepts that are half-baked, unable to reach anything moderately close to full realization, whatever that could be. If the show wants to propose a series of ethical or moralistic decisions that our characters are thrust into, or paint its world with overarching themes that carry particular significance for its characters, then it needs to make a commitment to actually investigate them seriously. It doesn’t need offer a complete, perfect solution to each question (and it would be presumptuous to assume one exists), but the exercise of engaging with the discussions the show wants to have must still be fun in and of itself. For me, this wasn’t.  One could argue that the series is not trying to actually probe that deeply about its concepts, that a series where conflicts are presented to generally last a couple of episodes doesn’t bear the responsibility to fully flesh them out. But when the series puts forward the ideas of economic class disparity via Shantytown, ethical decisions about who should live and die via the Trolley Problems, technology’s growing presence in our lives and its misuse, and stopping crimes before they happen (among other things), it’s not really a compliment to make a claim that the show doesn’t have to put in the legwork. It doesn’t need to be on the level of elegant prose, but it cannot read as disingenuous, which was what it left me with. By the time the final episode had rolled around and presented its last predicament, my interest had, much like Asumi, long since died.  ""Tokyo 24th Ward"" is an inconsistent lumping of concepts and aesthetic, trying to have its various pieces come together in a way that makes sense, but cannot commit to doing so. Its drama often does not work both at the individual episodic level and the grander narrative overall, with characters making unusual decisions or having revelations that lack dramatic weight and sensibility. The designs are often off-model, and the plot is a hodgepodge of events that don’t deliver despite trying to make use of its Trolley Problem framework. Ultimately, it was a misfire. It’s ironic that a series about having to make decisions with little time to spare was made by animators and writers with little time to spare themselves. Delaying an episode an extra week or having a placeholder recap is only a temporary band-aid for a larger wound. This is one case however where life imitating art resulted in the worser of two results.              Helpful       report                          ",positive,en,{}

The studios’ management is involved as well, but the current landscape of the anime industry is often not friendly to its staff, sometimes dumping projects on them with no time to get them finished or rushing them out the door despite their lacking quality. More and more stories like these are becoming documented, and it’s important to acknowledge them.  ""Tokyo 24th Ward"" was a Winter 2022 anime that regrettably got this problem. One month before the show started airing, key animation director Kiminori Itou vocally stated on Twitter that he was not optimistic about the project, and that the amount of time given to the production paled in comparison to CloverWorks’ other two shows that aired this season, Akebi’s Sailor Uniform and My Dress-Up Darling. This puts ""Tokyo 24th Ward"" in a weird light – if it succeeded despite itself, it would be all the more impressive. If it failed, it would likely be the result of the series not having enough time to pull itself together. Whether that is the result of CloverWorks themselves, or Aniplex, the company that licensed it, we can only guess. Either way, it is the end product that determines an outcome like that.  The series takes place in a futuristic, economically-divided ward that might be integrated into the larger city of Tokyo. After their friend Asumi dies in a fire at their old elementary school, childhood friends Shuta, Ran, and Koki all receive a mysterious phone call at the same time from someone claiming to be Asumi. Upon answering the call, they receive a vision of one of their friends and her dog stuck on a railroad track and must decide whether to allow the train to hit them or slow down the train and risk hurting the passengers. <play that sequence> The phone call also imbues them with enhanced abilities, as they spring into action to try and resolve this rather-literal Trolley Problem. As time passes, more Trolley Problem complications will be presented that the three friends must contend with, and it will test the boundaries of their friendships, the ward, and whatever is causing these things to happen.  One of the Trolley Problem’s caveats in practical application, among many, is that it presents two moral extremes for which there is no possible alternative, which dangerously runs the risk of being too disconnected or disassociated from real life to have any significant meaning (even if one can cherry-pick actual stories of Trolley Problem-esque occurrences). An additional downside is that it can reduce a person’s perception of a situation down to its numerical value rather than an empathic value, which doesn’t necessarily bode well for psychological interpretation. To put it another way as Spock did, one could look at the Problem and argue that “the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few,” without understanding the resulting implications for who lives and who dies and the world beyond the problem’s framework. Thus, a story using the Trolley Problem starts on a fundamentally shaky ground because it needs to frame the scenarios as being justifiable both in terms of setting them up and the extremes it presents.  The fact that ""Tokyo 24th Ward"" takes place in a futuristic setting allows its incorporation of the Trolley Problem to work more seamlessly than it would otherwise. Because the series utilizes advanced machines, surveillance, and revolves primarily around the lives of its three main characters, the Problems read as being the expected result of things not occurring within expected parameters. The machines not doing what they’re supposed to be doing, or actually doing precisely what they’re supposed to be doing but in an unforeseen manner, is why the Trolley Problems themselves manifest. Shuta, Ran, and Koki all have various outlooks on the Problems, which helps fuel the conflict surrounding the moralistic decisions they face, as well as their tolerance of each other’s reasoning.  But as far as the three friends are concerned, their chemistry together, regardless of being fractured from Asumi’s death, isn’t pleasant to watch. Shuta fashions himself as the hero of the 24th Ward and upset that he failed to save Asumi, but fails moreso to have a character beyond being a “nice guy” with a superhero ideology, and sadly not much in the way of intelligence. Wanting to help people is certainly noble, but the more-fascinating relationship among the mains, the one between Ran and Koki, is such because they are at complete odds with one another – Ran is a graffiti artist that uses his talents to convey messages, while Koki is a by-the-book, calculating individual with a penchant for siding with law and order. They naturally gravitate towards different circles and schools of thought.  Interestingly enough, for people who supposedly care so much about Asumi, including the fact that Koki is her brother, it is mind-boggling that Shuta, Ran, and Koki never at any point have an earnest conversation about whether it really is Asumi talking to them, or someone pretending to be her. Especially given the crazy happenings that led to the events in episode one’s climax, one would reasonably expect that there would be some kind of brainstorming session to determine what precisely happened. Even if no conclusion had been reached, even if tempers get particularly flared, or even absent any agreement, this is a conversation that needed to happen. Months in-universe transpire without that dialogue.  The reason for this is because, without Asumi’s insistence that when the three are working together that anything is possible, the narrative doesn’t really have a friendship to cultivate for them. The show plays up the chasm between the three in light of Asumi’s death, which makes sense. But whether through flashback or present-time events, we see little evidence of an earnestness between the mains that existed beforehand. Hence, a dialogue taking place evaluating the truth of whether Asumi called them after the first episode cannot happen because the connection via friendship is, more or less, nonexistent.   Instead, the second episode follows the Ward putting on a cooking festival for the residents, resulting in a controversy over someone buying up all the cabbage. This handling of storytelling priority is a part of what makes ""Tokyo 24th Ward"" so bewildering; the series will propose plots or threads that are theoretically interesting, but shies away from exploring many of them. And when it does try to explore some of those threads, its sense of dramaturgy makes for some questionable decisions. During that same cooking festival arc, the three main characters are outside a warehouse and are deciding whether to bust in and get the cabbage they need for their friend’s okonomiyaki recipe, only to be told by someone that they don’t need to do that because they found some more cabbage lying around that they could use. There’s a build-up that insinuates some kind of action-style sequence will occur, only to pull the rug out from under itself by saying that such a thing wasn’t necessary in the first place. <play that sequence>  The roster of secondary characters is wide, and it’s rather sad that they tend to be vastly more interesting and theoretically-compelling than most stories involving the trio. Given the outcomes of some of the Trolley Problems that take place, the secondaries occasionally have to face the ramifications of the trio’s decisions. Kozue is one particular character who stands out in this respect, as an entire episode is centered around her in the aftershock of what happened. But she, like many others, is stymied by ""Tokyo 24th Ward"" having her take actions or decisions that either lead to unspectacular payoffs via poor buildup or head-scratching choices.   And unfortunately, not even the overall animation or aesthetic can carry the show along, either. It seems that Kiminori Itou’s frustrations make themselves most evident in this regard. Despite the decent look of the cityscape and the ward itself, the character designs are rather uninteresting or are, at worst, horribly off-model. Watching this show from week-to-week made it feel like the show got quite shortchanged in regards to the animation side of production, and given that episodes were delayed twice with a mid-series recap thrown in, this really becomes a nuisance. That doesn’t mean that there are no moments that don’t work, because some do. But given the level of animation CloverWorks is capable of, they are few and far between. <Asumi call sequence>  Perhaps the biggest frustration within ""Tokyo 24th Ward"" is that the various ideas that are on display here are indeed more than capable of filling out a twelve-episode narrative. But as presented, it is oversaturated and cannot accommodate everything in a satisfactory manner. The result is a slew of concepts that are half-baked, unable to reach anything moderately close to full realization, whatever that could be. If the show wants to propose a series of ethical or moralistic decisions that our characters are thrust into, or paint its world with overarching themes that carry particular significance for its characters, then it needs to make a commitment to actually investigate them seriously. It doesn’t need offer a complete, perfect solution to each question (and it would be presumptuous to assume one exists), but the exercise of engaging with the discussions the show wants to have must still be fun in and of itself. For me, this wasn’t.  One could argue that the series is not trying to actually probe that deeply about its concepts, that a series where conflicts are presented to generally last a couple of episodes doesn’t bear the responsibility to fully flesh them out. But when the series puts forward the ideas of economic class disparity via Shantytown, ethical decisions about who should live and die via the Trolley Problems, technology’s growing presence in our lives and its misuse, and stopping crimes before they happen (among other things), it’s not really a compliment to make a claim that the show doesn’t have to put in the legwork. It doesn’t need to be on the level of elegant prose, but it cannot read as disingenuous, which was what it left me with. By the time the final episode had rolled around and presented its last predicament, my interest had, much like Asumi, long since died.  ""Tokyo 24th Ward"" is an inconsistent lumping of concepts and aesthetic, trying to have its various pieces come together in a way that makes sense, but cannot commit to doing so. Its drama often does not work both at the individual episodic level and the grander narrative overall, with characters making unusual decisions or having revelations that lack dramatic weight and sensibility. The designs are often off-model, and the plot is a hodgepodge of events that don’t deliver despite trying to make use of its Trolley Problem framework. Ultimately, it was a misfire. It’s ironic that a series about having to make decisions with little time to spare was made by animators and writers with little time to spare themselves. Delaying an episode an extra week or having a placeholder recap is only a temporary band-aid for a larger wound. This is one case however where life imitating art resulted in the worser of two results.              Helpful       report                  ",positive,en,{}

This handling of storytelling priority is a part of what makes ""Tokyo 24th Ward"" so bewildering; the series will propose plots or threads that are theoretically interesting, but shies away from exploring many of them. And when it does try to explore some of those threads, its sense of dramaturgy makes for some questionable decisions. During that same cooking festival arc, the three main characters are outside a warehouse and are deciding whether to bust in and get the cabbage they need for their friend’s okonomiyaki recipe, only to be told by someone that they don’t need to do that because they found some more cabbage lying around that they could use. There’s a build-up that insinuates some kind of action-style sequence will occur, only to pull the rug out from under itself by saying that such a thing wasn’t necessary in the first place. <play that sequence>  The roster of secondary characters is wide, and it’s rather sad that they tend to be vastly more interesting and theoretically-compelling than most stories involving the trio. Given the outcomes of some of the Trolley Problems that take place, the secondaries occasionally have to face the ramifications of the trio’s decisions. Kozue is one particular character who stands out in this respect, as an entire episode is centered around her in the aftershock of what happened. But she, like many others, is stymied by ""Tokyo 24th Ward"" having her take actions or decisions that either lead to unspectacular payoffs via poor buildup or head-scratching choices.   And unfortunately, not even the overall animation or aesthetic can carry the show along, either. It seems that Kiminori Itou’s frustrations make themselves most evident in this regard. Despite the decent look of the cityscape and the ward itself, the character designs are rather uninteresting or are, at worst, horribly off-model. Watching this show from week-to-week made it feel like the show got quite shortchanged in regards to the animation side of production, and given that episodes were delayed twice with a mid-series recap thrown in, this really becomes a nuisance. That doesn’t mean that there are no moments that don’t work, because some do. But given the level of animation CloverWorks is capable of, they are few and far between. <Asumi call sequence>  Perhaps the biggest frustration within ""Tokyo 24th Ward"" is that the various ideas that are on display here are indeed more than capable of filling out a twelve-episode narrative. But as presented, it is oversaturated and cannot accommodate everything in a satisfactory manner. The result is a slew of concepts that are half-baked, unable to reach anything moderately close to full realization, whatever that could be. If the show wants to propose a series of ethical or moralistic decisions that our characters are thrust into, or paint its world with overarching themes that carry particular significance for its characters, then it needs to make a commitment to actually investigate them seriously. It doesn’t need offer a complete, perfect solution to each question (and it would be presumptuous to assume one exists), but the exercise of engaging with the discussions the show wants to have must still be fun in and of itself. For me, this wasn’t.  One could argue that the series is not trying to actually probe that deeply about its concepts, that a series where conflicts are presented to generally last a couple of episodes doesn’t bear the responsibility to fully flesh them out. But when the series puts forward the ideas of economic class disparity via Shantytown, ethical decisions about who should live and die via the Trolley Problems, technology’s growing presence in our lives and its misuse, and stopping crimes before they happen (among other things), it’s not really a compliment to make a claim that the show doesn’t have to put in the legwork. It doesn’t need to be on the level of elegant prose, but it cannot read as disingenuous, which was what it left me with. By the time the final episode had rolled around and presented its last predicament, my interest had, much like Asumi, long since died.  ""Tokyo 24th Ward"" is an inconsistent lumping of concepts and aesthetic, trying to have its various pieces come together in a way that makes sense, but cannot commit to doing so. Its drama often does not work both at the individual episodic level and the grander narrative overall, with characters making unusual decisions or having revelations that lack dramatic weight and sensibility. The designs are often off-model, and the plot is a hodgepodge of events that don’t deliver despite trying to make use of its Trolley Problem framework. Ultimately, it was a misfire. It’s ironic that a series about having to make decisions with little time to spare was made by animators and writers with little time to spare themselves. Delaying an episode an extra week or having a placeholder recap is only a temporary band-aid for a larger wound.

They may be released and financed under the company name, but it is men and women, sometimes from around the world, who are the ones that actually put pen to paper (or stylus and mouse to screen, rather) to produce the content we care about. The studios’ management is involved as well, but the current landscape of the anime industry is often not friendly to its staff, sometimes dumping projects on them with no time to get them finished or rushing them out the door despite their lacking quality. More and more stories like these are becoming documented, and it’s important to acknowledge them.  ""Tokyo 24th Ward"" was a Winter 2022 anime that regrettably got this problem. One month before the show started airing, key animation director Kiminori Itou vocally stated on Twitter that he was not optimistic about the project, and that the amount of time given to the production paled in comparison to CloverWorks’ other two shows that aired this season, Akebi’s Sailor Uniform and My Dress-Up Darling. This puts ""Tokyo 24th Ward"" in a weird light – if it succeeded despite itself, it would be all the more impressive. If it failed, it would likely be the result of the series not having enough time to pull itself together. Whether that is the result of CloverWorks themselves, or Aniplex, the company that licensed it, we can only guess. Either way, it is the end product that determines an outcome like that.  The series takes place in a futuristic, economically-divided ward that might be integrated into the larger city of Tokyo. After their friend Asumi dies in a fire at their old elementary school, childhood friends Shuta, Ran, and Koki all receive a mysterious phone call at the same time from someone claiming to be Asumi. Upon answering the call, they receive a vision of one of their friends and her dog stuck on a railroad track and must decide whether to allow the train to hit them or slow down the train and risk hurting the passengers. <play that sequence> The phone call also imbues them with enhanced abilities, as they spring into action to try and resolve this rather-literal Trolley Problem. As time passes, more Trolley Problem complications will be presented that the three friends must contend with, and it will test the boundaries of their friendships, the ward, and whatever is causing these things to happen.  One of the Trolley Problem’s caveats in practical application, among many, is that it presents two moral extremes for which there is no possible alternative, which dangerously runs the risk of being too disconnected or disassociated from real life to have any significant meaning (even if one can cherry-pick actual stories of Trolley Problem-esque occurrences). An additional downside is that it can reduce a person’s perception of a situation down to its numerical value rather than an empathic value, which doesn’t necessarily bode well for psychological interpretation. To put it another way as Spock did, one could look at the Problem and argue that “the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few,” without understanding the resulting implications for who lives and who dies and the world beyond the problem’s framework. Thus, a story using the Trolley Problem starts on a fundamentally shaky ground because it needs to frame the scenarios as being justifiable both in terms of setting them up and the extremes it presents.  The fact that ""Tokyo 24th Ward"" takes place in a futuristic setting allows its incorporation of the Trolley Problem to work more seamlessly than it would otherwise. Because the series utilizes advanced machines, surveillance, and revolves primarily around the lives of its three main characters, the Problems read as being the expected result of things not occurring within expected parameters. The machines not doing what they’re supposed to be doing, or actually doing precisely what they’re supposed to be doing but in an unforeseen manner, is why the Trolley Problems themselves manifest. Shuta, Ran, and Koki all have various outlooks on the Problems, which helps fuel the conflict surrounding the moralistic decisions they face, as well as their tolerance of each other’s reasoning.  But as far as the three friends are concerned, their chemistry together, regardless of being fractured from Asumi’s death, isn’t pleasant to watch. Shuta fashions himself as the hero of the 24th Ward and upset that he failed to save Asumi, but fails moreso to have a character beyond being a “nice guy” with a superhero ideology, and sadly not much in the way of intelligence. Wanting to help people is certainly noble, but the more-fascinating relationship among the mains, the one between Ran and Koki, is such because they are at complete odds with one another – Ran is a graffiti artist that uses his talents to convey messages, while Koki is a by-the-book, calculating individual with a penchant for siding with law and order. They naturally gravitate towards different circles and schools of thought.  Interestingly enough, for people who supposedly care so much about Asumi, including the fact that Koki is her brother, it is mind-boggling that Shuta, Ran, and Koki never at any point have an earnest conversation about whether it really is Asumi talking to them, or someone pretending to be her. Especially given the crazy happenings that led to the events in episode one’s climax, one would reasonably expect that there would be some kind of brainstorming session to determine what precisely happened. Even if no conclusion had been reached, even if tempers get particularly flared, or even absent any agreement, this is a conversation that needed to happen. Months in-universe transpire without that dialogue.  The reason for this is because, without Asumi’s insistence that when the three are working together that anything is possible, the narrative doesn’t really have a friendship to cultivate for them. The show plays up the chasm between the three in light of Asumi’s death, which makes sense. But whether through flashback or present-time events, we see little evidence of an earnestness between the mains that existed beforehand. Hence, a dialogue taking place evaluating the truth of whether Asumi called them after the first episode cannot happen because the connection via friendship is, more or less, nonexistent.   Instead, the second episode follows the Ward putting on a cooking festival for the residents, resulting in a controversy over someone buying up all the cabbage.

This is the story of Tokyo 24-ku a.k.a Tokyo 24th Ward, brought to you by CloverWorks, the studio now infamous for the ""3 shows per season lineup"" moniker that the Black Sheep of the season has to suffer inherent problems, and this show is that Black Sheep of blame.  Let's start by laying the groundwork for this show: directed by Jojo director Naokatsu Tsuda, with scriptwriter and series composer Vio Shimokura from Nitroplus (the company responsible for churning out visual novel games, created from writers like the acclaimed Gen Urobuchi), Tokyo 24-ku can be summed with these words alone: groupism, artificial intelligence, altruism, utilitarianism, individualism, consequentialism, principle of double effect. But the most important aspect of how Tokyo 24-ku works is by this barreling issue called the ""trolley problem"", first invented and accounted in a 1967 philosophy paper by English philosopher Philippa Ruth Foot, one of the founders of contemporary virtue ethics that are inspired by Aristotle, along with fellow philosophist Judith Jarvis Thomson.  To understand Tokyo 24-ku, you need to understand what is this ""trolley problem"" all about. This thought experiment is described as such: a series of thought experiments in ethics and psychology, involving stylized ethical dilemmas of whether to sacrifice one person to save a larger number, that usually begins with a scenario in which a runaway tram or trolley is on course to collide with and kill a number of people (traditionally five) down the track, but a driver or bystander can intervene and divert the vehicle to kill just one person on a different track. Then other variations of the runaway vehicle, and analogous life-and-death dilemmas (medical, judicial etc.) are posed, each containing the option to either do nothing, in which case several people will be killed, or intervene and sacrifice one initially ""safe"" person to save the others.  And this trolley problem is placed on the 3 central characters: Shuta ""Shu"" Aoi, Ran Akagi and Koki ""Ko"" Suido, or as nicknamed as such: RGB, because of their hair colours. How all these events conspired to turn on their heads, falls on their history growing up in the 24th Ward a.k.a Shantytown as childhood friends with their own typical ambitions in life, being raised in different family backgrounds, hobbies and personalities, with friends being close and typical as family-like. But one event changes everything, and that's when their historic elementary school suffered an arson attack that at first, was thought to be a rando terrorist attack, but it was insignificant things like rats nibbling on old wiring that caused the school to catch fire, and that someone was Koki's younger sister Asumi whom was caught in the flames, the causal effect to lose her life. Asumi is close to the RGB boys, in fact, she'd call them as such to signify their closeness, but with her death, she is seemingly not done yet as her tentative soul lives through phone calls to the RGB guys to present to them the trolley problems known as ""Visions"", though for what purpose remains to be seen in the beginning, that slowly begins to unravel the ugliness that's harnessing those ""Visions"" and the very things that make up the special district of the 24th Ward.  So first off, I mentioned that you do not need to have a big brain to understand this show, because at hindsight, these trolley problems or ""Visions"" start out as being 2-way choices of limiting innocent deaths by the count. But as time progresses, the Visions get progressively more nuanced, taking into accounts of the nihilistic nature of human radical behaviours from the likes of utilitarianism, altruism and consequentialism, that despite the descriptions of the trolley problem at hand, raises the stakes that would always result in a win-lose situation. And this is where the mysterious Carneades comes in to thwart the RGB guys, thereby raising the stakes higher that death is imminent for at least an innocent being despite the choices that they make. This is pretty significant because Carneades (in history) is known as an academic skeptic, whom holds the belief that all knowledge is impossible a.k.a acatalepsy (meaning ""inability to comprehend"", incomprehensibleness, or the impossibility of comprehending or conceiving a thing), except for the knowledge that all other knowledge is impossible, that human knowledge never amounts to certainty, but only to plausibility. On the basis of truth, Carneades argues that if there were a criterion, it must exist either in reason (logos), sensation (aisthêsis), or conception (phantasia). But then reason itself depends on conception, and this again on sensation; have no means of judging whether humans' sensations are true or false, whether they correspond to the objects that produce them, or carry wrong impressions to the mind, producing false conceptions and ideas, and leading reason also into error. Therefore, sensation, conception, and reason, are alike disqualified for being the criterion of truth.  Alas, the happenings within Shantytown have a butt-ton of problems to deal with. Starting with the RGB guys, or as I would like to call them, Shuta ""Mr. 24 hero"" Aoi, Ran ""DoRed"" Akagi and Koki ""SARG"" Suido, each of their ambitions are very different, and yet thus serve a different aspect that shows the faction divisions within the ward. The red-haired Ran Akagi is the leader of his graffiti group called DoRed, whom exhibits a strong personality and is able to convey his emotions and feelings through the art of graffiti, which has progressed in the series to be more like a cult following for people opposing the government's radical changes against their will. Together with friends like Kinako, technological hacker Kudo ""Kunai"" Naito, and influencers like Kuchikiri  (better known as 0th) Ran is a force to be reckoned with. The green-haired Koki Suido comes from his familial line of intelligents, with his father Gori being the mayor of the 24th Ward, save for the deceased sister Asumi. Together, they run the 24th Ward with the usual bigotry treatments of fabrications and lies (as you would expect of any governmental system) heralding from the system utilized to keep the ward in their grasp, funded with the help from fellow chief researcher Sakiko ""Satchan"" Tsuzuragawa. And this is so because Koki works in SARG, Shantytown's police faction equivalent to keep harmony within the midst from the likes of Hazard Cast (their version of police surveillance control) and the KANAE System, named after the Suido family's deceased mother (which is an upgraded feature that severely limits privacy in exchange for security) through phones specially supplied to and heavily controlled in the ward, known as cPhones. The blue-haired Shuta Aoi, he's your typical neighbourhood boy with a childish ambition to match, and is the one that always knocks time off around with the people of Shantytown, doing the regular work that's just like the normal average layman. Together with Mari Sakuragi whom manages the 24th Ward's popular okonomiyaki restaurant ""Itadaki"", Shuta is the most average person alive whom has a good side to him being of childlike wonder, yet scramble to action when the Visions occur because he finds it to be a recurring dilemma of choice, because he is known as Mr. 24 the hero of Shantytown, and he wouldn't want anyone dying right in front of his eyes to befall emotional curses upon himself.  The other characters ploughing through this wonky series, it's sad but obvious to say that they're nothing more than plot movers, because where else would you concoct characters that only have ulterior motives, only to scrap them when their duties are done. Guess this shows that character dynamics are essential, yet when executed wrongly, can become the most glaring of issues to question why does ""this and that"" characters need to be around to begin with. A very hard pass on having too many characters to reflect the adage of ""too many cooks spoil the broth"".  By now, you should've known the terror that is the behind-the-scenes production woes at CloverWorks, and probably already guessed it by now: the Wonder Egg Priority curse has struck again. In case you didn't know, in Japan, it's prohibited for staff to share what's going on with the production of shows, think of it as like NDAs. But yet above all, one person did: chief animation director Kiminori Itou, whose pessimistic troubles were so rampant enough that he literally documented, chronicled and shared the events leading up to release on his Twitter account. Starting way back last year on October 24th when the anime was officially announced (and mind you, that was after announcements for both Sono Bisque Doll and Akebi's Sailor Uniform), the staff only literally had 2 months (give and take) to create, make and finish the entire production, even if it meant that they had to outsource animators to finish up the job. To put things into perspective, Episode 1 (the double-length premiere) was only completed in the nick of time before the TV broadcast. What resulted in all of that was inconsistent animation, visuals that look nice but was hampered to the point of overlays (the RGB guys displayed many instances of overlay visuals), and though the CloverWorks name is attached to it, the perception that the Wonder Egg Priority curse had already taken over the entire anime in general was already realized even before we the audience actually got to see Episode 1 in the flesh. Yikes, what a mess.  Of all the bad occurences in this show, there is some sliver of hope, and although the musical function is decent, I just can't feel it with so much dialogue and information being pushed down to our throats. All I can say that the OP is great, and come on, it's the same J-Pop band that brought you Vinland Saga's 1st OP. Survive Said The Prophet never misses, and shows their pedigree here. The ED's title references the RGB colour codes in unison to the RGB MCs, though the song is a bit on the meh side.  When all is said and done, even after taking everything into consideration, music alone can't really save the entire hectic production that leaves people to having tireless crunch and overwork, it's just so inhumane to see this, but this is the life of the anime industry in Japan, and there's no way to salvage this practice for years to come (that's why we advocate KyoAni in a different light, geddit?). Whatever the reason here, if Wonder Egg Priority was a showcase that if not taken severely enough, then Tokyo 24-ku is the next work to point a finger at both CloverWorks and Aniplex on a practice so deadly that it could cost people their lives and precious time wasted. And this is a protest that the anime industry will not listen to, because it's quantity over quality, and money is the root of all evil.  So there you have it: the classic case of greedy corporations at the oversight of quality, that rather of Tokyo 24-ku as a standalone show telling its own internal side of the story, there's an external side waiting to be scrutinized and criticized just as hard. What a shame, really.              Helpful       report                          ",positive,en,{}

This is the story of Tokyo 24-ku a.k.a Tokyo 24th Ward, brought to you by CloverWorks, the studio now infamous for the ""3 shows per season lineup"" moniker that the Black Sheep of the season has to suffer inherent problems, and this show is that Black Sheep of blame.  Let's start by laying the groundwork for this show: directed by Jojo director Naokatsu Tsuda, with scriptwriter and series composer Vio Shimokura from Nitroplus (the company responsible for churning out visual novel games, created from writers like the acclaimed Gen Urobuchi), Tokyo 24-ku can be summed with these words alone: groupism, artificial intelligence, altruism, utilitarianism, individualism, consequentialism, principle of double effect. But the most important aspect of how Tokyo 24-ku works is by this barreling issue called the ""trolley problem"", first invented and accounted in a 1967 philosophy paper by English philosopher Philippa Ruth Foot, one of the founders of contemporary virtue ethics that are inspired by Aristotle, along with fellow philosophist Judith Jarvis Thomson.  To understand Tokyo 24-ku, you need to understand what is this ""trolley problem"" all about. This thought experiment is described as such: a series of thought experiments in ethics and psychology, involving stylized ethical dilemmas of whether to sacrifice one person to save a larger number, that usually begins with a scenario in which a runaway tram or trolley is on course to collide with and kill a number of people (traditionally five) down the track, but a driver or bystander can intervene and divert the vehicle to kill just one person on a different track. Then other variations of the runaway vehicle, and analogous life-and-death dilemmas (medical, judicial etc.) are posed, each containing the option to either do nothing, in which case several people will be killed, or intervene and sacrifice one initially ""safe"" person to save the others.  And this trolley problem is placed on the 3 central characters: Shuta ""Shu"" Aoi, Ran Akagi and Koki ""Ko"" Suido, or as nicknamed as such: RGB, because of their hair colours. How all these events conspired to turn on their heads, falls on their history growing up in the 24th Ward a.k.a Shantytown as childhood friends with their own typical ambitions in life, being raised in different family backgrounds, hobbies and personalities, with friends being close and typical as family-like. But one event changes everything, and that's when their historic elementary school suffered an arson attack that at first, was thought to be a rando terrorist attack, but it was insignificant things like rats nibbling on old wiring that caused the school to catch fire, and that someone was Koki's younger sister Asumi whom was caught in the flames, the causal effect to lose her life. Asumi is close to the RGB boys, in fact, she'd call them as such to signify their closeness, but with her death, she is seemingly not done yet as her tentative soul lives through phone calls to the RGB guys to present to them the trolley problems known as ""Visions"", though for what purpose remains to be seen in the beginning, that slowly begins to unravel the ugliness that's harnessing those ""Visions"" and the very things that make up the special district of the 24th Ward.  So first off, I mentioned that you do not need to have a big brain to understand this show, because at hindsight, these trolley problems or ""Visions"" start out as being 2-way choices of limiting innocent deaths by the count.

This is the story of Tokyo 24-ku a.k.a Tokyo 24th Ward, brought to you by CloverWorks, the studio now infamous for the ""3 shows per season lineup"" moniker that the Black Sheep of the season has to suffer inherent problems, and this show is that Black Sheep of blame.  Let's start by laying the groundwork for this show: directed by Jojo director Naokatsu Tsuda, with scriptwriter and series composer Vio Shimokura from Nitroplus (the company responsible for churning out visual novel games, created from writers like the acclaimed Gen Urobuchi), Tokyo 24-ku can be summed with these words alone: groupism, artificial intelligence, altruism, utilitarianism, individualism, consequentialism, principle of double effect. But the most important aspect of how Tokyo 24-ku works is by this barreling issue called the ""trolley problem"", first invented and accounted in a 1967 philosophy paper by English philosopher Philippa Ruth Foot, one of the founders of contemporary virtue ethics that are inspired by Aristotle, along with fellow philosophist Judith Jarvis Thomson.  To understand Tokyo 24-ku, you need to understand what is this ""trolley problem"" all about. This thought experiment is described as such: a series of thought experiments in ethics and psychology, involving stylized ethical dilemmas of whether to sacrifice one person to save a larger number, that usually begins with a scenario in which a runaway tram or trolley is on course to collide with and kill a number of people (traditionally five) down the track, but a driver or bystander can intervene and divert the vehicle to kill just one person on a different track. Then other variations of the runaway vehicle, and analogous life-and-death dilemmas (medical, judicial etc.) are posed, each containing the option to either do nothing, in which case several people will be killed, or intervene and sacrifice one initially ""safe"" person to save the others.  And this trolley problem is placed on the 3 central characters: Shuta ""Shu"" Aoi, Ran Akagi and Koki ""Ko"" Suido, or as nicknamed as such: RGB, because of their hair colours. How all these events conspired to turn on their heads, falls on their history growing up in the 24th Ward a.k.a Shantytown as childhood friends with their own typical ambitions in life, being raised in different family backgrounds, hobbies and personalities, with friends being close and typical as family-like. But one event changes everything, and that's when their historic elementary school suffered an arson attack that at first, was thought to be a rando terrorist attack, but it was insignificant things like rats nibbling on old wiring that caused the school to catch fire, and that someone was Koki's younger sister Asumi whom was caught in the flames, the causal effect to lose her life. Asumi is close to the RGB boys, in fact, she'd call them as such to signify their closeness, but with her death, she is seemingly not done yet as her tentative soul lives through phone calls to the RGB guys to present to them the trolley problems known as ""Visions"", though for what purpose remains to be seen in the beginning, that slowly begins to unravel the ugliness that's harnessing those ""Visions"" and the very things that make up the special district of the 24th Ward.  So first off, I mentioned that you do not need to have a big brain to understand this show, because at hindsight, these trolley problems or ""Visions"" start out as being 2-way choices of limiting innocent deaths by the count. But as time progresses, the Visions get progressively more nuanced, taking into accounts of the nihilistic nature of human radical behaviours from the likes of utilitarianism, altruism and consequentialism, that despite the descriptions of the trolley problem at hand, raises the stakes that would always result in a win-lose situation. And this is where the mysterious Carneades comes in to thwart the RGB guys, thereby raising the stakes higher that death is imminent for at least an innocent being despite the choices that they make. This is pretty significant because Carneades (in history) is known as an academic skeptic, whom holds the belief that all knowledge is impossible a.k.a acatalepsy (meaning ""inability to comprehend"", incomprehensibleness, or the impossibility of comprehending or conceiving a thing), except for the knowledge that all other knowledge is impossible, that human knowledge never amounts to certainty, but only to plausibility. On the basis of truth, Carneades argues that if there were a criterion, it must exist either in reason (logos), sensation (aisthêsis), or conception (phantasia). But then reason itself depends on conception, and this again on sensation; have no means of judging whether humans' sensations are true or false, whether they correspond to the objects that produce them, or carry wrong impressions to the mind, producing false conceptions and ideas, and leading reason also into error. Therefore, sensation, conception, and reason, are alike disqualified for being the criterion of truth.  Alas, the happenings within Shantytown have a butt-ton of problems to deal with. Starting with the RGB guys, or as I would like to call them, Shuta ""Mr. 24 hero"" Aoi, Ran ""DoRed"" Akagi and Koki ""SARG"" Suido, each of their ambitions are very different, and yet thus serve a different aspect that shows the faction divisions within the ward. The red-haired Ran Akagi is the leader of his graffiti group called DoRed, whom exhibits a strong personality and is able to convey his emotions and feelings through the art of graffiti, which has progressed in the series to be more like a cult following for people opposing the government's radical changes against their will. Together with friends like Kinako, technological hacker Kudo ""Kunai"" Naito, and influencers like Kuchikiri  (better known as 0th) Ran is a force to be reckoned with. The green-haired Koki Suido comes from his familial line of intelligents, with his father Gori being the mayor of the 24th Ward, save for the deceased sister Asumi. Together, they run the 24th Ward with the usual bigotry treatments of fabrications and lies (as you would expect of any governmental system) heralding from the system utilized to keep the ward in their grasp, funded with the help from fellow chief researcher Sakiko ""Satchan"" Tsuzuragawa. And this is so because Koki works in SARG, Shantytown's police faction equivalent to keep harmony within the midst from the likes of Hazard Cast (their version of police surveillance control) and the KANAE System, named after the Suido family's deceased mother (which is an upgraded feature that severely limits privacy in exchange for security) through phones specially supplied to and heavily controlled in the ward, known as cPhones. The blue-haired Shuta Aoi, he's your typical neighbourhood boy with a childish ambition to match, and is the one that always knocks time off around with the people of Shantytown, doing the regular work that's just like the normal average layman. Together with Mari Sakuragi whom manages the 24th Ward's popular okonomiyaki restaurant ""Itadaki"", Shuta is the most average person alive whom has a good side to him being of childlike wonder, yet scramble to action when the Visions occur because he finds it to be a recurring dilemma of choice, because he is known as Mr. 24 the hero of Shantytown, and he wouldn't want anyone dying right in front of his eyes to befall emotional curses upon himself.  The other characters ploughing through this wonky series, it's sad but obvious to say that they're nothing more than plot movers, because where else would you concoct characters that only have ulterior motives, only to scrap them when their duties are done. Guess this shows that character dynamics are essential, yet when executed wrongly, can become the most glaring of issues to question why does ""this and that"" characters need to be around to begin with. A very hard pass on having too many characters to reflect the adage of ""too many cooks spoil the broth"".  By now, you should've known the terror that is the behind-the-scenes production woes at CloverWorks, and probably already guessed it by now: the Wonder Egg Priority curse has struck again. In case you didn't know, in Japan, it's prohibited for staff to share what's going on with the production of shows, think of it as like NDAs. But yet above all, one person did: chief animation director Kiminori Itou, whose pessimistic troubles were so rampant enough that he literally documented, chronicled and shared the events leading up to release on his Twitter account. Starting way back last year on October 24th when the anime was officially announced (and mind you, that was after announcements for both Sono Bisque Doll and Akebi's Sailor Uniform), the staff only literally had 2 months (give and take) to create, make and finish the entire production, even if it meant that they had to outsource animators to finish up the job. To put things into perspective, Episode 1 (the double-length premiere) was only completed in the nick of time before the TV broadcast. What resulted in all of that was inconsistent animation, visuals that look nice but was hampered to the point of overlays (the RGB guys displayed many instances of overlay visuals), and though the CloverWorks name is attached to it, the perception that the Wonder Egg Priority curse had already taken over the entire anime in general was already realized even before we the audience actually got to see Episode 1 in the flesh. Yikes, what a mess.  Of all the bad occurences in this show, there is some sliver of hope, and although the musical function is decent, I just can't feel it with so much dialogue and information being pushed down to our throats.

The green-haired Koki Suido comes from his familial line of intelligents, with his father Gori being the mayor of the 24th Ward, save for the deceased sister Asumi. Together, they run the 24th Ward with the usual bigotry treatments of fabrications and lies (as you would expect of any governmental system) heralding from the system utilized to keep the ward in their grasp, funded with the help from fellow chief researcher Sakiko ""Satchan"" Tsuzuragawa. And this is so because Koki works in SARG, Shantytown's police faction equivalent to keep harmony within the midst from the likes of Hazard Cast (their version of police surveillance control) and the KANAE System, named after the Suido family's deceased mother (which is an upgraded feature that severely limits privacy in exchange for security) through phones specially supplied to and heavily controlled in the ward, known as cPhones. The blue-haired Shuta Aoi, he's your typical neighbourhood boy with a childish ambition to match, and is the one that always knocks time off around with the people of Shantytown, doing the regular work that's just like the normal average layman. Together with Mari Sakuragi whom manages the 24th Ward's popular okonomiyaki restaurant ""Itadaki"", Shuta is the most average person alive whom has a good side to him being of childlike wonder, yet scramble to action when the Visions occur because he finds it to be a recurring dilemma of choice, because he is known as Mr. 24 the hero of Shantytown, and he wouldn't want anyone dying right in front of his eyes to befall emotional curses upon himself.  The other characters ploughing through this wonky series, it's sad but obvious to say that they're nothing more than plot movers, because where else would you concoct characters that only have ulterior motives, only to scrap them when their duties are done. Guess this shows that character dynamics are essential, yet when executed wrongly, can become the most glaring of issues to question why does ""this and that"" characters need to be around to begin with. A very hard pass on having too many characters to reflect the adage of ""too many cooks spoil the broth"".  By now, you should've known the terror that is the behind-the-scenes production woes at CloverWorks, and probably already guessed it by now: the Wonder Egg Priority curse has struck again. In case you didn't know, in Japan, it's prohibited for staff to share what's going on with the production of shows, think of it as like NDAs. But yet above all, one person did: chief animation director Kiminori Itou, whose pessimistic troubles were so rampant enough that he literally documented, chronicled and shared the events leading up to release on his Twitter account. Starting way back last year on October 24th when the anime was officially announced (and mind you, that was after announcements for both Sono Bisque Doll and Akebi's Sailor Uniform), the staff only literally had 2 months (give and take) to create, make and finish the entire production, even if it meant that they had to outsource animators to finish up the job. To put things into perspective, Episode 1 (the double-length premiere) was only completed in the nick of time before the TV broadcast. What resulted in all of that was inconsistent animation, visuals that look nice but was hampered to the point of overlays (the RGB guys displayed many instances of overlay visuals), and though the CloverWorks name is attached to it, the perception that the Wonder Egg Priority curse had already taken over the entire anime in general was already realized even before we the audience actually got to see Episode 1 in the flesh. Yikes, what a mess.  Of all the bad occurences in this show, there is some sliver of hope, and although the musical function is decent, I just can't feel it with so much dialogue and information being pushed down to our throats. All I can say that the OP is great, and come on, it's the same J-Pop band that brought you Vinland Saga's 1st OP. Survive Said The Prophet never misses, and shows their pedigree here. The ED's title references the RGB colour codes in unison to the RGB MCs, though the song is a bit on the meh side.  When all is said and done, even after taking everything into consideration, music alone can't really save the entire hectic production that leaves people to having tireless crunch and overwork, it's just so inhumane to see this, but this is the life of the anime industry in Japan, and there's no way to salvage this practice for years to come (that's why we advocate KyoAni in a different light, geddit?). Whatever the reason here, if Wonder Egg Priority was a showcase that if not taken severely enough, then Tokyo 24-ku is the next work to point a finger at both CloverWorks and Aniplex on a practice so deadly that it could cost people their lives and precious time wasted. And this is a protest that the anime industry will not listen to, because it's quantity over quality, and money is the root of all evil.  So there you have it: the classic case of greedy corporations at the oversight of quality, that rather of Tokyo 24-ku as a standalone show telling its own internal side of the story, there's an external side waiting to be scrutinized and criticized just as hard. What a shame, really.              Helpful  ",positive,en,{}

Its design captures all of the main details with a crescent moon on the upper lid and stones based on the five main Pretty Guardians (Sailor Moon, Sailor Mercury, Sailor Mars, Sailor Jupiter, and Sailor Venus).There are four eyeshadow colors carefully chosen in combinations that are great for both everyday use and special occasions. The red pearl color can even be used as blush, giving this single compact a wide variety of uses.The eyeshadows use synthetic mica, allowing it to cover dullness caused by sweat or sebum while adding beautiful color. The powder was made using a wet manufacturing process, so it’s possible to mix it with semi-solid oils, and it will stay firmly on your skin. Fruit extract, apricot seed extract, peach leaf extract, and okra extract were also used as moisturizing ingredients.The Miracle Romance Make-Up Flat-Style Eyeshadow is both cute and thoughtfully developed, and in the name of the moon, it’ll let you perform your very own powerful “Make Up!” transformation! ■ Product Details・Name: Miracle Romance Make-Up Flat-Style Eyeshadow・Price: ¥4,212 (tax included, shipping and handling separate)・Target Age: 15 and older・Set Contents: Eyeshadow (4 colors), applicator, loose powder tray・Dimensions (approx.): 70 x 25 mm・Materials:　- Container: ABS, AS, PMMA　- Mirror: Glass　- Applicator: AS, PUR　- Box: Paper　- Loose Powder Tray: PET・Manufacturing Countries:　- Container/Loose Powder Tray/Applicator: China　- Eyeshadow: Japan・Available Through: Premium Bandai, Otona Joshi Biyori shops, and more・Pre-Order Period: Jan. 20 (Fri.) at 1:00 pm while supplies last・Estimated Release: March 2017©Naoko Takeuchi, PNP, Toei Animation©Naoko TakeuchiSource: @PressAnimeBandaiMangaProductSailor MoonJoin the TOM Fan Club to learn TOM Senpai's secrets.

A warning will be displayed before any spoilers are mentioned, so rest assured that you can read this article even if you haven’t watched it yet!Fantasy anime  Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba has taken not only Japan, but the entire world by storm. On October 16, 2020, a sequel,  Demon Slayer -Kimetsu no Yaiba- The Movie: Mugen Train, was released in Japan. In just 10 days, it earned over 100 billion yen in box office revenues, the fastest movie to have ever done so in Japan, and the two month mark saw it go past a whopping 300 million yen. If that wasn't enough, it even overtook  Studio Ghibli's  Spirited Away, previously the highest-grossing film in Japanese history - yet another record set at blazing speeds!Along with this wave of popularity, manga volumes and general  KnY merchandise has been selling out everywhere. Regardless of age and gender, the franchise has truly attracted passionate fans far and wide.Penned by a TOM Staff member and true  KnY fan who’s gone to see  Demon Slayer -Kimetsu no Yaiba- The Movie: Mugen Train an unbelievable 16 times, this article will introduce nine of its highlights - in other words, nine reasons to go and watch it when it's available where you are. Get ready to engage in some Total Concentration Reading!First, let’s talk about the background behind  Demon Slayer -Kimetsu no Yaiba- The Movie: Mugen Train. The original manga,  Demon Slayer: Kimetsu No Yaiba, tells the story of Tanjiro Kamado, a boy who embarks on a quest to heal his sister Nezuko, who has been transformed into a demon. During this journey, he and his companions must face intense battles against evil demons.  Mugen Train covers the 7th and 8th volumes of the manga. In terms of the TV anime series, the movie follows on from the story of the 26th and last episode, “New Mission.” If you haven’t seen the TV anime yet, I recommend watching it first. For some quick information on the plot, setting, and key vocab, check out our guide to Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba!Now, watch closely… and pay attention to these highlights! 1. Unbelievably Beautiful VisualsWhen it first came out, the TV anime's stunning animation and breathtaking battle scenes went viral. Of course, these high standards were maintained in the movie as well. Seeing those amazing battle scenes on the big screen was particularly overwhelming! The sheer speed made me feel like I was running through the screen with Tanjiro and the others, while the ominous figures of their enemies, the demons, had me shivering… From the first scene of the advancing Mugen Train to the credits, you can dive right into the world of  KnY through the spectacular animation. And it’s not just the battle scenes – charming country landscapes, the train’s striking interior, snowy mountains, the Rengoku family’s traditional Japanese house… There’s just so much to enjoy in this amazing movie, produced by ufotable, a studio whose animation of katana and Japanese architechture has been well received in anime like  Touken Ranbu and much more. Be sure to look out for the backgrounds, too! Here’s a tip: each of the fusuma, or sliding doors, have especially elaborate designs.  2. The Flame Hashira: The One and Only Kyojuro RengokuOne thing I want – or actually, need you to pay attention to is the second protagonist of Mugen Train: Kyojuro Rengoku, the Demon Slayer Corps’ Flame Hashira. Many people may have been surprised at Kyojuro’s first appearance in the anime series – the moment he lays eyes upon Nezuko, already a demon, and Tanjiro, who brought her, he orders that she be decapitated. This paints him as quite an unreasonable person who won’t even stop for an explanation first, but we go on to learn so much more about him. A son of the Rengoku family and its historic Fire Hashira lineage, we see his gentle soul, strength, and unwavering heart and convictions, as well as the loneliness that follows a man of his nature. All of this is sure to draw you to him as a character. At the beginning of Episode 24 of the anime series, Kyojuro is seen talking with Shinobu Kocho (the Insect Hashira) about his upcoming mission on the Mugen Train. He didn’t receive any battle scenes during the series, so the movie is the first time we actually get to see him and his Flame Breathing techniques in action. The flames that roar through the train, his unbelievably swift reactions, the movement of his cape, his intense red eyes that seem to see through all…Everything. Is. Way. Too. Cool.Seriously, everything about him is just so cool… How am I meant to deal with this… (I mean, I don’t have to.) The moment he began his Flame Breathing First Form: Shiranui, I realized, “Oh, I’ve pretty much spent nothing on this movie… This is already worth the ticket…”From his sword techniques to his mere presence and words, every part of Rengoku Kyojuro is priceless. Honestly, this movie leaves you no time to even blink. Everything is something to look out for. I don’t want you to let even a tenth of a second escape your attention, so be sure to use plenty of eye drops before it starts 3. The Mugen Train and its Real-Life OriginsLet’s take a look at a certain train otaku favorite in Japan, SL Hitoyoshi, which features an 8620 Class steam locomotive. Commonly known as “hachiroku"" (meaning ""86”), it’s none other than the locomotive that inspired the appearance of the Mugen Train! From the beginning of the movie, we get plenty of glimpses at Japan in the Taisho Era (1912-1926), from the design of the station and passenger cars to the fashion of the passengers themselves. Through the animation, we also experience its sheer speed, as well as the actual sensation of being swayed as we ride in the heavy carriages. It’s downright awesome!Here in Japan, we actually got to see a collaboration between SL Hitoyoshi and  KnY, where the locomotive was transformed into a real-life Mugen Train for a limited run. Naturally, it was so popular that it was practically impossible to get your hands on tickets. (Yup, I didn’t manage to snag any either…) It quickly became a viral topic on social media, with people excited to see a “real-life Mugen Train” even in photos and videos.  4. Tanjiro’s Feelings For His FamilyKnY’s story begins with a powerful theme: family. We also see its importance in the movie, which beautifully illustrates Tanjiro’s feelings for his family. He’s already lost so many people important to him, but no matter how much he wants to return to those happy days, there’s no going back – he'll never be able to see his loved ones again. This movie’s depiction of Tanjiro’s family, entangled in memories both happy and sad, but never to be restored, will have your eyes streaming with tears. 5. And Of Course, the Funny Scenes!Another great element that we get to see again are the hilarious moments between Inosuke and Zenitsu! You’ll also find yourself chuckling at Rengoku as he scarfs down his ekiben (bento lunches bought at train stations). Another heads up – at first Zenitsu’s dream sequence will probably just seem funny, but if you pay attention to where it’s set, that smile might turn into tears… (This is especially aimed at anyone who’s already read the manga up to the Mugen Train arc – I want you to think long and hard about where he is in that dream!) Spoiler Alert!From here, I’ll be introducing specific details about the movie, so please stop reading if you want to avoid spoilers.↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓Alright! Let’s keep going with more highlights, including actual scenes from the movie! 6. An Unprecedented Battle of IntellectTanjiro’s new foe, and the demon controlling the Mugen Train is Enmu, Lower Rank One in the Twelve Kizuki. Before the events of the movie, Muzan himself took a liking to Enmu and gifted him with Muzan’s blood. Having gained power with this infusion, Enmu decides to enlist the help of humans – or rather, use them as a means for his plan. Thus, the lives of Tanjiro, Zenitsu, Inosuke, Nezuko, and their mission companion, Rengoku, as well as the train’s many regular passengers, are Enmu’s next targets. His gentle and calm manner of speaking and friendly smile prove to make him an even more sinister character. Carrying out his plan with meticulous care, Enmu attempts to put Tanjiro and the other humans to sleep forever through his Blood Demon Art, a style of attack that they’ve never faced before. How will Tanjiro and his fellow Demon Slayers wake themselves up from Enmu’s eternal dreams? 7. The Sudden Appearance of Upper Rank Three, AkazaThe last part of the movie takes a huge turn with the sudden appearance of Akaza (Upper Rank Three) and his fierce battle against Rengoku. Just before dawn, Tanjiro and the others finally get the chance to breathe a sigh of relief, having defeated Enmu and checked that the passengers are safe. But this only lasts for a moment, with the Demon Slayers gathered facing the dreaded Upper Rank Three for the first time. The sudden roaring sound signals the appearance of something... but then dies down, leaving an eerie silence. Then, a pair of eyes glisten in the darkness. This frightening sense of anticipation crosses the screen to weigh down on you, causing you to instinctively clench your fists in suspense…Despite Akaza being a favorite among  KnY’s many demons, we didn’t get any information on his voice actor, or even still images until the movie’s official release. As a result, fans speculated that the movie might only cover Enmu’s arc and stop before showing Akaza, or that the anime series would continue with his story. However, the movie’s premiere date came and the cat was finally let out of the bag. We now know that Akaza’s voice actor is Akira Ishida, famous for roles like Kaworu Nagisa in  Neon Genesis Evangelion! This casting was a huge yet welcome surprise for fans. If you’re watching the movie with Japanese audio, be sure to soak up every moment of Akaza’s malevolence, madness and despair through Ishida’s formidable voice acting!One more highlight is the overwhelming energy of Rengoku and Akaza in their battle scenes, yet another part where you can’t afford to blink. If IMAX screenings are available near you, take advantage of them and experience the fight’s sheer power at full volume. It goes without saying that you can still experience plenty at normal theaters, but I urge you to go and feel the huge impact behind each and every hit at IMAX volume levels! The depiction of the snowflake patterns in Akaza’s Technique Deployment ability is also a highlight. In the original manga’s 18th volume, we learn about Akaza’s past. Despite being a ruthless demon with numerous victims, the sorrows of his life as a human capture the pity of readers. Personally, he’s one of my favorite characters. After watching the movie, I also recommend going right to the rest of the manga to continue the story! 8. Tears of FrustrationAt the end of the battle, Tanjiro and his companions are overwhelmed by the realization that they are still too weak, no matter how much work they put in or how hard they train. Sneering down with their seemingly infinite power are the demons. Haunted by the thought that they couldn’t do anything, that they had to be protected by others, the young humans have faced frustration, sadness, and uncontrollable tears. For the sake of their slain family members and beloved people they still had to protect, they’ve trained over and over, fought to survive the Final Selection, narrowly escaped death every night, and made huge progress. Yet their power was still nowhere near enough. And now, the man they had followed has fallen victim to their enemies. No matter how many times you watch the movie, this realization will tear your heart to shreds. In the face of such a tragedy, Inosuke offers some words that are deeply touching. His upbringing among wild boars may have given him less experience with other people, but we can see that he’s grown yet again as a human.  9. Rengoku’s Explosive Battle Through LifeFans who have already read the manga will know what I’m talking about. In any case, I won’t elaborate too much, but I urge you to burn his battles and his way of life into your mind – why he risks his life in battle, why he tries to protect humans. His crystal-clear beliefs and promises will also give you an insight into the loneliness he must bear. Protect the weak. Respect one’s duty and values. In what light will you see these warriors and hear their words as they fight to protect others? If you have the chance, please find out on the big screen.

A warning will be displayed before any spoilers are mentioned, so rest assured that you can read this article even if you haven’t watched it yet!Fantasy anime  Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba has taken not only Japan, but the entire world by storm. On October 16, 2020, a sequel,  Demon Slayer -Kimetsu no Yaiba- The Movie: Mugen Train, was released in Japan. In just 10 days, it earned over 100 billion yen in box office revenues, the fastest movie to have ever done so in Japan, and the two month mark saw it go past a whopping 300 million yen. If that wasn't enough, it even overtook  Studio Ghibli's  Spirited Away, previously the highest-grossing film in Japanese history - yet another record set at blazing speeds!Along with this wave of popularity, manga volumes and general  KnY merchandise has been selling out everywhere. Regardless of age and gender, the franchise has truly attracted passionate fans far and wide.Penned by a TOM Staff member and true  KnY fan who’s gone to see  Demon Slayer -Kimetsu no Yaiba- The Movie: Mugen Train an unbelievable 16 times, this article will introduce nine of its highlights - in other words, nine reasons to go and watch it when it's available where you are. Get ready to engage in some Total Concentration Reading!First, let’s talk about the background behind  Demon Slayer -Kimetsu no Yaiba- The Movie: Mugen Train. The original manga,  Demon Slayer: Kimetsu No Yaiba, tells the story of Tanjiro Kamado, a boy who embarks on a quest to heal his sister Nezuko, who has been transformed into a demon. During this journey, he and his companions must face intense battles against evil demons.  Mugen Train covers the 7th and 8th volumes of the manga. In terms of the TV anime series, the movie follows on from the story of the 26th and last episode, “New Mission.” If you haven’t seen the TV anime yet, I recommend watching it first. For some quick information on the plot, setting, and key vocab, check out our guide to Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba!Now, watch closely… and pay attention to these highlights! 1. Unbelievably Beautiful VisualsWhen it first came out, the TV anime's stunning animation and breathtaking battle scenes went viral. Of course, these high standards were maintained in the movie as well. Seeing those amazing battle scenes on the big screen was particularly overwhelming! The sheer speed made me feel like I was running through the screen with Tanjiro and the others, while the ominous figures of their enemies, the demons, had me shivering… From the first scene of the advancing Mugen Train to the credits, you can dive right into the world of  KnY through the spectacular animation. And it’s not just the battle scenes – charming country landscapes, the train’s striking interior, snowy mountains, the Rengoku family’s traditional Japanese house… There’s just so much to enjoy in this amazing movie, produced by ufotable, a studio whose animation of katana and Japanese architechture has been well received in anime like  Touken Ranbu and much more. Be sure to look out for the backgrounds, too! Here’s a tip: each of the fusuma, or sliding doors, have especially elaborate designs.  2. The Flame Hashira: The One and Only Kyojuro RengokuOne thing I want – or actually, need you to pay attention to is the second protagonist of Mugen Train: Kyojuro Rengoku, the Demon Slayer Corps’ Flame Hashira. Many people may have been surprised at Kyojuro’s first appearance in the anime series – the moment he lays eyes upon Nezuko, already a demon, and Tanjiro, who brought her, he orders that she be decapitated. This paints him as quite an unreasonable person who won’t even stop for an explanation first, but we go on to learn so much more about him. A son of the Rengoku family and its historic Fire Hashira lineage, we see his gentle soul, strength, and unwavering heart and convictions, as well as the loneliness that follows a man of his nature. All of this is sure to draw you to him as a character. At the beginning of Episode 24 of the anime series, Kyojuro is seen talking with Shinobu Kocho (the Insect Hashira) about his upcoming mission on the Mugen Train. He didn’t receive any battle scenes during the series, so the movie is the first time we actually get to see him and his Flame Breathing techniques in action. The flames that roar through the train, his unbelievably swift reactions, the movement of his cape, his intense red eyes that seem to see through all…Everything. Is. Way. Too. Cool.Seriously, everything about him is just so cool… How am I meant to deal with this… (I mean, I don’t have to.) The moment he began his Flame Breathing First Form: Shiranui, I realized, “Oh, I’ve pretty much spent nothing on this movie… This is already worth the ticket…”From his sword techniques to his mere presence and words, every part of Rengoku Kyojuro is priceless. Honestly, this movie leaves you no time to even blink. Everything is something to look out for. I don’t want you to let even a tenth of a second escape your attention, so be sure to use plenty of eye drops before it starts 3. The Mugen Train and its Real-Life OriginsLet’s take a look at a certain train otaku favorite in Japan, SL Hitoyoshi, which features an 8620 Class steam locomotive. Commonly known as “hachiroku"" (meaning ""86”), it’s none other than the locomotive that inspired the appearance of the Mugen Train! From the beginning of the movie, we get plenty of glimpses at Japan in the Taisho Era (1912-1926), from the design of the station and passenger cars to the fashion of the passengers themselves. Through the animation, we also experience its sheer speed, as well as the actual sensation of being swayed as we ride in the heavy carriages. It’s downright awesome!Here in Japan, we actually got to see a collaboration between SL Hitoyoshi and  KnY, where the locomotive was transformed into a real-life Mugen Train for a limited run. Naturally, it was so popular that it was practically impossible to get your hands on tickets. (Yup, I didn’t manage to snag any either…) It quickly became a viral topic on social media, with people excited to see a “real-life Mugen Train” even in photos and videos.  4. Tanjiro’s Feelings For His FamilyKnY’s story begins with a powerful theme: family. We also see its importance in the movie, which beautifully illustrates Tanjiro’s feelings for his family. He’s already lost so many people important to him, but no matter how much he wants to return to those happy days, there’s no going back – he'll never be able to see his loved ones again. This movie’s depiction of Tanjiro’s family, entangled in memories both happy and sad, but never to be restored, will have your eyes streaming with tears. 5. And Of Course, the Funny Scenes!Another great element that we get to see again are the hilarious moments between Inosuke and Zenitsu! You’ll also find yourself chuckling at Rengoku as he scarfs down his ekiben (bento lunches bought at train stations). Another heads up – at first Zenitsu’s dream sequence will probably just seem funny, but if you pay attention to where it’s set, that smile might turn into tears… (This is especially aimed at anyone who’s already read the manga up to the Mugen Train arc – I want you to think long and hard about where he is in that dream!) Spoiler Alert!From here, I’ll be introducing specific details about the movie, so please stop reading if you want to avoid spoilers.↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓Alright! Let’s keep going with more highlights, including actual scenes from the movie! 6. An Unprecedented Battle of IntellectTanjiro’s new foe, and the demon controlling the Mugen Train is Enmu, Lower Rank One in the Twelve Kizuki. Before the events of the movie, Muzan himself took a liking to Enmu and gifted him with Muzan’s blood. Having gained power with this infusion, Enmu decides to enlist the help of humans – or rather, use them as a means for his plan. Thus, the lives of Tanjiro, Zenitsu, Inosuke, Nezuko, and their mission companion, Rengoku, as well as the train’s many regular passengers, are Enmu’s next targets. His gentle and calm manner of speaking and friendly smile prove to make him an even more sinister character. Carrying out his plan with meticulous care, Enmu attempts to put Tanjiro and the other humans to sleep forever through his Blood Demon Art, a style of attack that they’ve never faced before. How will Tanjiro and his fellow Demon Slayers wake themselves up from Enmu’s eternal dreams? 7. The Sudden Appearance of Upper Rank Three, AkazaThe last part of the movie takes a huge turn with the sudden appearance of Akaza (Upper Rank Three) and his fierce battle against Rengoku. Just before dawn, Tanjiro and the others finally get the chance to breathe a sigh of relief, having defeated Enmu and checked that the passengers are safe. But this only lasts for a moment, with the Demon Slayers gathered facing the dreaded Upper Rank Three for the first time. The sudden roaring sound signals the appearance of something... but then dies down, leaving an eerie silence. Then, a pair of eyes glisten in the darkness. This frightening sense of anticipation crosses the screen to weigh down on you, causing you to instinctively clench your fists in suspense…Despite Akaza being a favorite among  KnY’s many demons, we didn’t get any information on his voice actor, or even still images until the movie’s official release. As a result, fans speculated that the movie might only cover Enmu’s arc and stop before showing Akaza, or that the anime series would continue with his story. However, the movie’s premiere date came and the cat was finally let out of the bag. We now know that Akaza’s voice actor is Akira Ishida, famous for roles like Kaworu Nagisa in  Neon Genesis Evangelion! This casting was a huge yet welcome surprise for fans. If you’re watching the movie with Japanese audio, be sure to soak up every moment of Akaza’s malevolence, madness and despair through Ishida’s formidable voice acting!One more highlight is the overwhelming energy of Rengoku and Akaza in their battle scenes, yet another part where you can’t afford to blink. If IMAX screenings are available near you, take advantage of them and experience the fight’s sheer power at full volume. It goes without saying that you can still experience plenty at normal theaters, but I urge you to go and feel the huge impact behind each and every hit at IMAX volume levels! The depiction of the snowflake patterns in Akaza’s Technique Deployment ability is also a highlight. In the original manga’s 18th volume, we learn about Akaza’s past. Despite being a ruthless demon with numerous victims, the sorrows of his life as a human capture the pity of readers. Personally, he’s one of my favorite characters. After watching the movie, I also recommend going right to the rest of the manga to continue the story! 8.

A warning will be displayed before any spoilers are mentioned, so rest assured that you can read this article even if you haven’t watched it yet!Fantasy anime  Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba has taken not only Japan, but the entire world by storm. On October 16, 2020, a sequel,  Demon Slayer -Kimetsu no Yaiba- The Movie: Mugen Train, was released in Japan. In just 10 days, it earned over 100 billion yen in box office revenues, the fastest movie to have ever done so in Japan, and the two month mark saw it go past a whopping 300 million yen. If that wasn't enough, it even overtook  Studio Ghibli's  Spirited Away, previously the highest-grossing film in Japanese history - yet another record set at blazing speeds!Along with this wave of popularity, manga volumes and general  KnY merchandise has been selling out everywhere. Regardless of age and gender, the franchise has truly attracted passionate fans far and wide.Penned by a TOM Staff member and true  KnY fan who’s gone to see  Demon Slayer -Kimetsu no Yaiba- The Movie: Mugen Train an unbelievable 16 times, this article will introduce nine of its highlights - in other words, nine reasons to go and watch it when it's available where you are. Get ready to engage in some Total Concentration Reading!First, let’s talk about the background behind  Demon Slayer -Kimetsu no Yaiba- The Movie: Mugen Train. The original manga,  Demon Slayer: Kimetsu No Yaiba, tells the story of Tanjiro Kamado, a boy who embarks on a quest to heal his sister Nezuko, who has been transformed into a demon. During this journey, he and his companions must face intense battles against evil demons.  Mugen Train covers the 7th and 8th volumes of the manga. In terms of the TV anime series, the movie follows on from the story of the 26th and last episode, “New Mission.” If you haven’t seen the TV anime yet, I recommend watching it first. For some quick information on the plot, setting, and key vocab, check out our guide to Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba!Now, watch closely… and pay attention to these highlights! 1. Unbelievably Beautiful VisualsWhen it first came out, the TV anime's stunning animation and breathtaking battle scenes went viral. Of course, these high standards were maintained in the movie as well. Seeing those amazing battle scenes on the big screen was particularly overwhelming! The sheer speed made me feel like I was running through the screen with Tanjiro and the others, while the ominous figures of their enemies, the demons, had me shivering… From the first scene of the advancing Mugen Train to the credits, you can dive right into the world of  KnY through the spectacular animation. And it’s not just the battle scenes – charming country landscapes, the train’s striking interior, snowy mountains, the Rengoku family’s traditional Japanese house… There’s just so much to enjoy in this amazing movie, produced by ufotable, a studio whose animation of katana and Japanese architechture has been well received in anime like  Touken Ranbu and much more. Be sure to look out for the backgrounds, too! Here’s a tip: each of the fusuma, or sliding doors, have especially elaborate designs.  2. The Flame Hashira: The One and Only Kyojuro RengokuOne thing I want – or actually, need you to pay attention to is the second protagonist of Mugen Train: Kyojuro Rengoku, the Demon Slayer Corps’ Flame Hashira. Many people may have been surprised at Kyojuro’s first appearance in the anime series – the moment he lays eyes upon Nezuko, already a demon, and Tanjiro, who brought her, he orders that she be decapitated. This paints him as quite an unreasonable person who won’t even stop for an explanation first, but we go on to learn so much more about him. A son of the Rengoku family and its historic Fire Hashira lineage, we see his gentle soul, strength, and unwavering heart and convictions, as well as the loneliness that follows a man of his nature. All of this is sure to draw you to him as a character. At the beginning of Episode 24 of the anime series, Kyojuro is seen talking with Shinobu Kocho (the Insect Hashira) about his upcoming mission on the Mugen Train. He didn’t receive any battle scenes during the series, so the movie is the first time we actually get to see him and his Flame Breathing techniques in action. The flames that roar through the train, his unbelievably swift reactions, the movement of his cape, his intense red eyes that seem to see through all…Everything. Is. Way. Too. Cool.Seriously, everything about him is just so cool… How am I meant to deal with this… (I mean, I don’t have to.) The moment he began his Flame Breathing First Form: Shiranui, I realized, “Oh, I’ve pretty much spent nothing on this movie… This is already worth the ticket…”From his sword techniques to his mere presence and words, every part of Rengoku Kyojuro is priceless. Honestly, this movie leaves you no time to even blink. Everything is something to look out for. I don’t want you to let even a tenth of a second escape your attention, so be sure to use plenty of eye drops before it starts 3. The Mugen Train and its Real-Life OriginsLet’s take a look at a certain train otaku favorite in Japan, SL Hitoyoshi, which features an 8620 Class steam locomotive. Commonly known as “hachiroku"" (meaning ""86”), it’s none other than the locomotive that inspired the appearance of the Mugen Train! From the beginning of the movie, we get plenty of glimpses at Japan in the Taisho Era (1912-1926), from the design of the station and passenger cars to the fashion of the passengers themselves. Through the animation, we also experience its sheer speed, as well as the actual sensation of being swayed as we ride in the heavy carriages. It’s downright awesome!Here in Japan, we actually got to see a collaboration between SL Hitoyoshi and  KnY, where the locomotive was transformed into a real-life Mugen Train for a limited run. Naturally, it was so popular that it was practically impossible to get your hands on tickets. (Yup, I didn’t manage to snag any either…) It quickly became a viral topic on social media, with people excited to see a “real-life Mugen Train” even in photos and videos.  4. Tanjiro’s Feelings For His FamilyKnY’s story begins with a powerful theme: family. We also see its importance in the movie, which beautifully illustrates Tanjiro’s feelings for his family. He’s already lost so many people important to him, but no matter how much he wants to return to those happy days, there’s no going back – he'll never be able to see his loved ones again. This movie’s depiction of Tanjiro’s family, entangled in memories both happy and sad, but never to be restored, will have your eyes streaming with tears. 5. And Of Course, the Funny Scenes!Another great element that we get to see again are the hilarious moments between Inosuke and Zenitsu! You’ll also find yourself chuckling at Rengoku as he scarfs down his ekiben (bento lunches bought at train stations). Another heads up – at first Zenitsu’s dream sequence will probably just seem funny, but if you pay attention to where it’s set, that smile might turn into tears… (This is especially aimed at anyone who’s already read the manga up to the Mugen Train arc – I want you to think long and hard about where he is in that dream!) Spoiler Alert!From here, I’ll be introducing specific details about the movie, so please stop reading if you want to avoid spoilers.↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓Alright! Let’s keep going with more highlights, including actual scenes from the movie! 6. An Unprecedented Battle of IntellectTanjiro’s new foe, and the demon controlling the Mugen Train is Enmu, Lower Rank One in the Twelve Kizuki. Before the events of the movie, Muzan himself took a liking to Enmu and gifted him with Muzan’s blood. Having gained power with this infusion, Enmu decides to enlist the help of humans – or rather, use them as a means for his plan. Thus, the lives of Tanjiro, Zenitsu, Inosuke, Nezuko, and their mission companion, Rengoku, as well as the train’s many regular passengers, are Enmu’s next targets. His gentle and calm manner of speaking and friendly smile prove to make him an even more sinister character. Carrying out his plan with meticulous care, Enmu attempts to put Tanjiro and the other humans to sleep forever through his Blood Demon Art, a style of attack that they’ve never faced before. How will Tanjiro and his fellow Demon Slayers wake themselves up from Enmu’s eternal dreams? 7. The Sudden Appearance of Upper Rank Three, AkazaThe last part of the movie takes a huge turn with the sudden appearance of Akaza (Upper Rank Three) and his fierce battle against Rengoku. Just before dawn, Tanjiro and the others finally get the chance to breathe a sigh of relief, having defeated Enmu and checked that the passengers are safe. But this only lasts for a moment, with the Demon Slayers gathered facing the dreaded Upper Rank Three for the first time. The sudden roaring sound signals the appearance of something... but then dies down, leaving an eerie silence. Then, a pair of eyes glisten in the darkness. This frightening sense of anticipation crosses the screen to weigh down on you, causing you to instinctively clench your fists in suspense…Despite Akaza being a favorite among  KnY’s many demons, we didn’t get any information on his voice actor, or even still images until the movie’s official release. As a result, fans speculated that the movie might only cover Enmu’s arc and stop before showing Akaza, or that the anime series would continue with his story. However, the movie’s premiere date came and the cat was finally let out of the bag. We now know that Akaza’s voice actor is Akira Ishida, famous for roles like Kaworu Nagisa in  Neon Genesis Evangelion! This casting was a huge yet welcome surprise for fans. If you’re watching the movie with Japanese audio, be sure to soak up every moment of Akaza’s malevolence, madness and despair through Ishida’s formidable voice acting!One more highlight is the overwhelming energy of Rengoku and Akaza in their battle scenes, yet another part where you can’t afford to blink. If IMAX screenings are available near you, take advantage of them and experience the fight’s sheer power at full volume. It goes without saying that you can still experience plenty at normal theaters, but I urge you to go and feel the huge impact behind each and every hit at IMAX volume levels! The depiction of the snowflake patterns in Akaza’s Technique Deployment ability is also a highlight. In the original manga’s 18th volume, we learn about Akaza’s past. Despite being a ruthless demon with numerous victims, the sorrows of his life as a human capture the pity of readers. Personally, he’s one of my favorite characters. After watching the movie, I also recommend going right to the rest of the manga to continue the story! 8. Tears of FrustrationAt the end of the battle, Tanjiro and his companions are overwhelmed by the realization that they are still too weak, no matter how much work they put in or how hard they train. Sneering down with their seemingly infinite power are the demons. Haunted by the thought that they couldn’t do anything, that they had to be protected by others, the young humans have faced frustration, sadness, and uncontrollable tears. For the sake of their slain family members and beloved people they still had to protect, they’ve trained over and over, fought to survive the Final Selection, narrowly escaped death every night, and made huge progress. Yet their power was still nowhere near enough. And now, the man they had followed has fallen victim to their enemies. No matter how many times you watch the movie, this realization will tear your heart to shreds. In the face of such a tragedy, Inosuke offers some words that are deeply touching. His upbringing among wild boars may have given him less experience with other people, but we can see that he’s grown yet again as a human.  9. Rengoku’s Explosive Battle Through LifeFans who have already read the manga will know what I’m talking about. In any case, I won’t elaborate too much, but I urge you to burn his battles and his way of life into your mind – why he risks his life in battle, why he tries to protect humans. His crystal-clear beliefs and promises will also give you an insight into the loneliness he must bear. Protect the weak. Respect one’s duty and values. In what light will you see these warriors and hear their words as they fight to protect others? If you have the chance, please find out on the big screen. Finally, let me leave you with these words: “Keep your heart burning!” (And don’t forget a handkerchief!)This is a Tokyo Otaku Mode original article with text and illustrations by HER.--Need some more quality time with the KnY crew?

06-04-2022,anime,11,0,https://otakumode.com/letter,Letter from the Founder | Tokyo Otaku Mode (TOM),"Tokyo Otaku ModeShopNewsGalleryOtapediaLog InSign UpAbout UsOur PromiseLetter From the FounderTokyo Otaku Mode FAQTOM Shop FAQTOM Premium FAQContact UsAdvertiseOur Business PartnersIcon and BannerAffiliate ProgramEnglishJapaneseLetter from the FounderMy name is Tomo Kamei, the Founder of Tokyo Otaku Mode. Since I am not sure which country those of you who are reading this may be in, let me greet you by saying good morning, good afternoon, and good evening.I created this page to provide you with a better understanding of what exactly Tokyo Otaku Mode is and also to convey the ambitions and intentions we as a team have for Tokyo Otaku Mode and how we plan to expand our service. I would like to directly convey to you in my own words when and why we started Tokyo Otaku Mode, the reason for expanding our service overseas, and our goal for the Tokyo Otaku Mode Shop.The Bud that Sprouted Before the Creation of Tokyo Otaku ModeHave you ever seen a 40.1 meter tsunami?On March 10, 2011, I was working at an advertising company and on a business trip in Fukushima Prefecture. Tohoku is an area in the northern part of Japan. On that day, I had finished my work faster than I had thought I would. I boarded the bullet train, gazed out at the Tohoku scenery through the window, and took a small nap. The next day, I attended a business meeting at the office. Everything was normal.Then, the earthquake hit.Everything was flying off the shelves, and the shaking was so strong, it sounded like a scream. The ground was soft and flexible like a trampoline mat. I tried to keep calm, but it felt like the soles of my feet were on fire, and I was scared. After the shaking had stopped, we turned on the TV and the announcer was giving a warning: “A large 8.8 magnitude earthquake originating in Tohoku has struck. Everyone in the area should evacuate immediately.” Many people either lost their lives or went missing due to the earthquake and the resulting tsunami. Cities were swallowed by the waves of the tsunami that rose up high in the sky. One such city was the one I had been in the day before. The white shirts of the clients I met on the business trip, the smiles on the men’s faces who worked at the hotel, the red tiled roofs bleached by the sea breeze, the sound of the tires on the taxi I rode to the station squeaking to a stop. Even now, fragments of such memories from the city come to mind. And most of these were dragged away from reality by the earthquake and tsunami. My right index finger shook uncontrollably as I watched the TV.At that time, there was something else I was striving for other than work. That was starting up Tokyo Otaku Mode’s Facebook page. Basically, the idea was to transmit to the world representative otaku content like anime and manga. I ironed out the concept of Tokyo Otaku Mode with my colleagues, and, with the desire to somehow convey the current trends in Japanese content by utilizing our advantage of being in Japan, we thought up the idea that otaku content would be great as content delivered through Facebook to overseas countries. So, we came up with the plan to launch a Facebook page at the end of March, and we steadily started preparing. But then the earthquake happened and we thought about postponing the launch.In the days following, tragic news concerning the earthquake was reported on TV and in newspapers throughout Japan. I also saw despairing comments regarding Japan even in overseas news reports. Even online, blatantly inaccurate information like “So-and-so manga artist died in the earthquake” was running rampant. What was really going on in Japan was not being properly conveyed.I talked with my colleagues once more. We wondered if there was something we could do, something we should do. We ultimately decided to launch the Facebook page we had been thinking about due to what was going on at the time. We wanted to be the first to convey to people all over the world the same enjoyment we had experienced from anime and manga up until then.Even today, I remember the sprouting of a powerful determination along with those feelings that matched our mission. Thus, two weeks after the earthquake, on March 24, I, along with my colleagues, launched Tokyo Otaku Mode’s Facebook page.Tokyo Otaku Mode: From Street Presentations to Silicon ValleyTokyo Otaku Mode was primarily started by several members, myself included. Even today, all of us are active in the company as founding members.At first, we started by introducing content related to the subcultures of Japan on Facebook. Looking back on it, it was a meager attempt, like something someone would make out of hobby. We went through a harsh time at the beginning where we weren’t getting any fans. Even still, we proceeded in trial and error and continued to persevere and update the page with information on Japan’s subcultures and pictures of cosplayers we would take by attending otaku-related events. By doing so, our number of fans slowly increased up to us having several million. Our continuing conviction of having this service be for the benefit of people all over the world had paid off.However, even though our number of fans continued to increase, I was still employed elsewhere, as were the other members. Even at the time when Tokyo Otaku Mode had several million fans, we were still treating it like a recreational activity, doing it between working and on our days off. At that time, I had a certain encounter that would change that. In the winter of 2012 (February), I had the chance to meet with Dave McClure, founder of 500 Startups, a small-investment fund that actively invests in businesses that are just starting out, which came about by us giving a street presentation in Shibuya. We desperately explained Tokyo Otaku Mode, and after listening to our presentation, Dave recommended us to come to Silicon Valley. In other words, he was going to invest in us.I immediately quit the company I was working for and made the jump to America. And just like that, my colleagues came along and on April 10, 2012, more than 10,000 kilometers from Tohoku in Silicon Valley, Tokyo Otaku Mode officially became a company. Three-hundred and ninety six days had passed since the day when I first saw on TV the devastation of the earthquake.Becoming a Service and Place for News to Satisfy Both Fans and CreatorsBefore Tokyo Otaku Mode became a corporate body (around 2010), thinking that I should understand overseas market economies, I used my own money to go to Shanghai, Vietnam, Philippines, and San Francisco to observe companies. In other words, I was able to see many things. As a part of these trips, I would do things like check to see what Japanese content and services were popular and listen to what the natives of the area had to say. Among all this, there was one thing that struck me, that being the circulation of pirated anime and manga. It differed by the areas in each country, but there was the same level of proliferation of pirated content, the source to which was unknown. People were buying these copies even though they knew they weren’t authentic… In subtle ways, well-known anime and manga were being altered and sold. I had heard of the existence of pirated copies before, but I was astonished by the reality that works having been stripped of their original rights and values were being offered by people overseas.A pirated copy of a work is an illegal replication. There are pirated software and anime that ignore the rights of the works’ creators that are sold and distributed online. Because most Japanese anime and manga is created in Japanese, translating them to other languages to circulate them overseas is unavoidable. Therefore, do translated pirated versions really convey the creator’s intent? Among manga that have 10 volumes, there may be a volume that becomes hard to find anywhere. Because fans in this instance won’t be able to keep up with the work’s story, they may feel disappointed and think “This isn’t fun,” and this may be the basis for fans losing interest in anime and manga. By observing things overseas, it has strengthened my complicated feelings toward pirated copies. I think that those reading this have a love of Japanese anime and manga and a desire to enjoy what is to come. If that’s the case, I hope that you would show your understanding of the fact that by giving creators the value they rightfully deserve, you are helping them to continue creating.There are fans who want to happen upon new works and creators who want to create even better works. By viewing things overseas, the question “If content could be supplied in a more legitimate way, would that make people happy?” came to mind. Tokyo Otaku Mode is our answer to that question. We are trying to create a worldwide platform that meets the needs of both fans and creators, a place that is unburdened by economic conditions and social issues of any single country or area, a place that anime and manga fans the world over can enjoy.Thus, through our service, we want to increase the earnings of anime with a production cost of $1 million to $2 or $3 million (By the way, there is a lot of deep otaku content in Japan. It is Tokyo Otaku Mode’s mission to also introduce this with everyone.). We want the works we introduce to be known throughout the world, and even for related products to steadily sell well; to timely offer information on products and works, regardless of country or area; and to return to a place where creators and manufacturers gain profits for their works. If we are able to do that, I believe that we can create a positive influence on all those related to producing works and that they will continue to create high-quality entertainment.The People of Tokyo Otaku ModeThe people who manage the Tokyo Otaku Mode service were brought together mainly through the founding members’ personal connections.This includes not just the programmers who can be called the lifeline of managing the website, but also members who support the creators, members who manage the shop, cameramen, and editors. In other words, the site was established through assembling people from all kinds of fields in order to spread otaku content to people all over the world and to create an environment that creators can immerse themselves in.By the way, we use the catch-all term “creator” to refer to anyone who produces creative work and has the skills to make people enjoy it, whether they are illustrators, cosplayers, Vocaloid producers, manga artists, or something else. I want creators to thoroughly immerse themselves in creating their works. Occasionally, they slip into the world of a work that seems like it’s at the bottom of the ocean. They are so focused that they can’t hear anything around them, and they create worlds that no one has seen in form that everyone can see. Giving a work such form takes extraordinary ability and time.However, even though many young creators possess skill, they lack money. It’s difficult to eke out a living on just independent creations without cooperating with manufacturers and companies and establishing a sales route. To make ends meet, many must get second jobs. In other words, they have no choice but to scale back how much time they can devote to creating works. Even though they want to create work, reality won’t allow them to. Many creators have been burdened by this dilemma throughout history, even though they possess talent that would most likely bloom if only they had time to devote to it.That is why we lend our support to these creators. Basically, we do this by offering them a platform on which to show their works, help them to communicate with fans all over the world by translating their messages, and try to return the profits and rights to those who can’t spread their works to the world. We are doing a lot to collaborate with them, which also involves producing posters, T-shirts, and other original products of their works.Through their products, the creators can make a profit. Thus, they are able to devote more time to immersing themselves in their creations, which I believe heightens the possibility of them creating even better works. I want the wonderful works crafted by creators of such skill to be more highly known by everyone all over the world.Well, doesn’t that make you excited? What kind of new works will be created and what will the future hold? I want to happen upon a work and think “I’m so glad I found this work,” and then to spread this joy by sharing the work with everyone around the world.This is how all of us at Tokyo Otaku Mode feel.Tokyo Otaku Mode’s Mission: To Change the World’s Course By a Single MillimeterThe Earth’s diameter is 12,742 kilometers. Though the Himalayas and Africa’s Great Rift Valley are a different story. We at Tokyo Otaku Mode want to create a 1 millimeter shift in the world of someone born somewhere on this vast Earth. This may be something that many people also think. Art, services, religion, love––it’s true that people and companies try to convey various thoughts to others. We understand that for those captivated by subcultures like anime and manga, enjoying such works and products brings about feelings of peace. It’s difficult for humans to feel depressed when they are enjoying something. It’s also difficult to feel sad or cry when you are happy and smiling. It is for that reason that the attitude of otaku who enjoy things from deep within their being may be the foundation for creating more peace throughout the world. We at Tokyo Otaku Mode believe in this possibility, and we want to steer the world in a better direction through elevating the level of familiarity and values of otaku culture.Our mission on a more concrete level is to deliver to the world Japanese otaku content. To say it a different way, we want to promote all otaku values and create a place and opportunities for each individual to be able to reflect upon the joy of being otaku. Another mission of ours is to discover and support talented creators in order to construct an ecosystem of creations being continuously realized. I may be speaking too grandiose, but we aim to create a new art culture that will in turn elevate the status of otaku culture.We merely propagate a variety of things to people around the world; the value of that is up to them. It is not our intention to arbitrarily push our own values. The world will be changed by the otaku that populate it; we are just laying the groundwork.Tokyo Otaku Mode ShopFinally, I’d like to talk about the Tokyo Otaku Mode Shop.The thought of starting the Tokyo Otaku Mode Shop was born through our mission and our own personal experiences. An environment where people, things, and products that should be valued will surely be valued; a place to make both fans and creators happy. As an extension of these thoughts, the idea of establishing a shop service––through which we could not only deliver to fans all over the world authentic products from Japan, but also deliver to fans’ hands creators’ works in the form of products on top of transmitting information and sharings creators’ works––began to blossom.Everything we sell on the Tokyo Otaku Mode Shop was procured through legitimate means. We received permission to sell each and every item, which we offer to everyone living overseas.This has always stayed constant, whether it’s an introduction to a creator’s work on the Gallery page, or distributing otaku news on the News page. What we do on the Shop page is the same as our overall mission: to deliver Japanese otaku content to everyone around the world. The Shop page is just a more tangible representation of this mission; it can be held, touched, and seen adorning nearby walls as canvas boards and posters. It’s a way to distinctly feel those merits. That is one of our desires for our shop service. We’d be happy if our shop is stocked with things that you enjoy.If there is something you can’t find, please send us an inquiry. We understand that for every 100 otaku, there will be 100 different things that they enjoy. Therefore, we’d like to hear requests from everyone around the world as to what kind of products they would like. I don’t know if we will be able to fulfill 100% of those requests, but we will do the best that we can.We want everyone around the world to look forward to receiving products they desire and relish the moment of finally getting those products and being so happy that their heart skips a beat. That is one of the highlights of being otaku. Artwork, check. News, check. Products, check. We at Tokyo Otaku Mode will continue day after day to offer fascinating otaku content for everyone in every area of the globe to enjoy. And we will proceed in changing the direction of the world.

Since I am not sure which country those of you who are reading this may be in, let me greet you by saying good morning, good afternoon, and good evening.I created this page to provide you with a better understanding of what exactly Tokyo Otaku Mode is and also to convey the ambitions and intentions we as a team have for Tokyo Otaku Mode and how we plan to expand our service. I would like to directly convey to you in my own words when and why we started Tokyo Otaku Mode, the reason for expanding our service overseas, and our goal for the Tokyo Otaku Mode Shop.The Bud that Sprouted Before the Creation of Tokyo Otaku ModeHave you ever seen a 40.1 meter tsunami?On March 10, 2011, I was working at an advertising company and on a business trip in Fukushima Prefecture. Tohoku is an area in the northern part of Japan. On that day, I had finished my work faster than I had thought I would. I boarded the bullet train, gazed out at the Tohoku scenery through the window, and took a small nap. The next day, I attended a business meeting at the office. Everything was normal.Then, the earthquake hit.Everything was flying off the shelves, and the shaking was so strong, it sounded like a scream. The ground was soft and flexible like a trampoline mat. I tried to keep calm, but it felt like the soles of my feet were on fire, and I was scared. After the shaking had stopped, we turned on the TV and the announcer was giving a warning: “A large 8.8 magnitude earthquake originating in Tohoku has struck. Everyone in the area should evacuate immediately.” Many people either lost their lives or went missing due to the earthquake and the resulting tsunami. Cities were swallowed by the waves of the tsunami that rose up high in the sky. One such city was the one I had been in the day before. The white shirts of the clients I met on the business trip, the smiles on the men’s faces who worked at the hotel, the red tiled roofs bleached by the sea breeze, the sound of the tires on the taxi I rode to the station squeaking to a stop. Even now, fragments of such memories from the city come to mind. And most of these were dragged away from reality by the earthquake and tsunami. My right index finger shook uncontrollably as I watched the TV.At that time, there was something else I was striving for other than work. That was starting up Tokyo Otaku Mode’s Facebook page. Basically, the idea was to transmit to the world representative otaku content like anime and manga. I ironed out the concept of Tokyo Otaku Mode with my colleagues, and, with the desire to somehow convey the current trends in Japanese content by utilizing our advantage of being in Japan, we thought up the idea that otaku content would be great as content delivered through Facebook to overseas countries. So, we came up with the plan to launch a Facebook page at the end of March, and we steadily started preparing. But then the earthquake happened and we thought about postponing the launch.In the days following, tragic news concerning the earthquake was reported on TV and in newspapers throughout Japan. I also saw despairing comments regarding Japan even in overseas news reports. Even online, blatantly inaccurate information like “So-and-so manga artist died in the earthquake” was running rampant. What was really going on in Japan was not being properly conveyed.I talked with my colleagues once more. We wondered if there was something we could do, something we should do. We ultimately decided to launch the Facebook page we had been thinking about due to what was going on at the time. We wanted to be the first to convey to people all over the world the same enjoyment we had experienced from anime and manga up until then.Even today, I remember the sprouting of a powerful determination along with those feelings that matched our mission. Thus, two weeks after the earthquake, on March 24, I, along with my colleagues, launched Tokyo Otaku Mode’s Facebook page.Tokyo Otaku Mode: From Street Presentations to Silicon ValleyTokyo Otaku Mode was primarily started by several members, myself included. Even today, all of us are active in the company as founding members.At first, we started by introducing content related to the subcultures of Japan on Facebook. Looking back on it, it was a meager attempt, like something someone would make out of hobby. We went through a harsh time at the beginning where we weren’t getting any fans. Even still, we proceeded in trial and error and continued to persevere and update the page with information on Japan’s subcultures and pictures of cosplayers we would take by attending otaku-related events. By doing so, our number of fans slowly increased up to us having several million. Our continuing conviction of having this service be for the benefit of people all over the world had paid off.However, even though our number of fans continued to increase, I was still employed elsewhere, as were the other members. Even at the time when Tokyo Otaku Mode had several million fans, we were still treating it like a recreational activity, doing it between working and on our days off. At that time, I had a certain encounter that would change that. In the winter of 2012 (February), I had the chance to meet with Dave McClure, founder of 500 Startups, a small-investment fund that actively invests in businesses that are just starting out, which came about by us giving a street presentation in Shibuya. We desperately explained Tokyo Otaku Mode, and after listening to our presentation, Dave recommended us to come to Silicon Valley. In other words, he was going to invest in us.I immediately quit the company I was working for and made the jump to America. And just like that, my colleagues came along and on April 10, 2012, more than 10,000 kilometers from Tohoku in Silicon Valley, Tokyo Otaku Mode officially became a company. Three-hundred and ninety six days had passed since the day when I first saw on TV the devastation of the earthquake.Becoming a Service and Place for News to Satisfy Both Fans and CreatorsBefore Tokyo Otaku Mode became a corporate body (around 2010), thinking that I should understand overseas market economies, I used my own money to go to Shanghai, Vietnam, Philippines, and San Francisco to observe companies. In other words, I was able to see many things. As a part of these trips, I would do things like check to see what Japanese content and services were popular and listen to what the natives of the area had to say. Among all this, there was one thing that struck me, that being the circulation of pirated anime and manga. It differed by the areas in each country, but there was the same level of proliferation of pirated content, the source to which was unknown. People were buying these copies even though they knew they weren’t authentic… In subtle ways, well-known anime and manga were being altered and sold. I had heard of the existence of pirated copies before, but I was astonished by the reality that works having been stripped of their original rights and values were being offered by people overseas.A pirated copy of a work is an illegal replication. There are pirated software and anime that ignore the rights of the works’ creators that are sold and distributed online. Because most Japanese anime and manga is created in Japanese, translating them to other languages to circulate them overseas is unavoidable. Therefore, do translated pirated versions really convey the creator’s intent? Among manga that have 10 volumes, there may be a volume that becomes hard to find anywhere. Because fans in this instance won’t be able to keep up with the work’s story, they may feel disappointed and think “This isn’t fun,” and this may be the basis for fans losing interest in anime and manga. By observing things overseas, it has strengthened my complicated feelings toward pirated copies. I think that those reading this have a love of Japanese anime and manga and a desire to enjoy what is to come. If that’s the case, I hope that you would show your understanding of the fact that by giving creators the value they rightfully deserve, you are helping them to continue creating.There are fans who want to happen upon new works and creators who want to create even better works. By viewing things overseas, the question “If content could be supplied in a more legitimate way, would that make people happy?” came to mind. Tokyo Otaku Mode is our answer to that question. We are trying to create a worldwide platform that meets the needs of both fans and creators, a place that is unburdened by economic conditions and social issues of any single country or area, a place that anime and manga fans the world over can enjoy.Thus, through our service, we want to increase the earnings of anime with a production cost of $1 million to $2 or $3 million (By the way, there is a lot of deep otaku content in Japan. It is Tokyo Otaku Mode’s mission to also introduce this with everyone.). We want the works we introduce to be known throughout the world, and even for related products to steadily sell well; to timely offer information on products and works, regardless of country or area; and to return to a place where creators and manufacturers gain profits for their works. If we are able to do that, I believe that we can create a positive influence on all those related to producing works and that they will continue to create high-quality entertainment.The People of Tokyo Otaku ModeThe people who manage the Tokyo Otaku Mode service were brought together mainly through the founding members’ personal connections.This includes not just the programmers who can be called the lifeline of managing the website, but also members who support the creators, members who manage the shop, cameramen, and editors. In other words, the site was established through assembling people from all kinds of fields in order to spread otaku content to people all over the world and to create an environment that creators can immerse themselves in.By the way, we use the catch-all term “creator” to refer to anyone who produces creative work and has the skills to make people enjoy it, whether they are illustrators, cosplayers, Vocaloid producers, manga artists, or something else. I want creators to thoroughly immerse themselves in creating their works. Occasionally, they slip into the world of a work that seems like it’s at the bottom of the ocean. They are so focused that they can’t hear anything around them, and they create worlds that no one has seen in form that everyone can see. Giving a work such form takes extraordinary ability and time.However, even though many young creators possess skill, they lack money. It’s difficult to eke out a living on just independent creations without cooperating with manufacturers and companies and establishing a sales route. To make ends meet, many must get second jobs. In other words, they have no choice but to scale back how much time they can devote to creating works. Even though they want to create work, reality won’t allow them to. Many creators have been burdened by this dilemma throughout history, even though they possess talent that would most likely bloom if only they had time to devote to it.That is why we lend our support to these creators. Basically, we do this by offering them a platform on which to show their works, help them to communicate with fans all over the world by translating their messages, and try to return the profits and rights to those who can’t spread their works to the world. We are doing a lot to collaborate with them, which also involves producing posters, T-shirts, and other original products of their works.Through their products, the creators can make a profit. Thus, they are able to devote more time to immersing themselves in their creations, which I believe heightens the possibility of them creating even better works. I want the wonderful works crafted by creators of such skill to be more highly known by everyone all over the world.Well, doesn’t that make you excited? What kind of new works will be created and what will the future hold? I want to happen upon a work and think “I’m so glad I found this work,” and then to spread this joy by sharing the work with everyone around the world.This is how all of us at Tokyo Otaku Mode feel.Tokyo Otaku Mode’s Mission: To Change the World’s Course By a Single MillimeterThe Earth’s diameter is 12,742 kilometers. Though the Himalayas and Africa’s Great Rift Valley are a different story. We at Tokyo Otaku Mode want to create a 1 millimeter shift in the world of someone born somewhere on this vast Earth. This may be something that many people also think. Art, services, religion, love––it’s true that people and companies try to convey various thoughts to others. We understand that for those captivated by subcultures like anime and manga, enjoying such works and products brings about feelings of peace. It’s difficult for humans to feel depressed when they are enjoying something. It’s also difficult to feel sad or cry when you are happy and smiling. It is for that reason that the attitude of otaku who enjoy things from deep within their being may be the foundation for creating more peace throughout the world. We at Tokyo Otaku Mode believe in this possibility, and we want to steer the world in a better direction through elevating the level of familiarity and values of otaku culture.Our mission on a more concrete level is to deliver to the world Japanese otaku content. To say it a different way, we want to promote all otaku values and create a place and opportunities for each individual to be able to reflect upon the joy of being otaku. Another mission of ours is to discover and support talented creators in order to construct an ecosystem of creations being continuously realized. I may be speaking too grandiose, but we aim to create a new art culture that will in turn elevate the status of otaku culture.We merely propagate a variety of things to people around the world; the value of that is up to them. It is not our intention to arbitrarily push our own values. The world will be changed by the otaku that populate it; we are just laying the groundwork.Tokyo Otaku Mode ShopFinally, I’d like to talk about the Tokyo Otaku Mode Shop.The thought of starting the Tokyo Otaku Mode Shop was born through our mission and our own personal experiences. An environment where people, things, and products that should be valued will surely be valued; a place to make both fans and creators happy. As an extension of these thoughts, the idea of establishing a shop service––through which we could not only deliver to fans all over the world authentic products from Japan, but also deliver to fans’ hands creators’ works in the form of products on top of transmitting information and sharings creators’ works––began to blossom.Everything we sell on the Tokyo Otaku Mode Shop was procured through legitimate means. We received permission to sell each and every item, which we offer to everyone living overseas.This has always stayed constant, whether it’s an introduction to a creator’s work on the Gallery page, or distributing otaku news on the News page. What we do on the Shop page is the same as our overall mission: to deliver Japanese otaku content to everyone around the world. The Shop page is just a more tangible representation of this mission; it can be held, touched, and seen adorning nearby walls as canvas boards and posters. It’s a way to distinctly feel those merits. That is one of our desires for our shop service. We’d be happy if our shop is stocked with things that you enjoy.If there is something you can’t find, please send us an inquiry. We understand that for every 100 otaku, there will be 100 different things that they enjoy. Therefore, we’d like to hear requests from everyone around the world as to what kind of products they would like. I don’t know if we will be able to fulfill 100% of those requests, but we will do the best that we can.We want everyone around the world to look forward to receiving products they desire and relish the moment of finally getting those products and being so happy that their heart skips a beat. That is one of the highlights of being otaku. Artwork, check. News, check. Products, check. We at Tokyo Otaku Mode will continue day after day to offer fascinating otaku content for everyone in every area of the globe to enjoy. And we will proceed in changing the direction of the world.  Yes, even if it’s only a millimeter.Thank you for taking the time to read this. Everyone here at Tokyo Otaku Mode would like to convey their thanks for embracing this place, cooperating with us, and helping us to grow up until now and into the future.About UsWhat is Tokyo Otaku Mode?TOM PremiumLetter From the FounderOur PromiseCorporate Site (Japanese) LEGALTerms of UsePrivacy PolicyMerchandise PolicyHelpTOM Shop FAQTOM Premium FAQTokyo Otaku Mode FAQContact UsMore InfoSite MapTOM Email ArchivesKeyword RankingWhat is a Special Creator?AdvertiseOur Business PartnersIcon and BannerOtapediaOther SiteTOM Shop AppsRecommended SiteMyAnimeListHoney’s AnimeAnime Anime globalTokyo Otaku Mode (TOM)",positive,,{}

After the shaking had stopped, we turned on the TV and the announcer was giving a warning: “A large 8.8 magnitude earthquake originating in Tohoku has struck. Everyone in the area should evacuate immediately.” Many people either lost their lives or went missing due to the earthquake and the resulting tsunami. Cities were swallowed by the waves of the tsunami that rose up high in the sky. One such city was the one I had been in the day before. The white shirts of the clients I met on the business trip, the smiles on the men’s faces who worked at the hotel, the red tiled roofs bleached by the sea breeze, the sound of the tires on the taxi I rode to the station squeaking to a stop. Even now, fragments of such memories from the city come to mind. And most of these were dragged away from reality by the earthquake and tsunami. My right index finger shook uncontrollably as I watched the TV.At that time, there was something else I was striving for other than work. That was starting up Tokyo Otaku Mode’s Facebook page. Basically, the idea was to transmit to the world representative otaku content like anime and manga. I ironed out the concept of Tokyo Otaku Mode with my colleagues, and, with the desire to somehow convey the current trends in Japanese content by utilizing our advantage of being in Japan, we thought up the idea that otaku content would be great as content delivered through Facebook to overseas countries. So, we came up with the plan to launch a Facebook page at the end of March, and we steadily started preparing. But then the earthquake happened and we thought about postponing the launch.In the days following, tragic news concerning the earthquake was reported on TV and in newspapers throughout Japan. I also saw despairing comments regarding Japan even in overseas news reports. Even online, blatantly inaccurate information like “So-and-so manga artist died in the earthquake” was running rampant. What was really going on in Japan was not being properly conveyed.I talked with my colleagues once more. We wondered if there was something we could do, something we should do. We ultimately decided to launch the Facebook page we had been thinking about due to what was going on at the time. We wanted to be the first to convey to people all over the world the same enjoyment we had experienced from anime and manga up until then.Even today, I remember the sprouting of a powerful determination along with those feelings that matched our mission. Thus, two weeks after the earthquake, on March 24, I, along with my colleagues, launched Tokyo Otaku Mode’s Facebook page.Tokyo Otaku Mode: From Street Presentations to Silicon ValleyTokyo Otaku Mode was primarily started by several members, myself included. Even today, all of us are active in the company as founding members.At first, we started by introducing content related to the subcultures of Japan on Facebook. Looking back on it, it was a meager attempt, like something someone would make out of hobby. We went through a harsh time at the beginning where we weren’t getting any fans. Even still, we proceeded in trial and error and continued to persevere and update the page with information on Japan’s subcultures and pictures of cosplayers we would take by attending otaku-related events. By doing so, our number of fans slowly increased up to us having several million. Our continuing conviction of having this service be for the benefit of people all over the world had paid off.However, even though our number of fans continued to increase, I was still employed elsewhere, as were the other members. Even at the time when Tokyo Otaku Mode had several million fans, we were still treating it like a recreational activity, doing it between working and on our days off. At that time, I had a certain encounter that would change that. In the winter of 2012 (February), I had the chance to meet with Dave McClure, founder of 500 Startups, a small-investment fund that actively invests in businesses that are just starting out, which came about by us giving a street presentation in Shibuya. We desperately explained Tokyo Otaku Mode, and after listening to our presentation, Dave recommended us to come to Silicon Valley. In other words, he was going to invest in us.I immediately quit the company I was working for and made the jump to America. And just like that, my colleagues came along and on April 10, 2012, more than 10,000 kilometers from Tohoku in Silicon Valley, Tokyo Otaku Mode officially became a company. Three-hundred and ninety six days had passed since the day when I first saw on TV the devastation of the earthquake.Becoming a Service and Place for News to Satisfy Both Fans and CreatorsBefore Tokyo Otaku Mode became a corporate body (around 2010), thinking that I should understand overseas market economies, I used my own money to go to Shanghai, Vietnam, Philippines, and San Francisco to observe companies. In other words, I was able to see many things. As a part of these trips, I would do things like check to see what Japanese content and services were popular and listen to what the natives of the area had to say. Among all this, there was one thing that struck me, that being the circulation of pirated anime and manga. It differed by the areas in each country, but there was the same level of proliferation of pirated content, the source to which was unknown. People were buying these copies even though they knew they weren’t authentic… In subtle ways, well-known anime and manga were being altered and sold. I had heard of the existence of pirated copies before, but I was astonished by the reality that works having been stripped of their original rights and values were being offered by people overseas.A pirated copy of a work is an illegal replication. There are pirated software and anime that ignore the rights of the works’ creators that are sold and distributed online. Because most Japanese anime and manga is created in Japanese, translating them to other languages to circulate them overseas is unavoidable. Therefore, do translated pirated versions really convey the creator’s intent? Among manga that have 10 volumes, there may be a volume that becomes hard to find anywhere. Because fans in this instance won’t be able to keep up with the work’s story, they may feel disappointed and think “This isn’t fun,” and this may be the basis for fans losing interest in anime and manga. By observing things overseas, it has strengthened my complicated feelings toward pirated copies. I think that those reading this have a love of Japanese anime and manga and a desire to enjoy what is to come. If that’s the case, I hope that you would show your understanding of the fact that by giving creators the value they rightfully deserve, you are helping them to continue creating.There are fans who want to happen upon new works and creators who want to create even better works. By viewing things overseas, the question “If content could be supplied in a more legitimate way, would that make people happy?” came to mind. Tokyo Otaku Mode is our answer to that question. We are trying to create a worldwide platform that meets the needs of both fans and creators, a place that is unburdened by economic conditions and social issues of any single country or area, a place that anime and manga fans the world over can enjoy.Thus, through our service, we want to increase the earnings of anime with a production cost of $1 million to $2 or $3 million (By the way, there is a lot of deep otaku content in Japan. It is Tokyo Otaku Mode’s mission to also introduce this with everyone.). We want the works we introduce to be known throughout the world, and even for related products to steadily sell well; to timely offer information on products and works, regardless of country or area; and to return to a place where creators and manufacturers gain profits for their works. If we are able to do that, I believe that we can create a positive influence on all those related to producing works and that they will continue to create high-quality entertainment.The People of Tokyo Otaku ModeThe people who manage the Tokyo Otaku Mode service were brought together mainly through the founding members’ personal connections.This includes not just the programmers who can be called the lifeline of managing the website, but also members who support the creators, members who manage the shop, cameramen, and editors. In other words, the site was established through assembling people from all kinds of fields in order to spread otaku content to people all over the world and to create an environment that creators can immerse themselves in.By the way, we use the catch-all term “creator” to refer to anyone who produces creative work and has the skills to make people enjoy it, whether they are illustrators, cosplayers, Vocaloid producers, manga artists, or something else. I want creators to thoroughly immerse themselves in creating their works. Occasionally, they slip into the world of a work that seems like it’s at the bottom of the ocean. They are so focused that they can’t hear anything around them, and they create worlds that no one has seen in form that everyone can see. Giving a work such form takes extraordinary ability and time.However, even though many young creators possess skill, they lack money. It’s difficult to eke out a living on just independent creations without cooperating with manufacturers and companies and establishing a sales route. To make ends meet, many must get second jobs. In other words, they have no choice but to scale back how much time they can devote to creating works. Even though they want to create work, reality won’t allow them to. Many creators have been burdened by this dilemma throughout history, even though they possess talent that would most likely bloom if only they had time to devote to it.That is why we lend our support to these creators. Basically, we do this by offering them a platform on which to show their works, help them to communicate with fans all over the world by translating their messages, and try to return the profits and rights to those who can’t spread their works to the world. We are doing a lot to collaborate with them, which also involves producing posters, T-shirts, and other original products of their works.Through their products, the creators can make a profit. Thus, they are able to devote more time to immersing themselves in their creations, which I believe heightens the possibility of them creating even better works. I want the wonderful works crafted by creators of such skill to be more highly known by everyone all over the world.Well, doesn’t that make you excited? What kind of new works will be created and what will the future hold? I want to happen upon a work and think “I’m so glad I found this work,” and then to spread this joy by sharing the work with everyone around the world.This is how all of us at Tokyo Otaku Mode feel.Tokyo Otaku Mode’s Mission: To Change the World’s Course By a Single MillimeterThe Earth’s diameter is 12,742 kilometers. Though the Himalayas and Africa’s Great Rift Valley are a different story. We at Tokyo Otaku Mode want to create a 1 millimeter shift in the world of someone born somewhere on this vast Earth. This may be something that many people also think. Art, services, religion, love––it’s true that people and companies try to convey various thoughts to others. We understand that for those captivated by subcultures like anime and manga, enjoying such works and products brings about feelings of peace. It’s difficult for humans to feel depressed when they are enjoying something. It’s also difficult to feel sad or cry when you are happy and smiling. It is for that reason that the attitude of otaku who enjoy things from deep within their being may be the foundation for creating more peace throughout the world. We at Tokyo Otaku Mode believe in this possibility, and we want to steer the world in a better direction through elevating the level of familiarity and values of otaku culture.Our mission on a more concrete level is to deliver to the world Japanese otaku content. To say it a different way, we want to promote all otaku values and create a place and opportunities for each individual to be able to reflect upon the joy of being otaku. Another mission of ours is to discover and support talented creators in order to construct an ecosystem of creations being continuously realized. I may be speaking too grandiose, but we aim to create a new art culture that will in turn elevate the status of otaku culture.We merely propagate a variety of things to people around the world; the value of that is up to them. It is not our intention to arbitrarily push our own values. The world will be changed by the otaku that populate it; we are just laying the groundwork.Tokyo Otaku Mode ShopFinally, I’d like to talk about the Tokyo Otaku Mode Shop.The thought of starting the Tokyo Otaku Mode Shop was born through our mission and our own personal experiences. An environment where people, things, and products that should be valued will surely be valued; a place to make both fans and creators happy. As an extension of these thoughts, the idea of establishing a shop service––through which we could not only deliver to fans all over the world authentic products from Japan, but also deliver to fans’ hands creators’ works in the form of products on top of transmitting information and sharings creators’ works––began to blossom.Everything we sell on the Tokyo Otaku Mode Shop was procured through legitimate means. We received permission to sell each and every item, which we offer to everyone living overseas.This has always stayed constant, whether it’s an introduction to a creator’s work on the Gallery page, or distributing otaku news on the News page. What we do on the Shop page is the same as our overall mission: to deliver Japanese otaku content to everyone around the world. The Shop page is just a more tangible representation of this mission; it can be held, touched, and seen adorning nearby walls as canvas boards and posters. It’s a way to distinctly feel those merits. That is one of our desires for our shop service. We’d be happy if our shop is stocked with things that you enjoy.If there is something you can’t find, please send us an inquiry. We understand that for every 100 otaku, there will be 100 different things that they enjoy. Therefore, we’d like to hear requests from everyone around the world as to what kind of products they would like. I don’t know if we will be able to fulfill 100% of those requests, but we will do the best that we can.We want everyone around the world to look forward to receiving products they desire and relish the moment of finally getting those products and being so happy that their heart skips a beat. That is one of the highlights of being otaku. Artwork, check. News, check. Products, check. We at Tokyo Otaku Mode will continue day after day to offer fascinating otaku content for everyone in every area of the globe to enjoy. And we will proceed in changing the direction of the world.  Yes, even if it’s only a millimeter.Thank you for taking the time to read this. Everyone here at Tokyo Otaku Mode would like to convey their thanks for embracing this place, cooperating with us, and helping us to grow up until now and into the future.",positive,,{}

Since I am not sure which country those of you who are reading this may be in, let me greet you by saying good morning, good afternoon, and good evening.I created this page to provide you with a better understanding of what exactly Tokyo Otaku Mode is and also to convey the ambitions and intentions we as a team have for Tokyo Otaku Mode and how we plan to expand our service. I would like to directly convey to you in my own words when and why we started Tokyo Otaku Mode, the reason for expanding our service overseas, and our goal for the Tokyo Otaku Mode Shop.The Bud that Sprouted Before the Creation of Tokyo Otaku ModeHave you ever seen a 40.1 meter tsunami?On March 10, 2011, I was working at an advertising company and on a business trip in Fukushima Prefecture. Tohoku is an area in the northern part of Japan. On that day, I had finished my work faster than I had thought I would. I boarded the bullet train, gazed out at the Tohoku scenery through the window, and took a small nap. The next day, I attended a business meeting at the office. Everything was normal.Then, the earthquake hit.Everything was flying off the shelves, and the shaking was so strong, it sounded like a scream. The ground was soft and flexible like a trampoline mat.

Looking back on it, it was a meager attempt, like something someone would make out of hobby. We went through a harsh time at the beginning where we weren’t getting any fans. Even still, we proceeded in trial and error and continued to persevere and update the page with information on Japan’s subcultures and pictures of cosplayers we would take by attending otaku-related events. By doing so, our number of fans slowly increased up to us having several million. Our continuing conviction of having this service be for the benefit of people all over the world had paid off.However, even though our number of fans continued to increase, I was still employed elsewhere, as were the other members. Even at the time when Tokyo Otaku Mode had several million fans, we were still treating it like a recreational activity, doing it between working and on our days off. At that time, I had a certain encounter that would change that. In the winter of 2012 (February), I had the chance to meet with Dave McClure, founder of 500 Startups, a small-investment fund that actively invests in businesses that are just starting out, which came about by us giving a street presentation in Shibuya. We desperately explained Tokyo Otaku Mode, and after listening to our presentation, Dave recommended us to come to Silicon Valley. In other words, he was going to invest in us.I immediately quit the company I was working for and made the jump to America. And just like that, my colleagues came along and on April 10, 2012, more than 10,000 kilometers from Tohoku in Silicon Valley, Tokyo Otaku Mode officially became a company. Three-hundred and ninety six days had passed since the day when I first saw on TV the devastation of the earthquake.Becoming a Service and Place for News to Satisfy Both Fans and CreatorsBefore Tokyo Otaku Mode became a corporate body (around 2010), thinking that I should understand overseas market economies, I used my own money to go to Shanghai, Vietnam, Philippines, and San Francisco to observe companies. In other words, I was able to see many things. As a part of these trips, I would do things like check to see what Japanese content and services were popular and listen to what the natives of the area had to say. Among all this, there was one thing that struck me, that being the circulation of pirated anime and manga. It differed by the areas in each country, but there was the same level of proliferation of pirated content, the source to which was unknown. People were buying these copies even though they knew they weren’t authentic… In subtle ways, well-known anime and manga were being altered and sold. I had heard of the existence of pirated copies before, but I was astonished by the reality that works having been stripped of their original rights and values were being offered by people overseas.A pirated copy of a work is an illegal replication. There are pirated software and anime that ignore the rights of the works’ creators that are sold and distributed online. Because most Japanese anime and manga is created in Japanese, translating them to other languages to circulate them overseas is unavoidable. Therefore, do translated pirated versions really convey the creator’s intent? Among manga that have 10 volumes, there may be a volume that becomes hard to find anywhere. Because fans in this instance won’t be able to keep up with the work’s story, they may feel disappointed and think “This isn’t fun,” and this may be the basis for fans losing interest in anime and manga. By observing things overseas, it has strengthened my complicated feelings toward pirated copies. I think that those reading this have a love of Japanese anime and manga and a desire to enjoy what is to come. If that’s the case, I hope that you would show your understanding of the fact that by giving creators the value they rightfully deserve, you are helping them to continue creating.There are fans who want to happen upon new works and creators who want to create even better works. By viewing things overseas, the question “If content could be supplied in a more legitimate way, would that make people happy?” came to mind. Tokyo Otaku Mode is our answer to that question. We are trying to create a worldwide platform that meets the needs of both fans and creators, a place that is unburdened by economic conditions and social issues of any single country or area, a place that anime and manga fans the world over can enjoy.Thus, through our service, we want to increase the earnings of anime with a production cost of $1 million to $2 or $3 million (By the way, there is a lot of deep otaku content in Japan. It is Tokyo Otaku Mode’s mission to also introduce this with everyone.). We want the works we introduce to be known throughout the world, and even for related products to steadily sell well; to timely offer information on products and works, regardless of country or area; and to return to a place where creators and manufacturers gain profits for their works. If we are able to do that, I believe that we can create a positive influence on all those related to producing works and that they will continue to create high-quality entertainment.The People of Tokyo Otaku ModeThe people who manage the Tokyo Otaku Mode service were brought together mainly through the founding members’ personal connections.This includes not just the programmers who can be called the lifeline of managing the website, but also members who support the creators, members who manage the shop, cameramen, and editors. In other words, the site was established through assembling people from all kinds of fields in order to spread otaku content to people all over the world and to create an environment that creators can immerse themselves in.By the way, we use the catch-all term “creator” to refer to anyone who produces creative work and has the skills to make people enjoy it, whether they are illustrators, cosplayers, Vocaloid producers, manga artists, or something else. I want creators to thoroughly immerse themselves in creating their works. Occasionally, they slip into the world of a work that seems like it’s at the bottom of the ocean. They are so focused that they can’t hear anything around them, and they create worlds that no one has seen in form that everyone can see. Giving a work such form takes extraordinary ability and time.However, even though many young creators possess skill, they lack money. It’s difficult to eke out a living on just independent creations without cooperating with manufacturers and companies and establishing a sales route. To make ends meet, many must get second jobs. In other words, they have no choice but to scale back how much time they can devote to creating works. Even though they want to create work, reality won’t allow them to. Many creators have been burdened by this dilemma throughout history, even though they possess talent that would most likely bloom if only they had time to devote to it.That is why we lend our support to these creators. Basically, we do this by offering them a platform on which to show their works, help them to communicate with fans all over the world by translating their messages, and try to return the profits and rights to those who can’t spread their works to the world. We are doing a lot to collaborate with them, which also involves producing posters, T-shirts, and other original products of their works.Through their products, the creators can make a profit. Thus, they are able to devote more time to immersing themselves in their creations, which I believe heightens the possibility of them creating even better works. I want the wonderful works crafted by creators of such skill to be more highly known by everyone all over the world.Well, doesn’t that make you excited? What kind of new works will be created and what will the future hold? I want to happen upon a work and think “I’m so glad I found this work,” and then to spread this joy by sharing the work with everyone around the world.This is how all of us at Tokyo Otaku Mode feel.Tokyo Otaku Mode’s Mission: To Change the World’s Course By a Single MillimeterThe Earth’s diameter is 12,742 kilometers. Though the Himalayas and Africa’s Great Rift Valley are a different story. We at Tokyo Otaku Mode want to create a 1 millimeter shift in the world of someone born somewhere on this vast Earth. This may be something that many people also think. Art, services, religion, love––it’s true that people and companies try to convey various thoughts to others. We understand that for those captivated by subcultures like anime and manga, enjoying such works and products brings about feelings of peace. It’s difficult for humans to feel depressed when they are enjoying something. It’s also difficult to feel sad or cry when you are happy and smiling. It is for that reason that the attitude of otaku who enjoy things from deep within their being may be the foundation for creating more peace throughout the world. We at Tokyo Otaku Mode believe in this possibility, and we want to steer the world in a better direction through elevating the level of familiarity and values of otaku culture.Our mission on a more concrete level is to deliver to the world Japanese otaku content. To say it a different way, we want to promote all otaku values and create a place and opportunities for each individual to be able to reflect upon the joy of being otaku. Another mission of ours is to discover and support talented creators in order to construct an ecosystem of creations being continuously realized. I may be speaking too grandiose, but we aim to create a new art culture that will in turn elevate the status of otaku culture.We merely propagate a variety of things to people around the world; the value of that is up to them. It is not our intention to arbitrarily push our own values. The world will be changed by the otaku that populate it; we are just laying the groundwork.Tokyo Otaku Mode ShopFinally, I’d like to talk about the Tokyo Otaku Mode Shop.The thought of starting the Tokyo Otaku Mode Shop was born through our mission and our own personal experiences. An environment where people, things, and products that should be valued will surely be valued; a place to make both fans and creators happy. As an extension of these thoughts, the idea of establishing a shop service––through which we could not only deliver to fans all over the world authentic products from Japan, but also deliver to fans’ hands creators’ works in the form of products on top of transmitting information and sharings creators’ works––began to blossom.Everything we sell on the Tokyo Otaku Mode Shop was procured through legitimate means. We received permission to sell each and every item, which we offer to everyone living overseas.This has always stayed constant, whether it’s an introduction to a creator’s work on the Gallery page, or distributing otaku news on the News page. What we do on the Shop page is the same as our overall mission: to deliver Japanese otaku content to everyone around the world. The Shop page is just a more tangible representation of this mission; it can be held, touched, and seen adorning nearby walls as canvas boards and posters. It’s a way to distinctly feel those merits. That is one of our desires for our shop service. We’d be happy if our shop is stocked with things that you enjoy.If there is something you can’t find, please send us an inquiry. We understand that for every 100 otaku, there will be 100 different things that they enjoy. Therefore, we’d like to hear requests from everyone around the world as to what kind of products they would like. I don’t know if we will be able to fulfill 100% of those requests, but we will do the best that we can.We want everyone around the world to look forward to receiving products they desire and relish the moment of finally getting those products and being so happy that their heart skips a beat. That is one of the highlights of being otaku. Artwork, check. News, check. Products, check. We at Tokyo Otaku Mode will continue day after day to offer fascinating otaku content for everyone in every area of the globe to enjoy. And we will proceed in changing the direction of the world.  Yes, even if it’s only a millimeter.Thank you for taking the time to read this. Everyone here at Tokyo Otaku Mode would like to convey their thanks for embracing this place, cooperating with us, and helping us to grow up until now and into the future.",positive,,{}
06-04-2022,anime,11,0,https://otakumode.com/letter,Letter from the Founder | Tokyo Otaku Mode (TOM),"Letter from the FounderMy name is Tomo Kamei, the Founder of Tokyo Otaku Mode. Since I am not sure which country those of you who are reading this may be in, let me greet you by saying good morning, good afternoon, and good evening.I created this page to provide you with a better understanding of what exactly Tokyo Otaku Mode is and also to convey the ambitions and intentions we as a team have for Tokyo Otaku Mode and how we plan to expand our service. I would like to directly convey to you in my own words when and why we started Tokyo Otaku Mode, the reason for expanding our service overseas, and our goal for the Tokyo Otaku Mode Shop.The Bud that Sprouted Before the Creation of Tokyo Otaku ModeHave you ever seen a 40.1 meter tsunami?On March 10, 2011, I was working at an advertising company and on a business trip in Fukushima Prefecture. Tohoku is an area in the northern part of Japan. On that day, I had finished my work faster than I had thought I would. I boarded the bullet train, gazed out at the Tohoku scenery through the window, and took a small nap. The next day, I attended a business meeting at the office. Everything was normal.Then, the earthquake hit.Everything was flying off the shelves, and the shaking was so strong, it sounded like a scream. The ground was soft and flexible like a trampoline mat. I tried to keep calm, but it felt like the soles of my feet were on fire, and I was scared. After the shaking had stopped, we turned on the TV and the announcer was giving a warning: “A large 8.8 magnitude earthquake originating in Tohoku has struck. Everyone in the area should evacuate immediately.” Many people either lost their lives or went missing due to the earthquake and the resulting tsunami. Cities were swallowed by the waves of the tsunami that rose up high in the sky. One such city was the one I had been in the day before. The white shirts of the clients I met on the business trip, the smiles on the men’s faces who worked at the hotel, the red tiled roofs bleached by the sea breeze, the sound of the tires on the taxi I rode to the station squeaking to a stop. Even now, fragments of such memories from the city come to mind. And most of these were dragged away from reality by the earthquake and tsunami. My right index finger shook uncontrollably as I watched the TV.At that time, there was something else I was striving for other than work. That was starting up Tokyo Otaku Mode’s Facebook page. Basically, the idea was to transmit to the world representative otaku content like anime and manga. I ironed out the concept of Tokyo Otaku Mode with my colleagues, and, with the desire to somehow convey the current trends in Japanese content by utilizing our advantage of being in Japan, we thought up the idea that otaku content would be great as content delivered through Facebook to overseas countries. So, we came up with the plan to launch a Facebook page at the end of March, and we steadily started preparing. But then the earthquake happened and we thought about postponing the launch.In the days following, tragic news concerning the earthquake was reported on TV and in newspapers throughout Japan. I also saw despairing comments regarding Japan even in overseas news reports. Even online, blatantly inaccurate information like “So-and-so manga artist died in the earthquake” was running rampant. What was really going on in Japan was not being properly conveyed.I talked with my colleagues once more. We wondered if there was something we could do, something we should do. We ultimately decided to launch the Facebook page we had been thinking about due to what was going on at the time. We wanted to be the first to convey to people all over the world the same enjoyment we had experienced from anime and manga up until then.Even today, I remember the sprouting of a powerful determination along with those feelings that matched our mission. Thus, two weeks after the earthquake, on March 24, I, along with my colleagues, launched Tokyo Otaku Mode’s Facebook page.Tokyo Otaku Mode: From Street Presentations to Silicon ValleyTokyo Otaku Mode was primarily started by several members, myself included.
