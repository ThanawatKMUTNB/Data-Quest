The Best and Worst of Winter 2022   by Daniel DeLorme, Apr  6th 2022            Let's have a look at what ANN readers consider the best (and worst) of the season, based on the polls you can find in our Daily Streaming Reviews and on the Your Score page with the latest simulcasts.   Keep in mind that these rankings are based on how people rated individual episodes of the current season, not on the overall quality or popularity of the series. Only the titles legally streaming in North America and popular enough are being ranked, so the bottom of the list might represent 'watchable' rather than 'bad'. See the notes for further details.   For the last week we're comparing all the final episodes With the week of March 26-31, the Winter 2022 season is now over. But many of the series already ended the previous week, so we're adding an extra ""final"" week where all the last episodes are ranked against each other. With this we can see which series ended on a strong note and which ones ended more weakly. That means the ""final ep."" column is a repeat of the last episode from Mar 19-25 or Mar 26-31. And the ""prev week change"" is the difference in position between the ""final ep."" column and the penultimate episode.  The ranking doesn't include some episodes from the trailing end of the season streaming in April: Tokyo 24th Ward #12. For completeness' sake we'll update this ranking as the episodes are reviewed and rated in the coming days.   Episode Rankings for the final episodes Along the actual ranking for this week's episodes, this graph chronicles the change in position from week to week. While some series are stable, others swing wildly in the rankings depending on the strength of each episode. When a series has no episode for a given week, the previous week's episode is used instead as a placeholder. The first episode of each series is considered as part of the first week, even if it really streamed during the second week.

With the last episode duplicated in the ""final ep."" column, it means that the votes for the last episode of each series are counted twice, which intentionally gives a boost to series that ended strongly. This somewhat compensates for the fact that the first episode of each series has more votes, which favors series that started strongly.

Platinum End  13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 24          Notes  Disclaimer: the rankings are just an average of opinions, published for entertainment and information purposes. ANN makes no claims regarding statistical significance or invulnerability to spam.   The rankings are computed using the Schulze method, with the variation that unrated titles are considered as abstentions instead of lower than the rated titles. This roughly means that if, out of all people who rated both A and B, 60% preferred A, it will be ranked higher than B.   The rankings indicate relative quality (A is preferred to B), not absolute quality (B is good/bad). While the titles are ranked from 'best' to 'worst', sometimes the difference between #1 and #10 can be very thin. So if your favorite is near the bottom of the list, don't take it personally. It doesn't mean it's a bad show, it just means that ANN readers, on average, have preferred the ones above.   If a series has no episode for a given week, we use the rating data for the previous week's episode in order to compute the weekly ranking. This is not officially counted as a position in the ranking (it has no impact on the cumulative ranking), but it makes it easier to compare weeks if they each have the same number of series ranked.   It should be noted that long-running series (and sequels) have an advantage in the sense that only people who like the series are still watching it, and they are likely to give each episode a high rating. But if such a series is going through a low-quality filler arc, the season will get low rankings that are not indicative of the true overall quality of the series.     discuss this in the forum |        bookmark/share with:               Weekly Ranking homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature                The Best and Worst of Winter 2022   Apr  6, 10:10                 anime    With the last few episodes trailing into Spring like an April's fool, it's time to look at the final ranking of the Winter 2022 season.

The Best and Worst of Winter 2022   by Daniel DeLorme, Apr  6th 2022            Let's have a look at what ANN readers consider the best (and worst) of the season, based on the polls you can find in our Daily Streaming Reviews and on the Your Score page with the latest simulcasts.   Keep in mind that these rankings are based on how people rated individual episodes of the current season, not on the overall quality or popularity of the series. Only the titles legally streaming in North America and popular enough are being ranked, so the bottom of the list might represent 'watchable' rather than 'bad'. See the notes for further details.   For the last week we're comparing all the final episodes With the week of March 26-31, the Winter 2022 season is now over. But many of the series already ended the previous week, so we're adding an extra ""final"" week where all the last episodes are ranked against each other. With this we can see which series ended on a strong note and which ones ended more weakly. That means the ""final ep."" column is a repeat of the last episode from Mar 19-25 or Mar 26-31. And the ""prev week change"" is the difference in position between the ""final ep."" column and the penultimate episode.  The ranking doesn't include some episodes from the trailing end of the season streaming in April: Tokyo 24th Ward #12. For completeness' sake we'll update this ranking as the episodes are reviewed and rated in the coming days.   Episode Rankings for the final episodes Along the actual ranking for this week's episodes, this graph chronicles the change in position from week to week. While some series are stable, others swing wildly in the rankings depending on the strength of each episode. When a series has no episode for a given week, the previous week's episode is used instead as a placeholder. The first episode of each series is considered as part of the first week, even if it really streamed during the second week.

With the last episode duplicated in the ""final ep."" column, it means that the votes for the last episode of each series are counted twice, which intentionally gives a boost to series that ended strongly. This somewhat compensates for the fact that the first episode of each series has more votes, which favors series that started strongly.

Platinum End  13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 24          Notes  Disclaimer: the rankings are just an average of opinions, published for entertainment and information purposes. ANN makes no claims regarding statistical significance or invulnerability to spam.   The rankings are computed using the Schulze method, with the variation that unrated titles are considered as abstentions instead of lower than the rated titles. This roughly means that if, out of all people who rated both A and B, 60% preferred A, it will be ranked higher than B.   The rankings indicate relative quality (A is preferred to B), not absolute quality (B is good/bad). While the titles are ranked from 'best' to 'worst', sometimes the difference between #1 and #10 can be very thin. So if your favorite is near the bottom of the list, don't take it personally. It doesn't mean it's a bad show, it just means that ANN readers, on average, have preferred the ones above.   If a series has no episode for a given week, we use the rating data for the previous week's episode in order to compute the weekly ranking. This is not officially counted as a position in the ranking (it has no impact on the cumulative ranking), but it makes it easier to compare weeks if they each have the same number of series ranked.   It should be noted that long-running series (and sequels) have an advantage in the sense that only people who like the series are still watching it, and they are likely to give each episode a high rating. But if such a series is going through a low-quality filler arc, the season will get low rankings that are not indicative of the true overall quality of the series.     discuss this in the forum |        bookmark/share with:               Weekly Ranking homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature                The Best and Worst of Winter 2022   Apr  6, 10:10                 anime    With the last few episodes trailing into Spring like an April's fool, it's time to look at the final ranking of the Winter 2022 season.

The Best and Worst of Winter 2022   by Daniel DeLorme, Apr  6th 2022            Let's have a look at what ANN readers consider the best (and worst) of the season, based on the polls you can find in our Daily Streaming Reviews and on the Your Score page with the latest simulcasts.   Keep in mind that these rankings are based on how people rated individual episodes of the current season, not on the overall quality or popularity of the series. Only the titles legally streaming in North America and popular enough are being ranked, so the bottom of the list might represent 'watchable' rather than 'bad'. See the notes for further details.   For the last week we're comparing all the final episodes With the week of March 26-31, the Winter 2022 season is now over. But many of the series already ended the previous week, so we're adding an extra ""final"" week where all the last episodes are ranked against each other. With this we can see which series ended on a strong note and which ones ended more weakly. That means the ""final ep."" column is a repeat of the last episode from Mar 19-25 or Mar 26-31. And the ""prev week change"" is the difference in position between the ""final ep."" column and the penultimate episode.  The ranking doesn't include some episodes from the trailing end of the season streaming in April: Tokyo 24th Ward #12. For completeness' sake we'll update this ranking as the episodes are reviewed and rated in the coming days.   Episode Rankings for the final episodes Along the actual ranking for this week's episodes, this graph chronicles the change in position from week to week. While some series are stable, others swing wildly in the rankings depending on the strength of each episode. When a series has no episode for a given week, the previous week's episode is used instead as a placeholder. The first episode of each series is considered as part of the first week, even if it really streamed during the second week.

With the last episode duplicated in the ""final ep."" column, it means that the votes for the last episode of each series are counted twice, which intentionally gives a boost to series that ended strongly. This somewhat compensates for the fact that the first episode of each series has more votes, which favors series that started strongly.

Platinum End  13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 24          Notes  Disclaimer: the rankings are just an average of opinions, published for entertainment and information purposes. ANN makes no claims regarding statistical significance or invulnerability to spam.   The rankings are computed using the Schulze method, with the variation that unrated titles are considered as abstentions instead of lower than the rated titles. This roughly means that if, out of all people who rated both A and B, 60% preferred A, it will be ranked higher than B.   The rankings indicate relative quality (A is preferred to B), not absolute quality (B is good/bad). While the titles are ranked from 'best' to 'worst', sometimes the difference between #1 and #10 can be very thin. So if your favorite is near the bottom of the list, don't take it personally. It doesn't mean it's a bad show, it just means that ANN readers, on average, have preferred the ones above.   If a series has no episode for a given week, we use the rating data for the previous week's episode in order to compute the weekly ranking. This is not officially counted as a position in the ranking (it has no impact on the cumulative ranking), but it makes it easier to compare weeks if they each have the same number of series ranked.   It should be noted that long-running series (and sequels) have an advantage in the sense that only people who like the series are still watching it, and they are likely to give each episode a high rating. But if such a series is going through a low-quality filler arc, the season will get low rankings that are not indicative of the true overall quality of the series.     discuss this in the forum |        bookmark/share with:               Weekly Ranking homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature                The Best and Worst of Winter 2022   Apr  6, 10:10                 anime    With the last few episodes trailing into Spring like an April's fool, it's time to look at the final ranking of the Winter 2022 season.

The Best and Worst of Winter 2022   by Daniel DeLorme, Apr  6th 2022            Let's have a look at what ANN readers consider the best (and worst) of the season, based on the polls you can find in our Daily Streaming Reviews and on the Your Score page with the latest simulcasts.   Keep in mind that these rankings are based on how people rated individual episodes of the current season, not on the overall quality or popularity of the series. Only the titles legally streaming in North America and popular enough are being ranked, so the bottom of the list might represent 'watchable' rather than 'bad'. See the notes for further details.   For the last week we're comparing all the final episodes With the week of March 26-31, the Winter 2022 season is now over. But many of the series already ended the previous week, so we're adding an extra ""final"" week where all the last episodes are ranked against each other. With this we can see which series ended on a strong note and which ones ended more weakly. That means the ""final ep."" column is a repeat of the last episode from Mar 19-25 or Mar 26-31. And the ""prev week change"" is the difference in position between the ""final ep."" column and the penultimate episode.  The ranking doesn't include some episodes from the trailing end of the season streaming in April: Tokyo 24th Ward #12. For completeness' sake we'll update this ranking as the episodes are reviewed and rated in the coming days.   Episode Rankings for the final episodes Along the actual ranking for this week's episodes, this graph chronicles the change in position from week to week. While some series are stable, others swing wildly in the rankings depending on the strength of each episode. When a series has no episode for a given week, the previous week's episode is used instead as a placeholder. The first episode of each series is considered as part of the first week, even if it really streamed during the second week.

Platinum End  13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 24          Notes  Disclaimer: the rankings are just an average of opinions, published for entertainment and information purposes. ANN makes no claims regarding statistical significance or invulnerability to spam.   The rankings are computed using the Schulze method, with the variation that unrated titles are considered as abstentions instead of lower than the rated titles. This roughly means that if, out of all people who rated both A and B, 60% preferred A, it will be ranked higher than B.   The rankings indicate relative quality (A is preferred to B), not absolute quality (B is good/bad). While the titles are ranked from 'best' to 'worst', sometimes the difference between #1 and #10 can be very thin. So if your favorite is near the bottom of the list, don't take it personally. It doesn't mean it's a bad show, it just means that ANN readers, on average, have preferred the ones above.   If a series has no episode for a given week, we use the rating data for the previous week's episode in order to compute the weekly ranking. This is not officially counted as a position in the ranking (it has no impact on the cumulative ranking), but it makes it easier to compare weeks if they each have the same number of series ranked.   It should be noted that long-running series (and sequels) have an advantage in the sense that only people who like the series are still watching it, and they are likely to give each episode a high rating. But if such a series is going through a low-quality filler arc, the season will get low rankings that are not indicative of the true overall quality of the series.     discuss this in the forum |        bookmark/share with:               Weekly Ranking homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature                The Best and Worst of Winter 2022   Apr  6, 10:10                 anime    With the last few episodes trailing into Spring like an April's fool, it's time to look at the final ranking of the Winter 2022 season.

The Best and Worst of Winter 2022   by Daniel DeLorme, Apr  6th 2022            Let's have a look at what ANN readers consider the best (and worst) of the season, based on the polls you can find in our Daily Streaming Reviews and on the Your Score page with the latest simulcasts.   Keep in mind that these rankings are based on how people rated individual episodes of the current season, not on the overall quality or popularity of the series. Only the titles legally streaming in North America and popular enough are being ranked, so the bottom of the list might represent 'watchable' rather than 'bad'. See the notes for further details.   For the last week we're comparing all the final episodes With the week of March 26-31, the Winter 2022 season is now over. But many of the series already ended the previous week, so we're adding an extra ""final"" week where all the last episodes are ranked against each other. With this we can see which series ended on a strong note and which ones ended more weakly. That means the ""final ep."" column is a repeat of the last episode from Mar 19-25 or Mar 26-31. And the ""prev week change"" is the difference in position between the ""final ep."" column and the penultimate episode.  The ranking doesn't include some episodes from the trailing end of the season streaming in April: Tokyo 24th Ward #12. For completeness' sake we'll update this ranking as the episodes are reviewed and rated in the coming days.   Episode Rankings for the final episodes Along the actual ranking for this week's episodes, this graph chronicles the change in position from week to week. While some series are stable, others swing wildly in the rankings depending on the strength of each episode. When a series has no episode for a given week, the previous week's episode is used instead as a placeholder. The first episode of each series is considered as part of the first week, even if it really streamed during the second week.

ANN makes no claims regarding statistical significance or invulnerability to spam.   The rankings are computed using the Schulze method, with the variation that unrated titles are considered as abstentions instead of lower than the rated titles. This roughly means that if, out of all people who rated both A and B, 60% preferred A, it will be ranked higher than B.   The rankings indicate relative quality (A is preferred to B), not absolute quality (B is good/bad). While the titles are ranked from 'best' to 'worst', sometimes the difference between #1 and #10 can be very thin. So if your favorite is near the bottom of the list, don't take it personally. It doesn't mean it's a bad show, it just means that ANN readers, on average, have preferred the ones above.   If a series has no episode for a given week, we use the rating data for the previous week's episode in order to compute the weekly ranking. This is not officially counted as a position in the ranking (it has no impact on the cumulative ranking), but it makes it easier to compare weeks if they each have the same number of series ranked.   It should be noted that long-running series (and sequels) have an advantage in the sense that only people who like the series are still watching it, and they are likely to give each episode a high rating. But if such a series is going through a low-quality filler arc, the season will get low rankings that are not indicative of the true overall quality of the series.     discuss this in the forum |        bookmark/share with:               Weekly Ranking homepage / archives      ",positive,en,{}

Keep in mind that these rankings are based on how people rated individual episodes of the current season, not on the overall quality or popularity of the series. Only the titles legally streaming in North America and popular enough are being ranked, so the bottom of the list might represent 'watchable' rather than 'bad'. See the notes for further details.   For the last week we're comparing all the final episodes With the week of March 26-31, the Winter 2022 season is now over. But many of the series already ended the previous week, so we're adding an extra ""final"" week where all the last episodes are ranked against each other. With this we can see which series ended on a strong note and which ones ended more weakly. That means the ""final ep."" column is a repeat of the last episode from Mar 19-25 or Mar 26-31. And the ""prev week change"" is the difference in position between the ""final ep."" column and the penultimate episode.  The ranking doesn't include some episodes from the trailing end of the season streaming in April: Tokyo 24th Ward #12. For completeness' sake we'll update this ranking as the episodes are reviewed and rated in the coming days.   Episode Rankings for the final episodes Along the actual ranking for this week's episodes, this graph chronicles the change in position from week to week. While some series are stable, others swing wildly in the rankings depending on the strength of each episode. When a series has no episode for a given week, the previous week's episode is used instead as a placeholder. The first episode of each series is considered as part of the first week, even if it really streamed during the second week.

ANN makes no claims regarding statistical significance or invulnerability to spam.   The rankings are computed using the Schulze method, with the variation that unrated titles are considered as abstentions instead of lower than the rated titles. This roughly means that if, out of all people who rated both A and B, 60% preferred A, it will be ranked higher than B.   The rankings indicate relative quality (A is preferred to B), not absolute quality (B is good/bad). While the titles are ranked from 'best' to 'worst', sometimes the difference between #1 and #10 can be very thin. So if your favorite is near the bottom of the list, don't take it personally. It doesn't mean it's a bad show, it just means that ANN readers, on average, have preferred the ones above.   If a series has no episode for a given week, we use the rating data for the previous week's episode in order to compute the weekly ranking. This is not officially counted as a position in the ranking (it has no impact on the cumulative ranking), but it makes it easier to compare weeks if they each have the same number of series ranked.   It should be noted that long-running series (and sequels) have an advantage in the sense that only people who like the series are still watching it, and they are likely to give each episode a high rating. But if such a series is going through a low-quality filler arc, the season will get low rankings that are not indicative of the true overall quality of the series.     discuss this in the forum |        bookmark/share with:               Weekly Ranking homepage / archives    ",positive,en,{}

Keep in mind that these rankings are based on how people rated individual episodes of the current season, not on the overall quality or popularity of the series. Only the titles legally streaming in North America and popular enough are being ranked, so the bottom of the list might represent 'watchable' rather than 'bad'. See the notes for further details.   For the last week we're comparing all the final episodes With the week of March 26-31, the Winter 2022 season is now over. But many of the series already ended the previous week, so we're adding an extra ""final"" week where all the last episodes are ranked against each other. With this we can see which series ended on a strong note and which ones ended more weakly. That means the ""final ep."" column is a repeat of the last episode from Mar 19-25 or Mar 26-31. And the ""prev week change"" is the difference in position between the ""final ep."" column and the penultimate episode.  The ranking doesn't include some episodes from the trailing end of the season streaming in April: Tokyo 24th Ward #12. For completeness' sake we'll update this ranking as the episodes are reviewed and rated in the coming days.   Episode Rankings for the final episodes Along the actual ranking for this week's episodes, this graph chronicles the change in position from week to week. While some series are stable, others swing wildly in the rankings depending on the strength of each episode. When a series has no episode for a given week, the previous week's episode is used instead as a placeholder.

ANN makes no claims regarding statistical significance or invulnerability to spam.   The rankings are computed using the Schulze method, with the variation that unrated titles are considered as abstentions instead of lower than the rated titles. This roughly means that if, out of all people who rated both A and B, 60% preferred A, it will be ranked higher than B.   The rankings indicate relative quality (A is preferred to B), not absolute quality (B is good/bad). While the titles are ranked from 'best' to 'worst', sometimes the difference between #1 and #10 can be very thin. So if your favorite is near the bottom of the list, don't take it personally. It doesn't mean it's a bad show, it just means that ANN readers, on average, have preferred the ones above.   If a series has no episode for a given week, we use the rating data for the previous week's episode in order to compute the weekly ranking. This is not officially counted as a position in the ranking (it has no impact on the cumulative ranking), but it makes it easier to compare weeks if they each have the same number of series ranked.   It should be noted that long-running series (and sequels) have an advantage in the sense that only people who like the series are still watching it, and they are likely to give each episode a high rating. But if such a series is going through a low-quality filler arc, the season will get low rankings that are not indicative of the true overall quality of the series.   ",positive,en,{}
06-04-2022,anime,2,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/weekly-ranking/2022/winter/.182540,The Best and Worst of Winter 2022 - Anime News Network:SEA,"     Let's have a look at what ANN readers consider the best (and worst) of the season, based on the polls you can find in our Daily Streaming Reviews and on the Your Score page with the latest simulcasts.   Keep in mind that these rankings are based on how people rated individual episodes of the current season, not on the overall quality or popularity of the series. Only the titles legally streaming in North America and popular enough are being ranked, so the bottom of the list might represent 'watchable' rather than 'bad'. See the notes for further details.   For the last week we're comparing all the final episodes With the week of March 26-31, the Winter 2022 season is now over. But many of the series already ended the previous week, so we're adding an extra ""final"" week where all the last episodes are ranked against each other. With this we can see which series ended on a strong note and which ones ended more weakly. That means the ""final ep."" column is a repeat of the last episode from Mar 19-25 or Mar 26-31. And the ""prev week change"" is the difference in position between the ""final ep."" column and the penultimate episode.  The ranking doesn't include some episodes from the trailing end of the season streaming in April: Tokyo 24th Ward #12. For completeness' sake we'll update this ranking as the episodes are reviewed and rated in the coming days.   Episode Rankings for the final episodes Along the actual ranking for this week's episodes, this graph chronicles the change in position from week to week. While some series are stable, others swing wildly in the rankings depending on the strength of each episode. When a series has no episode for a given week, the previous week's episode is used instead as a placeholder. The first episode of each series is considered as part of the first week, even if it really streamed during the second week.

With the last episode duplicated in the ""final ep."" column, it means that the votes for the last episode of each series are counted twice, which intentionally gives a boost to series that ended strongly. This somewhat compensates for the fact that the first episode of each series has more votes, which favors series that started strongly.

Review:         Synopsis:        Not only is 24-year-old Koduka Chiyo wallowing in self-pity after quitting her job, she's also three months behind on her rent. Her 19-year-old landlady proposes an unusual solution: perform favors for her in exchange for the owed money – with the first being that the two sleep together. An arrangement is made where the landlord moves in with Chiyo to make the transfer of these “favors” easier but what is the true reason behind this young landlord's arrangement?     Review:            It's hard not to feel cautious about delving into a manga with such a premise. When a story about a blossoming romance between two characters starts with one of them very directly taking advantage of the other, it has to do a lot of legwork to dig itself out of that hole. Handle that poorly and readers may be left wondering why they should root for these characters by the second chapter. While I don't think that all of the legwork was achieved in this first volume, I was nevertheless surprised at just how subtle yet involved the series is in raising some rather realistic questions about non-heteronormative sexual orientations and how society views them.    A lot of this doesn't come from our main character Chiyo (though there is some bicuriosity starting to bloom there) but rather from the landlord that is placing her in this situation. Despite being younger, there is a clear power imbalance between the two characters and the manga very much treads the line of making sure that the situation doesn't come across as too malicious. A lot of the “favors” being requested range from the mundane to the surprisingly wholesome, and you do get a strong feeling that the landlord isn't going into this arrangement with sex as the primary goal. The manga goes out of its way to highlight that Chiyo's landlord is simply feeling very lonely and a lot of this is borne out of her desperation to fill the void. It is honestly rather refreshing to have a female character that is so blunt about only being into women, but what I found just as fascinating was the occasional snide comment about other sexualities and how people view her.    The manga does not spell out everything for the reader which I appreciate. You get the sense that this was written for an audience that is willing to look past the uncomfortable premise to see where the story actually goes, and what you'll discover beneath that facade is an account of the desperate lengths that people will go to find a connection in a society where their attractions are frowned upon, as well as what it's like to live through a world of microaggressions from people that probably didn't mean to be hurtful but still end up accomplishing just that. That said, I personally think that there are certain lines that should never be crossed regardless of circumstance, and this landlord crossed at least two of them throughout this first volume alone. But surprisingly, I didn't walk away thinking that she was a terrible person, but rather a lonely and misguided soul, which is an accomplishment given my trepidations about the material. If anything, I am interested in seeing where this story goes and if it can pull off the difficult task of having me fully buy into this developing relationship.    However, while I appreciate how the landlord's character is written as she is far and away the most interesting thing about this manga, I can't say the same about our actual named protagonist. She is very much the typical wide-eyed screw-up manga lead that is comedically incapable of taking care of herself despite being the oldest of the two. She definitely means well, and she is willing to step outside her comfort zone for the sake of making up for her own shortcomings, which is endearing. However, the jokes about her incompetence could get a little tiring towards the end. There's nothing necessarily wrong with her character; it's just that this first volume was a little lopsided in its characterization – the bulk of that very subtle character-building went to the landlord whereas Chiyo is clearly meant to counterbalance that as a source of levity. Still, I think that levity could have had more variety towards the end. There are hints towards the end that imply something deeper is beginning to develop – and I hope that goes somewhere – but aside from that, there's just not a lot to Chiyo in this first volume.    Repressed sexuality and sexual desire, non-heterosexual curiosity, societal commentary on different types of sexual orientation – I must admit, none of these are things I was expecting this manga to really touch upon when I originally picked it up to review. While it's impossible to resolve such heavy issues within a single 188-page volume, the fact that there is a clear setup for the story to explore them more deeply made me look at the volume in a more favorable light than I initially had. It is uncomfortable and as I alluded to before, ethical lines like consent or subtle manipulation are muddied more than I think the story really needed to. Unlike the larger societal issues, these more interpersonal dynamics are not treated with the seriousness they deserve, being accompanied by an overall lighter, almost comedic tone. Sometimes it's a nice blend, but mostly they feel incongruous with the at times cartoonish sense of humor the manga has.    This could also be a stylistic issue as the manga will occasionally use simplified character expressions for the sake of brevity. Things like Chiyo's rounded, airheaded expressions are nice and it's not like the art tries too hard to be cute or funny. However, similar to Chiyo's characterization, these don't have a lot of variety to them. That's not true for the whole manga as there are plenty of other instances where the paneling and character framing are being used in subtle ways to elevate the heavier moments. But whenever the style shifts away from that, it can sometimes get jarring and even disappointing to see engaging artwork being undercut by something more typical and repetitive. I hope the balance is improved in future columes.    All in all I Can't Believe I Slept With You! left me pleasantly surprised. It could be because my expectations weren't exactly positive going in, but I do think there are some genuine attempts at leveraging that initial discomfort to talk about some pretty relevant stuff. The mileage on whether or not those conversation starters are worth the shiftier implications of some of our characters' actions will vary from person to person. For me personally though, I think it's a step in the right direction and while I'm not sure if the story will fully redeem itself from the place where it starts, there is enough competency and thoughtfulness on display here that at the very least makes me believe there's a chance that might happen. Guess the manga is forcing me to check out the other volumes to see if my assumptions were right.             Grade:      Overall : B Story : B Art : B  + A morally questionable lead that's able to generate a surprising amount of sympathy, subtle yet relevant social commentary on sexuality and loneliness − Not much to Chiyo's character for most of the book, humor lacks variety and can clash with more serious moments            discuss this in the forum (2 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                  				Add this manga to 				               Production Info:        Story & Art: Miyako Miyahara   Full encyclopedia details aboutI Can't Believe I Slept With You!

There's nothing necessarily wrong with her character; it's just that this first volume was a little lopsided in its characterization – the bulk of that very subtle character-building went to the landlord whereas Chiyo is clearly meant to counterbalance that as a source of levity. Still, I think that levity could have had more variety towards the end. There are hints towards the end that imply something deeper is beginning to develop – and I hope that goes somewhere – but aside from that, there's just not a lot to Chiyo in this first volume.    Repressed sexuality and sexual desire, non-heterosexual curiosity, societal commentary on different types of sexual orientation – I must admit, none of these are things I was expecting this manga to really touch upon when I originally picked it up to review. While it's impossible to resolve such heavy issues within a single 188-page volume, the fact that there is a clear setup for the story to explore them more deeply made me look at the volume in a more favorable light than I initially had. It is uncomfortable and as I alluded to before, ethical lines like consent or subtle manipulation are muddied more than I think the story really needed to. Unlike the larger societal issues, these more interpersonal dynamics are not treated with the seriousness they deserve, being accompanied by an overall lighter, almost comedic tone. Sometimes it's a nice blend, but mostly they feel incongruous with the at times cartoonish sense of humor the manga has.    This could also be a stylistic issue as the manga will occasionally use simplified character expressions for the sake of brevity. Things like Chiyo's rounded, airheaded expressions are nice and it's not like the art tries too hard to be cute or funny. However, similar to Chiyo's characterization, these don't have a lot of variety to them. That's not true for the whole manga as there are plenty of other instances where the paneling and character framing are being used in subtle ways to elevate the heavier moments. But whenever the style shifts away from that, it can sometimes get jarring and even disappointing to see engaging artwork being undercut by something more typical and repetitive. I hope the balance is improved in future columes.    All in all I Can't Believe I Slept With You! left me pleasantly surprised. It could be because my expectations weren't exactly positive going in, but I do think there are some genuine attempts at leveraging that initial discomfort to talk about some pretty relevant stuff. The mileage on whether or not those conversation starters are worth the shiftier implications of some of our characters' actions will vary from person to person. For me personally though, I think it's a step in the right direction and while I'm not sure if the story will fully redeem itself from the place where it starts, there is enough competency and thoughtfulness on display here that at the very least makes me believe there's a chance that might happen. Guess the manga is forcing me to check out the other volumes to see if my assumptions were right.

GN 1                      Synopsis:             Not only is 24-year-old Koduka Chiyo wallowing in self-pity after quitting her job, she's also three months behind on her rent. Her 19-year-old landlady proposes an unusual solution: perform favors for her in exchange for the owed money – with the first being that the two sleep together. An arrangement is made where the landlord moves in with Chiyo to make the transfer of these “favors” easier but what is the true reason behind this young landlord's arrangement?      Review:         Synopsis:        Not only is 24-year-old Koduka Chiyo wallowing in self-pity after quitting her job, she's also three months behind on her rent. Her 19-year-old landlady proposes an unusual solution: perform favors for her in exchange for the owed money – with the first being that the two sleep together. An arrangement is made where the landlord moves in with Chiyo to make the transfer of these “favors” easier but what is the true reason behind this young landlord's arrangement?     Review:            It's hard not to feel cautious about delving into a manga with such a premise. When a story about a blossoming romance between two characters starts with one of them very directly taking advantage of the other, it has to do a lot of legwork to dig itself out of that hole. Handle that poorly and readers may be left wondering why they should root for these characters by the second chapter. While I don't think that all of the legwork was achieved in this first volume, I was nevertheless surprised at just how subtle yet involved the series is in raising some rather realistic questions about non-heteronormative sexual orientations and how society views them.    A lot of this doesn't come from our main character Chiyo (though there is some bicuriosity starting to bloom there) but rather from the landlord that is placing her in this situation. Despite being younger, there is a clear power imbalance between the two characters and the manga very much treads the line of making sure that the situation doesn't come across as too malicious. A lot of the “favors” being requested range from the mundane to the surprisingly wholesome, and you do get a strong feeling that the landlord isn't going into this arrangement with sex as the primary goal. The manga goes out of its way to highlight that Chiyo's landlord is simply feeling very lonely and a lot of this is borne out of her desperation to fill the void. It is honestly rather refreshing to have a female character that is so blunt about only being into women, but what I found just as fascinating was the occasional snide comment about other sexualities and how people view her.    The manga does not spell out everything for the reader which I appreciate. You get the sense that this was written for an audience that is willing to look past the uncomfortable premise to see where the story actually goes, and what you'll discover beneath that facade is an account of the desperate lengths that people will go to find a connection in a society where their attractions are frowned upon, as well as what it's like to live through a world of microaggressions from people that probably didn't mean to be hurtful but still end up accomplishing just that. That said, I personally think that there are certain lines that should never be crossed regardless of circumstance, and this landlord crossed at least two of them throughout this first volume alone. But surprisingly, I didn't walk away thinking that she was a terrible person, but rather a lonely and misguided soul, which is an accomplishment given my trepidations about the material. If anything, I am interested in seeing where this story goes and if it can pull off the difficult task of having me fully buy into this developing relationship.    However, while I appreciate how the landlord's character is written as she is far and away the most interesting thing about this manga, I can't say the same about our actual named protagonist. She is very much the typical wide-eyed screw-up manga lead that is comedically incapable of taking care of herself despite being the oldest of the two. She definitely means well, and she is willing to step outside her comfort zone for the sake of making up for her own shortcomings, which is endearing. However, the jokes about her incompetence could get a little tiring towards the end. There's nothing necessarily wrong with her character; it's just that this first volume was a little lopsided in its characterization – the bulk of that very subtle character-building went to the landlord whereas Chiyo is clearly meant to counterbalance that as a source of levity. Still, I think that levity could have had more variety towards the end.

Review:         Synopsis:        Not only is 24-year-old Koduka Chiyo wallowing in self-pity after quitting her job, she's also three months behind on her rent. Her 19-year-old landlady proposes an unusual solution: perform favors for her in exchange for the owed money – with the first being that the two sleep together. An arrangement is made where the landlord moves in with Chiyo to make the transfer of these “favors” easier but what is the true reason behind this young landlord's arrangement?     Review:            It's hard not to feel cautious about delving into a manga with such a premise. When a story about a blossoming romance between two characters starts with one of them very directly taking advantage of the other, it has to do a lot of legwork to dig itself out of that hole. Handle that poorly and readers may be left wondering why they should root for these characters by the second chapter. While I don't think that all of the legwork was achieved in this first volume, I was nevertheless surprised at just how subtle yet involved the series is in raising some rather realistic questions about non-heteronormative sexual orientations and how society views them.    A lot of this doesn't come from our main character Chiyo (though there is some bicuriosity starting to bloom there) but rather from the landlord that is placing her in this situation. Despite being younger, there is a clear power imbalance between the two characters and the manga very much treads the line of making sure that the situation doesn't come across as too malicious. A lot of the “favors” being requested range from the mundane to the surprisingly wholesome, and you do get a strong feeling that the landlord isn't going into this arrangement with sex as the primary goal. The manga goes out of its way to highlight that Chiyo's landlord is simply feeling very lonely and a lot of this is borne out of her desperation to fill the void. It is honestly rather refreshing to have a female character that is so blunt about only being into women, but what I found just as fascinating was the occasional snide comment about other sexualities and how people view her.    The manga does not spell out everything for the reader which I appreciate. You get the sense that this was written for an audience that is willing to look past the uncomfortable premise to see where the story actually goes, and what you'll discover beneath that facade is an account of the desperate lengths that people will go to find a connection in a society where their attractions are frowned upon, as well as what it's like to live through a world of microaggressions from people that probably didn't mean to be hurtful but still end up accomplishing just that. That said, I personally think that there are certain lines that should never be crossed regardless of circumstance, and this landlord crossed at least two of them throughout this first volume alone. But surprisingly, I didn't walk away thinking that she was a terrible person, but rather a lonely and misguided soul, which is an accomplishment given my trepidations about the material. If anything, I am interested in seeing where this story goes and if it can pull off the difficult task of having me fully buy into this developing relationship.    However, while I appreciate how the landlord's character is written as she is far and away the most interesting thing about this manga, I can't say the same about our actual named protagonist. She is very much the typical wide-eyed screw-up manga lead that is comedically incapable of taking care of herself despite being the oldest of the two. She definitely means well, and she is willing to step outside her comfort zone for the sake of making up for her own shortcomings, which is endearing. However, the jokes about her incompetence could get a little tiring towards the end. There's nothing necessarily wrong with her character; it's just that this first volume was a little lopsided in its characterization – the bulk of that very subtle character-building went to the landlord whereas Chiyo is clearly meant to counterbalance that as a source of levity. Still, I think that levity could have had more variety towards the end. There are hints towards the end that imply something deeper is beginning to develop – and I hope that goes somewhere – but aside from that, there's just not a lot to Chiyo in this first volume.    Repressed sexuality and sexual desire, non-heterosexual curiosity, societal commentary on different types of sexual orientation – I must admit, none of these are things I was expecting this manga to really touch upon when I originally picked it up to review. While it's impossible to resolve such heavy issues within a single 188-page volume, the fact that there is a clear setup for the story to explore them more deeply made me look at the volume in a more favorable light than I initially had. It is uncomfortable and as I alluded to before, ethical lines like consent or subtle manipulation are muddied more than I think the story really needed to. Unlike the larger societal issues, these more interpersonal dynamics are not treated with the seriousness they deserve, being accompanied by an overall lighter, almost comedic tone. Sometimes it's a nice blend, but mostly they feel incongruous with the at times cartoonish sense of humor the manga has.    This could also be a stylistic issue as the manga will occasionally use simplified character expressions for the sake of brevity. Things like Chiyo's rounded, airheaded expressions are nice and it's not like the art tries too hard to be cute or funny. However, similar to Chiyo's characterization, these don't have a lot of variety to them. That's not true for the whole manga as there are plenty of other instances where the paneling and character framing are being used in subtle ways to elevate the heavier moments. But whenever the style shifts away from that, it can sometimes get jarring and even disappointing to see engaging artwork being undercut by something more typical and repetitive. I hope the balance is improved in future columes.    All in all I Can't Believe I Slept With You! left me pleasantly surprised. It could be because my expectations weren't exactly positive going in, but I do think there are some genuine attempts at leveraging that initial discomfort to talk about some pretty relevant stuff. The mileage on whether or not those conversation starters are worth the shiftier implications of some of our characters' actions will vary from person to person. For me personally though, I think it's a step in the right direction and while I'm not sure if the story will fully redeem itself from the place where it starts, there is enough competency and thoughtfulness on display here that at the very least makes me believe there's a chance that might happen. Guess the manga is forcing me to check out the other volumes to see if my assumptions were right.             Grade:      Overall : B Story : B Art : B  + A morally questionable lead that's able to generate a surprising amount of sympathy, subtle yet relevant social commentary on sexuality and loneliness − Not much to Chiyo's character for most of the book, humor lacks variety and can clash with more serious moments            discuss this in the forum (2 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                  				Add this manga to 				               Production Info:        Story & Art: Miyako Miyahara   Full encyclopedia details aboutI Can't Believe I Slept With You!

Mizushima teased that the project, which is not a full anime, will feature stories that fill in gaps in-between the original anime's first and second seasons. The project will also unveil the secrets of the Double Drive, the missing link to the GN Drive. There will be new mobile suits for Setsuna, Lockon, and other characters.    Seiji Mizushima, the director of the previous Gundam 00 anime, is reuniting with staff for stories that were not told in the original anime. Returning staff include screenwriter Yosuke Kuroda, sci-fi writer Tomohiro Chiba, character designer Yun Kouga, musical director Masafumi Mami, and mechanical designers Kanetake Ebikawa and Takayuki Yanase. Sunrise is producing the anime.    Bandai Spiirts will release a figure of Gundam Devise Exia for its Metal Build series in October.

Bandai Entertainment dubbed both seasons of the anime, and aired the series in the United States on Sci Fi Channel's Ani-Monday programming block in 2008-2009. Right Stuf released the series on Blu-ray Disc and DVD in two parts in 2019. Bandai Entertainment previously released the first season of the anime on DVD in 2009 in three parts then as a complete set in 2012.

News Utano☆Princesama♪ Maji Love ST☆RISH Tours Film's Teaser Showcases Matching White Captain's Uniforms, Main Staff   posted on 2022-04-06 19:35 UTC-8 by Egan Loo          UtaPri: Maji Love Kingdom staff reunite for September 2 film    The staff for Gekijō-ban Utano☆Princesama♪ Maji Love ST☆RISH Tours, the upcoming film in the Utano☆Princesama franchise, posted the film's teaser trailer on Wednesday. The teaser showcases the film's ""live concert animation"" sequences, particularly one with the members in matching white captain's uniforms:        The teaser's description also lists more main staff member. Chika Nagaoka (Uta no Prince Sama Maji Love Kingdom, Detective Conan: The Fist of Blue Sapphire, Detective Conan: The Scarlet Bullet) is directing the anime, and Maki Fujioka (Uta no Prince Sama Maji Love Kingdom, ItaKiss, Wolf Girl & Black Prince) is adapting the original character designs from the franchise's Chinatsu Kurahana (Aquarion Evol, Samurai Flamenco).    Hiroshi Nakajima (Uta no Prince Sama Maji Love Kingdom, Uta no Prince Sama Maji Love Kingdom, Brotherhood: Final Fantasy XV) is directing the CG, and Takeshi Ohkawa is serving as sub-CG director (InuYasha the Movie 4: Fire on the Mystic Island). Katsuyoshi Miyajima (Uta no Prince Sama Maji Love Kingdom, AKB0048 next stage, Love Live! School idol project) is the character modeling director.     The film — described as part of a ""new theatrical film series"" — will be entirely composed of concert footage of the ST☆RISH idol group. Noriyasu Agematsu is once again credited as the original creator with Broccoli. Elements Garden is composing the music, and A-1 Pictures is producing the film. Shochiku is distributing the film.    The returning cast includes:     Takuma Terashima as Otoya Ittoki   Kenichi Suzumura as Masato Hijirikawa   Kishō Taniyama as Natsuki Shinomiya   Mamoru Miyano as Tokiya Ichinose   Junichi Suwabe as Ren Jingūji   Hiro Shimono as Shō Kurusu   Kousuke Toriumi as Cecil Aijima    The film will open in Japan on September 2.    The franchise will also have a one-hour television anime special that celebrates the 10th anniversary of the 2011 Uta no Prince-sama - Maji Love 1000% television anime, as well as the release of the film.    Uta no Prince-sama - Maji Love 1000%, the first anime season adapting Broccoli's dating simulation video game for female players, premiered in Japan in July 2011. In the first season of the slapstick romantic comedy, the female protagonist goes to a school for the performing arts with young men who are budding idols.

Sentai Filmworks, which licensed the previous four television anime seasons and the film, describes the film's story:   What's better than a concert by one of your favorite singing groups? A concert by three of your favorite singing groups, of course! That's what lucky fans get when three of the most popular vocal groups from the UTANO☆PRINCESAMA franchise all come together for a single epic motion picture performance. Have you got your tickets yet? If you have, come join ST*RISH, QUARTET NIGHT, and HE*VENS as they all take to the stage! It's an epic battle of the bands where there's no battle and everyone wins in Utano Princesama Maji LOVE Kingdom!

Titles with many votes will tend to be at the top, but this is modified a little by the ratings.

I literally saw crazy guy pay 20000 JPY for an HGUC Zeong. What a waste. Coming from experience,  building the kits is a huge time sink that you will never get back. Also the kits will be reprinted forever so in the long run, they will depreciate. other than 1 AU, all AUs pretty much die after the 50 episode runtime, so no matter how many kits you buy, the AU ain't getting a sequel anime series or movie.   You are better off getting anime figures since that actually helps animes get future seasons, not a time sink, and they appreciate in value. Plus you can avoid the cancerous Gundam fanbase.

Also the kits will be reprinted forever so in the long run, they will depreciate. other than 1 AU, all AUs pretty much die after the 50 episode runtime, so no matter how many kits you buy, the AU ain't getting a sequel anime series or movie.   You are better off getting anime figures since that actually helps animes get future seasons, not a time sink, and they appreciate in value. Plus you can avoid the cancerous Gundam fanbase.

Richard's battle with himself is in full swing, and I don't think that angel on his shoulder is gone for good.                    ep. review          31 comments       Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department ‒ Episode 9   Mar 15, 05:30 31 comments                 anime    The Monster Development Department gets meta as the the would-be villains suit up for the beach.                    ep. review          108 comments       86 Season 2 ‒ Episode 22   Mar 15, 04:30 108 comments                 anime    If anything, the 3-month gap between Episodes 21 and 22 has proven how much can be achieved with that extra time to think.                    ep. review          341 comments       My Dress-Up Darling ‒ Episode 10   Mar 15, 03:30 341 comments                 anime    If Kitagawa can understand Gojo's discomfort, I don't see why the rest of us can't do the same for others and I wish more people in the anime community take that into consideration.                    ep. review          101 comments       World's End Harem ‒ Episode 10   Mar 15, 02:30 101 comments                 anime    The UW's ultimate goal appears to be a world completely cleansed of the Y chromosome. I've been half-joking that the bad guys were evil feminists all along, but the show is tantalizingly close to making that its explicit reality.                    ep. review          27 comments       Teasing Master Takagi-san Season 3 ‒ Episode 10   Mar 15, 01:30 27 comments                 anime    This week's episode was great but it just didn't melt my heart into a puddle of pure syrup to be poured into a batter baked into a seven-layer “Dawwwwwwwwww” cake. There are much worse problems to have.                    ep. review          36 comments       Love of Kill ‒ Episode 9   Mar 15, 00:30 36 comments                 anime    The curtain to the show's prevailing mysteries are finally starting to be pulled back, and some of the revelations we get this episode are very intriguing.                    ep. review          45 comments       In the Land of Leadale ‒ Episode 10   Mar 14, 23:30 45 comments                 anime    Cayna's characterization in recent episodes have brought out the quirky, doting motherly side that I think Leadale has always been trying to show but got lost in her unjustified anger-filled outbursts.                    ep. review          95 comments       Case Study of Vanitas Season 2 ‒ Episode 21   Mar 12, 03:30 95 comments                 anime    Louis' death affected more people than just him, and one other very, very specifically: Dominique, his sister.                    ep. review          177 comments       Ranking of Kings ‒ Episodes 20-21   Mar 12, 02:30 177 comments                 anime    I don't think it's an exaggeration to say this series, and this episode in particular, will serve as inspiration for years to come.                    ep. review          47 comments       Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest Season 2 ‒ Episode 9   Mar 12, 01:30 47 comments                 anime    It's time for another action-centric episode of Arifureta. Say what you want, but this is where the story really gets to show off.                    ep. review          107 comments       Platinum End ‒ Episode 22   Mar 12, 00:30 107 comments                 anime    Yoneda and his interminably stupid Genius Atheist shtick has sucked up every molecule of oxygen in this show since he first opened his mouth.                    ep. review          19 comments       Tribe Nine ‒ Episode 9   Mar 11, 03:30 19 comments                 anime    The show finally digs into something really, really cool: Ojiro and Kazuki's backstory, which was thuddingly hinted at in the final moments of episode 8.                    ep. review          14 comments       Tokyo 24th Ward ‒ Episode 9   Mar 11, 02:30 14 comments                 anime    Where the present-day story of Tokyo 24th Ward has been about extreme expressions of socio-politics informed by technology, this flashback sees the characters more directly grappling with tech's impact on that society.                    ep. review          89 comments       The Genius Prince's Guide to Raising a Nation Out of Debt ‒ Episode 9   Mar 10, 02:30 89 comments                 anime    Wein is, by design, an overpowering presence in the story. He is smarter and more skilled than everyone else. However, that's not to say he doesn't have weaknesses.                    ep. review          51 comments       Sabikui Bisco ‒ Episode 9   Mar 10, 01:31 51 comments                 anime    Sometimes, when putting a story together, you just want to riff on the final act of Terminator 2, and that's valid. Sabikui Bisco certainly wears its influences on its sleeve as it catapults into yet another climax.                    ep. review          48 comments       Life with an Ordinary Guy Who Reincarnated into a Total Fantasy Knockout ‒ Episodes 8-9   Mar 10, 00:30 48 comments                 anime    While there are a few funny moments or chuckle-worthy faces hidden in there, the first half of the episode is just one big joke about how Shen is totally trying to assault Jinguuji, and it's a rough sit.                    ep. review          58 comments       Sasaki and Miyano ‒ Episode 9   Mar  9, 05:30 58 comments                 anime    What started off as largely obligation has become a chance for Miyano to explore his own anxieties about his appearance in a relatively safe – yet still public – situation.                    ep. review          76 comments       Princess Connect! Re:Dive Season 2 ‒ Episode 9   Mar  9, 04:30 76 comments                 anime    This is the point of no return for Karyl. Up until now, she has been able to play both sides to an extent.                    ep. review          341 comments       My Dress-Up Darling ‒ Episode 9   Mar  9, 03:30 341 comments                 anime    I love how this episode explores cosplaying on a budget from repurposing everyday clothing to finding solutions to costume malfunctions.                    ep. review          621 comments       One Piece ‒ Episode 1013   Mar  9, 01:30 621 comments                 anime    While the episode has a brief recap of Sanji's literal thirst trap scenario and Jinbei's soon-to-be-epic showdown, the real meat is in the Yamato and Ace interactions.                    ep. review          81 comments       Akebi's Sailor Uniform ‒ Episode 9   Mar  8, 23:30 81 comments                 anime    For anyone that has lived in Japan, this episode conjures up a certain nostalgia for roaming department stores and munching on food court karaage.                    ep. review          142 comments       How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom Part 2 ‒ Episode 9   Mar  8, 22:30 142 comments                 anime    Any time a work deals with the topic of slavery, you know it's entering into touchy territory. Given that we're also talking about an isekai with harem elements, I was basically in full Brace For Impact mode when this episode started.                    ep. review          168 comments       Attack on Titan The Final Season Part 2 ‒ Episode 84   Mar  8, 09:30 168 comments                 anime    Jean's betrayal of Floch and the Jeagerists doesn't just make for a convenient way to get the different characters in one place; it is a culmination of his entire character arc.                    ep. review          18 comments       Slow Loop ‒ Episode 9   Mar  8, 08:30 18 comments                 anime    The series continues to be incredibly charming, and reminds me that sometimes, slowing down and enjoying the ebb and flow of life – and maybe having some good fish – is the way to go.                    ep. review          42 comments       Requiem of the Rose King ‒ Episode 9   Mar  8, 07:30 42 comments                 anime    Richard tries to make a sacrifice to prevent familial slaughter but it may not be enough to circumvent this slow-motion tragedy.                    ep. review          101 comments       World's End Harem ‒ Episode 9   Mar  8, 06:30 101 comments                 anime    No, the site didn't glitch out on you. That thumbnail is an actual screencap from World’s End Harem, and it's far from the worst example I could have chosen.                    ep. review          40 comments       Delicious Party Precure ‒ Episode 5   Mar  8, 05:30 40 comments                 anime    This week's episode focuses on the team member's feelings, whether its shyness or overall feeling out of place.                    ep. review          27 comments       Teasing Master Takagi-san Season 3 ‒ Episode 9   Mar  8, 04:30 27 comments                 anime    I can't remember the last time that Christmas actually felt like Christmas. Then, all of a sudden, here comes Teasing Master Takagi-san, hell-bent on getting my grinchy ol' heart to grow three sizes in the middle of freaking March.                    ep. review          31 comments       Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department ‒ Episode 8   Mar  8, 03:30 31 comments                 anime    I'm thoroughly convinced it's Megistus who is the secret sauce. The dude is basically the walking embodiment of a single great joke, that of a villainous commander actually being an excellent, caring boss.                    ep. review          36 comments       Love of Kill ‒ Episode 8   Mar  8, 02:30 36 comments                 anime    We've got another death fake-out this week, but this one felt inexcusably lazy.                    ep. review          45 comments       In the Land of Leadale ‒ Episode 9   Mar  8, 01:30 45 comments                 anime    I've been pretty harsh on In the Land of Leadale for the majority of its run, and a lot of that comes down to the show's identity crisis. Leadale can't seem to decide if it wants to be a compelling mystery or just a really basic escapist power fantasy                    ep. review          19 comments       Tribe Nine ‒ Episode 8   Mar  8, 00:30 19 comments                 anime    I swear, “Let the Chaos Begin” (the title of episode 8) is exactly what I muttered as I opened the Funimation tab to stream this episode of Tribe Nine, a show full of Danganronpa expy characters that's quickly lost a lot of its flavor.                    ep. review          95 comments       Case Study of Vanitas Season 2 ‒ Episode 20   Mar  5, 03:30 95 comments                 anime    There may be more than one person's time being measured by Vanitas' dwindling hourglass, and human or vampire, not every body part can be reattached with some bandages and a sling.                    ep. review          47 comments       Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest Season 2 ‒ Episode 8   Mar  5, 02:30 47 comments                 anime    Arifureta's plot marches forward at breakneck speed...can't things chill a little?                    ep. review          107 comments       Platinum End ‒ Episode 21   Mar  5, 01:30 107 comments                 anime    Some moments are crucial to understanding a work, and viewers just aren't getting the full Platinum End experience if they don't see Yuri's totally unhinged, unprompted rant about why it's OK for her to not like gay people.                    ep. review          14 comments       Tokyo 24th Ward ‒ Episode 8   Mar  4, 01:30 14 comments                 anime    In the midst of this near-comical deployment of what it thinks commentary is, I'll give Tokyo 24th Ward this: You can tell that this is probably the episode they actually took that extra week off to work on.                    ep. review          89 comments       The Genius Prince's Guide to Raising a Nation Out of Debt ‒ Episode 8   Mar  3, 01:35 89 comments                 anime    Perhaps the most important thing this episode does is show us that Falanya is far from stupid. In fact, there is every possibility that she could grow up to be just as cunning as her brother.                    ep. review          51 comments       Sabikui Bisco ‒ Episode 8   Mar  2, 05:30 51 comments                 anime    Mushroom Mafioso Kurokawa takes center stage in this knuckle-whitening weekly dose of Sabikui Bisco.

I've been half-joking that the bad guys were evil feminists all along, but the show is tantalizingly close to making that its explicit reality.                    ep. review          27 comments       Teasing Master Takagi-san Season 3 ‒ Episode 10   Mar 15, 01:30 27 comments                 anime    This week's episode was great but it just didn't melt my heart into a puddle of pure syrup to be poured into a batter baked into a seven-layer “Dawwwwwwwwww” cake. There are much worse problems to have.                    ep. review          36 comments       Love of Kill ‒ Episode 9   Mar 15, 00:30 36 comments                 anime    The curtain to the show's prevailing mysteries are finally starting to be pulled back, and some of the revelations we get this episode are very intriguing.                    ep. review          45 comments       In the Land of Leadale ‒ Episode 10   Mar 14, 23:30 45 comments                 anime    Cayna's characterization in recent episodes have brought out the quirky, doting motherly side that I think Leadale has always been trying to show but got lost in her unjustified anger-filled outbursts.                    ep. review          95 comments       Case Study of Vanitas Season 2 ‒ Episode 21   Mar 12, 03:30 95 comments                 anime    Louis' death affected more people than just him, and one other very, very specifically: Dominique, his sister.                    ep. review          177 comments       Ranking of Kings ‒ Episodes 20-21   Mar 12, 02:30 177 comments                 anime    I don't think it's an exaggeration to say this series, and this episode in particular, will serve as inspiration for years to come.                    ep. review          47 comments       Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest Season 2 ‒ Episode 9   Mar 12, 01:30 47 comments                 anime    It's time for another action-centric episode of Arifureta. Say what you want, but this is where the story really gets to show off.                    ep. review          107 comments       Platinum End ‒ Episode 22   Mar 12, 00:30 107 comments                 anime    Yoneda and his interminably stupid Genius Atheist shtick has sucked up every molecule of oxygen in this show since he first opened his mouth.                    ep. review          19 comments       Tribe Nine ‒ Episode 9   Mar 11, 03:30 19 comments                 anime    The show finally digs into something really, really cool: Ojiro and Kazuki's backstory, which was thuddingly hinted at in the final moments of episode 8.                    ep. review          14 comments       Tokyo 24th Ward ‒ Episode 9   Mar 11, 02:30 14 comments                 anime    Where the present-day story of Tokyo 24th Ward has been about extreme expressions of socio-politics informed by technology, this flashback sees the characters more directly grappling with tech's impact on that society.                    ep. review          89 comments       The Genius Prince's Guide to Raising a Nation Out of Debt ‒ Episode 9   Mar 10, 02:30 89 comments                 anime    Wein is, by design, an overpowering presence in the story. He is smarter and more skilled than everyone else. However, that's not to say he doesn't have weaknesses.                    ep. review          51 comments       Sabikui Bisco ‒ Episode 9   Mar 10, 01:31 51 comments                 anime    Sometimes, when putting a story together, you just want to riff on the final act of Terminator 2, and that's valid. Sabikui Bisco certainly wears its influences on its sleeve as it catapults into yet another climax.                    ep. review          48 comments       Life with an Ordinary Guy Who Reincarnated into a Total Fantasy Knockout ‒ Episodes 8-9   Mar 10, 00:30 48 comments                 anime    While there are a few funny moments or chuckle-worthy faces hidden in there, the first half of the episode is just one big joke about how Shen is totally trying to assault Jinguuji, and it's a rough sit.                    ep. review          58 comments       Sasaki and Miyano ‒ Episode 9   Mar  9, 05:30 58 comments                 anime    What started off as largely obligation has become a chance for Miyano to explore his own anxieties about his appearance in a relatively safe – yet still public – situation.                    ep. review          76 comments       Princess Connect! Re:Dive Season 2 ‒ Episode 9   Mar  9, 04:30 76 comments                 anime    This is the point of no return for Karyl. Up until now, she has been able to play both sides to an extent.                    ep. review          341 comments       My Dress-Up Darling ‒ Episode 9   Mar  9, 03:30 341 comments                 anime    I love how this episode explores cosplaying on a budget from repurposing everyday clothing to finding solutions to costume malfunctions.                    ep. review          621 comments       One Piece ‒ Episode 1013   Mar  9, 01:30 621 comments                 anime    While the episode has a brief recap of Sanji's literal thirst trap scenario and Jinbei's soon-to-be-epic showdown, the real meat is in the Yamato and Ace interactions.                    ep. review          81 comments       Akebi's Sailor Uniform ‒ Episode 9   Mar  8, 23:30 81 comments                 anime    For anyone that has lived in Japan, this episode conjures up a certain nostalgia for roaming department stores and munching on food court karaage.                    ep. review          142 comments       How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom Part 2 ‒ Episode 9   Mar  8, 22:30 142 comments                 anime    Any time a work deals with the topic of slavery, you know it's entering into touchy territory. Given that we're also talking about an isekai with harem elements, I was basically in full Brace For Impact mode when this episode started.                    ep. review          168 comments       Attack on Titan The Final Season Part 2 ‒ Episode 84   Mar  8, 09:30 168 comments                 anime    Jean's betrayal of Floch and the Jeagerists doesn't just make for a convenient way to get the different characters in one place; it is a culmination of his entire character arc.                    ep. review          18 comments       Slow Loop ‒ Episode 9   Mar  8, 08:30 18 comments                 anime    The series continues to be incredibly charming, and reminds me that sometimes, slowing down and enjoying the ebb and flow of life – and maybe having some good fish – is the way to go.                    ep. review          42 comments       Requiem of the Rose King ‒ Episode 9   Mar  8, 07:30 42 comments                 anime    Richard tries to make a sacrifice to prevent familial slaughter but it may not be enough to circumvent this slow-motion tragedy.                    ep. review          101 comments       World's End Harem ‒ Episode 9   Mar  8, 06:30 101 comments                 anime    No, the site didn't glitch out on you. That thumbnail is an actual screencap from World’s End Harem, and it's far from the worst example I could have chosen.                    ep. review          40 comments       Delicious Party Precure ‒ Episode 5   Mar  8, 05:30 40 comments                 anime    This week's episode focuses on the team member's feelings, whether its shyness or overall feeling out of place.                    ep. review          27 comments       Teasing Master Takagi-san Season 3 ‒ Episode 9   Mar  8, 04:30 27 comments                 anime    I can't remember the last time that Christmas actually felt like Christmas. Then, all of a sudden, here comes Teasing Master Takagi-san, hell-bent on getting my grinchy ol' heart to grow three sizes in the middle of freaking March.                    ep. review          31 comments       Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department ‒ Episode 8   Mar  8, 03:30 31 comments                 anime    I'm thoroughly convinced it's Megistus who is the secret sauce. The dude is basically the walking embodiment of a single great joke, that of a villainous commander actually being an excellent, caring boss.                    ep. review          36 comments       Love of Kill ‒ Episode 8   Mar  8, 02:30 36 comments                 anime    We've got another death fake-out this week, but this one felt inexcusably lazy.                    ep. review          45 comments       In the Land of Leadale ‒ Episode 9   Mar  8, 01:30 45 comments                 anime    I've been pretty harsh on In the Land of Leadale for the majority of its run, and a lot of that comes down to the show's identity crisis. Leadale can't seem to decide if it wants to be a compelling mystery or just a really basic escapist power fantasy                    ep. review          19 comments       Tribe Nine ‒ Episode 8   Mar  8, 00:30 19 comments                 anime    I swear, “Let the Chaos Begin” (the title of episode 8) is exactly what I muttered as I opened the Funimation tab to stream this episode of Tribe Nine, a show full of Danganronpa expy characters that's quickly lost a lot of its flavor.                    ep. review          95 comments       Case Study of Vanitas Season 2 ‒ Episode 20   Mar  5, 03:30 95 comments                 anime    There may be more than one person's time being measured by Vanitas' dwindling hourglass, and human or vampire, not every body part can be reattached with some bandages and a sling.                    ep. review          47 comments       Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest Season 2 ‒ Episode 8   Mar  5, 02:30 47 comments                 anime    Arifureta's plot marches forward at breakneck speed...can't things chill a little?                    ep. review          107 comments       Platinum End ‒ Episode 21   Mar  5, 01:30 107 comments                 anime    Some moments are crucial to understanding a work, and viewers just aren't getting the full Platinum End experience if they don't see Yuri's totally unhinged, unprompted rant about why it's OK for her to not like gay people.                    ep. review          14 comments       Tokyo 24th Ward ‒ Episode 8   Mar  4, 01:30 14 comments                 anime    In the midst of this near-comical deployment of what it thinks commentary is, I'll give Tokyo 24th Ward this: You can tell that this is probably the episode they actually took that extra week off to work on.                    ep. review          89 comments       The Genius Prince's Guide to Raising a Nation Out of Debt ‒ Episode 8   Mar  3, 01:35 89 comments                 anime    Perhaps the most important thing this episode does is show us that Falanya is far from stupid. In fact, there is every possibility that she could grow up to be just as cunning as her brother.                    ep. review          51 comments       Sabikui Bisco ‒ Episode 8   Mar  2, 05:30 51 comments                 anime    Mushroom Mafioso Kurokawa takes center stage in this knuckle-whitening weekly dose of Sabikui Bisco.

He is smarter and more skilled than everyone else.

Sabikui Bisco certainly wears its influences on its sleeve as it catapults into yet another climax.                    ep. review          48 comments       Life with an Ordinary Guy Who Reincarnated into a Total Fantasy Knockout ‒ Episodes 8-9   Mar 10, 00:30 48 comments                 anime    While there are a few funny moments or chuckle-worthy faces hidden in there, the first half of the episode is just one big joke about how Shen is totally trying to assault Jinguuji, and it's a rough sit.                    ep. review          58 comments       Sasaki and Miyano ‒ Episode 9   Mar  9, 05:30 58 comments                 anime    What started off as largely obligation has become a chance for Miyano to explore his own anxieties about his appearance in a relatively safe – yet still public – situation.                    ep. review          76 comments       Princess Connect!

Leadale can't seem to decide if it wants to be a compelling mystery or just a really basic escapist power fantasy                    ep. review          19 comments       Tribe Nine ‒ Episode 8   Mar  8, 00:30 19 comments                 anime    I swear, “Let the Chaos Begin” (the title of episode 8) is exactly what I muttered as I opened the Funimation tab to stream this episode of Tribe Nine, a show full of Danganronpa expy characters that's quickly lost a lot of its flavor.                    ep. review          95 comments       Case Study of Vanitas Season 2 ‒ Episode 20   Mar  5, 03:30 95 comments                 anime    There may be more than one person's time being measured by Vanitas' dwindling hourglass, and human or vampire, not every body part can be reattached with some bandages and a sling.                    ep. review          47 comments       Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest Season 2 ‒ Episode 8   Mar  5, 02:30 47 comments                 anime    Arifureta's plot marches forward at breakneck speed...can't things chill a little?                    ep. review          107 comments       Platinum End ‒ Episode 21   Mar  5, 01:30 107 comments                 anime    Some moments are crucial to understanding a work, and viewers just aren't getting the full Platinum End experience if they don't see Yuri's totally unhinged, unprompted rant about why it's OK for her to not like gay people.                    ep. review          14 comments       Tokyo 24th Ward ‒ Episode 8   Mar  4, 01:30 14 comments                 anime    In the midst of this near-comical deployment of what it thinks commentary is, I'll give Tokyo 24th Ward this: You can tell that this is probably the episode they actually took that extra week off to work on.                    ep. review          89 comments       The Genius Prince's Guide to Raising a Nation Out of Debt ‒ Episode 8   Mar  3, 01:35 89 comments                 anime    Perhaps the most important thing this episode does is show us that Falanya is far from stupid. In fact, there is every possibility that she could grow up to be just as cunning as her brother.                    ep. review          51 comments       Sabikui Bisco ‒ Episode 8   Mar  2, 05:30 51 comments                 anime    Mushroom Mafioso Kurokawa takes center stage in this knuckle-whitening weekly dose of Sabikui Bisco.

How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom Part 2 ‒ SEASON FINALE I'm curious how well-received this ending is on the whole as I think it addresses a lot of my issues with the series, but departs from prior episodes in so many ways that it feels like something else entirely.  « »     Episode Review        — Archives —                  Filters          All Southeast Asia  •  Anime Manga Novels Games Music Merch Events Industry People Live-Action COVID-19           Text-only Compact View             Text-only List View             Text-only Grid View             List View with Images             Grid View with Images                               ep. review          168 comments       Attack on Titan The Final Season Part 2 ‒ SEASON FINALE   Apr  4, 23:30 168 comments                 anime    ""The Dawn of Humanity"" gives its characters one last chance to reflect before they pass the point of no return.

Then, all of a sudden, here comes Teasing Master Takagi-san, hell-bent on getting my grinchy ol' heart to grow three sizes in the middle of freaking March.                    ep. review          31 comments       Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department ‒ Episode 8   Mar  8, 03:30 31 comments                 anime    I'm thoroughly convinced it's Megistus who is the secret sauce.

Leadale can't seem to decide if it wants to be a compelling mystery or just a really basic escapist power fantasy                    ep. review          19 comments       Tribe Nine ‒ Episode 8   Mar  8, 00:30 19 comments                 anime    I swear, “Let the Chaos Begin” (the title of episode 8) is exactly what I muttered as I opened the Funimation tab to stream this episode of Tribe Nine, a show full of Danganronpa expy characters that's quickly lost a lot of its flavor.                    ep. review          95 comments       Case Study of Vanitas Season 2 ‒ Episode 20   Mar  5, 03:30 95 comments                 anime    There may be more than one person's time being measured by Vanitas' dwindling hourglass, and human or vampire, not every body part can be reattached with some bandages and a sling.                    ep. review          47 comments       Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest Season 2 ‒ Episode 8   Mar  5, 02:30 47 comments                 anime    Arifureta's plot marches forward at breakneck speed...can't things chill a little?                    ep. review          107 comments       Platinum End ‒ Episode 21   Mar  5, 01:30 107 comments                 anime    Some moments are crucial to understanding a work, and viewers just aren't getting the full Platinum End experience if they don't see Yuri's totally unhinged, unprompted rant about why it's OK for her to not like gay people.                    ep. review          14 comments       Tokyo 24th Ward ‒ Episode 8   Mar  4, 01:30 14 comments                 anime    In the midst of this near-comical deployment of what it thinks commentary is, I'll give Tokyo 24th Ward this: You can tell that this is probably the episode they actually took that extra week off to work on.                    ep. review          89 comments       The Genius Prince's Guide to Raising a Nation Out of Debt ‒ Episode 8   Mar  3, 01:35 89 comments                 anime    Perhaps the most important thing this episode does is show us that Falanya is far from stupid. In fact, there is every possibility that she could grow up to be just as cunning as her brother.                    ep. review          51 comments       Sabikui Bisco ‒ Episode 8   Mar  2, 05:30 51 comments                 anime    Mushroom Mafioso Kurokawa takes center stage in this knuckle-whitening weekly dose of Sabikui Bisco.

News Brigandine: The Legend of Runersia  Game Gets Steam Release on May 11   posted on 2022-04-05 09:00 UTC-8 by Crystalyn Hodgkins         Game released on Switch, PS4 in 2020    Happinet announced on Monday that it and Matrix Software's Brigandine: The Legend of Runersia game will release worldwide for Steam on May 11. The new version includes a ""Creative Mode"" that unlocks after completing the game's Main Mode. In Creative Mode, players ""can pick their preferred power balance and starting knights and play at leisure without a time limit.""      The game launched digitally for the Switch in June 2020, and then launched for PlayStation 4 in December 2020.    Happinet describes the game:    In Brigandine: The Legend of Runersia, six countries in the Continent of Runersia have waged a war to conquer and unify the land under one nation. Players decide how their legend will unfold by selecting a country and creating their army of Rune Knights, exploring over 40 base locations and encountering over 100 unique knights and 50 types of monsters as they progress across Runersia. The original Brigandine turn-based strategy game debuted for the PlayStation in 1998. Hearty Robin developed the game. Atlus published the game in the United States. The game's Brigandine: Grand Edition remake debuted in 2000 but was never released in English.   In the game, players select one of six nations and control their rune knight heroes and various monsters in turn-based battles to control the entire continent. The Grand Edition remake of the game added a multiplayer feature.

The original Brigandine turn-based strategy game debuted for the PlayStation in 1998. Hearty Robin developed the game. Atlus published the game in the United States. The game's Brigandine: Grand Edition remake debuted in 2000 but was never released in English.   In the game, players select one of six nations and control their rune knight heroes and various monsters in turn-based battles to control the entire continent. The Grand Edition remake of the game added a multiplayer feature.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Kotaro Lives Alone   Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Kotaro Lives Alone (ONA) ?                     Community score: 4.2              What is this?   The story centers on a 4-year-old boy named Kotarō Satо̄, who moves next door to Shin Karino, an unsuccessful manga artist. Kotarō has no parents and lives alone. Not only does he seem to earn a living, he actually seems more put together than his own strange neighbors.    Kotaro Lives Alone is based on Mami Tsumura's manga and streams on Netflix.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Because of my day job, I have a love-hate relationship with anime that feature young children. Write them well, and I'll gush over how the series really gets them; write them poorly or overly-precocious and it's difficult for me to suspend belief long enough to really get into the story. I'd heard good things about Kotaro Lives Alone, but I couldn't feel anything beyond the most cautious of optimism as I started up the first episode. I know four-year-olds, and it was hard to imagine a story where I could both believe a child is four and is capable of surviving on his own.    Somehow, miraculously, the first episode manages to strike that balance, painting a tragicomic picture of a young child who has been forced to grow up way too fast. Part of the reason it works is because of the way Kotaro wears certain affectations, such as copying the extremely formal and old-fashioned language from a samurai cartoon he likes, like a suit of armor as he imitates adult behavior. Moments like the brief shot of him reading a newspaper on the toilet – and Japanese newspapers have a lot of difficult kanji in them, at an age where a child is barely expected to read hiragana – with his little legs dangling speak volumes.    What Kotaro Lives Alone understands is that a four-year-old doesn't become this uncanny mix of adult and child from growing up in a healthy environment. Nothing has been explicitly stated so far, but there's a lot of little one-off lines that indicate that something in his former home life forced him to grow up way too early, and whatever happened, it was neither fun nor cute. There's a tragic undercurrent to every laugh, whether it's due to Kotaro or the hot messes that are the other adult tenants in his building, that keeps it from becoming cloying or too-sentimental. If anything, it's a bit too real of a reminder that children are denied their childhoods every day.       James Beckett  Rating:                I turned 30 this year, and the older I get, the happier I am to see domestic anime that focus on more “adult” issues. Despite the very peculiar and almost fantastical nature of its premise, Kotaro Lives Alone is right up my alley. Shin Karino is exactly the kind of protagonist that I'm interested in seeing more of these days: a real human person who deals with real everyday struggles. He's trying to rekindle his creative spark and salvage his career as a manga artist; he's got to deal with his colorful and bizarre neighbors; he even throws out his back just getting up from the table (it happens to the best of us, my man, don't sweat it). The only “weird” angle to Shin's life is that he's suddenly found himself involved in the day-to-day adventures of an incredibly precocious and eccentric four-year-old that apparently lives on his own.    This is the angle of the plot that I was unsure of, since unrealistically independent and intelligent tots are such a cliché for anime in general, but I like the way that Kotaro Lives Alone characterizes its titular tyke. The very childlike issues he goes through—figuring out how bathhouses work, successfully bandaging skinned knees, procuring a TV to watch his favorite cartoon—all contrast nicely with the jaded adults around him. Mizuki clearly has some drama in her personal life and work as a hostess, and even the outlandish Tamaru feels more grounded once you learn that he's having a hard time keeping his own family together. The jokey bits where Kotaro's “feudal lord” act clashes with his inherent immaturity could have come across as tacky or try-hard, but the show always manages to get the viewer to empathize with the boy's trials and tribulations as much as the grown-ups. Who among us hasn't also marched into a complete stranger's home just so they could tell you that you did a good job?    I only have one major complaint about Kotaro, but it's kind of a doozy: the show is pretty ugly. The art style is apparently going for this strange kind of abstraction that isn't quite Crayon Shin-chan, but all of the faces and bodies are just oddly proportioned and stretchy enough to look off-putting. It's a look that might appeal to some folks, but I just couldn't warm up to it no matter how hard I tried. Still, Kotaro Lives Alone was a very pleasant surprise, and if you can get past its rough presentation, you might come to love the kid just as much as his neighbors do.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Watching this episode, I couldn't decide whether I wanted to laugh or cry—and I suspect that's exactly what the creators were aiming for. After all, it's got a setup that is either inherently comedic or inherently tragic depending on the tone of the work. And let's be clear here, Kotaro Lives Alone works hard to walk the line right between them.    First, the comedic side of things. We have a four-year-old kid doing all the things a person living alone for the first time needs to do. 90% of the time, he does it just as well as any adult, which leads us to assume that this is his norm. The humor, therefore, comes from the unpredictable moments when he acts like the child he actually is, betraying our expectations in an obvious way. (This is exact same joke framework used for Stewie and Brian in Family Guy). It's an easy way to get a laugh, especially if you care for the character.    Then there's the tragic side of things. We have a kid, ostensibly with no parents, living alone in a rundown apartment building and surrounded by unscrupulous adults. Worse yet, he has a streetwise mindset that no child his age should have—such as knowing how to bring down the swelling from crying too much—which has some heartbreaking implications. Moreover, he clearly still wants to be loved: to have his hair washed by an adult and be praised for doing something on his own for the first time.    But the real hook of the show is that everyone in that apartment building is just as alone as Kotaro is. We have a manga artist who is struggling to live up to his breakout hit; a hostess who escapes her financially abusive boyfriend by getting drunk; and a low-level mobster who isn't allowed to meet his son anymore. Despite their circumstances, this group of broken people has a chance to become something by stepping up and becoming the family Kotaro so desperately needs. It's a show that plays with your emotions in the best way—and one I will most certainly be watching to the end.      Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                Is it weird to say the thing this premiere most reminded me of was Garfield fancomics? Not like, the body-horror ones that go viral on Twitter every once in a while, but the more grounded and dramatic ones that try to apply a sense of emotional realism to the static, archetypal characters of the eternal comic strip. Because the premise of this one – an eccentric kid named Kotaro Lives Alone in a low-rent apartment block and gets into low stakes adventures with his adult neighbors – feels like something you could find running for 20 years in a newspaper comic. That is, until it starts slipping in darker punchlines with much more serious implications.    It's an odd balance to strike, and not one this first episode totally manages to keep. There are long stretches of this episode that are just a couple of jokes being repeated and iterated upon without much escalation or change. Likewise, the initial shock of the implications about Kotaro's life before he wound up a Pre-K lease-holder wears off fairly quickly, and once those hints keep piling up it becomes decidedly harder to chuckle at him strutting around town with his plastic samurai sword. There's definitely a version of this setup that can work – be great even – but as of this premiere it doesn't feel like they've figured out the right formula.    Like sure, there are a handful of moments that are funny, or charming, or bittersweet, but they stand as isolated incidents that don't coalesce quite right. And since they don't properly gel, it winds up feeling like each fraction of what this show's going for is struggling for attention. Are you enjoying this silly segment of Kotaro being pestered by a bird? Well that's over so we can have him learn about his neighbor's failed marriage and struggle for visitation rights with his young son. Are you feeling compelled by Kotaro slowly letting his neighbor in, and perhaps accidentally admitting to his own loneliness? Try to hold onto that feeling while he and Kotaro walk around the supermarket and the guy freaks out over the thought of having an unknown baby of his own.    The upside is the entire series is already up on Netflix, so it's not much of a wait to see if things start to mesh better moving forward. And there is something genuinely engaging to this material – if nothing else Kotaro's striking eyes and bizarre speech patterns kept my attention through the entire first episode. So hopefully this can congeal into the best form of itself, because there's definitely potential here.     discuss this in the forum (108 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature                The Best and Worst of Winter 2022   Apr  6, 10:10                 anime    With the last few episodes trailing into Spring like an April's fool, it's time to look at the final ranking of the Winter 2022 season.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Kotaro Lives Alone   Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Kotaro Lives Alone (ONA) ?                     Community score: 4.2              What is this?   The story centers on a 4-year-old boy named Kotarō Satо̄, who moves next door to Shin Karino, an unsuccessful manga artist. Kotarō has no parents and lives alone. Not only does he seem to earn a living, he actually seems more put together than his own strange neighbors.    Kotaro Lives Alone is based on Mami Tsumura's manga and streams on Netflix.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Because of my day job, I have a love-hate relationship with anime that feature young children. Write them well, and I'll gush over how the series really gets them; write them poorly or overly-precocious and it's difficult for me to suspend belief long enough to really get into the story. I'd heard good things about Kotaro Lives Alone, but I couldn't feel anything beyond the most cautious of optimism as I started up the first episode. I know four-year-olds, and it was hard to imagine a story where I could both believe a child is four and is capable of surviving on his own.    Somehow, miraculously, the first episode manages to strike that balance, painting a tragicomic picture of a young child who has been forced to grow up way too fast. Part of the reason it works is because of the way Kotaro wears certain affectations, such as copying the extremely formal and old-fashioned language from a samurai cartoon he likes, like a suit of armor as he imitates adult behavior. Moments like the brief shot of him reading a newspaper on the toilet – and Japanese newspapers have a lot of difficult kanji in them, at an age where a child is barely expected to read hiragana – with his little legs dangling speak volumes.    What Kotaro Lives Alone understands is that a four-year-old doesn't become this uncanny mix of adult and child from growing up in a healthy environment. Nothing has been explicitly stated so far, but there's a lot of little one-off lines that indicate that something in his former home life forced him to grow up way too early, and whatever happened, it was neither fun nor cute. There's a tragic undercurrent to every laugh, whether it's due to Kotaro or the hot messes that are the other adult tenants in his building, that keeps it from becoming cloying or too-sentimental. If anything, it's a bit too real of a reminder that children are denied their childhoods every day.       James Beckett  Rating:                I turned 30 this year, and the older I get, the happier I am to see domestic anime that focus on more “adult” issues. Despite the very peculiar and almost fantastical nature of its premise, Kotaro Lives Alone is right up my alley. Shin Karino is exactly the kind of protagonist that I'm interested in seeing more of these days: a real human person who deals with real everyday struggles. He's trying to rekindle his creative spark and salvage his career as a manga artist; he's got to deal with his colorful and bizarre neighbors; he even throws out his back just getting up from the table (it happens to the best of us, my man, don't sweat it). The only “weird” angle to Shin's life is that he's suddenly found himself involved in the day-to-day adventures of an incredibly precocious and eccentric four-year-old that apparently lives on his own.    This is the angle of the plot that I was unsure of, since unrealistically independent and intelligent tots are such a cliché for anime in general, but I like the way that Kotaro Lives Alone characterizes its titular tyke. The very childlike issues he goes through—figuring out how bathhouses work, successfully bandaging skinned knees, procuring a TV to watch his favorite cartoon—all contrast nicely with the jaded adults around him. Mizuki clearly has some drama in her personal life and work as a hostess, and even the outlandish Tamaru feels more grounded once you learn that he's having a hard time keeping his own family together. The jokey bits where Kotaro's “feudal lord” act clashes with his inherent immaturity could have come across as tacky or try-hard, but the show always manages to get the viewer to empathize with the boy's trials and tribulations as much as the grown-ups. Who among us hasn't also marched into a complete stranger's home just so they could tell you that you did a good job?    I only have one major complaint about Kotaro, but it's kind of a doozy: the show is pretty ugly. The art style is apparently going for this strange kind of abstraction that isn't quite Crayon Shin-chan, but all of the faces and bodies are just oddly proportioned and stretchy enough to look off-putting. It's a look that might appeal to some folks, but I just couldn't warm up to it no matter how hard I tried. Still, Kotaro Lives Alone was a very pleasant surprise, and if you can get past its rough presentation, you might come to love the kid just as much as his neighbors do.

Like sure, there are a handful of moments that are funny, or charming, or bittersweet, but they stand as isolated incidents that don't coalesce quite right. And since they don't properly gel, it winds up feeling like each fraction of what this show's going for is struggling for attention. Are you enjoying this silly segment of Kotaro being pestered by a bird? Well that's over so we can have him learn about his neighbor's failed marriage and struggle for visitation rights with his young son. Are you feeling compelled by Kotaro slowly letting his neighbor in, and perhaps accidentally admitting to his own loneliness? Try to hold onto that feeling while he and Kotaro walk around the supermarket and the guy freaks out over the thought of having an unknown baby of his own.    The upside is the entire series is already up on Netflix, so it's not much of a wait to see if things start to mesh better moving forward. And there is something genuinely engaging to this material – if nothing else Kotaro's striking eyes and bizarre speech patterns kept my attention through the entire first episode. So hopefully this can congeal into the best form of itself, because there's definitely potential here.     discuss this in the forum (108 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature                The Best and Worst of Winter 2022   Apr  6, 10:10                 anime    With the last few episodes trailing into Spring like an April's fool, it's time to look at the final ranking of the Winter 2022 season.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Kotaro Lives Alone   Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Kotaro Lives Alone (ONA) ?                     Community score: 4.2              What is this?   The story centers on a 4-year-old boy named Kotarō Satо̄, who moves next door to Shin Karino, an unsuccessful manga artist. Kotarō has no parents and lives alone. Not only does he seem to earn a living, he actually seems more put together than his own strange neighbors.    Kotaro Lives Alone is based on Mami Tsumura's manga and streams on Netflix.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Because of my day job, I have a love-hate relationship with anime that feature young children. Write them well, and I'll gush over how the series really gets them; write them poorly or overly-precocious and it's difficult for me to suspend belief long enough to really get into the story. I'd heard good things about Kotaro Lives Alone, but I couldn't feel anything beyond the most cautious of optimism as I started up the first episode. I know four-year-olds, and it was hard to imagine a story where I could both believe a child is four and is capable of surviving on his own.    Somehow, miraculously, the first episode manages to strike that balance, painting a tragicomic picture of a young child who has been forced to grow up way too fast. Part of the reason it works is because of the way Kotaro wears certain affectations, such as copying the extremely formal and old-fashioned language from a samurai cartoon he likes, like a suit of armor as he imitates adult behavior. Moments like the brief shot of him reading a newspaper on the toilet – and Japanese newspapers have a lot of difficult kanji in them, at an age where a child is barely expected to read hiragana – with his little legs dangling speak volumes.    What Kotaro Lives Alone understands is that a four-year-old doesn't become this uncanny mix of adult and child from growing up in a healthy environment. Nothing has been explicitly stated so far, but there's a lot of little one-off lines that indicate that something in his former home life forced him to grow up way too early, and whatever happened, it was neither fun nor cute. There's a tragic undercurrent to every laugh, whether it's due to Kotaro or the hot messes that are the other adult tenants in his building, that keeps it from becoming cloying or too-sentimental. If anything, it's a bit too real of a reminder that children are denied their childhoods every day.       James Beckett  Rating:                I turned 30 this year, and the older I get, the happier I am to see domestic anime that focus on more “adult” issues. Despite the very peculiar and almost fantastical nature of its premise, Kotaro Lives Alone is right up my alley. Shin Karino is exactly the kind of protagonist that I'm interested in seeing more of these days: a real human person who deals with real everyday struggles. He's trying to rekindle his creative spark and salvage his career as a manga artist; he's got to deal with his colorful and bizarre neighbors; he even throws out his back just getting up from the table (it happens to the best of us, my man, don't sweat it). The only “weird” angle to Shin's life is that he's suddenly found himself involved in the day-to-day adventures of an incredibly precocious and eccentric four-year-old that apparently lives on his own.    This is the angle of the plot that I was unsure of, since unrealistically independent and intelligent tots are such a cliché for anime in general, but I like the way that Kotaro Lives Alone characterizes its titular tyke. The very childlike issues he goes through—figuring out how bathhouses work, successfully bandaging skinned knees, procuring a TV to watch his favorite cartoon—all contrast nicely with the jaded adults around him. Mizuki clearly has some drama in her personal life and work as a hostess, and even the outlandish Tamaru feels more grounded once you learn that he's having a hard time keeping his own family together. The jokey bits where Kotaro's “feudal lord” act clashes with his inherent immaturity could have come across as tacky or try-hard, but the show always manages to get the viewer to empathize with the boy's trials and tribulations as much as the grown-ups. Who among us hasn't also marched into a complete stranger's home just so they could tell you that you did a good job?    I only have one major complaint about Kotaro, but it's kind of a doozy: the show is pretty ugly. The art style is apparently going for this strange kind of abstraction that isn't quite Crayon Shin-chan, but all of the faces and bodies are just oddly proportioned and stretchy enough to look off-putting. It's a look that might appeal to some folks, but I just couldn't warm up to it no matter how hard I tried. Still, Kotaro Lives Alone was a very pleasant surprise, and if you can get past its rough presentation, you might come to love the kid just as much as his neighbors do.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Watching this episode, I couldn't decide whether I wanted to laugh or cry—and I suspect that's exactly what the creators were aiming for. After all, it's got a setup that is either inherently comedic or inherently tragic depending on the tone of the work. And let's be clear here, Kotaro Lives Alone works hard to walk the line right between them.    First, the comedic side of things. We have a four-year-old kid doing all the things a person living alone for the first time needs to do. 90% of the time, he does it just as well as any adult, which leads us to assume that this is his norm. The humor, therefore, comes from the unpredictable moments when he acts like the child he actually is, betraying our expectations in an obvious way. (This is exact same joke framework used for Stewie and Brian in Family Guy). It's an easy way to get a laugh, especially if you care for the character.    Then there's the tragic side of things. We have a kid, ostensibly with no parents, living alone in a rundown apartment building and surrounded by unscrupulous adults. Worse yet, he has a streetwise mindset that no child his age should have—such as knowing how to bring down the swelling from crying too much—which has some heartbreaking implications. Moreover, he clearly still wants to be loved: to have his hair washed by an adult and be praised for doing something on his own for the first time.    But the real hook of the show is that everyone in that apartment building is just as alone as Kotaro is. We have a manga artist who is struggling to live up to his breakout hit; a hostess who escapes her financially abusive boyfriend by getting drunk; and a low-level mobster who isn't allowed to meet his son anymore. Despite their circumstances, this group of broken people has a chance to become something by stepping up and becoming the family Kotaro so desperately needs. It's a show that plays with your emotions in the best way—and one I will most certainly be watching to the end.      Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                Is it weird to say the thing this premiere most reminded me of was Garfield fancomics? Not like, the body-horror ones that go viral on Twitter every once in a while, but the more grounded and dramatic ones that try to apply a sense of emotional realism to the static, archetypal characters of the eternal comic strip. Because the premise of this one – an eccentric kid named Kotaro Lives Alone in a low-rent apartment block and gets into low stakes adventures with his adult neighbors – feels like something you could find running for 20 years in a newspaper comic. That is, until it starts slipping in darker punchlines with much more serious implications.    It's an odd balance to strike, and not one this first episode totally manages to keep. There are long stretches of this episode that are just a couple of jokes being repeated and iterated upon without much escalation or change. Likewise, the initial shock of the implications about Kotaro's life before he wound up a Pre-K lease-holder wears off fairly quickly, and once those hints keep piling up it becomes decidedly harder to chuckle at him strutting around town with his plastic samurai sword. There's definitely a version of this setup that can work – be great even – but as of this premiere it doesn't feel like they've figured out the right formula.    Like sure, there are a handful of moments that are funny, or charming, or bittersweet, but they stand as isolated incidents that don't coalesce quite right. And since they don't properly gel, it winds up feeling like each fraction of what this show's going for is struggling for attention. Are you enjoying this silly segment of Kotaro being pestered by a bird? Well that's over so we can have him learn about his neighbor's failed marriage and struggle for visitation rights with his young son. Are you feeling compelled by Kotaro slowly letting his neighbor in, and perhaps accidentally admitting to his own loneliness? Try to hold onto that feeling while he and Kotaro walk around the supermarket and the guy freaks out over the thought of having an unknown baby of his own.    The upside is the entire series is already up on Netflix, so it's not much of a wait to see if things start to mesh better moving forward. And there is something genuinely engaging to this material – if nothing else Kotaro's striking eyes and bizarre speech patterns kept my attention through the entire first episode. So hopefully this can congeal into the best form of itself, because there's definitely potential here.     discuss this in the forum (108 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature                The Best and Worst of Winter 2022   Apr  6, 10:10                 anime    With the last few episodes trailing into Spring like an April's fool, it's time to look at the final ranking of the Winter 2022 season.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Kotaro Lives Alone   Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Kotaro Lives Alone (ONA) ?                     Community score: 4.2              What is this?   The story centers on a 4-year-old boy named Kotarō Satо̄, who moves next door to Shin Karino, an unsuccessful manga artist. Kotarō has no parents and lives alone. Not only does he seem to earn a living, he actually seems more put together than his own strange neighbors.    Kotaro Lives Alone is based on Mami Tsumura's manga and streams on Netflix.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Because of my day job, I have a love-hate relationship with anime that feature young children. Write them well, and I'll gush over how the series really gets them; write them poorly or overly-precocious and it's difficult for me to suspend belief long enough to really get into the story. I'd heard good things about Kotaro Lives Alone, but I couldn't feel anything beyond the most cautious of optimism as I started up the first episode. I know four-year-olds, and it was hard to imagine a story where I could both believe a child is four and is capable of surviving on his own.    Somehow, miraculously, the first episode manages to strike that balance, painting a tragicomic picture of a young child who has been forced to grow up way too fast. Part of the reason it works is because of the way Kotaro wears certain affectations, such as copying the extremely formal and old-fashioned language from a samurai cartoon he likes, like a suit of armor as he imitates adult behavior. Moments like the brief shot of him reading a newspaper on the toilet – and Japanese newspapers have a lot of difficult kanji in them, at an age where a child is barely expected to read hiragana – with his little legs dangling speak volumes.    What Kotaro Lives Alone understands is that a four-year-old doesn't become this uncanny mix of adult and child from growing up in a healthy environment. Nothing has been explicitly stated so far, but there's a lot of little one-off lines that indicate that something in his former home life forced him to grow up way too early, and whatever happened, it was neither fun nor cute. There's a tragic undercurrent to every laugh, whether it's due to Kotaro or the hot messes that are the other adult tenants in his building, that keeps it from becoming cloying or too-sentimental. If anything, it's a bit too real of a reminder that children are denied their childhoods every day.       James Beckett  Rating:                I turned 30 this year, and the older I get, the happier I am to see domestic anime that focus on more “adult” issues. Despite the very peculiar and almost fantastical nature of its premise, Kotaro Lives Alone is right up my alley. Shin Karino is exactly the kind of protagonist that I'm interested in seeing more of these days: a real human person who deals with real everyday struggles. He's trying to rekindle his creative spark and salvage his career as a manga artist; he's got to deal with his colorful and bizarre neighbors; he even throws out his back just getting up from the table (it happens to the best of us, my man, don't sweat it). The only “weird” angle to Shin's life is that he's suddenly found himself involved in the day-to-day adventures of an incredibly precocious and eccentric four-year-old that apparently lives on his own.    This is the angle of the plot that I was unsure of, since unrealistically independent and intelligent tots are such a cliché for anime in general, but I like the way that Kotaro Lives Alone characterizes its titular tyke. The very childlike issues he goes through—figuring out how bathhouses work, successfully bandaging skinned knees, procuring a TV to watch his favorite cartoon—all contrast nicely with the jaded adults around him. Mizuki clearly has some drama in her personal life and work as a hostess, and even the outlandish Tamaru feels more grounded once you learn that he's having a hard time keeping his own family together. The jokey bits where Kotaro's “feudal lord” act clashes with his inherent immaturity could have come across as tacky or try-hard, but the show always manages to get the viewer to empathize with the boy's trials and tribulations as much as the grown-ups. Who among us hasn't also marched into a complete stranger's home just so they could tell you that you did a good job?    I only have one major complaint about Kotaro, but it's kind of a doozy: the show is pretty ugly. The art style is apparently going for this strange kind of abstraction that isn't quite Crayon Shin-chan, but all of the faces and bodies are just oddly proportioned and stretchy enough to look off-putting. It's a look that might appeal to some folks, but I just couldn't warm up to it no matter how hard I tried. Still, Kotaro Lives Alone was a very pleasant surprise, and if you can get past its rough presentation, you might come to love the kid just as much as his neighbors do.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Watching this episode, I couldn't decide whether I wanted to laugh or cry—and I suspect that's exactly what the creators were aiming for. After all, it's got a setup that is either inherently comedic or inherently tragic depending on the tone of the work. And let's be clear here, Kotaro Lives Alone works hard to walk the line right between them.    First, the comedic side of things. We have a four-year-old kid doing all the things a person living alone for the first time needs to do. 90% of the time, he does it just as well as any adult, which leads us to assume that this is his norm. The humor, therefore, comes from the unpredictable moments when he acts like the child he actually is, betraying our expectations in an obvious way. (This is exact same joke framework used for Stewie and Brian in Family Guy). It's an easy way to get a laugh, especially if you care for the character.    Then there's the tragic side of things. We have a kid, ostensibly with no parents, living alone in a rundown apartment building and surrounded by unscrupulous adults. Worse yet, he has a streetwise mindset that no child his age should have—such as knowing how to bring down the swelling from crying too much—which has some heartbreaking implications. Moreover, he clearly still wants to be loved: to have his hair washed by an adult and be praised for doing something on his own for the first time.    But the real hook of the show is that everyone in that apartment building is just as alone as Kotaro is. We have a manga artist who is struggling to live up to his breakout hit; a hostess who escapes her financially abusive boyfriend by getting drunk; and a low-level mobster who isn't allowed to meet his son anymore. Despite their circumstances, this group of broken people has a chance to become something by stepping up and becoming the family Kotaro so desperately needs. It's a show that plays with your emotions in the best way—and one I will most certainly be watching to the end.      Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                Is it weird to say the thing this premiere most reminded me of was Garfield fancomics? Not like, the body-horror ones that go viral on Twitter every once in a while, but the more grounded and dramatic ones that try to apply a sense of emotional realism to the static, archetypal characters of the eternal comic strip. Because the premise of this one – an eccentric kid named Kotaro Lives Alone in a low-rent apartment block and gets into low stakes adventures with his adult neighbors – feels like something you could find running for 20 years in a newspaper comic. That is, until it starts slipping in darker punchlines with much more serious implications.    It's an odd balance to strike, and not one this first episode totally manages to keep. There are long stretches of this episode that are just a couple of jokes being repeated and iterated upon without much escalation or change. Likewise, the initial shock of the implications about Kotaro's life before he wound up a Pre-K lease-holder wears off fairly quickly, and once those hints keep piling up it becomes decidedly harder to chuckle at him strutting around town with his plastic samurai sword. There's definitely a version of this setup that can work – be great even – but as of this premiere it doesn't feel like they've figured out the right formula.    Like sure, there are a handful of moments that are funny, or charming, or bittersweet, but they stand as isolated incidents that don't coalesce quite right. And since they don't properly gel, it winds up feeling like each fraction of what this show's going for is struggling for attention. Are you enjoying this silly segment of Kotaro being pestered by a bird? Well that's over so we can have him learn about his neighbor's failed marriage and struggle for visitation rights with his young son. Are you feeling compelled by Kotaro slowly letting his neighbor in, and perhaps accidentally admitting to his own loneliness? Try to hold onto that feeling while he and Kotaro walk around the supermarket and the guy freaks out over the thought of having an unknown baby of his own.    The upside is the entire series is already up on Netflix, so it's not much of a wait to see if things start to mesh better moving forward. And there is something genuinely engaging to this material – if nothing else Kotaro's striking eyes and bizarre speech patterns kept my attention through the entire first episode. So hopefully this can congeal into the best form of itself, because there's definitely potential here.     discuss this in the forum (108 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature                The Best and Worst of Winter 2022   Apr  6, 10:10                 anime    With the last few episodes trailing into Spring like an April's fool, it's time to look at the final ranking of the Winter 2022 season.

This is the angle of the plot that I was unsure of, since unrealistically independent and intelligent tots are such a cliché for anime in general, but I like the way that Kotaro Lives Alone characterizes its titular tyke. The very childlike issues he goes through—figuring out how bathhouses work, successfully bandaging skinned knees, procuring a TV to watch his favorite cartoon—all contrast nicely with the jaded adults around him. Mizuki clearly has some drama in her personal life and work as a hostess, and even the outlandish Tamaru feels more grounded once you learn that he's having a hard time keeping his own family together. The jokey bits where Kotaro's “feudal lord” act clashes with his inherent immaturity could have come across as tacky or try-hard, but the show always manages to get the viewer to empathize with the boy's trials and tribulations as much as the grown-ups. Who among us hasn't also marched into a complete stranger's home just so they could tell you that you did a good job?    I only have one major complaint about Kotaro, but it's kind of a doozy: the show is pretty ugly. The art style is apparently going for this strange kind of abstraction that isn't quite Crayon Shin-chan, but all of the faces and bodies are just oddly proportioned and stretchy enough to look off-putting. It's a look that might appeal to some folks, but I just couldn't warm up to it no matter how hard I tried. Still, Kotaro Lives Alone was a very pleasant surprise, and if you can get past its rough presentation, you might come to love the kid just as much as his neighbors do.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Watching this episode, I couldn't decide whether I wanted to laugh or cry—and I suspect that's exactly what the creators were aiming for. After all, it's got a setup that is either inherently comedic or inherently tragic depending on the tone of the work. And let's be clear here, Kotaro Lives Alone works hard to walk the line right between them.    First, the comedic side of things. We have a four-year-old kid doing all the things a person living alone for the first time needs to do. 90% of the time, he does it just as well as any adult, which leads us to assume that this is his norm. The humor, therefore, comes from the unpredictable moments when he acts like the child he actually is, betraying our expectations in an obvious way. (This is exact same joke framework used for Stewie and Brian in Family Guy). It's an easy way to get a laugh, especially if you care for the character.    Then there's the tragic side of things. We have a kid, ostensibly with no parents, living alone in a rundown apartment building and surrounded by unscrupulous adults. Worse yet, he has a streetwise mindset that no child his age should have—such as knowing how to bring down the swelling from crying too much—which has some heartbreaking implications. Moreover, he clearly still wants to be loved: to have his hair washed by an adult and be praised for doing something on his own for the first time.    But the real hook of the show is that everyone in that apartment building is just as alone as Kotaro is. We have a manga artist who is struggling to live up to his breakout hit; a hostess who escapes her financially abusive boyfriend by getting drunk; and a low-level mobster who isn't allowed to meet his son anymore. Despite their circumstances, this group of broken people has a chance to become something by stepping up and becoming the family Kotaro so desperately needs. It's a show that plays with your emotions in the best way—and one I will most certainly be watching to the end.      Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                Is it weird to say the thing this premiere most reminded me of was Garfield fancomics? Not like, the body-horror ones that go viral on Twitter every once in a while, but the more grounded and dramatic ones that try to apply a sense of emotional realism to the static, archetypal characters of the eternal comic strip. Because the premise of this one – an eccentric kid named Kotaro Lives Alone in a low-rent apartment block and gets into low stakes adventures with his adult neighbors – feels like something you could find running for 20 years in a newspaper comic. That is, until it starts slipping in darker punchlines with much more serious implications.    It's an odd balance to strike, and not one this first episode totally manages to keep. There are long stretches of this episode that are just a couple of jokes being repeated and iterated upon without much escalation or change. Likewise, the initial shock of the implications about Kotaro's life before he wound up a Pre-K lease-holder wears off fairly quickly, and once those hints keep piling up it becomes decidedly harder to chuckle at him strutting around town with his plastic samurai sword. There's definitely a version of this setup that can work – be great even – but as of this premiere it doesn't feel like they've figured out the right formula.    Like sure, there are a handful of moments that are funny, or charming, or bittersweet, but they stand as isolated incidents that don't coalesce quite right. And since they don't properly gel, it winds up feeling like each fraction of what this show's going for is struggling for attention. Are you enjoying this silly segment of Kotaro being pestered by a bird? Well that's over so we can have him learn about his neighbor's failed marriage and struggle for visitation rights with his young son. Are you feeling compelled by Kotaro slowly letting his neighbor in, and perhaps accidentally admitting to his own loneliness? Try to hold onto that feeling while he and Kotaro walk around the supermarket and the guy freaks out over the thought of having an unknown baby of his own.    The upside is the entire series is already up on Netflix, so it's not much of a wait to see if things start to mesh better moving forward. And there is something genuinely engaging to this material – if nothing else Kotaro's striking eyes and bizarre speech patterns kept my attention through the entire first episode. So hopefully this can congeal into the best form of itself, because there's definitely potential here.     discuss this in the forum (108 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More     ",positive,en,{}

Community score: 4.2              What is this?   The story centers on a 4-year-old boy named Kotarō Satо̄, who moves next door to Shin Karino, an unsuccessful manga artist. Kotarō has no parents and lives alone. Not only does he seem to earn a living, he actually seems more put together than his own strange neighbors.    Kotaro Lives Alone is based on Mami Tsumura's manga and streams on Netflix.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Because of my day job, I have a love-hate relationship with anime that feature young children. Write them well, and I'll gush over how the series really gets them; write them poorly or overly-precocious and it's difficult for me to suspend belief long enough to really get into the story. I'd heard good things about Kotaro Lives Alone, but I couldn't feel anything beyond the most cautious of optimism as I started up the first episode. I know four-year-olds, and it was hard to imagine a story where I could both believe a child is four and is capable of surviving on his own.    Somehow, miraculously, the first episode manages to strike that balance, painting a tragicomic picture of a young child who has been forced to grow up way too fast. Part of the reason it works is because of the way Kotaro wears certain affectations, such as copying the extremely formal and old-fashioned language from a samurai cartoon he likes, like a suit of armor as he imitates adult behavior. Moments like the brief shot of him reading a newspaper on the toilet – and Japanese newspapers have a lot of difficult kanji in them, at an age where a child is barely expected to read hiragana – with his little legs dangling speak volumes.    What Kotaro Lives Alone understands is that a four-year-old doesn't become this uncanny mix of adult and child from growing up in a healthy environment. Nothing has been explicitly stated so far, but there's a lot of little one-off lines that indicate that something in his former home life forced him to grow up way too early, and whatever happened, it was neither fun nor cute. There's a tragic undercurrent to every laugh, whether it's due to Kotaro or the hot messes that are the other adult tenants in his building, that keeps it from becoming cloying or too-sentimental. If anything, it's a bit too real of a reminder that children are denied their childhoods every day.       James Beckett  Rating:                I turned 30 this year, and the older I get, the happier I am to see domestic anime that focus on more “adult” issues. Despite the very peculiar and almost fantastical nature of its premise, Kotaro Lives Alone is right up my alley. Shin Karino is exactly the kind of protagonist that I'm interested in seeing more of these days: a real human person who deals with real everyday struggles. He's trying to rekindle his creative spark and salvage his career as a manga artist; he's got to deal with his colorful and bizarre neighbors; he even throws out his back just getting up from the table (it happens to the best of us, my man, don't sweat it).

After all, it's got a setup that is either inherently comedic or inherently tragic depending on the tone of the work. And let's be clear here, Kotaro Lives Alone works hard to walk the line right between them.    First, the comedic side of things. We have a four-year-old kid doing all the things a person living alone for the first time needs to do. 90% of the time, he does it just as well as any adult, which leads us to assume that this is his norm. The humor, therefore, comes from the unpredictable moments when he acts like the child he actually is, betraying our expectations in an obvious way. (This is exact same joke framework used for Stewie and Brian in Family Guy). It's an easy way to get a laugh, especially if you care for the character.    Then there's the tragic side of things. We have a kid, ostensibly with no parents, living alone in a rundown apartment building and surrounded by unscrupulous adults. Worse yet, he has a streetwise mindset that no child his age should have—such as knowing how to bring down the swelling from crying too much—which has some heartbreaking implications. Moreover, he clearly still wants to be loved: to have his hair washed by an adult and be praised for doing something on his own for the first time.    But the real hook of the show is that everyone in that apartment building is just as alone as Kotaro is. We have a manga artist who is struggling to live up to his breakout hit; a hostess who escapes her financially abusive boyfriend by getting drunk; and a low-level mobster who isn't allowed to meet his son anymore. Despite their circumstances, this group of broken people has a chance to become something by stepping up and becoming the family Kotaro so desperately needs. It's a show that plays with your emotions in the best way—and one I will most certainly be watching to the end.      Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                Is it weird to say the thing this premiere most reminded me of was Garfield fancomics? Not like, the body-horror ones that go viral on Twitter every once in a while, but the more grounded and dramatic ones that try to apply a sense of emotional realism to the static, archetypal characters of the eternal comic strip. Because the premise of this one – an eccentric kid named Kotaro Lives Alone in a low-rent apartment block and gets into low stakes adventures with his adult neighbors – feels like something you could find running for 20 years in a newspaper comic. That is, until it starts slipping in darker punchlines with much more serious implications.    It's an odd balance to strike, and not one this first episode totally manages to keep. There are long stretches of this episode that are just a couple of jokes being repeated and iterated upon without much escalation or change. Likewise, the initial shock of the implications about Kotaro's life before he wound up a Pre-K lease-holder wears off fairly quickly, and once those hints keep piling up it becomes decidedly harder to chuckle at him strutting around town with his plastic samurai sword. There's definitely a version of this setup that can work – be great even – but as of this premiere it doesn't feel like they've figured out the right formula.    Like sure, there are a handful of moments that are funny, or charming, or bittersweet, but they stand as isolated incidents that don't coalesce quite right. And since they don't properly gel, it winds up feeling like each fraction of what this show's going for is struggling for attention. Are you enjoying this silly segment of Kotaro being pestered by a bird? Well that's over so we can have him learn about his neighbor's failed marriage and struggle for visitation rights with his young son. Are you feeling compelled by Kotaro slowly letting his neighbor in, and perhaps accidentally admitting to his own loneliness? Try to hold onto that feeling while he and Kotaro walk around the supermarket and the guy freaks out over the thought of having an unknown baby of his own.    The upside is the entire series is already up on Netflix, so it's not much of a wait to see if things start to mesh better moving forward. And there is something genuinely engaging to this material – if nothing else Kotaro's striking eyes and bizarre speech patterns kept my attention through the entire first episode. So hopefully this can congeal into the best form of itself, because there's definitely potential here.     discuss this in the forum (108 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives    ",positive,en,{}

Community score: 4.2              What is this?   The story centers on a 4-year-old boy named Kotarō Satо̄, who moves next door to Shin Karino, an unsuccessful manga artist. Kotarō has no parents and lives alone. Not only does he seem to earn a living, he actually seems more put together than his own strange neighbors.    Kotaro Lives Alone is based on Mami Tsumura's manga and streams on Netflix.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Because of my day job, I have a love-hate relationship with anime that feature young children. Write them well, and I'll gush over how the series really gets them; write them poorly or overly-precocious and it's difficult for me to suspend belief long enough to really get into the story. I'd heard good things about Kotaro Lives Alone, but I couldn't feel anything beyond the most cautious of optimism as I started up the first episode. I know four-year-olds, and it was hard to imagine a story where I could both believe a child is four and is capable of surviving on his own.    Somehow, miraculously, the first episode manages to strike that balance, painting a tragicomic picture of a young child who has been forced to grow up way too fast. Part of the reason it works is because of the way Kotaro wears certain affectations, such as copying the extremely formal and old-fashioned language from a samurai cartoon he likes, like a suit of armor as he imitates adult behavior. Moments like the brief shot of him reading a newspaper on the toilet – and Japanese newspapers have a lot of difficult kanji in them, at an age where a child is barely expected to read hiragana – with his little legs dangling speak volumes.    What Kotaro Lives Alone understands is that a four-year-old doesn't become this uncanny mix of adult and child from growing up in a healthy environment. Nothing has been explicitly stated so far, but there's a lot of little one-off lines that indicate that something in his former home life forced him to grow up way too early, and whatever happened, it was neither fun nor cute. There's a tragic undercurrent to every laugh, whether it's due to Kotaro or the hot messes that are the other adult tenants in his building, that keeps it from becoming cloying or too-sentimental. If anything, it's a bit too real of a reminder that children are denied their childhoods every day.       James Beckett  Rating:                I turned 30 this year, and the older I get, the happier I am to see domestic anime that focus on more “adult” issues. Despite the very peculiar and almost fantastical nature of its premise, Kotaro Lives Alone is right up my alley. Shin Karino is exactly the kind of protagonist that I'm interested in seeing more of these days: a real human person who deals with real everyday struggles. He's trying to rekindle his creative spark and salvage his career as a manga artist; he's got to deal with his colorful and bizarre neighbors; he even throws out his back just getting up from the table (it happens to the best of us, my man, don't sweat it). The only “weird” angle to Shin's life is that he's suddenly found himself involved in the day-to-day adventures of an incredibly precocious and eccentric four-year-old that apparently lives on his own.    This is the angle of the plot that I was unsure of, since unrealistically independent and intelligent tots are such a cliché for anime in general, but I like the way that Kotaro Lives Alone characterizes its titular tyke. The very childlike issues he goes through—figuring out how bathhouses work, successfully bandaging skinned knees, procuring a TV to watch his favorite cartoon—all contrast nicely with the jaded adults around him. Mizuki clearly has some drama in her personal life and work as a hostess, and even the outlandish Tamaru feels more grounded once you learn that he's having a hard time keeping his own family together. The jokey bits where Kotaro's “feudal lord” act clashes with his inherent immaturity could have come across as tacky or try-hard, but the show always manages to get the viewer to empathize with the boy's trials and tribulations as much as the grown-ups. Who among us hasn't also marched into a complete stranger's home just so they could tell you that you did a good job?    I only have one major complaint about Kotaro, but it's kind of a doozy: the show is pretty ugly. The art style is apparently going for this strange kind of abstraction that isn't quite Crayon Shin-chan, but all of the faces and bodies are just oddly proportioned and stretchy enough to look off-putting. It's a look that might appeal to some folks, but I just couldn't warm up to it no matter how hard I tried. Still, Kotaro Lives Alone was a very pleasant surprise, and if you can get past its rough presentation, you might come to love the kid just as much as his neighbors do.

After all, it's got a setup that is either inherently comedic or inherently tragic depending on the tone of the work. And let's be clear here, Kotaro Lives Alone works hard to walk the line right between them.    First, the comedic side of things. We have a four-year-old kid doing all the things a person living alone for the first time needs to do. 90% of the time, he does it just as well as any adult, which leads us to assume that this is his norm.

We have a manga artist who is struggling to live up to his breakout hit; a hostess who escapes her financially abusive boyfriend by getting drunk; and a low-level mobster who isn't allowed to meet his son anymore. Despite their circumstances, this group of broken people has a chance to become something by stepping up and becoming the family Kotaro so desperately needs. It's a show that plays with your emotions in the best way—and one I will most certainly be watching to the end.      Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                Is it weird to say the thing this premiere most reminded me of was Garfield fancomics?

There are long stretches of this episode that are just a couple of jokes being repeated and iterated upon without much escalation or change. Likewise, the initial shock of the implications about Kotaro's life before he wound up a Pre-K lease-holder wears off fairly quickly, and once those hints keep piling up it becomes decidedly harder to chuckle at him strutting around town with his plastic samurai sword. There's definitely a version of this setup that can work – be great even – but as of this premiere it doesn't feel like they've figured out the right formula.    Like sure, there are a handful of moments that are funny, or charming, or bittersweet, but they stand as isolated incidents that don't coalesce quite right. And since they don't properly gel, it winds up feeling like each fraction of what this show's going for is struggling for attention. Are you enjoying this silly segment of Kotaro being pestered by a bird? Well that's over so we can have him learn about his neighbor's failed marriage and struggle for visitation rights with his young son. Are you feeling compelled by Kotaro slowly letting his neighbor in, and perhaps accidentally admitting to his own loneliness? Try to hold onto that feeling while he and Kotaro walk around the supermarket and the guy freaks out over the thought of having an unknown baby of his own.    The upside is the entire series is already up on Netflix, so it's not much of a wait to see if things start to mesh better moving forward. And there is something genuinely engaging to this material – if nothing else Kotaro's striking eyes and bizarre speech patterns kept my attention through the entire first episode. So hopefully this can congeal into the best form of itself, because there's definitely potential here.  ",positive,en,{}

Review   by MrAJCosplay/Cartoon Cipher, Mar 28th 2022       Whole of Humanity Has Gone Yuri Except for Me GN 1                      Synopsis:               One day on her way to school, Marika Uruuno turns a corner to find her two best friends kissing each other. Though shocked to see this come out of nowhere, she begins to look around and notice two things. The first is that there are a lot more openly intimate girl couples around her then she remembers while the other is that she can't find a single male anywhere. It seems as though Marika has wandered into a world where men no longer exist, either being replaced with women lookalikes or just removed all together.    In a panic, Marika heads to the nurse's office to calm down. There she meets Lily Kazami, who is reading a book on parallel universes. Although she is ignored at first, Marika ends up telling Lily about her bizarre situation. Setting aside her disbelief, Lily offers to assist Marika on the condition that they go out together. Will they find answers to such a ludicrous scenario and will a romance between these two blossom along the way?

Will they find answers to such a ludicrous scenario and will a romance between these two blossom along the way?      Review:            I must say, the title and initial premise of this two-volume series did have me wondering just how much the story would fall back on gay panic or other stereotypes for the sake of cheap comedy or fanservice. However, I was pleasantly surprised at how seriously the manga took itself, and that the inciting incident wasn't just an excuse to create an otherworldly comedic situation. Beneath the ridiculousness of The Whole of Humanity Has Gone Yuri's premise – waking up one day to suddenly find that all the women of the world have become lesbians since men died off hundreds of years ago – is a genuine attempt at creating a narrative arc for our main characters, complete with a climax which seeks to resolve all loose ends. The question, then, is whether or not said attempt resulted in an engaging story. And I think it has, despite the fact that the manga doesn't always know the best way to stick the landing.    The Whole of Humanity Has Gone Yuri Except for Me starts off with a surprising amount of self-awareness as it introduces our main character Marika to a far more gay version of her life than she is used to. Predictably, no one believes her when she says that she is from another world, but then a girl named Lily decides to humor her, kickstarting a sci-fi mystery story about parallel worlds and questions about identity. Throw in some romantic drama and you have some pretty standard building blocks that at times mesh together surprisingly well. The story is self-aware about the ridiculousness of its premise;  Marika's claims of being from another world are met with surprisingly realistic reactions from other characters especially since, from their perspective, she's always been a part of this world and her suddenly talking about men runs right in the face of their own reality. Our two leads are very proactive despite their quirks and the story never really loses momentum throughout the two volumes; it has a very straightforward approach of getting its readers from point A to point B while still managing to work in moments of quiet introspection from our leads.    Themes of feeling out of place, feeling lost, and trying to figure out where your feelings for someone might come from are well-integrated into the story. When Marika goes on about how she never really fit in or how her private life seemed disjointed, it works both as a relatable character moment and a well-foreshadowed plot point. Lilly's characterization is a bit more standard, but no less genuine, especially since she carries a sense of desperation that only grows as the story progresses. These two have great chemistry together and while their banter can feel a bit cliché, the rest of their character interactions are capable of evoking both humor and emotional pathos.    This is in no small part thanks to the manga's artwork, which is an absolute highlight. Not only are the designs of our two leads distinct, but they also perfectly contrast with each other to reflect their differing personalities. There are some impressive panel layouts that help carry the emotional weight of certain scenes, and the manga's use of shading different variations of black or gray do wonders in setting up a scene. While a lot of the side characters do feel a bit lazy comparatively in their design, it's clear the artist knew what parts needed the most attention in order to convey what a character was feeling at any moment. The result is a manga that's very immersive; I would almost be tempted to recommend the manga just based on the artwork and fun main character interactions alone. Unfortunately, there are some major hiccups to the plotting that hold the manga back.    The author's decision to treat their story's premise with an air of seriousness and urgency means that they couldn't rely on any superficial or shallow resolutions. While the first third of this massive volume is strong and does a good job of setting up the mystery on top of some nice character moments between our two leads, when it comes time for the narrative to start progressing towards a definitive conclusion, you can feel the author buckling under the weight. There is an attempt to imbue a sense of logic to the circumstances that led to the manga's inciting incident, and while the theories discussed can be fun (if a little routine), the way in which we are given this information gets lazier as the book goes on, and new characters are introduced simply as plot devices to further the narrative without any real connection to anything else.    I could forgive these contrivances if didn't start affecting the aforementioned character interactions that I found so enjoyable. The story starts over-explaining where characters are and why they might feel the way that they do, as if every circumstance needed to happen for a reason that relates back to the main plot in some way. It all feels like the author had an intended ending in mind but attempted to prolong the story by adding additional details and revelations along the way, which can be exhausting to read. It genuinely became harder to appreciate some of the manga's better qualities because its plotting is so ingrained in how we get to those moments. Trying to come up with a plot-related reason for everything would only result in a story that's less believable overall. If the author just pulled back some of these twists and revelations, it might've led to more loose ends, but it would've definitely resulted in a more emotionally-fulfilling story.    To sum up, The Whole of Humanity Has Gone Yuri Except for Me was an interesting read that definitely had more to it than I originally thought. However, more doesn't always necessarily mean better. While the artwork is gorgeous and the character interactions between the leads start out believable, the story is too loaded with ideas and revelations to really appreciate them. To get a complete story in this massive volume is a good deal. However, you may end up walking away scratching your head instead of wanting more. I stand by what I said at the beginning of this review that there is an interesting story buried beneath this premise – I just don't think the author managed to tell it well.             Grade:      Overall : B- Story : C Art : A-  + Gorgeous artwork, strong start with believable character interactions and character reflections − Massive contrivances and over-explaining makes the plotting feel exhausting while also dragging down the genuine character interactions            discuss this in the forum (14 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                  				Add this manga to 				               Production Info:        Story & Art: Hiroki Haruse   Full encyclopedia details aboutWhole of Humanity Has Gone Yuri Except for Me (manga)        Review homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature                The Best and Worst of Winter 2022   Apr  6, 10:10                 anime    With the last few episodes trailing into Spring like an April's fool, it's time to look at the final ranking of the Winter 2022 season.

Review   by MrAJCosplay/Cartoon Cipher, Mar 28th 2022       Whole of Humanity Has Gone Yuri Except for Me GN 1                      Synopsis:               One day on her way to school, Marika Uruuno turns a corner to find her two best friends kissing each other. Though shocked to see this come out of nowhere, she begins to look around and notice two things. The first is that there are a lot more openly intimate girl couples around her then she remembers while the other is that she can't find a single male anywhere. It seems as though Marika has wandered into a world where men no longer exist, either being replaced with women lookalikes or just removed all together.    In a panic, Marika heads to the nurse's office to calm down. There she meets Lily Kazami, who is reading a book on parallel universes. Although she is ignored at first, Marika ends up telling Lily about her bizarre situation. Setting aside her disbelief, Lily offers to assist Marika on the condition that they go out together. Will they find answers to such a ludicrous scenario and will a romance between these two blossom along the way?

Will they find answers to such a ludicrous scenario and will a romance between these two blossom along the way?      Review:            I must say, the title and initial premise of this two-volume series did have me wondering just how much the story would fall back on gay panic or other stereotypes for the sake of cheap comedy or fanservice. However, I was pleasantly surprised at how seriously the manga took itself, and that the inciting incident wasn't just an excuse to create an otherworldly comedic situation. Beneath the ridiculousness of The Whole of Humanity Has Gone Yuri's premise – waking up one day to suddenly find that all the women of the world have become lesbians since men died off hundreds of years ago – is a genuine attempt at creating a narrative arc for our main characters, complete with a climax which seeks to resolve all loose ends. The question, then, is whether or not said attempt resulted in an engaging story. And I think it has, despite the fact that the manga doesn't always know the best way to stick the landing.    The Whole of Humanity Has Gone Yuri Except for Me starts off with a surprising amount of self-awareness as it introduces our main character Marika to a far more gay version of her life than she is used to. Predictably, no one believes her when she says that she is from another world, but then a girl named Lily decides to humor her, kickstarting a sci-fi mystery story about parallel worlds and questions about identity. Throw in some romantic drama and you have some pretty standard building blocks that at times mesh together surprisingly well. The story is self-aware about the ridiculousness of its premise;  Marika's claims of being from another world are met with surprisingly realistic reactions from other characters especially since, from their perspective, she's always been a part of this world and her suddenly talking about men runs right in the face of their own reality. Our two leads are very proactive despite their quirks and the story never really loses momentum throughout the two volumes; it has a very straightforward approach of getting its readers from point A to point B while still managing to work in moments of quiet introspection from our leads.    Themes of feeling out of place, feeling lost, and trying to figure out where your feelings for someone might come from are well-integrated into the story. When Marika goes on about how she never really fit in or how her private life seemed disjointed, it works both as a relatable character moment and a well-foreshadowed plot point. Lilly's characterization is a bit more standard, but no less genuine, especially since she carries a sense of desperation that only grows as the story progresses. These two have great chemistry together and while their banter can feel a bit cliché, the rest of their character interactions are capable of evoking both humor and emotional pathos.    This is in no small part thanks to the manga's artwork, which is an absolute highlight. Not only are the designs of our two leads distinct, but they also perfectly contrast with each other to reflect their differing personalities. There are some impressive panel layouts that help carry the emotional weight of certain scenes, and the manga's use of shading different variations of black or gray do wonders in setting up a scene. While a lot of the side characters do feel a bit lazy comparatively in their design, it's clear the artist knew what parts needed the most attention in order to convey what a character was feeling at any moment. The result is a manga that's very immersive; I would almost be tempted to recommend the manga just based on the artwork and fun main character interactions alone. Unfortunately, there are some major hiccups to the plotting that hold the manga back.    The author's decision to treat their story's premise with an air of seriousness and urgency means that they couldn't rely on any superficial or shallow resolutions. While the first third of this massive volume is strong and does a good job of setting up the mystery on top of some nice character moments between our two leads, when it comes time for the narrative to start progressing towards a definitive conclusion, you can feel the author buckling under the weight. There is an attempt to imbue a sense of logic to the circumstances that led to the manga's inciting incident, and while the theories discussed can be fun (if a little routine), the way in which we are given this information gets lazier as the book goes on, and new characters are introduced simply as plot devices to further the narrative without any real connection to anything else.    I could forgive these contrivances if didn't start affecting the aforementioned character interactions that I found so enjoyable. The story starts over-explaining where characters are and why they might feel the way that they do, as if every circumstance needed to happen for a reason that relates back to the main plot in some way. It all feels like the author had an intended ending in mind but attempted to prolong the story by adding additional details and revelations along the way, which can be exhausting to read. It genuinely became harder to appreciate some of the manga's better qualities because its plotting is so ingrained in how we get to those moments. Trying to come up with a plot-related reason for everything would only result in a story that's less believable overall. If the author just pulled back some of these twists and revelations, it might've led to more loose ends, but it would've definitely resulted in a more emotionally-fulfilling story.    To sum up, The Whole of Humanity Has Gone Yuri Except for Me was an interesting read that definitely had more to it than I originally thought. However, more doesn't always necessarily mean better. While the artwork is gorgeous and the character interactions between the leads start out believable, the story is too loaded with ideas and revelations to really appreciate them. To get a complete story in this massive volume is a good deal. However, you may end up walking away scratching your head instead of wanting more. I stand by what I said at the beginning of this review that there is an interesting story buried beneath this premise – I just don't think the author managed to tell it well.             Grade:      Overall : B- Story : C Art : A-  + Gorgeous artwork, strong start with believable character interactions and character reflections − Massive contrivances and over-explaining makes the plotting feel exhausting while also dragging down the genuine character interactions            discuss this in the forum (14 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                  				Add this manga to 				               Production Info:        Story & Art: Hiroki Haruse   Full encyclopedia details aboutWhole of Humanity Has Gone Yuri Except for Me (manga)        Review homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature                The Best and Worst of Winter 2022   Apr  6, 10:10                 anime    With the last few episodes trailing into Spring like an April's fool, it's time to look at the final ranking of the Winter 2022 season.

Though shocked to see this come out of nowhere, she begins to look around and notice two things. The first is that there are a lot more openly intimate girl couples around her then she remembers while the other is that she can't find a single male anywhere. It seems as though Marika has wandered into a world where men no longer exist, either being replaced with women lookalikes or just removed all together.    In a panic, Marika heads to the nurse's office to calm down. There she meets Lily Kazami, who is reading a book on parallel universes. Although she is ignored at first, Marika ends up telling Lily about her bizarre situation. Setting aside her disbelief, Lily offers to assist Marika on the condition that they go out together. Will they find answers to such a ludicrous scenario and will a romance between these two blossom along the way?

Will they find answers to such a ludicrous scenario and will a romance between these two blossom along the way?      Review:            I must say, the title and initial premise of this two-volume series did have me wondering just how much the story would fall back on gay panic or other stereotypes for the sake of cheap comedy or fanservice. However, I was pleasantly surprised at how seriously the manga took itself, and that the inciting incident wasn't just an excuse to create an otherworldly comedic situation. Beneath the ridiculousness of The Whole of Humanity Has Gone Yuri's premise – waking up one day to suddenly find that all the women of the world have become lesbians since men died off hundreds of years ago – is a genuine attempt at creating a narrative arc for our main characters, complete with a climax which seeks to resolve all loose ends. The question, then, is whether or not said attempt resulted in an engaging story. And I think it has, despite the fact that the manga doesn't always know the best way to stick the landing.    The Whole of Humanity Has Gone Yuri Except for Me starts off with a surprising amount of self-awareness as it introduces our main character Marika to a far more gay version of her life than she is used to. Predictably, no one believes her when she says that she is from another world, but then a girl named Lily decides to humor her, kickstarting a sci-fi mystery story about parallel worlds and questions about identity. Throw in some romantic drama and you have some pretty standard building blocks that at times mesh together surprisingly well. The story is self-aware about the ridiculousness of its premise;  Marika's claims of being from another world are met with surprisingly realistic reactions from other characters especially since, from their perspective, she's always been a part of this world and her suddenly talking about men runs right in the face of their own reality. Our two leads are very proactive despite their quirks and the story never really loses momentum throughout the two volumes; it has a very straightforward approach of getting its readers from point A to point B while still managing to work in moments of quiet introspection from our leads.    Themes of feeling out of place, feeling lost, and trying to figure out where your feelings for someone might come from are well-integrated into the story. When Marika goes on about how she never really fit in or how her private life seemed disjointed, it works both as a relatable character moment and a well-foreshadowed plot point. Lilly's characterization is a bit more standard, but no less genuine, especially since she carries a sense of desperation that only grows as the story progresses. These two have great chemistry together and while their banter can feel a bit cliché, the rest of their character interactions are capable of evoking both humor and emotional pathos.    This is in no small part thanks to the manga's artwork, which is an absolute highlight. Not only are the designs of our two leads distinct, but they also perfectly contrast with each other to reflect their differing personalities. There are some impressive panel layouts that help carry the emotional weight of certain scenes, and the manga's use of shading different variations of black or gray do wonders in setting up a scene. While a lot of the side characters do feel a bit lazy comparatively in their design, it's clear the artist knew what parts needed the most attention in order to convey what a character was feeling at any moment. The result is a manga that's very immersive; I would almost be tempted to recommend the manga just based on the artwork and fun main character interactions alone. Unfortunately, there are some major hiccups to the plotting that hold the manga back.    The author's decision to treat their story's premise with an air of seriousness and urgency means that they couldn't rely on any superficial or shallow resolutions. While the first third of this massive volume is strong and does a good job of setting up the mystery on top of some nice character moments between our two leads, when it comes time for the narrative to start progressing towards a definitive conclusion, you can feel the author buckling under the weight. There is an attempt to imbue a sense of logic to the circumstances that led to the manga's inciting incident, and while the theories discussed can be fun (if a little routine), the way in which we are given this information gets lazier as the book goes on, and new characters are introduced simply as plot devices to further the narrative without any real connection to anything else.    I could forgive these contrivances if didn't start affecting the aforementioned character interactions that I found so enjoyable. The story starts over-explaining where characters are and why they might feel the way that they do, as if every circumstance needed to happen for a reason that relates back to the main plot in some way. It all feels like the author had an intended ending in mind but attempted to prolong the story by adding additional details and revelations along the way, which can be exhausting to read. It genuinely became harder to appreciate some of the manga's better qualities because its plotting is so ingrained in how we get to those moments. Trying to come up with a plot-related reason for everything would only result in a story that's less believable overall. If the author just pulled back some of these twists and revelations, it might've led to more loose ends, but it would've definitely resulted in a more emotionally-fulfilling story.    To sum up, The Whole of Humanity Has Gone Yuri Except for Me was an interesting read that definitely had more to it than I originally thought. However, more doesn't always necessarily mean better. While the artwork is gorgeous and the character interactions between the leads start out believable, the story is too loaded with ideas and revelations to really appreciate them. To get a complete story in this massive volume is a good deal. However, you may end up walking away scratching your head instead of wanting more. I stand by what I said at the beginning of this review that there is an interesting story buried beneath this premise – I just don't think the author managed to tell it well.
