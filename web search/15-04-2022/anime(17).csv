I'd imagine it's due to scheduling logistics.

I'd imagine it's due to scheduling logistics.           Considering the first season dropped all at once (and her role likely recorded in batches), I imagine it would be much harder to keep up for a weekly simulcast. Unless Mia is a new character to S2 and you just meant reprise from the JPN cast, but yeah the schedule demands would still be there.

Uchida's fluent in English, and the character she plays is American. There have been a couple other series recently that were able to do something similar. I think D4DJ had a character where her JP voice actress portrayed her in both dubs, for instance. It wasn't likely to happen, but it would have been neat.

Seems like more of an outlier unless I'm forgetting obvious examples. Even incidental background English-speakers that actually sound accurate (Eden of the East comes to mind) will usually be re-dubbed.

But maybe they tried and were told it wasn’t possible. Either way, I hope they don’t forget about dubbing Superstar!

I'd imagine it's due to scheduling logistics.           Considering the first season dropped all at once (and her role likely recorded in batches), I imagine it would be much harder to keep up for a weekly simulcast. Unless Mia is a new character to S2 and you just meant reprise from the JPN cast, but yeah the schedule demands would still be there.

Uchida's fluent in English, and the character she plays is American. There have been a couple other series recently that were able to do something similar. I think D4DJ had a character where her JP voice actress portrayed her in both dubs, for instance. It wasn't likely to happen, but it would have been neat.

Seems like more of an outlier unless I'm forgetting obvious examples. Even incidental background English-speakers that actually sound accurate (Eden of the East comes to mind) will usually be re-dubbed.

But maybe they tried and were told it wasn’t possible. Either way, I hope they don’t forget about dubbing Superstar!

I'd imagine it's due to scheduling logistics.          why would she be in a English dub while she does Japanese voice work?            Uchida's fluent in English, and the character she plays is American. There have been a couple other series recently that were able to do something similar. I think D4DJ had a character where her JP voice actress portrayed her in both dubs, for instance. It wasn't likely to happen, but it would have been neat.           Tbh, D4DJ is about the only example I can think of that's not going back to like... keeping Pikachu's JPN VA or Miyuki Sawashiro in Di Gi Charat's dub?

Minmay in the (official) Macross dub, but that was years ago.

News Kimi ni Todoke Side Story Manga Ends   posted on 2022-04-14 01:00 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         Spinoff manga ends on May 13    This year's May issue of Shueisha's Bessatsu Margaret magazine revealed on Wednesday that Karuho Shiina's Kimi ni Todoke Bangaihen ~Unmei no Hito~ (Kimi ni Todoke Spinoff: Soulmate) spinoff manga will end in the magazine's next issue on May 13.    The first 50-page spinoff chapter debuted in Bessatsu Margaret in April 2018, and the second chapter debuted in October 2018. The third, fourth, and fifth chapters debuted in March, July, and October 2019, respectively. The sixth chapter debuted in August 2020. Another chapter debuted in March 2021, and more followed in May 2021 and in January. The spinoff series' second compiled book volume shipped in July 2021.    Shiina began the main Kimi ni Todoke manga in Bessatsu Margaret in 2006, and ended it in November 2017. Shueisha published the manga's 30th and final compiled book volume in March 2018.    The manga tells the story of Sawako Kuronuma, nicknamed Sadako (from The Ring) because her long black hair and pale skin makes her appear gloomy. The popular Shōta Kazahaya builds a friendship with Sawako that blossoms into romance.    The series has consistently ranked among the top-selling manga in Japan. Viz Media publishes the English version of the manga, and published the 30th volume in December 2018.    NIS America released both seasons of the television anime adaptation on home video. A live-action film adaptation opened in Japan in 2010.

News Kimi ni Todoke Side Story Manga Ends   posted on 2022-04-14 01:00 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         Spinoff manga ends on May 13    This year's May issue of Shueisha's Bessatsu Margaret magazine revealed on Wednesday that Karuho Shiina's Kimi ni Todoke Bangaihen ~Unmei no Hito~ (Kimi ni Todoke Spinoff: Soulmate) spinoff manga will end in the magazine's next issue on May 13.    The first 50-page spinoff chapter debuted in Bessatsu Margaret in April 2018, and the second chapter debuted in October 2018. The third, fourth, and fifth chapters debuted in March, July, and October 2019, respectively. The sixth chapter debuted in August 2020. Another chapter debuted in March 2021, and more followed in May 2021 and in January. The spinoff series' second compiled book volume shipped in July 2021.    Shiina began the main Kimi ni Todoke manga in Bessatsu Margaret in 2006, and ended it in November 2017. Shueisha published the manga's 30th and final compiled book volume in March 2018.    The manga tells the story of Sawako Kuronuma, nicknamed Sadako (from The Ring) because her long black hair and pale skin makes her appear gloomy. The popular Shōta Kazahaya builds a friendship with Sawako that blossoms into romance.    The series has consistently ranked among the top-selling manga in Japan. Viz Media publishes the English version of the manga, and published the 30th volume in December 2018.    NIS America released both seasons of the television anime adaptation on home video. A live-action film adaptation opened in Japan in 2010.

Sabikui Bisco Episode 12  by Steve Jones, Mar 29th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Sabikui Bisco ?                     Community score: 4.3           After last week's stunner, there aren't a whole lot of surprises left in Sabikui Bisco's bag of tricks, but it doesn't need them to pull together a satisfying and highly fungal finale. In fact, it's a credit to the story's construction that all of this feels as natural as it does. It's an over-the-top capstone on a drawn out and action heavy kaiju assualt, yet it hits the right character beats and ties a neat bow on this season's most important threads. And at this point, all Sabikui Bisco really needed to do was not trip over itself in order to wrap up a solid adaptation, so it can consider itself as steady as bedrock.    To my chagrin, Bisco's messianic return does indeed receive an explanation, but at least it jives with the rest of the setting. If I've already accepted that spore-coated arrows can spontaneously generate skyscraper-sized caps, then it only takes a light mental jog to accept that pipe snake poison can turn you into an immortal mushroom man. What's most important is that it's very gross. Bisco remarks that he has to clean Rust Eater growths off himself regularly, and he's in a hurry to find a cure for this unwanted boon of immortality, which is very in-character for him. I had been wondering where the story could go from here now that one of its heroes is apparently unkillable, and this makes a lot of sense.    Even with Bisco's miraculous mycelium, however, it still takes all hands to take down Kurokawa's yucky rust-spewing colossus. Personally, I wouldn't have dragged this confrontation out over three weeks, and I think the story's pacing would have been better served by frontloading at least one more episodic travelogue to better acquaint ourselves with both our heroes and the oddness of this world. Nonetheless, this conclusion has a collection of small and large moments I like a lot. Tirol frantically flipping through the Tetsujin user manual is a fitting gag for her mental acumen and total lack of combat prowess. Milo and Bisco naturally get the finishing blow with their bro-and-arrow combo, fitting their bodies together to send one final Rust Eater payload through Kurokawa's cranium.    Pawoo definitely steals the show, though. I continue to find it funny the narrative seems so adamant on setting her, not her brother, up with Bisco—whether this is due to prejudice, cowardice, or some other factor, I couldn't say. But if it's going to do so, then at least it's doing so with plenty of aplomb. Never mind that she gets the best action setpiece in this episode, rocketing herself up close and personal into the Tetsujin's massive mug and using her much vaunted pole to cleave his mask in twain. She Frenches Bisco and then nonchalantly brags about tasting the tongue of a walking deity. That is pure action hero badass behavior. At the end of the day, I'm still team Milo, but Pawoo is too good a character to be upset with.    And Milo and Bisco do bless us with the finale's tenderest moment after the battle is won. Yeah, Pawoo got to play tonsil hockey with him, but it's Milo who snuggles up against Bisco's chiseled chest to listen to the steadiness of his hyphae-enhanced heartbeat. At no point in the episode is there ever a doubt that they'll do everything together, from kicking Kurokawa's big rusty ass, to searching for a cure for immortality, to spreading the good shroom news (and spores) to Japan's other prefectures. Despite all the melodrama of the season's second half, they're back to bickering like an old couple in no time. It's pleasant! And that honestly might be the best word for Sabikui Bisco. It might make a lot of waves with its weird ideas and outrageous presentation, but overall it's just a very pleasant, crowd-pleasing watch that does right by its source material.    As my last word on Sabikui Bisco as an adaptation and anime, I really want to note how impressive and consistent it was on the production level. I think I may have voiced my quibbles a little too much in these reviews, but that's only because the show was operating on a level where I could assess the animation and feel okay about it. Because, as a whole, the show looks great! It emphasized personality-rich character art and backgrounds throughout its run, and it was able to inject kinetic energy where it counted. This finale, for instance, has some really nice cuts. Consider the fallen Tetsujin sloughing off its rust body, or Pawoo slamming her sword into the giant mask. It's even more impressive considering this is Studio OZ's first main credit, although director Atsushi Ikariya is no neophyte, and the team appear closely entwined with the older and similarly named Studio NAZ. This tally of animators and animation directors suggests a highly concentrated core staff, and the results speak for themselves.    The season bookends itself with the border outpost, which both serves as a nice way to send off those characters, and serves as a piece of narrative punctuation suggesting the further adventures to come. While Imihama is sorted now that it has Rust Eater aplenty and a governor who's not a total psychopath, the rest of Japan isn't as enthused about Milo and Bisco's fungal proselytization. The societal rot that let Kurokawa flourish is still out there, and they need to cure it with their own brand of good natural rot. I will most certainly be game to pop more shrooms should we ever be blessed with more Bisco, but with its creative vision and focus on adapting just one volume, this season does an admirable job standing alone as one of winter's most enjoyable action anime.    Rating:                 Sabikui Bisco is currently streaming on Crunchyroll and Funimation.    Steve can be found on Twitter if you want to read his World’s End Harem livetweets.

Sabikui Bisco Episode 12  by Steve Jones, Mar 29th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Sabikui Bisco ?                     Community score: 4.3           After last week's stunner, there aren't a whole lot of surprises left in Sabikui Bisco's bag of tricks, but it doesn't need them to pull together a satisfying and highly fungal finale. In fact, it's a credit to the story's construction that all of this feels as natural as it does. It's an over-the-top capstone on a drawn out and action heavy kaiju assualt, yet it hits the right character beats and ties a neat bow on this season's most important threads. And at this point, all Sabikui Bisco really needed to do was not trip over itself in order to wrap up a solid adaptation, so it can consider itself as steady as bedrock.    To my chagrin, Bisco's messianic return does indeed receive an explanation, but at least it jives with the rest of the setting. If I've already accepted that spore-coated arrows can spontaneously generate skyscraper-sized caps, then it only takes a light mental jog to accept that pipe snake poison can turn you into an immortal mushroom man. What's most important is that it's very gross. Bisco remarks that he has to clean Rust Eater growths off himself regularly, and he's in a hurry to find a cure for this unwanted boon of immortality, which is very in-character for him. I had been wondering where the story could go from here now that one of its heroes is apparently unkillable, and this makes a lot of sense.    Even with Bisco's miraculous mycelium, however, it still takes all hands to take down Kurokawa's yucky rust-spewing colossus. Personally, I wouldn't have dragged this confrontation out over three weeks, and I think the story's pacing would have been better served by frontloading at least one more episodic travelogue to better acquaint ourselves with both our heroes and the oddness of this world. Nonetheless, this conclusion has a collection of small and large moments I like a lot. Tirol frantically flipping through the Tetsujin user manual is a fitting gag for her mental acumen and total lack of combat prowess. Milo and Bisco naturally get the finishing blow with their bro-and-arrow combo, fitting their bodies together to send one final Rust Eater payload through Kurokawa's cranium.    Pawoo definitely steals the show, though. I continue to find it funny the narrative seems so adamant on setting her, not her brother, up with Bisco—whether this is due to prejudice, cowardice, or some other factor, I couldn't say. But if it's going to do so, then at least it's doing so with plenty of aplomb. Never mind that she gets the best action setpiece in this episode, rocketing herself up close and personal into the Tetsujin's massive mug and using her much vaunted pole to cleave his mask in twain. She Frenches Bisco and then nonchalantly brags about tasting the tongue of a walking deity. That is pure action hero badass behavior. At the end of the day, I'm still team Milo, but Pawoo is too good a character to be upset with.    And Milo and Bisco do bless us with the finale's tenderest moment after the battle is won. Yeah, Pawoo got to play tonsil hockey with him, but it's Milo who snuggles up against Bisco's chiseled chest to listen to the steadiness of his hyphae-enhanced heartbeat. At no point in the episode is there ever a doubt that they'll do everything together, from kicking Kurokawa's big rusty ass, to searching for a cure for immortality, to spreading the good shroom news (and spores) to Japan's other prefectures. Despite all the melodrama of the season's second half, they're back to bickering like an old couple in no time. It's pleasant! And that honestly might be the best word for Sabikui Bisco. It might make a lot of waves with its weird ideas and outrageous presentation, but overall it's just a very pleasant, crowd-pleasing watch that does right by its source material.    As my last word on Sabikui Bisco as an adaptation and anime, I really want to note how impressive and consistent it was on the production level. I think I may have voiced my quibbles a little too much in these reviews, but that's only because the show was operating on a level where I could assess the animation and feel okay about it. Because, as a whole, the show looks great! It emphasized personality-rich character art and backgrounds throughout its run, and it was able to inject kinetic energy where it counted. This finale, for instance, has some really nice cuts. Consider the fallen Tetsujin sloughing off its rust body, or Pawoo slamming her sword into the giant mask. It's even more impressive considering this is Studio OZ's first main credit, although director Atsushi Ikariya is no neophyte, and the team appear closely entwined with the older and similarly named Studio NAZ. This tally of animators and animation directors suggests a highly concentrated core staff, and the results speak for themselves.    The season bookends itself with the border outpost, which both serves as a nice way to send off those characters, and serves as a piece of narrative punctuation suggesting the further adventures to come. While Imihama is sorted now that it has Rust Eater aplenty and a governor who's not a total psychopath, the rest of Japan isn't as enthused about Milo and Bisco's fungal proselytization. The societal rot that let Kurokawa flourish is still out there, and they need to cure it with their own brand of good natural rot. I will most certainly be game to pop more shrooms should we ever be blessed with more Bisco, but with its creative vision and focus on adapting just one volume, this season does an admirable job standing alone as one of winter's most enjoyable action anime.    Rating:                 Sabikui Bisco is currently streaming on Crunchyroll and Funimation.    Steve can be found on Twitter if you want to read his World’s End Harem livetweets.

Sabikui Bisco Episode 12  by Steve Jones, Mar 29th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Sabikui Bisco ?                     Community score: 4.3           After last week's stunner, there aren't a whole lot of surprises left in Sabikui Bisco's bag of tricks, but it doesn't need them to pull together a satisfying and highly fungal finale. In fact, it's a credit to the story's construction that all of this feels as natural as it does. It's an over-the-top capstone on a drawn out and action heavy kaiju assualt, yet it hits the right character beats and ties a neat bow on this season's most important threads. And at this point, all Sabikui Bisco really needed to do was not trip over itself in order to wrap up a solid adaptation, so it can consider itself as steady as bedrock.    To my chagrin, Bisco's messianic return does indeed receive an explanation, but at least it jives with the rest of the setting. If I've already accepted that spore-coated arrows can spontaneously generate skyscraper-sized caps, then it only takes a light mental jog to accept that pipe snake poison can turn you into an immortal mushroom man. What's most important is that it's very gross. Bisco remarks that he has to clean Rust Eater growths off himself regularly, and he's in a hurry to find a cure for this unwanted boon of immortality, which is very in-character for him. I had been wondering where the story could go from here now that one of its heroes is apparently unkillable, and this makes a lot of sense.    Even with Bisco's miraculous mycelium, however, it still takes all hands to take down Kurokawa's yucky rust-spewing colossus. Personally, I wouldn't have dragged this confrontation out over three weeks, and I think the story's pacing would have been better served by frontloading at least one more episodic travelogue to better acquaint ourselves with both our heroes and the oddness of this world. Nonetheless, this conclusion has a collection of small and large moments I like a lot. Tirol frantically flipping through the Tetsujin user manual is a fitting gag for her mental acumen and total lack of combat prowess. Milo and Bisco naturally get the finishing blow with their bro-and-arrow combo, fitting their bodies together to send one final Rust Eater payload through Kurokawa's cranium.    Pawoo definitely steals the show, though. I continue to find it funny the narrative seems so adamant on setting her, not her brother, up with Bisco—whether this is due to prejudice, cowardice, or some other factor, I couldn't say. But if it's going to do so, then at least it's doing so with plenty of aplomb. Never mind that she gets the best action setpiece in this episode, rocketing herself up close and personal into the Tetsujin's massive mug and using her much vaunted pole to cleave his mask in twain. She Frenches Bisco and then nonchalantly brags about tasting the tongue of a walking deity. That is pure action hero badass behavior. At the end of the day, I'm still team Milo, but Pawoo is too good a character to be upset with.    And Milo and Bisco do bless us with the finale's tenderest moment after the battle is won. Yeah, Pawoo got to play tonsil hockey with him, but it's Milo who snuggles up against Bisco's chiseled chest to listen to the steadiness of his hyphae-enhanced heartbeat. At no point in the episode is there ever a doubt that they'll do everything together, from kicking Kurokawa's big rusty ass, to searching for a cure for immortality, to spreading the good shroom news (and spores) to Japan's other prefectures. Despite all the melodrama of the season's second half, they're back to bickering like an old couple in no time. It's pleasant! And that honestly might be the best word for Sabikui Bisco. It might make a lot of waves with its weird ideas and outrageous presentation, but overall it's just a very pleasant, crowd-pleasing watch that does right by its source material.    As my last word on Sabikui Bisco as an adaptation and anime, I really want to note how impressive and consistent it was on the production level. I think I may have voiced my quibbles a little too much in these reviews, but that's only because the show was operating on a level where I could assess the animation and feel okay about it. Because, as a whole, the show looks great! It emphasized personality-rich character art and backgrounds throughout its run, and it was able to inject kinetic energy where it counted. This finale, for instance, has some really nice cuts. Consider the fallen Tetsujin sloughing off its rust body, or Pawoo slamming her sword into the giant mask. It's even more impressive considering this is Studio OZ's first main credit, although director Atsushi Ikariya is no neophyte, and the team appear closely entwined with the older and similarly named Studio NAZ. This tally of animators and animation directors suggests a highly concentrated core staff, and the results speak for themselves.    The season bookends itself with the border outpost, which both serves as a nice way to send off those characters, and serves as a piece of narrative punctuation suggesting the further adventures to come. While Imihama is sorted now that it has Rust Eater aplenty and a governor who's not a total psychopath, the rest of Japan isn't as enthused about Milo and Bisco's fungal proselytization. The societal rot that let Kurokawa flourish is still out there, and they need to cure it with their own brand of good natural rot. I will most certainly be game to pop more shrooms should we ever be blessed with more Bisco, but with its creative vision and focus on adapting just one volume, this season does an admirable job standing alone as one of winter's most enjoyable action anime.    Rating:                 Sabikui Bisco is currently streaming on Crunchyroll and Funimation.    Steve can be found on Twitter if you want to read his World’s End Harem livetweets.

I have received a spamming or abusive email from someone on this board!  phpBB 2 Issues Who wrote this bulletin board? Why isn't X feature available? Who do I contact about abusive and/or legal matters related to this board?              Login and Registration Issues    Why can't I log in?Have you registered? Seriously, you must register in order to log in. Have you been banned from the board? (A message will be displayed if you have.) If so, you should contact the webmaster or board administrator to find out why. If you have registered and are not banned and you still cannot log in then check and double-check your username and password. Usually this is the problem; if not, contact the board administrator -- they may have incorrect configuration settings for the board.Back to top        Why do I need to register at all?Requiring registration permits us more control over how people post. By requiring that people register we are able to  ban trolls and anyone else who doesn't follow the forum rules. We'd rather have a smaller but friendly and intelligent posting community than a free for all.Back to top        Why do I get logged off automatically?If you do not check the Log me in automatically box when you log in, the board will only keep you logged in for a preset time. This prevents misuse of your account by anyone else. To stay logged in, check the box during login. This is not recommended if you access the board from a shared computer, e.g. library, internet cafe, university cluster, etc.Back to top        How do I prevent my username from appearing in the online user listings?In your profile you will find an option Hide your online status; if you switch this on you'll only appear to board administrators or to yourself. You will be counted as a hidden user.Back to top        I've lost my password!Don't panic! While your password cannot be retrieved it can be reset. To do this go to the login page and click I've forgotten my password. Follow the instructions and you should be back online in no time.Back to top        I registered but cannot log in!Firstly check that you are entering the correct username and password. Does your account need activating? We require that all new registrations be activated. When you registered you were told this. You should have received an email, please follow the instructions in the email. If you did not receive the email (check in your junk folder!), are you sure your email address is valid? One reason activation is used is to reduce the possibility of rogue users abusing the board anonymously. If you are sure the email address you used is valid you can try re-sending an activation e-mail.Back to top        I registered in the past but cannot log in anymore!The most likely reasons for this are: you entered an incorrect username or password (check the email you were sent when you first registered) or the administrator has deleted your account for some reason. If it is the latter case then perhaps you did not post anything? It is usual for boards to periodically remove users who have not posted anything so as to reduce the size of the database. Try registering again and get involved in discussions.Back to top            User Preferences and settings    How do I change my settings?All your settings (if you are registered) are stored in the database. To alter them click the Profile link (under the forum tab). This will allow you to change all your settings.Back to top        The times are not correct!The times are almost certainly correct; however, what you may be seeing are times displayed in a timezone different from the one you are in. If this is the case, you should change your profile setting for the timezone to match your particular area, e.g. London, Paris, New York, Sydney, etc. Please note that changing the timezone, like most settings, can only be done by registered users. So if you are not registered, this is a good time to do so, if you pardon the pun!Back to top        I changed the timezone and the time is still wrong!If you are sure you have set the timezone correctly and the time is still different, the most likely answer is daylight savings time (or summer time as it is known in the UK and other places). The board is not designed to handle the changeovers between standard and daylight time so during summer months the time may be an hour different from the real local time.Back to top        How do I show an image below my username?That image is called an 'avatar', and you can upload it by going to your profileBack to top        Why is my Avatar replaced by another pictureSome free webhosts (ie: Tripod) do not permit off-site linking to their images. They do this to conserve their bandwidth, try using another server for you image.Back to top        How do I change my rank?You can't. Currently we do not employ an automatic Rank changing system; we feel that these place too much emphasis on the quantity of posts as opposed to the quality.Back to top        When I click the email link for a user it asks me to log in.Sorry, but only registered users can send email to people via the built-in email form (if the admin has enabled this feature). This is to prevent malicious use of the email system by anonymous users.Back to top            Posting Issues    How do I post a topic in a forum?Easy -- click the relevant button on either the forum or topic screens. You may need to register before you can post a message. The facilities available to you are listed at the bottom of the forum and topic screens (the You can post new topics, You can vote in polls, etc. list)Back to top        How do I edit or delete a post?Unless you are the board admin or forum moderator you can only edit or delete your own posts. You can edit a post  by clicking the edit button for the relevant post.  If someone has already replied to the post you will find a small piece of text output below the post when you return to the topic, this lists the number of times you edited it. This will not appear if no one has replied, it also will not appear if moderators or administrators edit the post (We generally leave a message saying what we altered and why). Please note that normal users cannot delete a post once someone has replied.Back to top        How do I add a signature to my post?To add a signature to a post you must first create one; this is done via your profile. Once created you can check the Add Signature box on the posting form to add your signature. You can also add a signature by default to all your posts by checking the appropriate radio box in your profile. You can still prevent a signature being added to individual posts by un-checking the add signature box on the posting form.Back to top        How do I create a poll?Creating a poll is easy -- when you post a new topic (or edit the first post of a topic, if you have permission) you should see a Add Poll form below the main posting box. If you cannot see this then you probably do not have rights to create polls. You should enter a title for the poll and then at least two options -- to set an option type in the poll question and click the Add option button. You can also set a time limit for the poll, 0 being an infinite amount. There will be a limit to the number of options you can list, which is set by the board administratorBack to top        How do I edit or delete a poll?As with posts, polls can only be edited by the original poster, a moderator, or board administrator. To edit a poll, click the first post in the topic, which always has the poll associated with it. If no one has cast a vote then users can delete the poll or edit any poll option. However, if people have already placed votes only moderators or administrators can edit or delete it; this is to prevent people rigging polls by changing options mid-way through a pollBack to top        Why can't I access a forum?Some forums may be limited to certain users or groups. To view, read, post, etc. you may need special authorization which only the forum moderator and board administrator can grant, so you should contact them.Back to top        Why can't I vote in polls?Only registered users can vote in polls so as to prevent spoofing of results. If you have registered and still cannot vote then you probably do not have appropriate access rights.Back to top            Formatting and Topic Types    What is BBCode?BBCode is a special implementation of HTML. Whether you can use BBCode is determined by the administrator. You can also disable it on a per post basis from the posting form. BBCode itself is similar in style to HTML: tags are enclosed in square braces [ and ] rather than < and > and it offers greater control over what and how something is displayed. For more information on BBCode see the guide which can be accessed from the posting page.Back to top        Can I use HTML?You are allowed to use HTML, but only certain tags work. This is a safety feature to prevent people abusing the board by using tags which may destroy the layout or cause other problems. You can enable/disable HTML on a per post basis from the posting form.Back to top        What are Smileys?Smileys, or Emoticons, are small graphical images which can be used to express some feeling using a short code, e.g. :) means happy, :( means sad. The full list of emoticons can be seen via the posting form. Try not to overuse smileys, though, as they can quickly render a post unreadable and a moderator may decide to edit them out or remove the post altogether.Back to top        Can I post Images?Images can indeed be shown in your posts. However, there is no facility at present for uploading images directly to this board. Therefore you must link to an image stored on a publicly accessible web server, e.g. http://www.some-unknown-place.net/my-picture.gif. You cannot link to pictures stored on your own PC (unless it is a publicly accessible server) nor to images stored behind authentication mechanisms such as Hotmail or Yahoo mailboxes, password-protected sites, etc. To display the image use either the BBCode [img] tag or appropriate HTML (if allowed).Back to top        What are Announcements?Announcements often contain important information and you should read them as soon as possible. Announcements appear at the top of every page in the forum to which they are posted. Only the administrators and moderators can post announcements.Back to top        What are Sticky topics?Sticky topics appear below any announcements in viewforum and only on the first page. They are often quite important so you should read them where possible. As with announcements only board administrator and moderators can post sticky topics in each forum.Back to top        What are Locked topics?Locked topics are set this way by either the forum moderator or board administrator. You cannot reply to locked topics and any poll contained inside is automatically ended. Topics may be locked for many reasons.Back to top            User Levels and Groups    What are Administrators?Administrators are people assigned the highest level of control over the entire board. These people can control all facets of board operation which include setting permissions, banning users, creating usergroups or moderators, etc. They also have full moderator capabilities in all the forums.Back to top        What are Moderators?Moderators are individuals (or groups of individuals) whose job it is to look after the running of the forums from day to day. They have the power to edit or delete posts and lock, unlock, move, delete and split topics in the forum they moderate. Generally moderators are there to prevent people going off-topic or posting abusive or offensive material.Back to top        What are Usergroups?Usergroups are a way in which board administrators can group users. Each user can belong to several groups (this differs from most other boards) and each group can be assigned individual access rights. This makes it easy for administrators to set up several users as moderators of a forum, or to give them access to a private forum, etc.Back to top        How do I join a Usergroup?To join a usergroup click the usergroup link on the page header (dependent on template design) and you can then view all usergroups. Not all groups are open access -- some are closed and some may even have hidden memberships. If the board is open then you can request to join it by clicking the appropriate button. The user group moderator will need to approve your request; they may ask why you want to join the group. Please do not pester a group moderator if they turn your request down -- they will have their reasons.Back to top        How do I become a Usergroup Moderator?Usergroups are initially created by the board administrator who also assigns a board moderator. If you are interested in creating a usergroup then your first point of contact should be the administrator, so try dropping them a private message.Back to top            Private Messaging    I cannot send private messages!You are probably not registered and/or not logged on.Back to top        I keep getting unwanted private messages!In the future we will be adding an ignore list to the private messaging system. For now, though, if you keep receiving unwanted private messages from someone, inform the board administrator -- they have the power to prevent a user from sending private messages at all.Back to top        I have received a spamming or abusive email from someone on this board!We are sorry to hear that. The email form feature of this board includes safeguards to try to track users who send such posts. You should email the board administrator with a full copy of the email you received and it is very important this include the headers (these list details of the user that sent the email). They can then take action.Back to top            phpBB 2 Issues    Who wrote this bulletin board?This software (in its unmodified form) is produced, released and is copyrighted phpBB Group.

I have received a spamming or abusive email from someone on this board!  phpBB 2 Issues Who wrote this bulletin board? Why isn't X feature available? Who do I contact about abusive and/or legal matters related to this board?              Login and Registration Issues    Why can't I log in?Have you registered? Seriously, you must register in order to log in. Have you been banned from the board? (A message will be displayed if you have.) If so, you should contact the webmaster or board administrator to find out why. If you have registered and are not banned and you still cannot log in then check and double-check your username and password. Usually this is the problem; if not, contact the board administrator -- they may have incorrect configuration settings for the board.Back to top        Why do I need to register at all?Requiring registration permits us more control over how people post. By requiring that people register we are able to  ban trolls and anyone else who doesn't follow the forum rules. We'd rather have a smaller but friendly and intelligent posting community than a free for all.Back to top        Why do I get logged off automatically?If you do not check the Log me in automatically box when you log in, the board will only keep you logged in for a preset time. This prevents misuse of your account by anyone else. To stay logged in, check the box during login. This is not recommended if you access the board from a shared computer, e.g. library, internet cafe, university cluster, etc.Back to top        How do I prevent my username from appearing in the online user listings?In your profile you will find an option Hide your online status; if you switch this on you'll only appear to board administrators or to yourself. You will be counted as a hidden user.Back to top        I've lost my password!Don't panic! While your password cannot be retrieved it can be reset. To do this go to the login page and click I've forgotten my password. Follow the instructions and you should be back online in no time.Back to top        I registered but cannot log in!Firstly check that you are entering the correct username and password. Does your account need activating? We require that all new registrations be activated. When you registered you were told this. You should have received an email, please follow the instructions in the email. If you did not receive the email (check in your junk folder!), are you sure your email address is valid? One reason activation is used is to reduce the possibility of rogue users abusing the board anonymously. If you are sure the email address you used is valid you can try re-sending an activation e-mail.Back to top        I registered in the past but cannot log in anymore!The most likely reasons for this are: you entered an incorrect username or password (check the email you were sent when you first registered) or the administrator has deleted your account for some reason. If it is the latter case then perhaps you did not post anything? It is usual for boards to periodically remove users who have not posted anything so as to reduce the size of the database. Try registering again and get involved in discussions.Back to top            User Preferences and settings    How do I change my settings?All your settings (if you are registered) are stored in the database. To alter them click the Profile link (under the forum tab). This will allow you to change all your settings.Back to top        The times are not correct!The times are almost certainly correct; however, what you may be seeing are times displayed in a timezone different from the one you are in. If this is the case, you should change your profile setting for the timezone to match your particular area, e.g. London, Paris, New York, Sydney, etc. Please note that changing the timezone, like most settings, can only be done by registered users. So if you are not registered, this is a good time to do so, if you pardon the pun!Back to top        I changed the timezone and the time is still wrong!If you are sure you have set the timezone correctly and the time is still different, the most likely answer is daylight savings time (or summer time as it is known in the UK and other places). The board is not designed to handle the changeovers between standard and daylight time so during summer months the time may be an hour different from the real local time.Back to top        How do I show an image below my username?That image is called an 'avatar', and you can upload it by going to your profileBack to top        Why is my Avatar replaced by another pictureSome free webhosts (ie: Tripod) do not permit off-site linking to their images. They do this to conserve their bandwidth, try using another server for you image.Back to top        How do I change my rank?You can't. Currently we do not employ an automatic Rank changing system; we feel that these place too much emphasis on the quantity of posts as opposed to the quality.Back to top        When I click the email link for a user it asks me to log in.Sorry, but only registered users can send email to people via the built-in email form (if the admin has enabled this feature). This is to prevent malicious use of the email system by anonymous users.Back to top            Posting Issues    How do I post a topic in a forum?Easy -- click the relevant button on either the forum or topic screens. You may need to register before you can post a message. The facilities available to you are listed at the bottom of the forum and topic screens (the You can post new topics, You can vote in polls, etc. list)Back to top        How do I edit or delete a post?Unless you are the board admin or forum moderator you can only edit or delete your own posts. You can edit a post  by clicking the edit button for the relevant post.  If someone has already replied to the post you will find a small piece of text output below the post when you return to the topic, this lists the number of times you edited it. This will not appear if no one has replied, it also will not appear if moderators or administrators edit the post (We generally leave a message saying what we altered and why). Please note that normal users cannot delete a post once someone has replied.Back to top        How do I add a signature to my post?To add a signature to a post you must first create one; this is done via your profile. Once created you can check the Add Signature box on the posting form to add your signature. You can also add a signature by default to all your posts by checking the appropriate radio box in your profile. You can still prevent a signature being added to individual posts by un-checking the add signature box on the posting form.Back to top        How do I create a poll?Creating a poll is easy -- when you post a new topic (or edit the first post of a topic, if you have permission) you should see a Add Poll form below the main posting box. If you cannot see this then you probably do not have rights to create polls. You should enter a title for the poll and then at least two options -- to set an option type in the poll question and click the Add option button. You can also set a time limit for the poll, 0 being an infinite amount. There will be a limit to the number of options you can list, which is set by the board administratorBack to top        How do I edit or delete a poll?As with posts, polls can only be edited by the original poster, a moderator, or board administrator. To edit a poll, click the first post in the topic, which always has the poll associated with it. If no one has cast a vote then users can delete the poll or edit any poll option. However, if people have already placed votes only moderators or administrators can edit or delete it; this is to prevent people rigging polls by changing options mid-way through a pollBack to top        Why can't I access a forum?Some forums may be limited to certain users or groups. To view, read, post, etc. you may need special authorization which only the forum moderator and board administrator can grant, so you should contact them.Back to top        Why can't I vote in polls?Only registered users can vote in polls so as to prevent spoofing of results. If you have registered and still cannot vote then you probably do not have appropriate access rights.Back to top            Formatting and Topic Types    What is BBCode?BBCode is a special implementation of HTML. Whether you can use BBCode is determined by the administrator. You can also disable it on a per post basis from the posting form. BBCode itself is similar in style to HTML: tags are enclosed in square braces [ and ] rather than < and > and it offers greater control over what and how something is displayed. For more information on BBCode see the guide which can be accessed from the posting page.Back to top        Can I use HTML?You are allowed to use HTML, but only certain tags work. This is a safety feature to prevent people abusing the board by using tags which may destroy the layout or cause other problems. You can enable/disable HTML on a per post basis from the posting form.Back to top        What are Smileys?Smileys, or Emoticons, are small graphical images which can be used to express some feeling using a short code, e.g. :) means happy, :( means sad. The full list of emoticons can be seen via the posting form. Try not to overuse smileys, though, as they can quickly render a post unreadable and a moderator may decide to edit them out or remove the post altogether.Back to top        Can I post Images?Images can indeed be shown in your posts. However, there is no facility at present for uploading images directly to this board. Therefore you must link to an image stored on a publicly accessible web server, e.g. http://www.some-unknown-place.net/my-picture.gif. You cannot link to pictures stored on your own PC (unless it is a publicly accessible server) nor to images stored behind authentication mechanisms such as Hotmail or Yahoo mailboxes, password-protected sites, etc. To display the image use either the BBCode [img] tag or appropriate HTML (if allowed).Back to top        What are Announcements?Announcements often contain important information and you should read them as soon as possible. Announcements appear at the top of every page in the forum to which they are posted. Only the administrators and moderators can post announcements.Back to top        What are Sticky topics?Sticky topics appear below any announcements in viewforum and only on the first page. They are often quite important so you should read them where possible. As with announcements only board administrator and moderators can post sticky topics in each forum.Back to top        What are Locked topics?Locked topics are set this way by either the forum moderator or board administrator. You cannot reply to locked topics and any poll contained inside is automatically ended. Topics may be locked for many reasons.Back to top            User Levels and Groups    What are Administrators?Administrators are people assigned the highest level of control over the entire board. These people can control all facets of board operation which include setting permissions, banning users, creating usergroups or moderators, etc. They also have full moderator capabilities in all the forums.Back to top        What are Moderators?Moderators are individuals (or groups of individuals) whose job it is to look after the running of the forums from day to day. They have the power to edit or delete posts and lock, unlock, move, delete and split topics in the forum they moderate. Generally moderators are there to prevent people going off-topic or posting abusive or offensive material.Back to top        What are Usergroups?Usergroups are a way in which board administrators can group users. Each user can belong to several groups (this differs from most other boards) and each group can be assigned individual access rights. This makes it easy for administrators to set up several users as moderators of a forum, or to give them access to a private forum, etc.Back to top        How do I join a Usergroup?To join a usergroup click the usergroup link on the page header (dependent on template design) and you can then view all usergroups. Not all groups are open access -- some are closed and some may even have hidden memberships. If the board is open then you can request to join it by clicking the appropriate button. The user group moderator will need to approve your request; they may ask why you want to join the group. Please do not pester a group moderator if they turn your request down -- they will have their reasons.Back to top        How do I become a Usergroup Moderator?Usergroups are initially created by the board administrator who also assigns a board moderator. If you are interested in creating a usergroup then your first point of contact should be the administrator, so try dropping them a private message.Back to top            Private Messaging    I cannot send private messages!You are probably not registered and/or not logged on.Back to top        I keep getting unwanted private messages!In the future we will be adding an ignore list to the private messaging system. For now, though, if you keep receiving unwanted private messages from someone, inform the board administrator -- they have the power to prevent a user from sending private messages at all.Back to top        I have received a spamming or abusive email from someone on this board!We are sorry to hear that. The email form feature of this board includes safeguards to try to track users who send such posts. You should email the board administrator with a full copy of the email you received and it is very important this include the headers (these list details of the user that sent the email). They can then take action.Back to top            phpBB 2 Issues    Who wrote this bulletin board?This software (in its unmodified form) is produced, released and is copyrighted phpBB Group. It is made available under the GNU General Public License and may be freely distributed; see link for more detailsBack to top        Why isn't X feature available?This software was written by and licensed through phpBB Group.

I have received a spamming or abusive email from someone on this board!  phpBB 2 Issues Who wrote this bulletin board? Why isn't X feature available? Who do I contact about abusive and/or legal matters related to this board?              Login and Registration Issues    Why can't I log in?Have you registered? Seriously, you must register in order to log in. Have you been banned from the board? (A message will be displayed if you have.) If so, you should contact the webmaster or board administrator to find out why. If you have registered and are not banned and you still cannot log in then check and double-check your username and password. Usually this is the problem; if not, contact the board administrator -- they may have incorrect configuration settings for the board.Back to top        Why do I need to register at all?Requiring registration permits us more control over how people post. By requiring that people register we are able to  ban trolls and anyone else who doesn't follow the forum rules. We'd rather have a smaller but friendly and intelligent posting community than a free for all.Back to top        Why do I get logged off automatically?If you do not check the Log me in automatically box when you log in, the board will only keep you logged in for a preset time. This prevents misuse of your account by anyone else. To stay logged in, check the box during login. This is not recommended if you access the board from a shared computer, e.g. library, internet cafe, university cluster, etc.Back to top        How do I prevent my username from appearing in the online user listings?In your profile you will find an option Hide your online status; if you switch this on you'll only appear to board administrators or to yourself. You will be counted as a hidden user.Back to top        I've lost my password!Don't panic! While your password cannot be retrieved it can be reset. To do this go to the login page and click I've forgotten my password. Follow the instructions and you should be back online in no time.Back to top        I registered but cannot log in!Firstly check that you are entering the correct username and password. Does your account need activating? We require that all new registrations be activated. When you registered you were told this. You should have received an email, please follow the instructions in the email. If you did not receive the email (check in your junk folder!), are you sure your email address is valid? One reason activation is used is to reduce the possibility of rogue users abusing the board anonymously. If you are sure the email address you used is valid you can try re-sending an activation e-mail.Back to top        I registered in the past but cannot log in anymore!The most likely reasons for this are: you entered an incorrect username or password (check the email you were sent when you first registered) or the administrator has deleted your account for some reason. If it is the latter case then perhaps you did not post anything? It is usual for boards to periodically remove users who have not posted anything so as to reduce the size of the database. Try registering again and get involved in discussions.Back to top            User Preferences and settings    How do I change my settings?All your settings (if you are registered) are stored in the database. To alter them click the Profile link (under the forum tab). This will allow you to change all your settings.Back to top        The times are not correct!The times are almost certainly correct; however, what you may be seeing are times displayed in a timezone different from the one you are in. If this is the case, you should change your profile setting for the timezone to match your particular area, e.g. London, Paris, New York, Sydney, etc. Please note that changing the timezone, like most settings, can only be done by registered users. So if you are not registered, this is a good time to do so, if you pardon the pun!Back to top        I changed the timezone and the time is still wrong!If you are sure you have set the timezone correctly and the time is still different, the most likely answer is daylight savings time (or summer time as it is known in the UK and other places). The board is not designed to handle the changeovers between standard and daylight time so during summer months the time may be an hour different from the real local time.Back to top        How do I show an image below my username?That image is called an 'avatar', and you can upload it by going to your profileBack to top        Why is my Avatar replaced by another pictureSome free webhosts (ie: Tripod) do not permit off-site linking to their images. They do this to conserve their bandwidth, try using another server for you image.Back to top        How do I change my rank?You can't. Currently we do not employ an automatic Rank changing system; we feel that these place too much emphasis on the quantity of posts as opposed to the quality.Back to top        When I click the email link for a user it asks me to log in.Sorry, but only registered users can send email to people via the built-in email form (if the admin has enabled this feature). This is to prevent malicious use of the email system by anonymous users.Back to top            Posting Issues    How do I post a topic in a forum?Easy -- click the relevant button on either the forum or topic screens. You may need to register before you can post a message. The facilities available to you are listed at the bottom of the forum and topic screens (the You can post new topics, You can vote in polls, etc. list)Back to top        How do I edit or delete a post?Unless you are the board admin or forum moderator you can only edit or delete your own posts. You can edit a post  by clicking the edit button for the relevant post.  If someone has already replied to the post you will find a small piece of text output below the post when you return to the topic, this lists the number of times you edited it. This will not appear if no one has replied, it also will not appear if moderators or administrators edit the post (We generally leave a message saying what we altered and why). Please note that normal users cannot delete a post once someone has replied.Back to top        How do I add a signature to my post?To add a signature to a post you must first create one; this is done via your profile. Once created you can check the Add Signature box on the posting form to add your signature. You can also add a signature by default to all your posts by checking the appropriate radio box in your profile. You can still prevent a signature being added to individual posts by un-checking the add signature box on the posting form.Back to top        How do I create a poll?Creating a poll is easy -- when you post a new topic (or edit the first post of a topic, if you have permission) you should see a Add Poll form below the main posting box. If you cannot see this then you probably do not have rights to create polls. You should enter a title for the poll and then at least two options -- to set an option type in the poll question and click the Add option button. You can also set a time limit for the poll, 0 being an infinite amount. There will be a limit to the number of options you can list, which is set by the board administratorBack to top        How do I edit or delete a poll?As with posts, polls can only be edited by the original poster, a moderator, or board administrator. To edit a poll, click the first post in the topic, which always has the poll associated with it. If no one has cast a vote then users can delete the poll or edit any poll option. However, if people have already placed votes only moderators or administrators can edit or delete it; this is to prevent people rigging polls by changing options mid-way through a pollBack to top        Why can't I access a forum?Some forums may be limited to certain users or groups. To view, read, post, etc. you may need special authorization which only the forum moderator and board administrator can grant, so you should contact them.Back to top        Why can't I vote in polls?Only registered users can vote in polls so as to prevent spoofing of results. If you have registered and still cannot vote then you probably do not have appropriate access rights.Back to top            Formatting and Topic Types    What is BBCode?BBCode is a special implementation of HTML. Whether you can use BBCode is determined by the administrator. You can also disable it on a per post basis from the posting form. BBCode itself is similar in style to HTML: tags are enclosed in square braces [ and ] rather than < and > and it offers greater control over what and how something is displayed. For more information on BBCode see the guide which can be accessed from the posting page.Back to top        Can I use HTML?You are allowed to use HTML, but only certain tags work. This is a safety feature to prevent people abusing the board by using tags which may destroy the layout or cause other problems. You can enable/disable HTML on a per post basis from the posting form.Back to top        What are Smileys?Smileys, or Emoticons, are small graphical images which can be used to express some feeling using a short code, e.g. :) means happy, :( means sad. The full list of emoticons can be seen via the posting form. Try not to overuse smileys, though, as they can quickly render a post unreadable and a moderator may decide to edit them out or remove the post altogether.Back to top        Can I post Images?Images can indeed be shown in your posts. However, there is no facility at present for uploading images directly to this board. Therefore you must link to an image stored on a publicly accessible web server, e.g. http://www.some-unknown-place.net/my-picture.gif. You cannot link to pictures stored on your own PC (unless it is a publicly accessible server) nor to images stored behind authentication mechanisms such as Hotmail or Yahoo mailboxes, password-protected sites, etc. To display the image use either the BBCode [img] tag or appropriate HTML (if allowed).Back to top        What are Announcements?Announcements often contain important information and you should read them as soon as possible. Announcements appear at the top of every page in the forum to which they are posted. Only the administrators and moderators can post announcements.Back to top        What are Sticky topics?Sticky topics appear below any announcements in viewforum and only on the first page. They are often quite important so you should read them where possible. As with announcements only board administrator and moderators can post sticky topics in each forum.Back to top        What are Locked topics?Locked topics are set this way by either the forum moderator or board administrator. You cannot reply to locked topics and any poll contained inside is automatically ended. Topics may be locked for many reasons.Back to top            User Levels and Groups    What are Administrators?Administrators are people assigned the highest level of control over the entire board. These people can control all facets of board operation which include setting permissions, banning users, creating usergroups or moderators, etc. They also have full moderator capabilities in all the forums.Back to top        What are Moderators?Moderators are individuals (or groups of individuals) whose job it is to look after the running of the forums from day to day. They have the power to edit or delete posts and lock, unlock, move, delete and split topics in the forum they moderate. Generally moderators are there to prevent people going off-topic or posting abusive or offensive material.Back to top        What are Usergroups?Usergroups are a way in which board administrators can group users. Each user can belong to several groups (this differs from most other boards) and each group can be assigned individual access rights. This makes it easy for administrators to set up several users as moderators of a forum, or to give them access to a private forum, etc.Back to top        How do I join a Usergroup?To join a usergroup click the usergroup link on the page header (dependent on template design) and you can then view all usergroups. Not all groups are open access -- some are closed and some may even have hidden memberships. If the board is open then you can request to join it by clicking the appropriate button. The user group moderator will need to approve your request; they may ask why you want to join the group. Please do not pester a group moderator if they turn your request down -- they will have their reasons.Back to top        How do I become a Usergroup Moderator?Usergroups are initially created by the board administrator who also assigns a board moderator. If you are interested in creating a usergroup then your first point of contact should be the administrator, so try dropping them a private message.Back to top            Private Messaging    I cannot send private messages!You are probably not registered and/or not logged on.Back to top        I keep getting unwanted private messages!In the future we will be adding an ignore list to the private messaging system. For now, though, if you keep receiving unwanted private messages from someone, inform the board administrator -- they have the power to prevent a user from sending private messages at all.Back to top        I have received a spamming or abusive email from someone on this board!We are sorry to hear that. The email form feature of this board includes safeguards to try to track users who send such posts. You should email the board administrator with a full copy of the email you received and it is very important this include the headers (these list details of the user that sent the email). They can then take action.Back to top            phpBB 2 Issues    Who wrote this bulletin board?This software (in its unmodified form) is produced, released and is copyrighted phpBB Group.

Who do I contact about abusive and/or legal matters related to this board?              Login and Registration Issues    Why can't I log in?Have you registered? Seriously, you must register in order to log in. Have you been banned from the board? (A message will be displayed if you have.) If so, you should contact the webmaster or board administrator to find out why. If you have registered and are not banned and you still cannot log in then check and double-check your username and password. Usually this is the problem; if not, contact the board administrator -- they may have incorrect configuration settings for the board.Back to top        Why do I need to register at all?Requiring registration permits us more control over how people post. By requiring that people register we are able to  ban trolls and anyone else who doesn't follow the forum rules. We'd rather have a smaller but friendly and intelligent posting community than a free for all.Back to top        Why do I get logged off automatically?If you do not check the Log me in automatically box when you log in, the board will only keep you logged in for a preset time. This prevents misuse of your account by anyone else. To stay logged in, check the box during login. This is not recommended if you access the board from a shared computer, e.g. library, internet cafe, university cluster, etc.Back to top        How do I prevent my username from appearing in the online user listings?In your profile you will find an option Hide your online status; if you switch this on you'll only appear to board administrators or to yourself. You will be counted as a hidden user.Back to top        I've lost my password!Don't panic! While your password cannot be retrieved it can be reset. To do this go to the login page and click I've forgotten my password. Follow the instructions and you should be back online in no time.Back to top        I registered but cannot log in!Firstly check that you are entering the correct username and password. Does your account need activating? We require that all new registrations be activated. When you registered you were told this. You should have received an email, please follow the instructions in the email. If you did not receive the email (check in your junk folder!), are you sure your email address is valid? One reason activation is used is to reduce the possibility of rogue users abusing the board anonymously. If you are sure the email address you used is valid you can try re-sending an activation e-mail.Back to top        I registered in the past but cannot log in anymore!The most likely reasons for this are: you entered an incorrect username or password (check the email you were sent when you first registered) or the administrator has deleted your account for some reason. If it is the latter case then perhaps you did not post anything? It is usual for boards to periodically remove users who have not posted anything so as to reduce the size of the database. Try registering again and get involved in discussions.Back to top            User Preferences and settings    How do I change my settings?All your settings (if you are registered) are stored in the database. To alter them click the Profile link (under the forum tab). This will allow you to change all your settings.Back to top        The times are not correct!The times are almost certainly correct; however, what you may be seeing are times displayed in a timezone different from the one you are in. If this is the case, you should change your profile setting for the timezone to match your particular area, e.g. London, Paris, New York, Sydney, etc. Please note that changing the timezone, like most settings, can only be done by registered users. So if you are not registered, this is a good time to do so, if you pardon the pun!Back to top        I changed the timezone and the time is still wrong!If you are sure you have set the timezone correctly and the time is still different, the most likely answer is daylight savings time (or summer time as it is known in the UK and other places). The board is not designed to handle the changeovers between standard and daylight time so during summer months the time may be an hour different from the real local time.Back to top        How do I show an image below my username?That image is called an 'avatar', and you can upload it by going to your profileBack to top        Why is my Avatar replaced by another pictureSome free webhosts (ie: Tripod) do not permit off-site linking to their images. They do this to conserve their bandwidth, try using another server for you image.Back to top        How do I change my rank?You can't. Currently we do not employ an automatic Rank changing system; we feel that these place too much emphasis on the quantity of posts as opposed to the quality.Back to top        When I click the email link for a user it asks me to log in.Sorry, but only registered users can send email to people via the built-in email form (if the admin has enabled this feature). This is to prevent malicious use of the email system by anonymous users.Back to top            Posting Issues    How do I post a topic in a forum?Easy -- click the relevant button on either the forum or topic screens. You may need to register before you can post a message. The facilities available to you are listed at the bottom of the forum and topic screens (the You can post new topics, You can vote in polls, etc. list)Back to top        How do I edit or delete a post?Unless you are the board admin or forum moderator you can only edit or delete your own posts. You can edit a post  by clicking the edit button for the relevant post.  If someone has already replied to the post you will find a small piece of text output below the post when you return to the topic, this lists the number of times you edited it. This will not appear if no one has replied, it also will not appear if moderators or administrators edit the post (We generally leave a message saying what we altered and why). Please note that normal users cannot delete a post once someone has replied.Back to top        How do I add a signature to my post?To add a signature to a post you must first create one; this is done via your profile. Once created you can check the Add Signature box on the posting form to add your signature. You can also add a signature by default to all your posts by checking the appropriate radio box in your profile. You can still prevent a signature being added to individual posts by un-checking the add signature box on the posting form.Back to top        How do I create a poll?Creating a poll is easy -- when you post a new topic (or edit the first post of a topic, if you have permission) you should see a Add Poll form below the main posting box. If you cannot see this then you probably do not have rights to create polls. You should enter a title for the poll and then at least two options -- to set an option type in the poll question and click the Add option button. You can also set a time limit for the poll, 0 being an infinite amount. There will be a limit to the number of options you can list, which is set by the board administratorBack to top        How do I edit or delete a poll?As with posts, polls can only be edited by the original poster, a moderator, or board administrator. To edit a poll, click the first post in the topic, which always has the poll associated with it. If no one has cast a vote then users can delete the poll or edit any poll option. However, if people have already placed votes only moderators or administrators can edit or delete it; this is to prevent people rigging polls by changing options mid-way through a pollBack to top        Why can't I access a forum?Some forums may be limited to certain users or groups. To view, read, post, etc. you may need special authorization which only the forum moderator and board administrator can grant, so you should contact them.Back to top        Why can't I vote in polls?Only registered users can vote in polls so as to prevent spoofing of results. If you have registered and still cannot vote then you probably do not have appropriate access rights.Back to top            Formatting and Topic Types    What is BBCode?BBCode is a special implementation of HTML. Whether you can use BBCode is determined by the administrator. You can also disable it on a per post basis from the posting form. BBCode itself is similar in style to HTML: tags are enclosed in square braces [ and ] rather than < and > and it offers greater control over what and how something is displayed. For more information on BBCode see the guide which can be accessed from the posting page.Back to top        Can I use HTML?You are allowed to use HTML, but only certain tags work. This is a safety feature to prevent people abusing the board by using tags which may destroy the layout or cause other problems. You can enable/disable HTML on a per post basis from the posting form.Back to top        What are Smileys?Smileys, or Emoticons, are small graphical images which can be used to express some feeling using a short code, e.g. :) means happy, :( means sad. The full list of emoticons can be seen via the posting form. Try not to overuse smileys, though, as they can quickly render a post unreadable and a moderator may decide to edit them out or remove the post altogether.Back to top        Can I post Images?Images can indeed be shown in your posts. However, there is no facility at present for uploading images directly to this board. Therefore you must link to an image stored on a publicly accessible web server, e.g. http://www.some-unknown-place.net/my-picture.gif. You cannot link to pictures stored on your own PC (unless it is a publicly accessible server) nor to images stored behind authentication mechanisms such as Hotmail or Yahoo mailboxes, password-protected sites, etc. To display the image use either the BBCode [img] tag or appropriate HTML (if allowed).Back to top        What are Announcements?Announcements often contain important information and you should read them as soon as possible. Announcements appear at the top of every page in the forum to which they are posted. Only the administrators and moderators can post announcements.Back to top        What are Sticky topics?Sticky topics appear below any announcements in viewforum and only on the first page. They are often quite important so you should read them where possible. As with announcements only board administrator and moderators can post sticky topics in each forum.Back to top        What are Locked topics?Locked topics are set this way by either the forum moderator or board administrator. You cannot reply to locked topics and any poll contained inside is automatically ended. Topics may be locked for many reasons.Back to top            User Levels and Groups    What are Administrators?Administrators are people assigned the highest level of control over the entire board. These people can control all facets of board operation which include setting permissions, banning users, creating usergroups or moderators, etc. They also have full moderator capabilities in all the forums.Back to top        What are Moderators?Moderators are individuals (or groups of individuals) whose job it is to look after the running of the forums from day to day. They have the power to edit or delete posts and lock, unlock, move, delete and split topics in the forum they moderate. Generally moderators are there to prevent people going off-topic or posting abusive or offensive material.Back to top        What are Usergroups?Usergroups are a way in which board administrators can group users. Each user can belong to several groups (this differs from most other boards) and each group can be assigned individual access rights. This makes it easy for administrators to set up several users as moderators of a forum, or to give them access to a private forum, etc.Back to top        How do I join a Usergroup?To join a usergroup click the usergroup link on the page header (dependent on template design) and you can then view all usergroups. Not all groups are open access -- some are closed and some may even have hidden memberships. If the board is open then you can request to join it by clicking the appropriate button. The user group moderator will need to approve your request; they may ask why you want to join the group. Please do not pester a group moderator if they turn your request down -- they will have their reasons.Back to top        How do I become a Usergroup Moderator?Usergroups are initially created by the board administrator who also assigns a board moderator.
