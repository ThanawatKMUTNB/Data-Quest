News 3 New Manga Launch on Shonen Jump+   posted on 2022-04-12 01:15 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo          Marriage Toxin, Bubble, Camellia Curtain manga debut in April    The Shonen Jump+ app and website revealed on Sunday three new manga:     Mizuki Yoda (ne0;lation) and Jōmyaku will launch the Marriage Toxin manga on April 20.     Yoda is drawing the series, and Jōmyaku is writing the story. The website teases that it is about professional killers, swindlers, and the best troubled marriage hunters in the world.    Yoda and Tomohide Hirao launched the ne0;lation manga in Shueisha's Weekly Shonen Jump magazine in December 2017. The manga ended in April 2018. Viz Media previewed the manga in English, and then added the manga to its Shonen Jump digital lineup when it changed to its new English Shonen Jump service.    Erubo Hijihara will launch a manga adaptation of Bubble, the new original anime film by Wit Studio, on April 22.     The film will debut worldwide on Netflix on April 28, and will open in Japanese theaters on May 13. The film played as an official selection of the Generation 14plus section at the 72nd Berlin International Film Festival on February 10-20.    Netflix describes the anime:    The story is set in Tokyo, after bubbles that broke the laws of gravity rained down upon the world.   Cut off from the outside world, Tokyo has become a playground for a group of young people who have lost their families, acting as a battlefield for parkour team battles as they leap from building to building.    Hibiki, a young ace known for his dangerous play style, makes a reckless move one day and plummets into the gravity-bending sea. His life is saved by Uta, a girl with mysterious powers. The pair then hear a unique sound audible only to them.    Why did Uta appear before Hibiki? Their encounter leads to a revelation that will change the world.    Kazusa Inaoka (i tell c) will launch the Camellia Curtain (Camellia no Curtain) manga on April 29.     The magazine teases it as a theatre ensemble drama.    Inaoka launched the i tell c manga in Shonen Jump in February 2021. The manga ended in June 2021.    The author launched the Kimi wo Shinryakuseyo! (Invade You) manga in May 2018 in Shueisha's Shonen Jump GIGA magazine and later launched it in Weekly Shonen Jump. The series ended in September 2018.

News 3 New Manga Launch on Shonen Jump+   posted on 2022-04-12 01:15 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo          Marriage Toxin, Bubble, Camellia Curtain manga debut in April    The Shonen Jump+ app and website revealed on Sunday three new manga:     Mizuki Yoda (ne0;lation) and Jōmyaku will launch the Marriage Toxin manga on April 20.     Yoda is drawing the series, and Jōmyaku is writing the story. The website teases that it is about professional killers, swindlers, and the best troubled marriage hunters in the world.    Yoda and Tomohide Hirao launched the ne0;lation manga in Shueisha's Weekly Shonen Jump magazine in December 2017. The manga ended in April 2018. Viz Media previewed the manga in English, and then added the manga to its Shonen Jump digital lineup when it changed to its new English Shonen Jump service.    Erubo Hijihara will launch a manga adaptation of Bubble, the new original anime film by Wit Studio, on April 22.     The film will debut worldwide on Netflix on April 28, and will open in Japanese theaters on May 13. The film played as an official selection of the Generation 14plus section at the 72nd Berlin International Film Festival on February 10-20.    Netflix describes the anime:    The story is set in Tokyo, after bubbles that broke the laws of gravity rained down upon the world.   Cut off from the outside world, Tokyo has become a playground for a group of young people who have lost their families, acting as a battlefield for parkour team battles as they leap from building to building.    Hibiki, a young ace known for his dangerous play style, makes a reckless move one day and plummets into the gravity-bending sea. His life is saved by Uta, a girl with mysterious powers. The pair then hear a unique sound audible only to them.    Why did Uta appear before Hibiki? Their encounter leads to a revelation that will change the world.    Kazusa Inaoka (i tell c) will launch the Camellia Curtain (Camellia no Curtain) manga on April 29.     The magazine teases it as a theatre ensemble drama.    Inaoka launched the i tell c manga in Shonen Jump in February 2021. The manga ended in June 2021.    The author launched the Kimi wo Shinryakuseyo! (Invade You) manga in May 2018 in Shueisha's Shonen Jump GIGA magazine and later launched it in Weekly Shonen Jump. The series ended in September 2018.

News 3 New Manga Launch on Shonen Jump+   posted on 2022-04-12 01:15 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo          Marriage Toxin, Bubble, Camellia Curtain manga debut in April    The Shonen Jump+ app and website revealed on Sunday three new manga:     Mizuki Yoda (ne0;lation) and Jōmyaku will launch the Marriage Toxin manga on April 20.     Yoda is drawing the series, and Jōmyaku is writing the story. The website teases that it is about professional killers, swindlers, and the best troubled marriage hunters in the world.    Yoda and Tomohide Hirao launched the ne0;lation manga in Shueisha's Weekly Shonen Jump magazine in December 2017. The manga ended in April 2018. Viz Media previewed the manga in English, and then added the manga to its Shonen Jump digital lineup when it changed to its new English Shonen Jump service.    Erubo Hijihara will launch a manga adaptation of Bubble, the new original anime film by Wit Studio, on April 22.     The film will debut worldwide on Netflix on April 28, and will open in Japanese theaters on May 13. The film played as an official selection of the Generation 14plus section at the 72nd Berlin International Film Festival on February 10-20.    Netflix describes the anime:    The story is set in Tokyo, after bubbles that broke the laws of gravity rained down upon the world.   Cut off from the outside world, Tokyo has become a playground for a group of young people who have lost their families, acting as a battlefield for parkour team battles as they leap from building to building.    Hibiki, a young ace known for his dangerous play style, makes a reckless move one day and plummets into the gravity-bending sea. His life is saved by Uta, a girl with mysterious powers. The pair then hear a unique sound audible only to them.    Why did Uta appear before Hibiki? Their encounter leads to a revelation that will change the world.    Kazusa Inaoka (i tell c) will launch the Camellia Curtain (Camellia no Curtain) manga on April 29.     The magazine teases it as a theatre ensemble drama.    Inaoka launched the i tell c manga in Shonen Jump in February 2021. The manga ended in June 2021.    The author launched the Kimi wo Shinryakuseyo! (Invade You) manga in May 2018 in Shueisha's Shonen Jump GIGA magazine and later launched it in Weekly Shonen Jump. The series ended in September 2018.

Netflix describes the anime:    The story is set in Tokyo, after bubbles that broke the laws of gravity rained down upon the world.   Cut off from the outside world, Tokyo has become a playground for a group of young people who have lost their families, acting as a battlefield for parkour team battles as they leap from building to building.    Hibiki, a young ace known for his dangerous play style, makes a reckless move one day and plummets into the gravity-bending sea. His life is saved by Uta, a girl with mysterious powers. The pair then hear a unique sound audible only to them.    Why did Uta appear before Hibiki? Their encounter leads to a revelation that will change the world.

Also Shanks is surprisingly cynical.

Also Shanks is surprisingly cynical.

News Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero Film Rescheduled to June 11 After Toei Animation Hack   posted on 2022-04-14 15:06 UTC-8 by Egan Loo         Originally slated for April 22    Toei announced on Thursday that Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero, the second anime film in the Dragon Ball Super franchise, has been rescheduled for June 11. It had been delayed due to the Toei Animation hack last month. Toei added that the entire staff is putting all their effort into meeting the new release date.      The film was slated to open in Japan on April 22, and then was slated to open in North America this summer. (The CG film's release schedule may differ depending on each country and region.)    As the name suggests, the film will have a focus on the ""superhero"" aspect. Original creator Akira Toriyama is in charge of the screenplay and character design. Planning for the new film project began in 2018, before the release of Dragon Ball Super: Broly. The film has a goal of telling ""a large-scale story."" Aside from story composition and character design, Toriyama is also writing lines of dialogue for the film.    Tetsuro Kodama is directing the film, and Naoki Satō is composing the music. Nobuhito Sue is the art director, Chikashi Kubota is the animation director, and Jae Hoon Jung is the CG director.    Guest cast members include:    Hiroshi Kamiya as Gamma #1   Mamoru Miyano as Gamma #2   Miyu Irino as Dr. Hedo   Volcano Ōta as Magenta   Ryota Takeuchi as Carmine    The staff has previously revealed new character designs for Dende, Korin, and Bulma, and teased that Whis will appear in the film.    The film will be the 21st anime film in the overall Dragon Ball franchise.   Toei Animation announced on March 11 that on March 6, an unauthorized third party accessed the company's network, which resulted in a shutdown of part of the company's systems. Toei Animation is currently investigating the matter. The hack affected the broadcast schedules for the One Piece, Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai, Delicious Party Precure, and Digimon Ghost Game anime, starting with the episodes slated to air on the weekend of March 12-13. All four shows will resume airing new episodes during the April 16-17 weekend.    NHK reported on April 7 that according to its sources at Toei Animation, the  hack was a ransomware attack. NHK quoted a company source as saying, ""the impact on production is still continuing, and we are working hard to bring things back to normal.""

News Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero Film Rescheduled to June 11 After Toei Animation Hack   posted on 2022-04-14 15:06 UTC-8 by Egan Loo         Originally slated for April 22    Toei announced on Thursday that Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero, the second anime film in the Dragon Ball Super franchise, has been rescheduled for June 11. It had been delayed due to the Toei Animation hack last month. Toei added that the entire staff is putting all their effort into meeting the new release date.      The film was slated to open in Japan on April 22, and then was slated to open in North America this summer. (The CG film's release schedule may differ depending on each country and region.)    As the name suggests, the film will have a focus on the ""superhero"" aspect. Original creator Akira Toriyama is in charge of the screenplay and character design. Planning for the new film project began in 2018, before the release of Dragon Ball Super: Broly. The film has a goal of telling ""a large-scale story."" Aside from story composition and character design, Toriyama is also writing lines of dialogue for the film.    Tetsuro Kodama is directing the film, and Naoki Satō is composing the music. Nobuhito Sue is the art director, Chikashi Kubota is the animation director, and Jae Hoon Jung is the CG director.    Guest cast members include:    Hiroshi Kamiya as Gamma #1   Mamoru Miyano as Gamma #2   Miyu Irino as Dr. Hedo   Volcano Ōta as Magenta   Ryota Takeuchi as Carmine    The staff has previously revealed new character designs for Dende, Korin, and Bulma, and teased that Whis will appear in the film.    The film will be the 21st anime film in the overall Dragon Ball franchise.   Toei Animation announced on March 11 that on March 6, an unauthorized third party accessed the company's network, which resulted in a shutdown of part of the company's systems. Toei Animation is currently investigating the matter. The hack affected the broadcast schedules for the One Piece, Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai, Delicious Party Precure, and Digimon Ghost Game anime, starting with the episodes slated to air on the weekend of March 12-13. All four shows will resume airing new episodes during the April 16-17 weekend.    NHK reported on April 7 that according to its sources at Toei Animation, the  hack was a ransomware attack. NHK quoted a company source as saying, ""the impact on production is still continuing, and we are working hard to bring things back to normal.""

News Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero Film Rescheduled to June 11 After Toei Animation Hack   posted on 2022-04-14 15:06 UTC-8 by Egan Loo         Originally slated for April 22    Toei announced on Thursday that Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero, the second anime film in the Dragon Ball Super franchise, has been rescheduled for June 11. It had been delayed due to the Toei Animation hack last month. Toei added that the entire staff is putting all their effort into meeting the new release date.      The film was slated to open in Japan on April 22, and then was slated to open in North America this summer. (The CG film's release schedule may differ depending on each country and region.)    As the name suggests, the film will have a focus on the ""superhero"" aspect. Original creator Akira Toriyama is in charge of the screenplay and character design. Planning for the new film project began in 2018, before the release of Dragon Ball Super: Broly. The film has a goal of telling ""a large-scale story."" Aside from story composition and character design, Toriyama is also writing lines of dialogue for the film.    Tetsuro Kodama is directing the film, and Naoki Satō is composing the music. Nobuhito Sue is the art director, Chikashi Kubota is the animation director, and Jae Hoon Jung is the CG director.    Guest cast members include:    Hiroshi Kamiya as Gamma #1   Mamoru Miyano as Gamma #2   Miyu Irino as Dr. Hedo   Volcano Ōta as Magenta   Ryota Takeuchi as Carmine    The staff has previously revealed new character designs for Dende, Korin, and Bulma, and teased that Whis will appear in the film.    The film will be the 21st anime film in the overall Dragon Ball franchise.   Toei Animation announced on March 11 that on March 6, an unauthorized third party accessed the company's network, which resulted in a shutdown of part of the company's systems. Toei Animation is currently investigating the matter. The hack affected the broadcast schedules for the One Piece, Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai, Delicious Party Precure, and Digimon Ghost Game anime, starting with the episodes slated to air on the weekend of March 12-13. All four shows will resume airing new episodes during the April 16-17 weekend.    NHK reported on April 7 that according to its sources at Toei Animation, the  hack was a ransomware attack. NHK quoted a company source as saying, ""the impact on production is still continuing, and we are working hard to bring things back to normal.""

It had been delayed due to the Toei Animation hack last month. Toei added that the entire staff is putting all their effort into meeting the new release date.      The film was slated to open in Japan on April 22, and then was slated to open in North America this summer. (The CG film's release schedule may differ depending on each country and region.)    As the name suggests, the film will have a focus on the ""superhero"" aspect. Original creator Akira Toriyama is in charge of the screenplay and character design. Planning for the new film project began in 2018, before the release of Dragon Ball Super: Broly. The film has a goal of telling ""a large-scale story."" Aside from story composition and character design, Toriyama is also writing lines of dialogue for the film.    Tetsuro Kodama is directing the film, and Naoki Satō is composing the music. Nobuhito Sue is the art director, Chikashi Kubota is the animation director, and Jae Hoon Jung is the CG director.    Guest cast members include:    Hiroshi Kamiya as Gamma #1   Mamoru Miyano as Gamma #2   Miyu Irino as Dr. Hedo   Volcano Ōta as Magenta   Ryota Takeuchi as Carmine    The staff has previously revealed new character designs for Dende, Korin, and Bulma, and teased that Whis will appear in the film.    The film will be the 21st anime film in the overall Dragon Ball franchise.   Toei Animation announced on March 11 that on March 6, an unauthorized third party accessed the company's network, which resulted in a shutdown of part of the company's systems. Toei Animation is currently investigating the matter. The hack affected the broadcast schedules for the One Piece, Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai, Delicious Party Precure, and Digimon Ghost Game anime, starting with the episodes slated to air on the weekend of March 12-13. All four shows will resume airing new episodes during the April 16-17 weekend.    NHK reported on April 7 that according to its sources at Toei Animation, the  hack was a ransomware attack. NHK quoted a company source as saying, ""the impact on production is still continuing, and we are working hard to bring things back to normal.""

News Akari Akase's Ending Theme Song for My Dress-Up Darling Anime Streamed 7 Million Times   posted on 2022-04-14 23:35 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         Music video debuted on January 9    The music video for Akari Akase's ""Koi no Yukue"" (Where Love Is), the ending theme song for the television anime of Shinichi Fukuda's My Dress-Up Darling (Sono Bisque Doll wa Koi wo Suru), has been streamed over seven million times since its release about three months ago. The song's music video debuted on January 9:      TikTok personality Akase debuted her singing career with the song.    The anime premiered on January 9. Funimation streamed the anime as it aired in Japan, and is also streaming an English dub. Crunchyroll is also streaming the anime and English dub.    Square Enix Manga & Books publishes the manga in English, and it describes the story:    Traumatized by a childhood incident with a friend who took exception to his love of traditional dolls, doll-artisan hopeful Wakana Gojō passes his days as a loner, finding solace in the home ec room at his high school. To Wakana, people like beautiful Marin Kitagawa, a trendy girl who's always surrounded by a throng of friends, is practically an alien from another world. But when cheerful Marin--never one to be shy--spots Wakana sewing away one day after school, she barges in with the aim of roping her quiet classmate into her secret hobby: cosplay.

News Akari Akase's Ending Theme Song for My Dress-Up Darling Anime Streamed 7 Million Times   posted on 2022-04-14 23:35 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         Music video debuted on January 9    The music video for Akari Akase's ""Koi no Yukue"" (Where Love Is), the ending theme song for the television anime of Shinichi Fukuda's My Dress-Up Darling (Sono Bisque Doll wa Koi wo Suru), has been streamed over seven million times since its release about three months ago. The song's music video debuted on January 9:      TikTok personality Akase debuted her singing career with the song.    The anime premiered on January 9. Funimation streamed the anime as it aired in Japan, and is also streaming an English dub. Crunchyroll is also streaming the anime and English dub.    Square Enix Manga & Books publishes the manga in English, and it describes the story:    Traumatized by a childhood incident with a friend who took exception to his love of traditional dolls, doll-artisan hopeful Wakana Gojō passes his days as a loner, finding solace in the home ec room at his high school. To Wakana, people like beautiful Marin Kitagawa, a trendy girl who's always surrounded by a throng of friends, is practically an alien from another world. But when cheerful Marin--never one to be shy--spots Wakana sewing away one day after school, she barges in with the aim of roping her quiet classmate into her secret hobby: cosplay.   The manga launched in Squre Enix's Young Gangan magazine in January 2018. Square Enix published the manga's ninth volume on March 25. Square Enix Manga & Books will publish the fifth volume in English on April 26.

News Akari Akase's Ending Theme Song for My Dress-Up Darling Anime Streamed 7 Million Times   posted on 2022-04-14 23:35 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         Music video debuted on January 9    The music video for Akari Akase's ""Koi no Yukue"" (Where Love Is), the ending theme song for the television anime of Shinichi Fukuda's My Dress-Up Darling (Sono Bisque Doll wa Koi wo Suru), has been streamed over seven million times since its release about three months ago. The song's music video debuted on January 9:      TikTok personality Akase debuted her singing career with the song.    The anime premiered on January 9. Funimation streamed the anime as it aired in Japan, and is also streaming an English dub. Crunchyroll is also streaming the anime and English dub.    Square Enix Manga & Books publishes the manga in English, and it describes the story:    Traumatized by a childhood incident with a friend who took exception to his love of traditional dolls, doll-artisan hopeful Wakana Gojō passes his days as a loner, finding solace in the home ec room at his high school. To Wakana, people like beautiful Marin Kitagawa, a trendy girl who's always surrounded by a throng of friends, is practically an alien from another world. But when cheerful Marin--never one to be shy--spots Wakana sewing away one day after school, she barges in with the aim of roping her quiet classmate into her secret hobby: cosplay.   The manga launched in Squre Enix's Young Gangan magazine in January 2018. Square Enix published the manga's ninth volume on March 25. Square Enix Manga & Books will publish the fifth volume in English on April 26.

My Dress-Up Darling Episode 12  by MrAJCosplay/Cartoon Cipher, Mar 28th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of My Dress-Up Darling ?                     Community score: 4.7            Because the fanservice and the cosplay insights are oftentimes My Dress-Up Darling's biggest attention grabbers – as well as being some of the primary elements the show is marketed on – I was genuinely shocked when it decided to end on a note that embraces neither of those things. Instead, this episode cements My Dress-Up Darling as a romance about two characters coming into their own all along, and while I think the show could have definitely made this more of a focus earlier on, it still makes for one of the best season finales one could hope for.    In terms of narrative progression, there's not a lot that goes on in this episode. We don't really see a lot of the other characters we got introduced to outside of the main duo, and cosplay is barely even mentioned aside from one or two small conversation points (my favorite is the scene towards the beginning where Gojo isn't affected by a horror movie because he's focusing so hard on things like the makeup and costume design). This is just an episode about Gojo and Kitagawa living out the last days of their summer break, spending time together and fortifying the foundation of their relationship that has been slowly building up to this point. We get scenes of Kitagawa getting in over her head and needing to rely on Gojo to help keep her steady, and it's clear that Gojo appreciates Kitagawa for taking him out to experience things that he never really got the chance to. It's not like there was really anything stopping him from experiencing these things on his own, but this boy had grown to be so accepting of his loneliness due to his childhood trauma that he probably just came to his own conclusion that he could never be a part of social gatherings like that. So Kitagawa not only going with him to the festival but also casually bringing up that they will do more things together next year means the world to him, and those quiet moments where he's just staring off into the scenery or appreciating the beautiful ball of energy that steamrolled into his life genuinely moved me.    A couple reviews ago I mentioned how I almost didn't want these two to get together too quickly despite Kitagawa realizing her feelings for Gojo early on, as I think the characters needed to come to terms with how they view themselves before they would be ready to commit to something like a romantic relationship. This episode was definitely a step in that direction as Gojo begins to further appreciate and accept the fact that he does not need to be alone anymore while Kitagawa continues to rely on Gojo as a source of support and understanding. I love these two characters and I look forward to the day when I might be able to see them come together as equals. Despite all of the unabashed horniness and some questionable and borderline problematic practices the show touches upon, you will never convince me that My Dress Up Darling doesn't have a heart. It might take some time to get it, and some might feel like it's not worth trying to find in the first place, but that heart was strong enough to carry me all the way to the end of the show and also consider it one of the better slice of life anime that I've seen in a bit.

My Dress-Up Darling Episode 12  by MrAJCosplay/Cartoon Cipher, Mar 28th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of My Dress-Up Darling ?                     Community score: 4.7            Because the fanservice and the cosplay insights are oftentimes My Dress-Up Darling's biggest attention grabbers – as well as being some of the primary elements the show is marketed on – I was genuinely shocked when it decided to end on a note that embraces neither of those things. Instead, this episode cements My Dress-Up Darling as a romance about two characters coming into their own all along, and while I think the show could have definitely made this more of a focus earlier on, it still makes for one of the best season finales one could hope for.    In terms of narrative progression, there's not a lot that goes on in this episode. We don't really see a lot of the other characters we got introduced to outside of the main duo, and cosplay is barely even mentioned aside from one or two small conversation points (my favorite is the scene towards the beginning where Gojo isn't affected by a horror movie because he's focusing so hard on things like the makeup and costume design). This is just an episode about Gojo and Kitagawa living out the last days of their summer break, spending time together and fortifying the foundation of their relationship that has been slowly building up to this point. We get scenes of Kitagawa getting in over her head and needing to rely on Gojo to help keep her steady, and it's clear that Gojo appreciates Kitagawa for taking him out to experience things that he never really got the chance to. It's not like there was really anything stopping him from experiencing these things on his own, but this boy had grown to be so accepting of his loneliness due to his childhood trauma that he probably just came to his own conclusion that he could never be a part of social gatherings like that. So Kitagawa not only going with him to the festival but also casually bringing up that they will do more things together next year means the world to him, and those quiet moments where he's just staring off into the scenery or appreciating the beautiful ball of energy that steamrolled into his life genuinely moved me.    A couple reviews ago I mentioned how I almost didn't want these two to get together too quickly despite Kitagawa realizing her feelings for Gojo early on, as I think the characters needed to come to terms with how they view themselves before they would be ready to commit to something like a romantic relationship. This episode was definitely a step in that direction as Gojo begins to further appreciate and accept the fact that he does not need to be alone anymore while Kitagawa continues to rely on Gojo as a source of support and understanding. I love these two characters and I look forward to the day when I might be able to see them come together as equals. Despite all of the unabashed horniness and some questionable and borderline problematic practices the show touches upon, you will never convince me that My Dress Up Darling doesn't have a heart. It might take some time to get it, and some might feel like it's not worth trying to find in the first place, but that heart was strong enough to carry me all the way to the end of the show and also consider it one of the better slice of life anime that I've seen in a bit.

My Dress-Up Darling Episode 12  by MrAJCosplay/Cartoon Cipher, Mar 28th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of My Dress-Up Darling ?                     Community score: 4.7            Because the fanservice and the cosplay insights are oftentimes My Dress-Up Darling's biggest attention grabbers – as well as being some of the primary elements the show is marketed on – I was genuinely shocked when it decided to end on a note that embraces neither of those things. Instead, this episode cements My Dress-Up Darling as a romance about two characters coming into their own all along, and while I think the show could have definitely made this more of a focus earlier on, it still makes for one of the best season finales one could hope for.    In terms of narrative progression, there's not a lot that goes on in this episode. We don't really see a lot of the other characters we got introduced to outside of the main duo, and cosplay is barely even mentioned aside from one or two small conversation points (my favorite is the scene towards the beginning where Gojo isn't affected by a horror movie because he's focusing so hard on things like the makeup and costume design). This is just an episode about Gojo and Kitagawa living out the last days of their summer break, spending time together and fortifying the foundation of their relationship that has been slowly building up to this point. We get scenes of Kitagawa getting in over her head and needing to rely on Gojo to help keep her steady, and it's clear that Gojo appreciates Kitagawa for taking him out to experience things that he never really got the chance to. It's not like there was really anything stopping him from experiencing these things on his own, but this boy had grown to be so accepting of his loneliness due to his childhood trauma that he probably just came to his own conclusion that he could never be a part of social gatherings like that. So Kitagawa not only going with him to the festival but also casually bringing up that they will do more things together next year means the world to him, and those quiet moments where he's just staring off into the scenery or appreciating the beautiful ball of energy that steamrolled into his life genuinely moved me.    A couple reviews ago I mentioned how I almost didn't want these two to get together too quickly despite Kitagawa realizing her feelings for Gojo early on, as I think the characters needed to come to terms with how they view themselves before they would be ready to commit to something like a romantic relationship. This episode was definitely a step in that direction as Gojo begins to further appreciate and accept the fact that he does not need to be alone anymore while Kitagawa continues to rely on Gojo as a source of support and understanding. I love these two characters and I look forward to the day when I might be able to see them come together as equals. Despite all of the unabashed horniness and some questionable and borderline problematic practices the show touches upon, you will never convince me that My Dress Up Darling doesn't have a heart. It might take some time to get it, and some might feel like it's not worth trying to find in the first place, but that heart was strong enough to carry me all the way to the end of the show and also consider it one of the better slice of life anime that I've seen in a bit.    Rating:                 My Dress-Up Darling is currently streaming on Crunchyroll and Funimation.   <prevEpisode 1-2 Episode 3 Episode 4 Episode 5 Episode 6 Episode 7 Episode 8 Episode 9 Episode 10 Episode 11 Episode 12     discuss this in the forum (341 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               back to My Dress-Up Darling Episode Review homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          3 comments       Jujutsu Kaisen Stage Play's Video Introduces Cast in Costume   Apr 15, 07:02 3 comments                 live-action    Ryūji Satō, Ryosuke Miura star in July-August play ― A press conference for the stage play of Gege Akutami's Jujutsu Kaisen manga introduced the production's promotional video, main cast, and other details on Wednesday.

My Dress-Up Darling Episode 12  by MrAJCosplay/Cartoon Cipher, Mar 28th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of My Dress-Up Darling ?                     Community score: 4.7            Because the fanservice and the cosplay insights are oftentimes My Dress-Up Darling's biggest attention grabbers – as well as being some of the primary elements the show is marketed on – I was genuinely shocked when it decided to end on a note that embraces neither of those things. Instead, this episode cements My Dress-Up Darling as a romance about two characters coming into their own all along, and while I think the show could have definitely made this more of a focus earlier on, it still makes for one of the best season finales one could hope for.    In terms of narrative progression, there's not a lot that goes on in this episode. We don't really see a lot of the other characters we got introduced to outside of the main duo, and cosplay is barely even mentioned aside from one or two small conversation points (my favorite is the scene towards the beginning where Gojo isn't affected by a horror movie because he's focusing so hard on things like the makeup and costume design). This is just an episode about Gojo and Kitagawa living out the last days of their summer break, spending time together and fortifying the foundation of their relationship that has been slowly building up to this point. We get scenes of Kitagawa getting in over her head and needing to rely on Gojo to help keep her steady, and it's clear that Gojo appreciates Kitagawa for taking him out to experience things that he never really got the chance to. It's not like there was really anything stopping him from experiencing these things on his own, but this boy had grown to be so accepting of his loneliness due to his childhood trauma that he probably just came to his own conclusion that he could never be a part of social gatherings like that. So Kitagawa not only going with him to the festival but also casually bringing up that they will do more things together next year means the world to him, and those quiet moments where he's just staring off into the scenery or appreciating the beautiful ball of energy that steamrolled into his life genuinely moved me.    A couple reviews ago I mentioned how I almost didn't want these two to get together too quickly despite Kitagawa realizing her feelings for Gojo early on, as I think the characters needed to come to terms with how they view themselves before they would be ready to commit to something like a romantic relationship. This episode was definitely a step in that direction as Gojo begins to further appreciate and accept the fact that he does not need to be alone anymore while Kitagawa continues to rely on Gojo as a source of support and understanding. I love these two characters and I look forward to the day when I might be able to see them come together as equals. Despite all of the unabashed horniness and some questionable and borderline problematic practices the show touches upon, you will never convince me that My Dress Up Darling doesn't have a heart. It might take some time to get it, and some might feel like it's not worth trying to find in the first place, but that heart was strong enough to carry me all the way to the end of the show and also consider it one of the better slice of life anime that I've seen in a bit.

A couple reviews ago I mentioned how I almost didn't want these two to get together too quickly despite Kitagawa realizing her feelings for Gojo early on, as I think the characters needed to come to terms with how they view themselves before they would be ready to commit to something like a romantic relationship. This episode was definitely a step in that direction as Gojo begins to further appreciate and accept the fact that he does not need to be alone anymore while Kitagawa continues to rely on Gojo as a source of support and understanding. I love these two characters and I look forward to the day when I might be able to see them come together as equals. Despite all of the unabashed horniness and some questionable and borderline problematic practices the show touches upon, you will never convince me that My Dress Up Darling doesn't have a heart. It might take some time to get it, and some might feel like it's not worth trying to find in the first place, but that heart was strong enough to carry me all the way to the end of the show and also consider it one of the better slice of life anime that I've seen in a bit.

Community score: 4.7            Because the fanservice and the cosplay insights are oftentimes My Dress-Up Darling's biggest attention grabbers – as well as being some of the primary elements the show is marketed on – I was genuinely shocked when it decided to end on a note that embraces neither of those things.

In terms of narrative progression, there's not a lot that goes on in this episode. We don't really see a lot of the other characters we got introduced to outside of the main duo, and cosplay is barely even mentioned aside from one or two small conversation points (my favorite is the scene towards the beginning where Gojo isn't affected by a horror movie because he's focusing so hard on things like the makeup and costume design). This is just an episode about Gojo and Kitagawa living out the last days of their summer break, spending time together and fortifying the foundation of their relationship that has been slowly building up to this point. We get scenes of Kitagawa getting in over her head and needing to rely on Gojo to help keep her steady, and it's clear that Gojo appreciates Kitagawa for taking him out to experience things that he never really got the chance to.

News Live-Action Whisper of the Heart Sequel Film Rescheduled to October 14 After COVID-19 Delay   posted on 2022-04-13 09:16 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda          Runa Yasuhara, Tsubasa Nakagawa play Shizuku, Seiji in middle school    The official website for the live-action sequel film based on Aoi Hiiragi's Whisper of the Heart (Mimi o Sumaseba) manga unveiled a new teaser trailer, two teaser visuals, more cast members, and the new October 14 opening date for the film on Wednesday.       The teaser ends with narration by Youko Honna, the voice of Shizuku Tsukishima in Studio Ghibli's anime film.     The live-action film was originally slated to open on September 18, 2020, but was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.    The newly announced cast members include Runa Yasuhara and Tsubasa Nakagawa as Shizuku and Seiji, respectively, as they were in middle school.     The film stars Nana Seino (live-action Kyou Kara Ore Wa!!, After the Rain, Nowhere Girl, Tokyo Tribe films, left in image above) as Shizuku Tsukishima, and Tori Matsuzaka (Hello World, Himitsu - Top Secret, .hack//The Movie, Gatchaman, Kyō, Koi o Hajimemasu, Samurai Sentai Shinkenger,  right) as Seiji Amasawa. Yūichirō Hirakawa (live-action The Promised Neverland, ERASED/Boku dake ga Inai Machi, Waiting for Spring, Rookies, JIN projects) is directing the movie, which Sony Pictures Entertainment and Shochiku will distribute.    The new film's story is set 10 years after the original manga's story. Now 24, Shizuku has given up her dream of being a novelist, but works hard every day to sell books as a children's book editor at a publishing company. Meanwhile, Seiji is still following his dream abroad, even as the distance between him and Shizuku grows ever larger.    The original manga inspired an anime film by Yoshifumi Kondō and Studio Ghibli in 1995. The story follows junior high school bookworm Shizuku as she has a chance encounter with a mysterious antique shop, and the boy Seiji Amasawa, the grandson of the shop's owner. A novice violin maker, Seiji has also attracted Shizuku's attention as she has noticed for a while that his name is written on the checkout cards of the books she borrows from the library. Seiji's passion for violin-making inspires Shizuku to pursue her dream of writing a novel.    Hiiragi published the manga in Shueisha's shōjo manga magazine  Ribon in 1989. Hiiragi published a sequel manga titled Mimi o Sumaseba: Shiawase na Jikan in 1995, and a spinoff titled Baron: The Cat Returns in 2002. Viz Media published Baron: The Cat Returns in English. That manga inspired Hiroyuki Morita and Studio Ghibli's The Cat Returns film in 2002.

News Live-Action Whisper of the Heart Sequel Film Rescheduled to October 14 After COVID-19 Delay   posted on 2022-04-13 09:16 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda          Runa Yasuhara, Tsubasa Nakagawa play Shizuku, Seiji in middle school    The official website for the live-action sequel film based on Aoi Hiiragi's Whisper of the Heart (Mimi o Sumaseba) manga unveiled a new teaser trailer, two teaser visuals, more cast members, and the new October 14 opening date for the film on Wednesday.       The teaser ends with narration by Youko Honna, the voice of Shizuku Tsukishima in Studio Ghibli's anime film.     The live-action film was originally slated to open on September 18, 2020, but was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.    The newly announced cast members include Runa Yasuhara and Tsubasa Nakagawa as Shizuku and Seiji, respectively, as they were in middle school.     The film stars Nana Seino (live-action Kyou Kara Ore Wa!!, After the Rain, Nowhere Girl, Tokyo Tribe films, left in image above) as Shizuku Tsukishima, and Tori Matsuzaka (Hello World, Himitsu - Top Secret, .hack//The Movie, Gatchaman, Kyō, Koi o Hajimemasu, Samurai Sentai Shinkenger,  right) as Seiji Amasawa. Yūichirō Hirakawa (live-action The Promised Neverland, ERASED/Boku dake ga Inai Machi, Waiting for Spring, Rookies, JIN projects) is directing the movie, which Sony Pictures Entertainment and Shochiku will distribute.    The new film's story is set 10 years after the original manga's story. Now 24, Shizuku has given up her dream of being a novelist, but works hard every day to sell books as a children's book editor at a publishing company. Meanwhile, Seiji is still following his dream abroad, even as the distance between him and Shizuku grows ever larger.    The original manga inspired an anime film by Yoshifumi Kondō and Studio Ghibli in 1995. The story follows junior high school bookworm Shizuku as she has a chance encounter with a mysterious antique shop, and the boy Seiji Amasawa, the grandson of the shop's owner. A novice violin maker, Seiji has also attracted Shizuku's attention as she has noticed for a while that his name is written on the checkout cards of the books she borrows from the library. Seiji's passion for violin-making inspires Shizuku to pursue her dream of writing a novel.    Hiiragi published the manga in Shueisha's shōjo manga magazine  Ribon in 1989. Hiiragi published a sequel manga titled Mimi o Sumaseba: Shiawase na Jikan in 1995, and a spinoff titled Baron: The Cat Returns in 2002. Viz Media published Baron: The Cat Returns in English. That manga inspired Hiroyuki Morita and Studio Ghibli's The Cat Returns film in 2002.

News Live-Action Whisper of the Heart Sequel Film Rescheduled to October 14 After COVID-19 Delay   posted on 2022-04-13 09:16 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda          Runa Yasuhara, Tsubasa Nakagawa play Shizuku, Seiji in middle school    The official website for the live-action sequel film based on Aoi Hiiragi's Whisper of the Heart (Mimi o Sumaseba) manga unveiled a new teaser trailer, two teaser visuals, more cast members, and the new October 14 opening date for the film on Wednesday.       The teaser ends with narration by Youko Honna, the voice of Shizuku Tsukishima in Studio Ghibli's anime film.     The live-action film was originally slated to open on September 18, 2020, but was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.    The newly announced cast members include Runa Yasuhara and Tsubasa Nakagawa as Shizuku and Seiji, respectively, as they were in middle school.     The film stars Nana Seino (live-action Kyou Kara Ore Wa!!, After the Rain, Nowhere Girl, Tokyo Tribe films, left in image above) as Shizuku Tsukishima, and Tori Matsuzaka (Hello World, Himitsu - Top Secret, .hack//The Movie, Gatchaman, Kyō, Koi o Hajimemasu, Samurai Sentai Shinkenger,  right) as Seiji Amasawa. Yūichirō Hirakawa (live-action The Promised Neverland, ERASED/Boku dake ga Inai Machi, Waiting for Spring, Rookies, JIN projects) is directing the movie, which Sony Pictures Entertainment and Shochiku will distribute.    The new film's story is set 10 years after the original manga's story. Now 24, Shizuku has given up her dream of being a novelist, but works hard every day to sell books as a children's book editor at a publishing company. Meanwhile, Seiji is still following his dream abroad, even as the distance between him and Shizuku grows ever larger.    The original manga inspired an anime film by Yoshifumi Kondō and Studio Ghibli in 1995. The story follows junior high school bookworm Shizuku as she has a chance encounter with a mysterious antique shop, and the boy Seiji Amasawa, the grandson of the shop's owner. A novice violin maker, Seiji has also attracted Shizuku's attention as she has noticed for a while that his name is written on the checkout cards of the books she borrows from the library. Seiji's passion for violin-making inspires Shizuku to pursue her dream of writing a novel.    Hiiragi published the manga in Shueisha's shōjo manga magazine  Ribon in 1989. Hiiragi published a sequel manga titled Mimi o Sumaseba: Shiawase na Jikan in 1995, and a spinoff titled Baron: The Cat Returns in 2002. Viz Media published Baron: The Cat Returns in English.

News Live-Action Whisper of the Heart Sequel Film Rescheduled to October 14 After COVID-19 Delay   posted on 2022-04-13 09:16 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda          Runa Yasuhara, Tsubasa Nakagawa play Shizuku, Seiji in middle school    The official website for the live-action sequel film based on Aoi Hiiragi's Whisper of the Heart (Mimi o Sumaseba) manga unveiled a new teaser trailer, two teaser visuals, more cast members, and the new October 14 opening date for the film on Wednesday.       The teaser ends with narration by Youko Honna, the voice of Shizuku Tsukishima in Studio Ghibli's anime film.     The live-action film was originally slated to open on September 18, 2020, but was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.    The newly announced cast members include Runa Yasuhara and Tsubasa Nakagawa as Shizuku and Seiji, respectively, as they were in middle school.     The film stars Nana Seino (live-action Kyou Kara Ore Wa!!, After the Rain, Nowhere Girl, Tokyo Tribe films, left in image above) as Shizuku Tsukishima, and Tori Matsuzaka (Hello World, Himitsu - Top Secret, .hack//The Movie, Gatchaman, Kyō, Koi o Hajimemasu, Samurai Sentai Shinkenger,  right) as Seiji Amasawa. Yūichirō Hirakawa (live-action The Promised Neverland, ERASED/Boku dake ga Inai Machi, Waiting for Spring, Rookies, JIN projects) is directing the movie, which Sony Pictures Entertainment and Shochiku will distribute.    The new film's story is set 10 years after the original manga's story. Now 24, Shizuku has given up her dream of being a novelist, but works hard every day to sell books as a children's book editor at a publishing company. Meanwhile, Seiji is still following his dream abroad, even as the distance between him and Shizuku grows ever larger.    The original manga inspired an anime film by Yoshifumi Kondō and Studio Ghibli in 1995. The story follows junior high school bookworm Shizuku as she has a chance encounter with a mysterious antique shop, and the boy Seiji Amasawa, the grandson of the shop's owner. A novice violin maker, Seiji has also attracted Shizuku's attention as she has noticed for a while that his name is written on the checkout cards of the books she borrows from the library. Seiji's passion for violin-making inspires Shizuku to pursue her dream of writing a novel.    Hiiragi published the manga in Shueisha's shōjo manga magazine  Ribon in 1989. Hiiragi published a sequel manga titled Mimi o Sumaseba: Shiawase na Jikan in 1995, and a spinoff titled Baron: The Cat Returns in 2002. Viz Media published Baron: The Cat Returns in English. That manga inspired Hiroyuki Morita and Studio Ghibli's The Cat Returns film in 2002.

Hiiragi published a sequel manga titled Mimi o Sumaseba: Shiawase na Jikan in 1995, and a spinoff titled Baron: The Cat Returns in 2002. Viz Media published Baron: The Cat Returns in English. That manga inspired Hiroyuki Morita and Studio Ghibli's The Cat Returns film in 2002.
