This Week in Anime Your Tiger & Bunny Primer  by Jean-Karlo Lemus & Monique Thomas, Apr 12th 2022           Want to know what all the hubbub is about the superhero series Tiger & Bunny but haven't seen the original season? Fear not, citizens! The recap movie and sequel are on Netflix right now and Jean-Karlo and Nicky are ready to give you the official This Week in Anime™ experience.    These movies are streaming on Netflix   Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the participants in this chatlog are not the views of Anime News Network.Spoiler Warning for discussion of the series ahead.     @Lossthief    @mouse_inhouse    @NickyEnchilada    @vestenet      Nicky  Hey, everybody, it's me and Jean-Karlo here, and today we announce that due to recent changes in upper-management This Week in Anime will include regular shout-outs to sponsors!     Jean-Karlo  This week's This Week in Anime was brought to you by Crab! It all comes crawling back to Crab™!     Crab and very region-specific Pepsi sounds like an interesting flavor combo, NGL. But still not as interesting of a combo as the hero duo Tiger & Bunny!     The original Tiger & Bunny anime came out a bit before the massive influx of superheroes became the mono-culture in the U.S. And weirdly enough, it's taken this long for the series to come back with a new season. Netflix is also streaming two movies for the Tiger & Bunny series, The Beginning and The Rising.   These two films came out in 2012 and 2014 respectively but have just now been re-released for streaming on Netflix in honor of that hot new second season. The Beginning is half re-cap of the early part of the series and serves as a great re-introduction for our Super Hero Buddy Cops, while The Rising takes place after the series proper with entirely new material.     Now, I love me some Japanese superheroes, especially the old blood. Yatterman, Gatchaman, Kamen Rider, Casshern, Ultraman, that stuff. And I was always interested in how Japan would handle a take on more Americanized superheroes. Tiger & Bunny has been beloved by fans since its premiere, and not just because of the wave of heroes the Mouse of House churns out on a daily basis. It's a fascinating show, all the way down to the folks wearing those fancy sponsored CG costumes.   Tiger & Bunny is conceptually rich because it fully breaks down the idea of commercialized heroing as an industry, including real company sponsors (which leads to some funny dissonance). The heroes of Sternbild receive live TV coverage and toe the line between being enforcers, performers, and public motivators, along with everything else that life throws at them, on and off the cameras. The focus on the corporate inner workings is part of what makes it feel more mature. It's not just some kids' fantasy of saving people, but a more detailed look at what would happen if someone really tried to make this their job.   Normally, all the heroes compete for points with each other. But when veteran Wild Tiger, real name Kotetsu Kaburagi, moves to a new company after his previous one folds, he's paired with the young and ambitious Barnaby Brooks Jr., to which he affectionally nicknames Bunny, much to his new partner's annoyance.      What makes Tiger & Bunny work – unlike a lot of ""these heroes are realistic!"" joints like The Boys – is that it's not relentlessly dour. The characters aren't irredeemable louts or psychopaths, they're just people trying to make an honest living while living under the whims of an unfeeling, uncaring management system. These people live or die by their sponsors. It's more Mystery Men than anything else, and that's a damn original place to start from when you're making a superhero movie.   It also leans heavily into the showbiz stuff more than any other cape thing I had watched before, but if anything its core is its ensemble cast of heroes and trying to build the companionship between the two main characters. Like many stories about manly bonds, the two of them start out pretty prickly at first, but both have also suffered severe losses of love in their lives. Kotetsu has a 10-year-old daughter he keeps his work secret from, and has previously lost his wife. Barnaby lost his family to a tragic (extremely plot related) incident that left him traumatized. Just knowing this, you can see how much they could benefit from having someone else to call family in their life. Y'know, assuming you could get one of them to open up.     Kotetsu is a really compelling character, and not just because he's a handsome fail-dad with a stylish outfit. He just needs some loving heart to make him better, or worse, that's a fantasy, too. He's goofy and his sense of heroism really doesn't jive with the mercenary world he's in, but rather than feeling like an idiot he just feels quaint. He's not wrong to want to help people, he's just shouldering more weight than he can carry because he just cares about people that much.     He's definitely meant to appeal to an older audience, a rarity for anime, and he's the the heart of the show despite being a lame guy who struggles to keep up with the younger competition. He constantly lets people down, including his own daughter, but you can tell he really values people's feelings just as much as being a hero.     As if to underline it all: his is the only ""conventional"" superhero outfit among all the other heroes. Everyone else has a fancy suit of armor, but Wild Tiger insists on a cape, a themed cowl, and a strongman suit. Even when he gets his updated power suit, he still wears his old one underneath. You can see him wearing the mask inside his helmet.   Barnaby however is the complete opposite, all suped up in the latest tech and uses his real name and face. He instantly saves Kotetsu's sorry ass and is eager to climb up the ladder. They also both happen to share the same type of power, including the fact that both of them have a time limit to use it.      Where Kotetsu wants to be a hero out of a genuine-to-a-fault desire to help people, Barnaby is wholly self-interested... or so he tells himself. He's convinced that putting his identity out there and acting as a hero can get him the funds and recognition he needs to track down the Oroboros group, the crime ring involved with the  murder of his parents. He may not want to care about other people, but he still cares nevertheless. Not that he'd ever admit it to such an embarrassing dad like Kotetsu.   Also, in a twist of fate, Barnaby Brooks Jr is Kotetsu's daughter's favorite superhero. Not even Wild Tiger. Eesh.      Kotetsu's old school ways doesn't make him popular, even with his own daughter. He was inspired by the King of Old Timers, Mr. Legend, so it makes sense that he clings to those ideals. Many people with super powers in this world – referred to as NEXT – don't always fit in when their powers are fresh and new, and even so, not everyone is fit to be a hero.      This is explored a bit more in The Rising, but a lot of NEXTs have powers that just skirt the line of being useful. Stuff like producing a toxin that just makes you really itchy. Or making your hand grow really, really big. Or, like... being really good at swimming. Kotetsu himself rides that line, partially because of his shtick, partially because his power on its own isn't the best (he can make himself one-hundred times stronger for a short period of time), and partially because he tends to leap before he looks. Like My Hero Academia and its many characters that have wholly-pedestrian Quirks, a lot of heroes in Tiger & Bunny just aren't meant for the big leagues.   When the series begins, Kotetsu is at least doing well enough to stand alongside the biggest heroes in the city: the immovable Rock Bison, the scaredy-cat ninja Origami Cyclone, the thunder-wielding Dragon Kid, the literally-flaming Fire Emblem, the King of Heroes Sky High, and the ice-wielding idol Blue Rose.       And even in The Beginning we really see how Kotetsu helps bring these people together. At first they don't really have much comradery with each other, they might even get in each other's way, something the villain of the first movie actively uses against all of them. But by the time The Rising happens you can really feel how they've grown close.   As always, the villain is capitalism. Because all of the heroes are part of Hero TV, a superhero reality tv show, they're all rated on their actions. You earn points for saving citizens and preventing disasters, but lose points if you fail to capture criminals or if they give you the slip. Getting points is important because you cannot become a hero without a sponsor, and doing well means your sponsor is happy. Happy sponsors, happy network, happy hero. Thus, it's against their best interests to help each other out: each hero scrambles for as many points as they can get.    This is also part of why Kotetsu is such a bomb in the ratings: much to his producer's chagrin, he values people's lives over ratings or network shares, so instead of waiting for a commercial break to let the audience get excited he goes and just tries to save people anyway.      Other than the recap portion of the movie, the plot of The Beginning is that someone nabs the city's very important golden statue of justice and nobody can catch the crook. All the heroes run around, get bamboozled by his power to swap places, and it's really just a fun excuse to allow the cast run around and interact. Anime movies often feel bad for being superfluous, but since Tiger & Bunny the series has quite a few episodes dedicated to just building up the characters, it doesn't really feel out of place for the franchise.     It helps that the other heroes aren't terribly complicated and nevertheless get plenty of scenes to themselves. When the team is called out to arrest thief Robin Baxter, they all go their separate ways... together. Dragon Kid and Blue Rose talk about earrings. Fire Emblem... flirts with Rock Bison. Sky High shows off his wind-control powers to Origami Cyclone, showing an uncharacteristically fun-loving side of himself. It's good stuff that does a good job of letting the cast start to see themselves as more than just competitors.       They each get their moments, whether it's Sky High being a little ""up in the clouds"" even though he's currently the top-rated hero, Rock Bison and Kotetsu being Old Guys together as pals at the bottom of the rankings, or Blue Rose's hilariously cheesy mandated catchphrase.   I also wanna point out that I love the character designs in Tiger & Bunny. It's not just Kotetsu's fancy outfits or Barnaby's flowing locks – everyone in this series looks amazing. Masakazu Katsura was brought onboard to handle character designs; he worked on the superhero-flavored Zetman but he's also known for the romantic comedies D.N.A.², Video Girl Ai, and I''s. His charming character designs are fantastic.   ... Also, he did a manga called Wingman about a toku-themed superhero and I'm dying to see that get brought back someday.    They're also more semi-realistic than most anime even ten years ago and it works better since most of the characters are older. The downside is that it makes them harder to animate too, so expect them to look off-model in places. But I think overall the movies look good even compared to today's standards, including the heavy use of CG for the suits and the action.     As it turns out, the CG is on purpose: because many of the costumes would otherwise have to be redrawn if sponsors for the heroes changed (or if the sponsorship brands had to be removed for foreign markets), it's just easier to render them as CG models. The only one who gets traditional animation is Blue Rose, partly because it's hard to shove a logo on her skimpy outfit, partly because she's T&B's source of T&A.     Which becomes upsetting when you remember she's supposed to be in high school still, for some reason. Why are there no adult female superheroes?!   Nobody said idol culture was healthy... A detail the movies leave out from the series is that Blue Rose might have romantic inclinations towards Kotetsu, who's like... twice her age. Thank goodness. Also, because let's be honest, Kotetsu and Barnaby all the way. A family can be a little girl and her two bickering superhero dads.     That's touched on in the series but I prefer to see it as a ""hero crush"" rather than just being hot for a single dad since she obviously takes Kotetsu's ideals to heart after a point. But it's not strong enough to get in the way of Kotetsu and Barnaby's intense married couple energy. The series very much leans in on the ""partner"" thing in more than just a joke or tongue-in-cheek way; they really are each other's emotional support. Which is why in The Rising the whole plot is just about them breaking up and trying to get back together. It's classic.     I wanna touch on one more thing from The Beginning before we get into The Rising: it ends with a really big show of trust for Barnaby from Kotetsu. Barnaby manages to trick Robin Baxter into imprisoning himself, but later finds that Kotetsu specifically went out of his way not only to let the other heroes allow Barnaby to do this alone, but also made sure to hang in the background to make sure Barnaby's plan went off. As much as Kotetsu chafes at Barnaby's antics, he still wants him to feel like a member of a team.      Oh yeah, it's a great moment of just the way Kotetsu quietly supports people even if they didn't ask for it or he doesn't always know how to show it, and the plan wouldn't have worked if Kotetsu never stuck his neck out to the others the way he did.    I'll also take a moment to shoutout to the dub. I found both language tracks to be pretty good, but Tiger & Bunny has a lot of what I miss in anime dubs. The script is adapted really well and fits the more natural and Americanized feel of the show and the more diverse cast.   Being that I'm more of a fan of older Japanese heroes, I do regret the more-Americanized takes on the recent Japanese superheroes. But this does mean that a lot of life is breathed into them in English dubs.   Anyway, Kotetsu starts The Rising out with his breath beaten out of him. Wild Tiger and Barnaby have sunk in the ratings in the time since The Beginning (it's been a few months and later events from the Tiger & Bunny series have transpired). They're knocked down to the ""Second League"", where a bunch of not-so-great superheroes dwell.      Kotetsu had gotten up in age to the point where he can't use his powers very long and is trying to take a slower pace to accommodate but fears that by doing so he's now drawing down his partner.   The good news is, a mogul named Mark Schneider bought out their old sponsor and pulls the strings needed to get Barnaby back up to the First League, teaming him up with a new hero named Golden Ryan. The bad news is, Schneider had no intention of doing anything for Kotetsu: without a sponsor, he's forced to retire from heroism and take up a job as a cab driver.     Golden Ryan (A pun on ""Golden Lion"" to Kotetsu's Tiger), is also a bit of a huge douchebag.     You think the guys at Banpresto had a laugh about their logo being emblazoned on such a tool of a hero? I can't see him making any Super Robot Wars cameos anytime soon...   At any rate, a series of disasters strikes the city. Barnaby puts the clues together and deduces that the disasters are connected to an old legend from the city's history: a goddess, angered by mankind's greed, sends earthquakes, sleeping sickness and a massive chasm to devour the city. The problem is just trying to convince the higher-ups to let the heroes investigate this.    Also compounding issues is Golden Ryan being concerned with just earning points for just him and Barnaby, instead of collaborating with other heroes--a selfishness helped along with Ryan's gravity-powers.      Barnaby may have been eager in the past, but he sticks to his ideals plenty compared to Ryan, whose dubious methods actively gets in the way of the other heroes, cause collateral damage, and puts citizens in danger just to get racked up on a point sheet.   It's here... that we can finally touch on Fire Emblem, because they're an important part of The Rising's story.   So... Fire Emblem is self-described as a gay superhero (and he's got fire powers, get it?). Being that they own their own company, they're their own sponsor. But like... Fire Emblem feels like a really bad take on a gay person, more akin to The Crying Game and that era of not differentiating gay men from trans-women or the like.    In a lot of ways, Fire Emblem reminds me of Levin from Tekkaman Blade (I'm going somewhere with this, bear with me). Levin was also swishy, flaming, and very flirty with the protagonist--and there's a very touching episode where Levin talks to a woman about living their truth. There's only one Levin in the world, and they live true to themselves, and Levin contains multitudes that just can't be described by simple binary concepts like ""man"" or ""woman."" And in a lot of ways, that's what Fire Emblem is going for: we see in their past that Nathan (Fire Emblem's real name) struggled with their attraction to men or presenting as a woman. Their big climactic moment while stuck in a nightmare of their own worst fears is having a Persona 4 moment and embracing their shadow, celebrating what it means to be themselves. This is really good and genuinely compelling and it does loads to keep Fire Emblem from just being a camp joke... if only Fire Emblem weren't always goosing the other men and touching their butts in what's clearly discomforting. Like, Levin also thirsted for D-Boy, but they kept their hands to themselves.       I'm actually really sweet on Fire Emblem for this type of extremely extra character. Anime doesn't have a good track record of portraying openly queer characters; they're often extremely one note, and while there are elements of Fire Emblem that still aid into negative stereotypes like occasionally making predatory statements or bad touching, there's also a lot of sincerity around the character as well. Fire Emblem regularly proves to be mature, competent, and an emotionally supportive character to others. The other characters never shun Nathan for who they are or who they love, and overall I'm glad that the series' writing does seem to take their character seriously even if it's not perfect.      Nathan's pros definitely outweigh his cons and I don't want to give the impression that I think they're an outright bad character; the phrase ""problematic"" was made for moments like these. They're a great hero, a trusted friend, and honestly the only ding on their journey of acceptance is the fact that they kept goosing the other guys. Nathan is a person of color and that's always a delight to see in anime. Also, I'm using they/them pronouns for Nathan because it's my understanding the new Tiger & Bunny anime is also doing so in the dub.   And once Fire Emblem comes back they lend one heck of an assist to Blue Rose and Dragon Kid... Also, Fire Emblem is sponsored by Domino's. That just amuses me.      Kotetsu also manages to get the go-ahead to jump back in the game while the 2nd League Heroes were helping Fire Emblem recover. It's a good moment for them considering they got canned for not making any company money earlier.    I also loved Rock Bison's little moment of SEND ME FLYING and throwing up the horns after. He was sitting in dead last point-wise and was even desperate enough to start copying other people's bits in order to make himself more likeable to poor results due to how obvious the imitation was.     The Fastball Special is a time-honored tradition in superheroism; I salute Rock Bison in return. It's only a matter of time before the MCU makes it utterly obnoxious.   It also goes into some other themes about imitation, like Kotetsu's daughter trying to figure out how to write a good poem for her assignment but running into a wall when she keeps trying to imitate. Kotetsu surprisingly offers some worldly advice, which gets thrown right back at him.    Everyone keeps trying to live up to what they think they should be doing and not necessarily what they can with their abilities or being true to their feelings.   It turns out that none of the disasters have any kind of divine origin: it's all revenge, baby! A man named Virgil is responsible for organizing the NEXTs that kicked the whole thing off. Using Sternbild's mythology against them, Virgil's goal is revenge against Schneider. Years ago, Schneider took advantage of Virgil's father in a business deal, which led to Virgil's father taking his own life. Virgil teamed up with three other NEXTs whose lives had been ruined by Schneider's wheeling-and-dealing in order to take out their revenge.         Which ties into some stuff in the series. Longtime villain and villain-killer Lunatic shows up to help Virgil to enact his own sense of justice and stand as Kotetsu's ideological opposite while Barnaby stands against Virgil as his mirror and opposite. Both of them state that it's important to be able to center yourself in the present, move on, and not be stuck in the past.      I can't be the only one who thinks Lunatic resembles a weird cross between Purple Haze and King Crimson. Anyway, Virgil becomes a giant robot crab made out of junk metal and fights off Wild Tiger and Barnaby in an attempt at carrying out his own revenge, claiming justification because Barnaby also took his revenge on the man that killed his parents.     Using Kotetsu's only one minute of power they unleash a big show-stopping team-up climax! Sweet.      The fantastic showing reinvigorates the public's desire for the old Wild Tiger/Barnaby team-up too, and even Golden Ryan helps spur them back into teaming up again.     With a nice poem from Kotetsu's daughter, the movie closes with the heroes continuing their duty of protecting Sternbild. It's a really solid ending for a solid pair of movies.     I thought these were both good as a re-introduction but also an epilogue for the series. It doesn't cover everything but it deals with a lot of elements that make Tiger & Bunny stand out.   As a Tiger & Bunny neophyte, I think these movies also serve really well as an introduction to the series. You get just enough of a taste of the other heroes to want to see more, the dynamic between Kotetsu and Barnaby is well-established, and the general feel of Sternbild is introduced. It's a unique world with interesting heroes, and I'm glad it's priming to make a big comeback to the world of anime. I hope Tiger & Bunny reaches a much bigger crowd this time around.   Yeah, I actually missed the initial boat for this one 10 years ago and had to binge the first season shortly before this because I kept putting it off until the second season was just around the corner. But I don't regret a minute of it. I definitely regret the fact that this couldn't be a bigger hit when it came out for a myriad of complicated reasons. That doesn't mean it's too late. Just because it's over a decade now doesn't mean it still can't have its day in the sun!   Nothing would be truer to this fail-dad than being late to his own successful franchise, I tell you what!     Anyways, this is Nicky & Jean-Karlo, over and out! Til next time.        discuss this in the forum (16 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    This Week in Anime homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          3 comments       Jujutsu Kaisen Stage Play's Video Introduces Cast in Costume   Apr 15, 07:02 3 comments                 live-action    Ryūji Satō, Ryosuke Miura star in July-August play ― A press conference for the stage play of Gege Akutami's Jujutsu Kaisen manga introduced the production's promotional video, main cast, and other details on Wednesday.

This Week in Anime Your Tiger & Bunny Primer  by Jean-Karlo Lemus & Monique Thomas, Apr 12th 2022           Want to know what all the hubbub is about the superhero series Tiger & Bunny but haven't seen the original season? Fear not, citizens! The recap movie and sequel are on Netflix right now and Jean-Karlo and Nicky are ready to give you the official This Week in Anime™ experience.    These movies are streaming on Netflix   Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the participants in this chatlog are not the views of Anime News Network.Spoiler Warning for discussion of the series ahead.     @Lossthief    @mouse_inhouse    @NickyEnchilada    @vestenet      Nicky  Hey, everybody, it's me and Jean-Karlo here, and today we announce that due to recent changes in upper-management This Week in Anime will include regular shout-outs to sponsors!     Jean-Karlo  This week's This Week in Anime was brought to you by Crab! It all comes crawling back to Crab™!     Crab and very region-specific Pepsi sounds like an interesting flavor combo, NGL. But still not as interesting of a combo as the hero duo Tiger & Bunny!     The original Tiger & Bunny anime came out a bit before the massive influx of superheroes became the mono-culture in the U.S. And weirdly enough, it's taken this long for the series to come back with a new season. Netflix is also streaming two movies for the Tiger & Bunny series, The Beginning and The Rising.   These two films came out in 2012 and 2014 respectively but have just now been re-released for streaming on Netflix in honor of that hot new second season. The Beginning is half re-cap of the early part of the series and serves as a great re-introduction for our Super Hero Buddy Cops, while The Rising takes place after the series proper with entirely new material.     Now, I love me some Japanese superheroes, especially the old blood. Yatterman, Gatchaman, Kamen Rider, Casshern, Ultraman, that stuff. And I was always interested in how Japan would handle a take on more Americanized superheroes. Tiger & Bunny has been beloved by fans since its premiere, and not just because of the wave of heroes the Mouse of House churns out on a daily basis. It's a fascinating show, all the way down to the folks wearing those fancy sponsored CG costumes.   Tiger & Bunny is conceptually rich because it fully breaks down the idea of commercialized heroing as an industry, including real company sponsors (which leads to some funny dissonance). The heroes of Sternbild receive live TV coverage and toe the line between being enforcers, performers, and public motivators, along with everything else that life throws at them, on and off the cameras. The focus on the corporate inner workings is part of what makes it feel more mature. It's not just some kids' fantasy of saving people, but a more detailed look at what would happen if someone really tried to make this their job.   Normally, all the heroes compete for points with each other. But when veteran Wild Tiger, real name Kotetsu Kaburagi, moves to a new company after his previous one folds, he's paired with the young and ambitious Barnaby Brooks Jr., to which he affectionally nicknames Bunny, much to his new partner's annoyance.      What makes Tiger & Bunny work – unlike a lot of ""these heroes are realistic!"" joints like The Boys – is that it's not relentlessly dour. The characters aren't irredeemable louts or psychopaths, they're just people trying to make an honest living while living under the whims of an unfeeling, uncaring management system. These people live or die by their sponsors. It's more Mystery Men than anything else, and that's a damn original place to start from when you're making a superhero movie.   It also leans heavily into the showbiz stuff more than any other cape thing I had watched before, but if anything its core is its ensemble cast of heroes and trying to build the companionship between the two main characters. Like many stories about manly bonds, the two of them start out pretty prickly at first, but both have also suffered severe losses of love in their lives. Kotetsu has a 10-year-old daughter he keeps his work secret from, and has previously lost his wife. Barnaby lost his family to a tragic (extremely plot related) incident that left him traumatized. Just knowing this, you can see how much they could benefit from having someone else to call family in their life. Y'know, assuming you could get one of them to open up.     Kotetsu is a really compelling character, and not just because he's a handsome fail-dad with a stylish outfit. He just needs some loving heart to make him better, or worse, that's a fantasy, too. He's goofy and his sense of heroism really doesn't jive with the mercenary world he's in, but rather than feeling like an idiot he just feels quaint. He's not wrong to want to help people, he's just shouldering more weight than he can carry because he just cares about people that much.     He's definitely meant to appeal to an older audience, a rarity for anime, and he's the the heart of the show despite being a lame guy who struggles to keep up with the younger competition. He constantly lets people down, including his own daughter, but you can tell he really values people's feelings just as much as being a hero.     As if to underline it all: his is the only ""conventional"" superhero outfit among all the other heroes. Everyone else has a fancy suit of armor, but Wild Tiger insists on a cape, a themed cowl, and a strongman suit. Even when he gets his updated power suit, he still wears his old one underneath. You can see him wearing the mask inside his helmet.   Barnaby however is the complete opposite, all suped up in the latest tech and uses his real name and face. He instantly saves Kotetsu's sorry ass and is eager to climb up the ladder. They also both happen to share the same type of power, including the fact that both of them have a time limit to use it.      Where Kotetsu wants to be a hero out of a genuine-to-a-fault desire to help people, Barnaby is wholly self-interested... or so he tells himself. He's convinced that putting his identity out there and acting as a hero can get him the funds and recognition he needs to track down the Oroboros group, the crime ring involved with the  murder of his parents. He may not want to care about other people, but he still cares nevertheless. Not that he'd ever admit it to such an embarrassing dad like Kotetsu.   Also, in a twist of fate, Barnaby Brooks Jr is Kotetsu's daughter's favorite superhero. Not even Wild Tiger. Eesh.      Kotetsu's old school ways doesn't make him popular, even with his own daughter. He was inspired by the King of Old Timers, Mr. Legend, so it makes sense that he clings to those ideals. Many people with super powers in this world – referred to as NEXT – don't always fit in when their powers are fresh and new, and even so, not everyone is fit to be a hero.      This is explored a bit more in The Rising, but a lot of NEXTs have powers that just skirt the line of being useful. Stuff like producing a toxin that just makes you really itchy. Or making your hand grow really, really big. Or, like... being really good at swimming. Kotetsu himself rides that line, partially because of his shtick, partially because his power on its own isn't the best (he can make himself one-hundred times stronger for a short period of time), and partially because he tends to leap before he looks. Like My Hero Academia and its many characters that have wholly-pedestrian Quirks, a lot of heroes in Tiger & Bunny just aren't meant for the big leagues.   When the series begins, Kotetsu is at least doing well enough to stand alongside the biggest heroes in the city: the immovable Rock Bison, the scaredy-cat ninja Origami Cyclone, the thunder-wielding Dragon Kid, the literally-flaming Fire Emblem, the King of Heroes Sky High, and the ice-wielding idol Blue Rose.       And even in The Beginning we really see how Kotetsu helps bring these people together. At first they don't really have much comradery with each other, they might even get in each other's way, something the villain of the first movie actively uses against all of them. But by the time The Rising happens you can really feel how they've grown close.   As always, the villain is capitalism. Because all of the heroes are part of Hero TV, a superhero reality tv show, they're all rated on their actions. You earn points for saving citizens and preventing disasters, but lose points if you fail to capture criminals or if they give you the slip. Getting points is important because you cannot become a hero without a sponsor, and doing well means your sponsor is happy. Happy sponsors, happy network, happy hero. Thus, it's against their best interests to help each other out: each hero scrambles for as many points as they can get.    This is also part of why Kotetsu is such a bomb in the ratings: much to his producer's chagrin, he values people's lives over ratings or network shares, so instead of waiting for a commercial break to let the audience get excited he goes and just tries to save people anyway.      Other than the recap portion of the movie, the plot of The Beginning is that someone nabs the city's very important golden statue of justice and nobody can catch the crook. All the heroes run around, get bamboozled by his power to swap places, and it's really just a fun excuse to allow the cast run around and interact. Anime movies often feel bad for being superfluous, but since Tiger & Bunny the series has quite a few episodes dedicated to just building up the characters, it doesn't really feel out of place for the franchise.     It helps that the other heroes aren't terribly complicated and nevertheless get plenty of scenes to themselves. When the team is called out to arrest thief Robin Baxter, they all go their separate ways... together. Dragon Kid and Blue Rose talk about earrings. Fire Emblem... flirts with Rock Bison. Sky High shows off his wind-control powers to Origami Cyclone, showing an uncharacteristically fun-loving side of himself. It's good stuff that does a good job of letting the cast start to see themselves as more than just competitors.       They each get their moments, whether it's Sky High being a little ""up in the clouds"" even though he's currently the top-rated hero, Rock Bison and Kotetsu being Old Guys together as pals at the bottom of the rankings, or Blue Rose's hilariously cheesy mandated catchphrase.   I also wanna point out that I love the character designs in Tiger & Bunny. It's not just Kotetsu's fancy outfits or Barnaby's flowing locks – everyone in this series looks amazing. Masakazu Katsura was brought onboard to handle character designs; he worked on the superhero-flavored Zetman but he's also known for the romantic comedies D.N.A.², Video Girl Ai, and I''s. His charming character designs are fantastic.   ... Also, he did a manga called Wingman about a toku-themed superhero and I'm dying to see that get brought back someday.    They're also more semi-realistic than most anime even ten years ago and it works better since most of the characters are older. The downside is that it makes them harder to animate too, so expect them to look off-model in places. But I think overall the movies look good even compared to today's standards, including the heavy use of CG for the suits and the action.     As it turns out, the CG is on purpose: because many of the costumes would otherwise have to be redrawn if sponsors for the heroes changed (or if the sponsorship brands had to be removed for foreign markets), it's just easier to render them as CG models. The only one who gets traditional animation is Blue Rose, partly because it's hard to shove a logo on her skimpy outfit, partly because she's T&B's source of T&A.     Which becomes upsetting when you remember she's supposed to be in high school still, for some reason. Why are there no adult female superheroes?!   Nobody said idol culture was healthy... A detail the movies leave out from the series is that Blue Rose might have romantic inclinations towards Kotetsu, who's like... twice her age. Thank goodness. Also, because let's be honest, Kotetsu and Barnaby all the way. A family can be a little girl and her two bickering superhero dads.     That's touched on in the series but I prefer to see it as a ""hero crush"" rather than just being hot for a single dad since she obviously takes Kotetsu's ideals to heart after a point. But it's not strong enough to get in the way of Kotetsu and Barnaby's intense married couple energy. The series very much leans in on the ""partner"" thing in more than just a joke or tongue-in-cheek way; they really are each other's emotional support. Which is why in The Rising the whole plot is just about them breaking up and trying to get back together. It's classic.     I wanna touch on one more thing from The Beginning before we get into The Rising: it ends with a really big show of trust for Barnaby from Kotetsu. Barnaby manages to trick Robin Baxter into imprisoning himself, but later finds that Kotetsu specifically went out of his way not only to let the other heroes allow Barnaby to do this alone, but also made sure to hang in the background to make sure Barnaby's plan went off. As much as Kotetsu chafes at Barnaby's antics, he still wants him to feel like a member of a team.      Oh yeah, it's a great moment of just the way Kotetsu quietly supports people even if they didn't ask for it or he doesn't always know how to show it, and the plan wouldn't have worked if Kotetsu never stuck his neck out to the others the way he did.    I'll also take a moment to shoutout to the dub. I found both language tracks to be pretty good, but Tiger & Bunny has a lot of what I miss in anime dubs. The script is adapted really well and fits the more natural and Americanized feel of the show and the more diverse cast.   Being that I'm more of a fan of older Japanese heroes, I do regret the more-Americanized takes on the recent Japanese superheroes. But this does mean that a lot of life is breathed into them in English dubs.   Anyway, Kotetsu starts The Rising out with his breath beaten out of him. Wild Tiger and Barnaby have sunk in the ratings in the time since The Beginning (it's been a few months and later events from the Tiger & Bunny series have transpired). They're knocked down to the ""Second League"", where a bunch of not-so-great superheroes dwell.      Kotetsu had gotten up in age to the point where he can't use his powers very long and is trying to take a slower pace to accommodate but fears that by doing so he's now drawing down his partner.   The good news is, a mogul named Mark Schneider bought out their old sponsor and pulls the strings needed to get Barnaby back up to the First League, teaming him up with a new hero named Golden Ryan. The bad news is, Schneider had no intention of doing anything for Kotetsu: without a sponsor, he's forced to retire from heroism and take up a job as a cab driver.     Golden Ryan (A pun on ""Golden Lion"" to Kotetsu's Tiger), is also a bit of a huge douchebag.     You think the guys at Banpresto had a laugh about their logo being emblazoned on such a tool of a hero? I can't see him making any Super Robot Wars cameos anytime soon...   At any rate, a series of disasters strikes the city. Barnaby puts the clues together and deduces that the disasters are connected to an old legend from the city's history: a goddess, angered by mankind's greed, sends earthquakes, sleeping sickness and a massive chasm to devour the city. The problem is just trying to convince the higher-ups to let the heroes investigate this.    Also compounding issues is Golden Ryan being concerned with just earning points for just him and Barnaby, instead of collaborating with other heroes--a selfishness helped along with Ryan's gravity-powers.      Barnaby may have been eager in the past, but he sticks to his ideals plenty compared to Ryan, whose dubious methods actively gets in the way of the other heroes, cause collateral damage, and puts citizens in danger just to get racked up on a point sheet.   It's here... that we can finally touch on Fire Emblem, because they're an important part of The Rising's story.   So... Fire Emblem is self-described as a gay superhero (and he's got fire powers, get it?). Being that they own their own company, they're their own sponsor. But like... Fire Emblem feels like a really bad take on a gay person, more akin to The Crying Game and that era of not differentiating gay men from trans-women or the like.    In a lot of ways, Fire Emblem reminds me of Levin from Tekkaman Blade (I'm going somewhere with this, bear with me). Levin was also swishy, flaming, and very flirty with the protagonist--and there's a very touching episode where Levin talks to a woman about living their truth. There's only one Levin in the world, and they live true to themselves, and Levin contains multitudes that just can't be described by simple binary concepts like ""man"" or ""woman."" And in a lot of ways, that's what Fire Emblem is going for: we see in their past that Nathan (Fire Emblem's real name) struggled with their attraction to men or presenting as a woman. Their big climactic moment while stuck in a nightmare of their own worst fears is having a Persona 4 moment and embracing their shadow, celebrating what it means to be themselves. This is really good and genuinely compelling and it does loads to keep Fire Emblem from just being a camp joke... if only Fire Emblem weren't always goosing the other men and touching their butts in what's clearly discomforting. Like, Levin also thirsted for D-Boy, but they kept their hands to themselves.       I'm actually really sweet on Fire Emblem for this type of extremely extra character. Anime doesn't have a good track record of portraying openly queer characters; they're often extremely one note, and while there are elements of Fire Emblem that still aid into negative stereotypes like occasionally making predatory statements or bad touching, there's also a lot of sincerity around the character as well. Fire Emblem regularly proves to be mature, competent, and an emotionally supportive character to others. The other characters never shun Nathan for who they are or who they love, and overall I'm glad that the series' writing does seem to take their character seriously even if it's not perfect.      Nathan's pros definitely outweigh his cons and I don't want to give the impression that I think they're an outright bad character; the phrase ""problematic"" was made for moments like these. They're a great hero, a trusted friend, and honestly the only ding on their journey of acceptance is the fact that they kept goosing the other guys. Nathan is a person of color and that's always a delight to see in anime. Also, I'm using they/them pronouns for Nathan because it's my understanding the new Tiger & Bunny anime is also doing so in the dub.   And once Fire Emblem comes back they lend one heck of an assist to Blue Rose and Dragon Kid... Also, Fire Emblem is sponsored by Domino's. That just amuses me.      Kotetsu also manages to get the go-ahead to jump back in the game while the 2nd League Heroes were helping Fire Emblem recover. It's a good moment for them considering they got canned for not making any company money earlier.    I also loved Rock Bison's little moment of SEND ME FLYING and throwing up the horns after. He was sitting in dead last point-wise and was even desperate enough to start copying other people's bits in order to make himself more likeable to poor results due to how obvious the imitation was.     The Fastball Special is a time-honored tradition in superheroism; I salute Rock Bison in return. It's only a matter of time before the MCU makes it utterly obnoxious.   It also goes into some other themes about imitation, like Kotetsu's daughter trying to figure out how to write a good poem for her assignment but running into a wall when she keeps trying to imitate. Kotetsu surprisingly offers some worldly advice, which gets thrown right back at him.    Everyone keeps trying to live up to what they think they should be doing and not necessarily what they can with their abilities or being true to their feelings.   It turns out that none of the disasters have any kind of divine origin: it's all revenge, baby! A man named Virgil is responsible for organizing the NEXTs that kicked the whole thing off. Using Sternbild's mythology against them, Virgil's goal is revenge against Schneider. Years ago, Schneider took advantage of Virgil's father in a business deal, which led to Virgil's father taking his own life. Virgil teamed up with three other NEXTs whose lives had been ruined by Schneider's wheeling-and-dealing in order to take out their revenge.         Which ties into some stuff in the series. Longtime villain and villain-killer Lunatic shows up to help Virgil to enact his own sense of justice and stand as Kotetsu's ideological opposite while Barnaby stands against Virgil as his mirror and opposite. Both of them state that it's important to be able to center yourself in the present, move on, and not be stuck in the past.      I can't be the only one who thinks Lunatic resembles a weird cross between Purple Haze and King Crimson. Anyway, Virgil becomes a giant robot crab made out of junk metal and fights off Wild Tiger and Barnaby in an attempt at carrying out his own revenge, claiming justification because Barnaby also took his revenge on the man that killed his parents.     Using Kotetsu's only one minute of power they unleash a big show-stopping team-up climax! Sweet.      The fantastic showing reinvigorates the public's desire for the old Wild Tiger/Barnaby team-up too, and even Golden Ryan helps spur them back into teaming up again.     With a nice poem from Kotetsu's daughter, the movie closes with the heroes continuing their duty of protecting Sternbild. It's a really solid ending for a solid pair of movies.     I thought these were both good as a re-introduction but also an epilogue for the series. It doesn't cover everything but it deals with a lot of elements that make Tiger & Bunny stand out.   As a Tiger & Bunny neophyte, I think these movies also serve really well as an introduction to the series. You get just enough of a taste of the other heroes to want to see more, the dynamic between Kotetsu and Barnaby is well-established, and the general feel of Sternbild is introduced. It's a unique world with interesting heroes, and I'm glad it's priming to make a big comeback to the world of anime. I hope Tiger & Bunny reaches a much bigger crowd this time around.   Yeah, I actually missed the initial boat for this one 10 years ago and had to binge the first season shortly before this because I kept putting it off until the second season was just around the corner. But I don't regret a minute of it. I definitely regret the fact that this couldn't be a bigger hit when it came out for a myriad of complicated reasons. That doesn't mean it's too late. Just because it's over a decade now doesn't mean it still can't have its day in the sun!   Nothing would be truer to this fail-dad than being late to his own successful franchise, I tell you what!     Anyways, this is Nicky & Jean-Karlo, over and out!

Jean-Karlo  This week's This Week in Anime was brought to you by Crab! It all comes crawling back to Crab™!     Crab and very region-specific Pepsi sounds like an interesting flavor combo, NGL. But still not as interesting of a combo as the hero duo Tiger & Bunny!     The original Tiger & Bunny anime came out a bit before the massive influx of superheroes became the mono-culture in the U.S. And weirdly enough, it's taken this long for the series to come back with a new season. Netflix is also streaming two movies for the Tiger & Bunny series, The Beginning and The Rising.   These two films came out in 2012 and 2014 respectively but have just now been re-released for streaming on Netflix in honor of that hot new second season. The Beginning is half re-cap of the early part of the series and serves as a great re-introduction for our Super Hero Buddy Cops, while The Rising takes place after the series proper with entirely new material.     Now, I love me some Japanese superheroes, especially the old blood. Yatterman, Gatchaman, Kamen Rider, Casshern, Ultraman, that stuff. And I was always interested in how Japan would handle a take on more Americanized superheroes. Tiger & Bunny has been beloved by fans since its premiere, and not just because of the wave of heroes the Mouse of House churns out on a daily basis. It's a fascinating show, all the way down to the folks wearing those fancy sponsored CG costumes.   Tiger & Bunny is conceptually rich because it fully breaks down the idea of commercialized heroing as an industry, including real company sponsors (which leads to some funny dissonance). The heroes of Sternbild receive live TV coverage and toe the line between being enforcers, performers, and public motivators, along with everything else that life throws at them, on and off the cameras. The focus on the corporate inner workings is part of what makes it feel more mature. It's not just some kids' fantasy of saving people, but a more detailed look at what would happen if someone really tried to make this their job.   Normally, all the heroes compete for points with each other. But when veteran Wild Tiger, real name Kotetsu Kaburagi, moves to a new company after his previous one folds, he's paired with the young and ambitious Barnaby Brooks Jr., to which he affectionally nicknames Bunny, much to his new partner's annoyance.      What makes Tiger & Bunny work – unlike a lot of ""these heroes are realistic!"" joints like The Boys – is that it's not relentlessly dour. The characters aren't irredeemable louts or psychopaths, they're just people trying to make an honest living while living under the whims of an unfeeling, uncaring management system. These people live or die by their sponsors. It's more Mystery Men than anything else, and that's a damn original place to start from when you're making a superhero movie.   It also leans heavily into the showbiz stuff more than any other cape thing I had watched before, but if anything its core is its ensemble cast of heroes and trying to build the companionship between the two main characters. Like many stories about manly bonds, the two of them start out pretty prickly at first, but both have also suffered severe losses of love in their lives. Kotetsu has a 10-year-old daughter he keeps his work secret from, and has previously lost his wife. Barnaby lost his family to a tragic (extremely plot related) incident that left him traumatized. Just knowing this, you can see how much they could benefit from having someone else to call family in their life. Y'know, assuming you could get one of them to open up.     Kotetsu is a really compelling character, and not just because he's a handsome fail-dad with a stylish outfit. He just needs some loving heart to make him better, or worse, that's a fantasy, too. He's goofy and his sense of heroism really doesn't jive with the mercenary world he's in, but rather than feeling like an idiot he just feels quaint. He's not wrong to want to help people, he's just shouldering more weight than he can carry because he just cares about people that much.     He's definitely meant to appeal to an older audience, a rarity for anime, and he's the the heart of the show despite being a lame guy who struggles to keep up with the younger competition. He constantly lets people down, including his own daughter, but you can tell he really values people's feelings just as much as being a hero.     As if to underline it all: his is the only ""conventional"" superhero outfit among all the other heroes. Everyone else has a fancy suit of armor, but Wild Tiger insists on a cape, a themed cowl, and a strongman suit. Even when he gets his updated power suit, he still wears his old one underneath. You can see him wearing the mask inside his helmet.   Barnaby however is the complete opposite, all suped up in the latest tech and uses his real name and face. He instantly saves Kotetsu's sorry ass and is eager to climb up the ladder. They also both happen to share the same type of power, including the fact that both of them have a time limit to use it.      Where Kotetsu wants to be a hero out of a genuine-to-a-fault desire to help people, Barnaby is wholly self-interested... or so he tells himself. He's convinced that putting his identity out there and acting as a hero can get him the funds and recognition he needs to track down the Oroboros group, the crime ring involved with the  murder of his parents. He may not want to care about other people, but he still cares nevertheless. Not that he'd ever admit it to such an embarrassing dad like Kotetsu.   Also, in a twist of fate, Barnaby Brooks Jr is Kotetsu's daughter's favorite superhero. Not even Wild Tiger. Eesh.      Kotetsu's old school ways doesn't make him popular, even with his own daughter. He was inspired by the King of Old Timers, Mr. Legend, so it makes sense that he clings to those ideals. Many people with super powers in this world – referred to as NEXT – don't always fit in when their powers are fresh and new, and even so, not everyone is fit to be a hero.      This is explored a bit more in The Rising, but a lot of NEXTs have powers that just skirt the line of being useful. Stuff like producing a toxin that just makes you really itchy. Or making your hand grow really, really big. Or, like... being really good at swimming. Kotetsu himself rides that line, partially because of his shtick, partially because his power on its own isn't the best (he can make himself one-hundred times stronger for a short period of time), and partially because he tends to leap before he looks. Like My Hero Academia and its many characters that have wholly-pedestrian Quirks, a lot of heroes in Tiger & Bunny just aren't meant for the big leagues.   When the series begins, Kotetsu is at least doing well enough to stand alongside the biggest heroes in the city: the immovable Rock Bison, the scaredy-cat ninja Origami Cyclone, the thunder-wielding Dragon Kid, the literally-flaming Fire Emblem, the King of Heroes Sky High, and the ice-wielding idol Blue Rose.       And even in The Beginning we really see how Kotetsu helps bring these people together. At first they don't really have much comradery with each other, they might even get in each other's way, something the villain of the first movie actively uses against all of them. But by the time The Rising happens you can really feel how they've grown close.   As always, the villain is capitalism. Because all of the heroes are part of Hero TV, a superhero reality tv show, they're all rated on their actions. You earn points for saving citizens and preventing disasters, but lose points if you fail to capture criminals or if they give you the slip. Getting points is important because you cannot become a hero without a sponsor, and doing well means your sponsor is happy. Happy sponsors, happy network, happy hero. Thus, it's against their best interests to help each other out: each hero scrambles for as many points as they can get.    This is also part of why Kotetsu is such a bomb in the ratings: much to his producer's chagrin, he values people's lives over ratings or network shares, so instead of waiting for a commercial break to let the audience get excited he goes and just tries to save people anyway.      Other than the recap portion of the movie, the plot of The Beginning is that someone nabs the city's very important golden statue of justice and nobody can catch the crook. All the heroes run around, get bamboozled by his power to swap places, and it's really just a fun excuse to allow the cast run around and interact. Anime movies often feel bad for being superfluous, but since Tiger & Bunny the series has quite a few episodes dedicated to just building up the characters, it doesn't really feel out of place for the franchise.     It helps that the other heroes aren't terribly complicated and nevertheless get plenty of scenes to themselves. When the team is called out to arrest thief Robin Baxter, they all go their separate ways... together. Dragon Kid and Blue Rose talk about earrings. Fire Emblem... flirts with Rock Bison. Sky High shows off his wind-control powers to Origami Cyclone, showing an uncharacteristically fun-loving side of himself. It's good stuff that does a good job of letting the cast start to see themselves as more than just competitors.       They each get their moments, whether it's Sky High being a little ""up in the clouds"" even though he's currently the top-rated hero, Rock Bison and Kotetsu being Old Guys together as pals at the bottom of the rankings, or Blue Rose's hilariously cheesy mandated catchphrase.   I also wanna point out that I love the character designs in Tiger & Bunny. It's not just Kotetsu's fancy outfits or Barnaby's flowing locks – everyone in this series looks amazing. Masakazu Katsura was brought onboard to handle character designs; he worked on the superhero-flavored Zetman but he's also known for the romantic comedies D.N.A.², Video Girl Ai, and I''s. His charming character designs are fantastic.   ... Also, he did a manga called Wingman about a toku-themed superhero and I'm dying to see that get brought back someday.    They're also more semi-realistic than most anime even ten years ago and it works better since most of the characters are older. The downside is that it makes them harder to animate too, so expect them to look off-model in places. But I think overall the movies look good even compared to today's standards, including the heavy use of CG for the suits and the action.     As it turns out, the CG is on purpose: because many of the costumes would otherwise have to be redrawn if sponsors for the heroes changed (or if the sponsorship brands had to be removed for foreign markets), it's just easier to render them as CG models. The only one who gets traditional animation is Blue Rose, partly because it's hard to shove a logo on her skimpy outfit, partly because she's T&B's source of T&A.     Which becomes upsetting when you remember she's supposed to be in high school still, for some reason. Why are there no adult female superheroes?!   Nobody said idol culture was healthy... A detail the movies leave out from the series is that Blue Rose might have romantic inclinations towards Kotetsu, who's like... twice her age. Thank goodness. Also, because let's be honest, Kotetsu and Barnaby all the way. A family can be a little girl and her two bickering superhero dads.     That's touched on in the series but I prefer to see it as a ""hero crush"" rather than just being hot for a single dad since she obviously takes Kotetsu's ideals to heart after a point. But it's not strong enough to get in the way of Kotetsu and Barnaby's intense married couple energy. The series very much leans in on the ""partner"" thing in more than just a joke or tongue-in-cheek way; they really are each other's emotional support. Which is why in The Rising the whole plot is just about them breaking up and trying to get back together. It's classic.     I wanna touch on one more thing from The Beginning before we get into The Rising: it ends with a really big show of trust for Barnaby from Kotetsu. Barnaby manages to trick Robin Baxter into imprisoning himself, but later finds that Kotetsu specifically went out of his way not only to let the other heroes allow Barnaby to do this alone, but also made sure to hang in the background to make sure Barnaby's plan went off. As much as Kotetsu chafes at Barnaby's antics, he still wants him to feel like a member of a team.      Oh yeah, it's a great moment of just the way Kotetsu quietly supports people even if they didn't ask for it or he doesn't always know how to show it, and the plan wouldn't have worked if Kotetsu never stuck his neck out to the others the way he did.    I'll also take a moment to shoutout to the dub. I found both language tracks to be pretty good, but Tiger & Bunny has a lot of what I miss in anime dubs. The script is adapted really well and fits the more natural and Americanized feel of the show and the more diverse cast.   Being that I'm more of a fan of older Japanese heroes, I do regret the more-Americanized takes on the recent Japanese superheroes. But this does mean that a lot of life is breathed into them in English dubs.   Anyway, Kotetsu starts The Rising out with his breath beaten out of him. Wild Tiger and Barnaby have sunk in the ratings in the time since The Beginning (it's been a few months and later events from the Tiger & Bunny series have transpired). They're knocked down to the ""Second League"", where a bunch of not-so-great superheroes dwell.      Kotetsu had gotten up in age to the point where he can't use his powers very long and is trying to take a slower pace to accommodate but fears that by doing so he's now drawing down his partner.   The good news is, a mogul named Mark Schneider bought out their old sponsor and pulls the strings needed to get Barnaby back up to the First League, teaming him up with a new hero named Golden Ryan. The bad news is, Schneider had no intention of doing anything for Kotetsu: without a sponsor, he's forced to retire from heroism and take up a job as a cab driver.     Golden Ryan (A pun on ""Golden Lion"" to Kotetsu's Tiger), is also a bit of a huge douchebag.     You think the guys at Banpresto had a laugh about their logo being emblazoned on such a tool of a hero? I can't see him making any Super Robot Wars cameos anytime soon...   At any rate, a series of disasters strikes the city. Barnaby puts the clues together and deduces that the disasters are connected to an old legend from the city's history: a goddess, angered by mankind's greed, sends earthquakes, sleeping sickness and a massive chasm to devour the city. The problem is just trying to convince the higher-ups to let the heroes investigate this.    Also compounding issues is Golden Ryan being concerned with just earning points for just him and Barnaby, instead of collaborating with other heroes--a selfishness helped along with Ryan's gravity-powers.      Barnaby may have been eager in the past, but he sticks to his ideals plenty compared to Ryan, whose dubious methods actively gets in the way of the other heroes, cause collateral damage, and puts citizens in danger just to get racked up on a point sheet.   It's here... that we can finally touch on Fire Emblem, because they're an important part of The Rising's story.   So... Fire Emblem is self-described as a gay superhero (and he's got fire powers, get it?). Being that they own their own company, they're their own sponsor. But like... Fire Emblem feels like a really bad take on a gay person, more akin to The Crying Game and that era of not differentiating gay men from trans-women or the like.    In a lot of ways, Fire Emblem reminds me of Levin from Tekkaman Blade (I'm going somewhere with this, bear with me). Levin was also swishy, flaming, and very flirty with the protagonist--and there's a very touching episode where Levin talks to a woman about living their truth. There's only one Levin in the world, and they live true to themselves, and Levin contains multitudes that just can't be described by simple binary concepts like ""man"" or ""woman."" And in a lot of ways, that's what Fire Emblem is going for: we see in their past that Nathan (Fire Emblem's real name) struggled with their attraction to men or presenting as a woman. Their big climactic moment while stuck in a nightmare of their own worst fears is having a Persona 4 moment and embracing their shadow, celebrating what it means to be themselves. This is really good and genuinely compelling and it does loads to keep Fire Emblem from just being a camp joke... if only Fire Emblem weren't always goosing the other men and touching their butts in what's clearly discomforting. Like, Levin also thirsted for D-Boy, but they kept their hands to themselves.       I'm actually really sweet on Fire Emblem for this type of extremely extra character. Anime doesn't have a good track record of portraying openly queer characters; they're often extremely one note, and while there are elements of Fire Emblem that still aid into negative stereotypes like occasionally making predatory statements or bad touching, there's also a lot of sincerity around the character as well. Fire Emblem regularly proves to be mature, competent, and an emotionally supportive character to others. The other characters never shun Nathan for who they are or who they love, and overall I'm glad that the series' writing does seem to take their character seriously even if it's not perfect.      Nathan's pros definitely outweigh his cons and I don't want to give the impression that I think they're an outright bad character; the phrase ""problematic"" was made for moments like these. They're a great hero, a trusted friend, and honestly the only ding on their journey of acceptance is the fact that they kept goosing the other guys. Nathan is a person of color and that's always a delight to see in anime. Also, I'm using they/them pronouns for Nathan because it's my understanding the new Tiger & Bunny anime is also doing so in the dub.   And once Fire Emblem comes back they lend one heck of an assist to Blue Rose and Dragon Kid... Also, Fire Emblem is sponsored by Domino's. That just amuses me.      Kotetsu also manages to get the go-ahead to jump back in the game while the 2nd League Heroes were helping Fire Emblem recover. It's a good moment for them considering they got canned for not making any company money earlier.    I also loved Rock Bison's little moment of SEND ME FLYING and throwing up the horns after. He was sitting in dead last point-wise and was even desperate enough to start copying other people's bits in order to make himself more likeable to poor results due to how obvious the imitation was.     The Fastball Special is a time-honored tradition in superheroism; I salute Rock Bison in return. It's only a matter of time before the MCU makes it utterly obnoxious.   It also goes into some other themes about imitation, like Kotetsu's daughter trying to figure out how to write a good poem for her assignment but running into a wall when she keeps trying to imitate. Kotetsu surprisingly offers some worldly advice, which gets thrown right back at him.    Everyone keeps trying to live up to what they think they should be doing and not necessarily what they can with their abilities or being true to their feelings.   It turns out that none of the disasters have any kind of divine origin: it's all revenge, baby! A man named Virgil is responsible for organizing the NEXTs that kicked the whole thing off. Using Sternbild's mythology against them, Virgil's goal is revenge against Schneider. Years ago, Schneider took advantage of Virgil's father in a business deal, which led to Virgil's father taking his own life. Virgil teamed up with three other NEXTs whose lives had been ruined by Schneider's wheeling-and-dealing in order to take out their revenge.         Which ties into some stuff in the series. Longtime villain and villain-killer Lunatic shows up to help Virgil to enact his own sense of justice and stand as Kotetsu's ideological opposite while Barnaby stands against Virgil as his mirror and opposite. Both of them state that it's important to be able to center yourself in the present, move on, and not be stuck in the past.      I can't be the only one who thinks Lunatic resembles a weird cross between Purple Haze and King Crimson. Anyway, Virgil becomes a giant robot crab made out of junk metal and fights off Wild Tiger and Barnaby in an attempt at carrying out his own revenge, claiming justification because Barnaby also took his revenge on the man that killed his parents.     Using Kotetsu's only one minute of power they unleash a big show-stopping team-up climax! Sweet.      The fantastic showing reinvigorates the public's desire for the old Wild Tiger/Barnaby team-up too, and even Golden Ryan helps spur them back into teaming up again.     With a nice poem from Kotetsu's daughter, the movie closes with the heroes continuing their duty of protecting Sternbild. It's a really solid ending for a solid pair of movies.     I thought these were both good as a re-introduction but also an epilogue for the series. It doesn't cover everything but it deals with a lot of elements that make Tiger & Bunny stand out.   As a Tiger & Bunny neophyte, I think these movies also serve really well as an introduction to the series. You get just enough of a taste of the other heroes to want to see more, the dynamic between Kotetsu and Barnaby is well-established, and the general feel of Sternbild is introduced. It's a unique world with interesting heroes, and I'm glad it's priming to make a big comeback to the world of anime. I hope Tiger & Bunny reaches a much bigger crowd this time around.   Yeah, I actually missed the initial boat for this one 10 years ago and had to binge the first season shortly before this because I kept putting it off until the second season was just around the corner. But I don't regret a minute of it. I definitely regret the fact that this couldn't be a bigger hit when it came out for a myriad of complicated reasons. That doesn't mean it's too late. Just because it's over a decade now doesn't mean it still can't have its day in the sun!   Nothing would be truer to this fail-dad than being late to his own successful franchise, I tell you what!     Anyways, this is Nicky & Jean-Karlo, over and out!

This Week in Anime Your Tiger & Bunny Primer  by Jean-Karlo Lemus & Monique Thomas, Apr 12th 2022           Want to know what all the hubbub is about the superhero series Tiger & Bunny but haven't seen the original season? Fear not, citizens! The recap movie and sequel are on Netflix right now and Jean-Karlo and Nicky are ready to give you the official This Week in Anime™ experience.

Jean-Karlo  This week's This Week in Anime was brought to you by Crab! It all comes crawling back to Crab™!     Crab and very region-specific Pepsi sounds like an interesting flavor combo, NGL. But still not as interesting of a combo as the hero duo Tiger & Bunny!     The original Tiger & Bunny anime came out a bit before the massive influx of superheroes became the mono-culture in the U.S. And weirdly enough, it's taken this long for the series to come back with a new season. Netflix is also streaming two movies for the Tiger & Bunny series, The Beginning and The Rising.   These two films came out in 2012 and 2014 respectively but have just now been re-released for streaming on Netflix in honor of that hot new second season. The Beginning is half re-cap of the early part of the series and serves as a great re-introduction for our Super Hero Buddy Cops, while The Rising takes place after the series proper with entirely new material.     Now, I love me some Japanese superheroes, especially the old blood. Yatterman, Gatchaman, Kamen Rider, Casshern, Ultraman, that stuff. And I was always interested in how Japan would handle a take on more Americanized superheroes. Tiger & Bunny has been beloved by fans since its premiere, and not just because of the wave of heroes the Mouse of House churns out on a daily basis. It's a fascinating show, all the way down to the folks wearing those fancy sponsored CG costumes.   Tiger & Bunny is conceptually rich because it fully breaks down the idea of commercialized heroing as an industry, including real company sponsors (which leads to some funny dissonance). The heroes of Sternbild receive live TV coverage and toe the line between being enforcers, performers, and public motivators, along with everything else that life throws at them, on and off the cameras. The focus on the corporate inner workings is part of what makes it feel more mature. It's not just some kids' fantasy of saving people, but a more detailed look at what would happen if someone really tried to make this their job.   Normally, all the heroes compete for points with each other. But when veteran Wild Tiger, real name Kotetsu Kaburagi, moves to a new company after his previous one folds, he's paired with the young and ambitious Barnaby Brooks Jr., to which he affectionally nicknames Bunny, much to his new partner's annoyance.      What makes Tiger & Bunny work – unlike a lot of ""these heroes are realistic!"" joints like The Boys – is that it's not relentlessly dour. The characters aren't irredeemable louts or psychopaths, they're just people trying to make an honest living while living under the whims of an unfeeling, uncaring management system. These people live or die by their sponsors. It's more Mystery Men than anything else, and that's a damn original place to start from when you're making a superhero movie.   It also leans heavily into the showbiz stuff more than any other cape thing I had watched before, but if anything its core is its ensemble cast of heroes and trying to build the companionship between the two main characters. Like many stories about manly bonds, the two of them start out pretty prickly at first, but both have also suffered severe losses of love in their lives. Kotetsu has a 10-year-old daughter he keeps his work secret from, and has previously lost his wife. Barnaby lost his family to a tragic (extremely plot related) incident that left him traumatized. Just knowing this, you can see how much they could benefit from having someone else to call family in their life. Y'know, assuming you could get one of them to open up.     Kotetsu is a really compelling character, and not just because he's a handsome fail-dad with a stylish outfit. He just needs some loving heart to make him better, or worse, that's a fantasy, too. He's goofy and his sense of heroism really doesn't jive with the mercenary world he's in, but rather than feeling like an idiot he just feels quaint. He's not wrong to want to help people, he's just shouldering more weight than he can carry because he just cares about people that much.     He's definitely meant to appeal to an older audience, a rarity for anime, and he's the the heart of the show despite being a lame guy who struggles to keep up with the younger competition. He constantly lets people down, including his own daughter, but you can tell he really values people's feelings just as much as being a hero.     As if to underline it all: his is the only ""conventional"" superhero outfit among all the other heroes. Everyone else has a fancy suit of armor, but Wild Tiger insists on a cape, a themed cowl, and a strongman suit. Even when he gets his updated power suit, he still wears his old one underneath. You can see him wearing the mask inside his helmet.   Barnaby however is the complete opposite, all suped up in the latest tech and uses his real name and face. He instantly saves Kotetsu's sorry ass and is eager to climb up the ladder. They also both happen to share the same type of power, including the fact that both of them have a time limit to use it.      Where Kotetsu wants to be a hero out of a genuine-to-a-fault desire to help people, Barnaby is wholly self-interested... or so he tells himself. He's convinced that putting his identity out there and acting as a hero can get him the funds and recognition he needs to track down the Oroboros group, the crime ring involved with the  murder of his parents. He may not want to care about other people, but he still cares nevertheless. Not that he'd ever admit it to such an embarrassing dad like Kotetsu.   Also, in a twist of fate, Barnaby Brooks Jr is Kotetsu's daughter's favorite superhero. Not even Wild Tiger. Eesh.      Kotetsu's old school ways doesn't make him popular, even with his own daughter. He was inspired by the King of Old Timers, Mr. Legend, so it makes sense that he clings to those ideals. Many people with super powers in this world – referred to as NEXT – don't always fit in when their powers are fresh and new, and even so, not everyone is fit to be a hero.      This is explored a bit more in The Rising, but a lot of NEXTs have powers that just skirt the line of being useful. Stuff like producing a toxin that just makes you really itchy. Or making your hand grow really, really big. Or, like... being really good at swimming. Kotetsu himself rides that line, partially because of his shtick, partially because his power on its own isn't the best (he can make himself one-hundred times stronger for a short period of time), and partially because he tends to leap before he looks. Like My Hero Academia and its many characters that have wholly-pedestrian Quirks, a lot of heroes in Tiger & Bunny just aren't meant for the big leagues.   When the series begins, Kotetsu is at least doing well enough to stand alongside the biggest heroes in the city: the immovable Rock Bison, the scaredy-cat ninja Origami Cyclone, the thunder-wielding Dragon Kid, the literally-flaming Fire Emblem, the King of Heroes Sky High, and the ice-wielding idol Blue Rose.       And even in The Beginning we really see how Kotetsu helps bring these people together. At first they don't really have much comradery with each other, they might even get in each other's way, something the villain of the first movie actively uses against all of them. But by the time The Rising happens you can really feel how they've grown close.   As always, the villain is capitalism. Because all of the heroes are part of Hero TV, a superhero reality tv show, they're all rated on their actions. You earn points for saving citizens and preventing disasters, but lose points if you fail to capture criminals or if they give you the slip. Getting points is important because you cannot become a hero without a sponsor, and doing well means your sponsor is happy. Happy sponsors, happy network, happy hero. Thus, it's against their best interests to help each other out: each hero scrambles for as many points as they can get.    This is also part of why Kotetsu is such a bomb in the ratings: much to his producer's chagrin, he values people's lives over ratings or network shares, so instead of waiting for a commercial break to let the audience get excited he goes and just tries to save people anyway.      Other than the recap portion of the movie, the plot of The Beginning is that someone nabs the city's very important golden statue of justice and nobody can catch the crook. All the heroes run around, get bamboozled by his power to swap places, and it's really just a fun excuse to allow the cast run around and interact. Anime movies often feel bad for being superfluous, but since Tiger & Bunny the series has quite a few episodes dedicated to just building up the characters, it doesn't really feel out of place for the franchise.     It helps that the other heroes aren't terribly complicated and nevertheless get plenty of scenes to themselves. When the team is called out to arrest thief Robin Baxter, they all go their separate ways... together. Dragon Kid and Blue Rose talk about earrings. Fire Emblem... flirts with Rock Bison. Sky High shows off his wind-control powers to Origami Cyclone, showing an uncharacteristically fun-loving side of himself. It's good stuff that does a good job of letting the cast start to see themselves as more than just competitors.       They each get their moments, whether it's Sky High being a little ""up in the clouds"" even though he's currently the top-rated hero, Rock Bison and Kotetsu being Old Guys together as pals at the bottom of the rankings, or Blue Rose's hilariously cheesy mandated catchphrase.   I also wanna point out that I love the character designs in Tiger & Bunny. It's not just Kotetsu's fancy outfits or Barnaby's flowing locks – everyone in this series looks amazing. Masakazu Katsura was brought onboard to handle character designs; he worked on the superhero-flavored Zetman but he's also known for the romantic comedies D.N.A.², Video Girl Ai, and I''s. His charming character designs are fantastic.   ... Also, he did a manga called Wingman about a toku-themed superhero and I'm dying to see that get brought back someday.    They're also more semi-realistic than most anime even ten years ago and it works better since most of the characters are older. The downside is that it makes them harder to animate too, so expect them to look off-model in places. But I think overall the movies look good even compared to today's standards, including the heavy use of CG for the suits and the action.     As it turns out, the CG is on purpose: because many of the costumes would otherwise have to be redrawn if sponsors for the heroes changed (or if the sponsorship brands had to be removed for foreign markets), it's just easier to render them as CG models. The only one who gets traditional animation is Blue Rose, partly because it's hard to shove a logo on her skimpy outfit, partly because she's T&B's source of T&A.     Which becomes upsetting when you remember she's supposed to be in high school still, for some reason. Why are there no adult female superheroes?!   Nobody said idol culture was healthy... A detail the movies leave out from the series is that Blue Rose might have romantic inclinations towards Kotetsu, who's like... twice her age. Thank goodness. Also, because let's be honest, Kotetsu and Barnaby all the way. A family can be a little girl and her two bickering superhero dads.     That's touched on in the series but I prefer to see it as a ""hero crush"" rather than just being hot for a single dad since she obviously takes Kotetsu's ideals to heart after a point. But it's not strong enough to get in the way of Kotetsu and Barnaby's intense married couple energy. The series very much leans in on the ""partner"" thing in more than just a joke or tongue-in-cheek way; they really are each other's emotional support. Which is why in The Rising the whole plot is just about them breaking up and trying to get back together. It's classic.     I wanna touch on one more thing from The Beginning before we get into The Rising: it ends with a really big show of trust for Barnaby from Kotetsu. Barnaby manages to trick Robin Baxter into imprisoning himself, but later finds that Kotetsu specifically went out of his way not only to let the other heroes allow Barnaby to do this alone, but also made sure to hang in the background to make sure Barnaby's plan went off. As much as Kotetsu chafes at Barnaby's antics, he still wants him to feel like a member of a team.      Oh yeah, it's a great moment of just the way Kotetsu quietly supports people even if they didn't ask for it or he doesn't always know how to show it, and the plan wouldn't have worked if Kotetsu never stuck his neck out to the others the way he did.    I'll also take a moment to shoutout to the dub. I found both language tracks to be pretty good, but Tiger & Bunny has a lot of what I miss in anime dubs. The script is adapted really well and fits the more natural and Americanized feel of the show and the more diverse cast.   Being that I'm more of a fan of older Japanese heroes, I do regret the more-Americanized takes on the recent Japanese superheroes. But this does mean that a lot of life is breathed into them in English dubs.   Anyway, Kotetsu starts The Rising out with his breath beaten out of him. Wild Tiger and Barnaby have sunk in the ratings in the time since The Beginning (it's been a few months and later events from the Tiger & Bunny series have transpired). They're knocked down to the ""Second League"", where a bunch of not-so-great superheroes dwell.      Kotetsu had gotten up in age to the point where he can't use his powers very long and is trying to take a slower pace to accommodate but fears that by doing so he's now drawing down his partner.   The good news is, a mogul named Mark Schneider bought out their old sponsor and pulls the strings needed to get Barnaby back up to the First League, teaming him up with a new hero named Golden Ryan. The bad news is, Schneider had no intention of doing anything for Kotetsu: without a sponsor, he's forced to retire from heroism and take up a job as a cab driver.     Golden Ryan (A pun on ""Golden Lion"" to Kotetsu's Tiger), is also a bit of a huge douchebag.     You think the guys at Banpresto had a laugh about their logo being emblazoned on such a tool of a hero? I can't see him making any Super Robot Wars cameos anytime soon...   At any rate, a series of disasters strikes the city. Barnaby puts the clues together and deduces that the disasters are connected to an old legend from the city's history: a goddess, angered by mankind's greed, sends earthquakes, sleeping sickness and a massive chasm to devour the city. The problem is just trying to convince the higher-ups to let the heroes investigate this.    Also compounding issues is Golden Ryan being concerned with just earning points for just him and Barnaby, instead of collaborating with other heroes--a selfishness helped along with Ryan's gravity-powers.      Barnaby may have been eager in the past, but he sticks to his ideals plenty compared to Ryan, whose dubious methods actively gets in the way of the other heroes, cause collateral damage, and puts citizens in danger just to get racked up on a point sheet.   It's here... that we can finally touch on Fire Emblem, because they're an important part of The Rising's story.   So... Fire Emblem is self-described as a gay superhero (and he's got fire powers, get it?). Being that they own their own company, they're their own sponsor. But like... Fire Emblem feels like a really bad take on a gay person, more akin to The Crying Game and that era of not differentiating gay men from trans-women or the like.    In a lot of ways, Fire Emblem reminds me of Levin from Tekkaman Blade (I'm going somewhere with this, bear with me). Levin was also swishy, flaming, and very flirty with the protagonist--and there's a very touching episode where Levin talks to a woman about living their truth. There's only one Levin in the world, and they live true to themselves, and Levin contains multitudes that just can't be described by simple binary concepts like ""man"" or ""woman."" And in a lot of ways, that's what Fire Emblem is going for: we see in their past that Nathan (Fire Emblem's real name) struggled with their attraction to men or presenting as a woman. Their big climactic moment while stuck in a nightmare of their own worst fears is having a Persona 4 moment and embracing their shadow, celebrating what it means to be themselves. This is really good and genuinely compelling and it does loads to keep Fire Emblem from just being a camp joke... if only Fire Emblem weren't always goosing the other men and touching their butts in what's clearly discomforting. Like, Levin also thirsted for D-Boy, but they kept their hands to themselves.       I'm actually really sweet on Fire Emblem for this type of extremely extra character. Anime doesn't have a good track record of portraying openly queer characters; they're often extremely one note, and while there are elements of Fire Emblem that still aid into negative stereotypes like occasionally making predatory statements or bad touching, there's also a lot of sincerity around the character as well. Fire Emblem regularly proves to be mature, competent, and an emotionally supportive character to others. The other characters never shun Nathan for who they are or who they love, and overall I'm glad that the series' writing does seem to take their character seriously even if it's not perfect.      Nathan's pros definitely outweigh his cons and I don't want to give the impression that I think they're an outright bad character; the phrase ""problematic"" was made for moments like these. They're a great hero, a trusted friend, and honestly the only ding on their journey of acceptance is the fact that they kept goosing the other guys. Nathan is a person of color and that's always a delight to see in anime. Also, I'm using they/them pronouns for Nathan because it's my understanding the new Tiger & Bunny anime is also doing so in the dub.   And once Fire Emblem comes back they lend one heck of an assist to Blue Rose and Dragon Kid... Also, Fire Emblem is sponsored by Domino's. That just amuses me.      Kotetsu also manages to get the go-ahead to jump back in the game while the 2nd League Heroes were helping Fire Emblem recover. It's a good moment for them considering they got canned for not making any company money earlier.    I also loved Rock Bison's little moment of SEND ME FLYING and throwing up the horns after. He was sitting in dead last point-wise and was even desperate enough to start copying other people's bits in order to make himself more likeable to poor results due to how obvious the imitation was.     The Fastball Special is a time-honored tradition in superheroism; I salute Rock Bison in return. It's only a matter of time before the MCU makes it utterly obnoxious.   It also goes into some other themes about imitation, like Kotetsu's daughter trying to figure out how to write a good poem for her assignment but running into a wall when she keeps trying to imitate. Kotetsu surprisingly offers some worldly advice, which gets thrown right back at him.    Everyone keeps trying to live up to what they think they should be doing and not necessarily what they can with their abilities or being true to their feelings.   It turns out that none of the disasters have any kind of divine origin: it's all revenge, baby! A man named Virgil is responsible for organizing the NEXTs that kicked the whole thing off. Using Sternbild's mythology against them, Virgil's goal is revenge against Schneider. Years ago, Schneider took advantage of Virgil's father in a business deal, which led to Virgil's father taking his own life. Virgil teamed up with three other NEXTs whose lives had been ruined by Schneider's wheeling-and-dealing in order to take out their revenge.         Which ties into some stuff in the series. Longtime villain and villain-killer Lunatic shows up to help Virgil to enact his own sense of justice and stand as Kotetsu's ideological opposite while Barnaby stands against Virgil as his mirror and opposite. Both of them state that it's important to be able to center yourself in the present, move on, and not be stuck in the past.      I can't be the only one who thinks Lunatic resembles a weird cross between Purple Haze and King Crimson. Anyway, Virgil becomes a giant robot crab made out of junk metal and fights off Wild Tiger and Barnaby in an attempt at carrying out his own revenge, claiming justification because Barnaby also took his revenge on the man that killed his parents.     Using Kotetsu's only one minute of power they unleash a big show-stopping team-up climax! Sweet.      The fantastic showing reinvigorates the public's desire for the old Wild Tiger/Barnaby team-up too, and even Golden Ryan helps spur them back into teaming up again.     With a nice poem from Kotetsu's daughter, the movie closes with the heroes continuing their duty of protecting Sternbild. It's a really solid ending for a solid pair of movies.     I thought these were both good as a re-introduction but also an epilogue for the series. It doesn't cover everything but it deals with a lot of elements that make Tiger & Bunny stand out.   As a Tiger & Bunny neophyte, I think these movies also serve really well as an introduction to the series. You get just enough of a taste of the other heroes to want to see more, the dynamic between Kotetsu and Barnaby is well-established, and the general feel of Sternbild is introduced. It's a unique world with interesting heroes, and I'm glad it's priming to make a big comeback to the world of anime. I hope Tiger & Bunny reaches a much bigger crowd this time around.   Yeah, I actually missed the initial boat for this one 10 years ago and had to binge the first season shortly before this because I kept putting it off until the second season was just around the corner. But I don't regret a minute of it. I definitely regret the fact that this couldn't be a bigger hit when it came out for a myriad of complicated reasons. That doesn't mean it's too late. Just because it's over a decade now doesn't mean it still can't have its day in the sun!   Nothing would be truer to this fail-dad than being late to his own successful franchise, I tell you what!     Anyways, this is Nicky & Jean-Karlo, over and out!

Jean-Karlo  This week's This Week in Anime was brought to you by Crab! It all comes crawling back to Crab™!     Crab and very region-specific Pepsi sounds like an interesting flavor combo, NGL. But still not as interesting of a combo as the hero duo Tiger & Bunny!     The original Tiger & Bunny anime came out a bit before the massive influx of superheroes became the mono-culture in the U.S. And weirdly enough, it's taken this long for the series to come back with a new season. Netflix is also streaming two movies for the Tiger & Bunny series, The Beginning and The Rising.   These two films came out in 2012 and 2014 respectively but have just now been re-released for streaming on Netflix in honor of that hot new second season. The Beginning is half re-cap of the early part of the series and serves as a great re-introduction for our Super Hero Buddy Cops, while The Rising takes place after the series proper with entirely new material.     Now, I love me some Japanese superheroes, especially the old blood. Yatterman, Gatchaman, Kamen Rider, Casshern, Ultraman, that stuff. And I was always interested in how Japan would handle a take on more Americanized superheroes. Tiger & Bunny has been beloved by fans since its premiere, and not just because of the wave of heroes the Mouse of House churns out on a daily basis. It's a fascinating show, all the way down to the folks wearing those fancy sponsored CG costumes.   Tiger & Bunny is conceptually rich because it fully breaks down the idea of commercialized heroing as an industry, including real company sponsors (which leads to some funny dissonance). The heroes of Sternbild receive live TV coverage and toe the line between being enforcers, performers, and public motivators, along with everything else that life throws at them, on and off the cameras. The focus on the corporate inner workings is part of what makes it feel more mature. It's not just some kids' fantasy of saving people, but a more detailed look at what would happen if someone really tried to make this their job.   Normally, all the heroes compete for points with each other. But when veteran Wild Tiger, real name Kotetsu Kaburagi, moves to a new company after his previous one folds, he's paired with the young and ambitious Barnaby Brooks Jr., to which he affectionally nicknames Bunny, much to his new partner's annoyance.      What makes Tiger & Bunny work – unlike a lot of ""these heroes are realistic!"" joints like The Boys – is that it's not relentlessly dour. The characters aren't irredeemable louts or psychopaths, they're just people trying to make an honest living while living under the whims of an unfeeling, uncaring management system. These people live or die by their sponsors. It's more Mystery Men than anything else, and that's a damn original place to start from when you're making a superhero movie.   It also leans heavily into the showbiz stuff more than any other cape thing I had watched before, but if anything its core is its ensemble cast of heroes and trying to build the companionship between the two main characters. Like many stories about manly bonds, the two of them start out pretty prickly at first, but both have also suffered severe losses of love in their lives. Kotetsu has a 10-year-old daughter he keeps his work secret from, and has previously lost his wife. Barnaby lost his family to a tragic (extremely plot related) incident that left him traumatized. Just knowing this, you can see how much they could benefit from having someone else to call family in their life. Y'know, assuming you could get one of them to open up.     Kotetsu is a really compelling character, and not just because he's a handsome fail-dad with a stylish outfit. He just needs some loving heart to make him better, or worse, that's a fantasy, too. He's goofy and his sense of heroism really doesn't jive with the mercenary world he's in, but rather than feeling like an idiot he just feels quaint. He's not wrong to want to help people, he's just shouldering more weight than he can carry because he just cares about people that much.     He's definitely meant to appeal to an older audience, a rarity for anime, and he's the the heart of the show despite being a lame guy who struggles to keep up with the younger competition. He constantly lets people down, including his own daughter, but you can tell he really values people's feelings just as much as being a hero.     As if to underline it all: his is the only ""conventional"" superhero outfit among all the other heroes. Everyone else has a fancy suit of armor, but Wild Tiger insists on a cape, a themed cowl, and a strongman suit. Even when he gets his updated power suit, he still wears his old one underneath. You can see him wearing the mask inside his helmet.   Barnaby however is the complete opposite, all suped up in the latest tech and uses his real name and face. He instantly saves Kotetsu's sorry ass and is eager to climb up the ladder. They also both happen to share the same type of power, including the fact that both of them have a time limit to use it.      Where Kotetsu wants to be a hero out of a genuine-to-a-fault desire to help people, Barnaby is wholly self-interested... or so he tells himself. He's convinced that putting his identity out there and acting as a hero can get him the funds and recognition he needs to track down the Oroboros group, the crime ring involved with the  murder of his parents. He may not want to care about other people, but he still cares nevertheless. Not that he'd ever admit it to such an embarrassing dad like Kotetsu.   Also, in a twist of fate, Barnaby Brooks Jr is Kotetsu's daughter's favorite superhero. Not even Wild Tiger. Eesh.      Kotetsu's old school ways doesn't make him popular, even with his own daughter. He was inspired by the King of Old Timers, Mr. Legend, so it makes sense that he clings to those ideals. Many people with super powers in this world – referred to as NEXT – don't always fit in when their powers are fresh and new, and even so, not everyone is fit to be a hero.      This is explored a bit more in The Rising, but a lot of NEXTs have powers that just skirt the line of being useful. Stuff like producing a toxin that just makes you really itchy. Or making your hand grow really, really big. Or, like... being really good at swimming. Kotetsu himself rides that line, partially because of his shtick, partially because his power on its own isn't the best (he can make himself one-hundred times stronger for a short period of time), and partially because he tends to leap before he looks. Like My Hero Academia and its many characters that have wholly-pedestrian Quirks, a lot of heroes in Tiger & Bunny just aren't meant for the big leagues.   When the series begins, Kotetsu is at least doing well enough to stand alongside the biggest heroes in the city: the immovable Rock Bison, the scaredy-cat ninja Origami Cyclone, the thunder-wielding Dragon Kid, the literally-flaming Fire Emblem, the King of Heroes Sky High, and the ice-wielding idol Blue Rose.       And even in The Beginning we really see how Kotetsu helps bring these people together. At first they don't really have much comradery with each other, they might even get in each other's way, something the villain of the first movie actively uses against all of them. But by the time The Rising happens you can really feel how they've grown close.   As always, the villain is capitalism. Because all of the heroes are part of Hero TV, a superhero reality tv show, they're all rated on their actions. You earn points for saving citizens and preventing disasters, but lose points if you fail to capture criminals or if they give you the slip. Getting points is important because you cannot become a hero without a sponsor, and doing well means your sponsor is happy. Happy sponsors, happy network, happy hero. Thus, it's against their best interests to help each other out: each hero scrambles for as many points as they can get.    This is also part of why Kotetsu is such a bomb in the ratings: much to his producer's chagrin, he values people's lives over ratings or network shares, so instead of waiting for a commercial break to let the audience get excited he goes and just tries to save people anyway.      Other than the recap portion of the movie, the plot of The Beginning is that someone nabs the city's very important golden statue of justice and nobody can catch the crook. All the heroes run around, get bamboozled by his power to swap places, and it's really just a fun excuse to allow the cast run around and interact. Anime movies often feel bad for being superfluous, but since Tiger & Bunny the series has quite a few episodes dedicated to just building up the characters, it doesn't really feel out of place for the franchise.     It helps that the other heroes aren't terribly complicated and nevertheless get plenty of scenes to themselves. When the team is called out to arrest thief Robin Baxter, they all go their separate ways... together. Dragon Kid and Blue Rose talk about earrings. Fire Emblem... flirts with Rock Bison. Sky High shows off his wind-control powers to Origami Cyclone, showing an uncharacteristically fun-loving side of himself. It's good stuff that does a good job of letting the cast start to see themselves as more than just competitors.       They each get their moments, whether it's Sky High being a little ""up in the clouds"" even though he's currently the top-rated hero, Rock Bison and Kotetsu being Old Guys together as pals at the bottom of the rankings, or Blue Rose's hilariously cheesy mandated catchphrase.   I also wanna point out that I love the character designs in Tiger & Bunny. It's not just Kotetsu's fancy outfits or Barnaby's flowing locks – everyone in this series looks amazing. Masakazu Katsura was brought onboard to handle character designs; he worked on the superhero-flavored Zetman but he's also known for the romantic comedies D.N.A.², Video Girl Ai, and I''s. His charming character designs are fantastic.   ... Also, he did a manga called Wingman about a toku-themed superhero and I'm dying to see that get brought back someday.    They're also more semi-realistic than most anime even ten years ago and it works better since most of the characters are older. The downside is that it makes them harder to animate too, so expect them to look off-model in places. But I think overall the movies look good even compared to today's standards, including the heavy use of CG for the suits and the action.     As it turns out, the CG is on purpose: because many of the costumes would otherwise have to be redrawn if sponsors for the heroes changed (or if the sponsorship brands had to be removed for foreign markets), it's just easier to render them as CG models. The only one who gets traditional animation is Blue Rose, partly because it's hard to shove a logo on her skimpy outfit, partly because she's T&B's source of T&A.     Which becomes upsetting when you remember she's supposed to be in high school still, for some reason. Why are there no adult female superheroes?!   Nobody said idol culture was healthy... A detail the movies leave out from the series is that Blue Rose might have romantic inclinations towards Kotetsu, who's like... twice her age. Thank goodness. Also, because let's be honest, Kotetsu and Barnaby all the way. A family can be a little girl and her two bickering superhero dads.     That's touched on in the series but I prefer to see it as a ""hero crush"" rather than just being hot for a single dad since she obviously takes Kotetsu's ideals to heart after a point. But it's not strong enough to get in the way of Kotetsu and Barnaby's intense married couple energy. The series very much leans in on the ""partner"" thing in more than just a joke or tongue-in-cheek way; they really are each other's emotional support. Which is why in The Rising the whole plot is just about them breaking up and trying to get back together. It's classic.     I wanna touch on one more thing from The Beginning before we get into The Rising: it ends with a really big show of trust for Barnaby from Kotetsu. Barnaby manages to trick Robin Baxter into imprisoning himself, but later finds that Kotetsu specifically went out of his way not only to let the other heroes allow Barnaby to do this alone, but also made sure to hang in the background to make sure Barnaby's plan went off. As much as Kotetsu chafes at Barnaby's antics, he still wants him to feel like a member of a team.      Oh yeah, it's a great moment of just the way Kotetsu quietly supports people even if they didn't ask for it or he doesn't always know how to show it, and the plan wouldn't have worked if Kotetsu never stuck his neck out to the others the way he did.    I'll also take a moment to shoutout to the dub. I found both language tracks to be pretty good, but Tiger & Bunny has a lot of what I miss in anime dubs. The script is adapted really well and fits the more natural and Americanized feel of the show and the more diverse cast.   Being that I'm more of a fan of older Japanese heroes, I do regret the more-Americanized takes on the recent Japanese superheroes. But this does mean that a lot of life is breathed into them in English dubs.   Anyway, Kotetsu starts The Rising out with his breath beaten out of him. Wild Tiger and Barnaby have sunk in the ratings in the time since The Beginning (it's been a few months and later events from the Tiger & Bunny series have transpired). They're knocked down to the ""Second League"", where a bunch of not-so-great superheroes dwell.      Kotetsu had gotten up in age to the point where he can't use his powers very long and is trying to take a slower pace to accommodate but fears that by doing so he's now drawing down his partner.   The good news is, a mogul named Mark Schneider bought out their old sponsor and pulls the strings needed to get Barnaby back up to the First League, teaming him up with a new hero named Golden Ryan. The bad news is, Schneider had no intention of doing anything for Kotetsu: without a sponsor, he's forced to retire from heroism and take up a job as a cab driver.     Golden Ryan (A pun on ""Golden Lion"" to Kotetsu's Tiger), is also a bit of a huge douchebag.     You think the guys at Banpresto had a laugh about their logo being emblazoned on such a tool of a hero? I can't see him making any Super Robot Wars cameos anytime soon...   At any rate, a series of disasters strikes the city. Barnaby puts the clues together and deduces that the disasters are connected to an old legend from the city's history: a goddess, angered by mankind's greed, sends earthquakes, sleeping sickness and a massive chasm to devour the city. The problem is just trying to convince the higher-ups to let the heroes investigate this.    Also compounding issues is Golden Ryan being concerned with just earning points for just him and Barnaby, instead of collaborating with other heroes--a selfishness helped along with Ryan's gravity-powers.      Barnaby may have been eager in the past, but he sticks to his ideals plenty compared to Ryan, whose dubious methods actively gets in the way of the other heroes, cause collateral damage, and puts citizens in danger just to get racked up on a point sheet.   It's here... that we can finally touch on Fire Emblem, because they're an important part of The Rising's story.   So... Fire Emblem is self-described as a gay superhero (and he's got fire powers, get it?). Being that they own their own company, they're their own sponsor. But like... Fire Emblem feels like a really bad take on a gay person, more akin to The Crying Game and that era of not differentiating gay men from trans-women or the like.    In a lot of ways, Fire Emblem reminds me of Levin from Tekkaman Blade (I'm going somewhere with this, bear with me). Levin was also swishy, flaming, and very flirty with the protagonist--and there's a very touching episode where Levin talks to a woman about living their truth. There's only one Levin in the world, and they live true to themselves, and Levin contains multitudes that just can't be described by simple binary concepts like ""man"" or ""woman."" And in a lot of ways, that's what Fire Emblem is going for: we see in their past that Nathan (Fire Emblem's real name) struggled with their attraction to men or presenting as a woman. Their big climactic moment while stuck in a nightmare of their own worst fears is having a Persona 4 moment and embracing their shadow, celebrating what it means to be themselves. This is really good and genuinely compelling and it does loads to keep Fire Emblem from just being a camp joke... if only Fire Emblem weren't always goosing the other men and touching their butts in what's clearly discomforting. Like, Levin also thirsted for D-Boy, but they kept their hands to themselves.       I'm actually really sweet on Fire Emblem for this type of extremely extra character. Anime doesn't have a good track record of portraying openly queer characters; they're often extremely one note, and while there are elements of Fire Emblem that still aid into negative stereotypes like occasionally making predatory statements or bad touching, there's also a lot of sincerity around the character as well. Fire Emblem regularly proves to be mature, competent, and an emotionally supportive character to others. The other characters never shun Nathan for who they are or who they love, and overall I'm glad that the series' writing does seem to take their character seriously even if it's not perfect.      Nathan's pros definitely outweigh his cons and I don't want to give the impression that I think they're an outright bad character; the phrase ""problematic"" was made for moments like these. They're a great hero, a trusted friend, and honestly the only ding on their journey of acceptance is the fact that they kept goosing the other guys. Nathan is a person of color and that's always a delight to see in anime. Also, I'm using they/them pronouns for Nathan because it's my understanding the new Tiger & Bunny anime is also doing so in the dub.   And once Fire Emblem comes back they lend one heck of an assist to Blue Rose and Dragon Kid... Also, Fire Emblem is sponsored by Domino's. That just amuses me.      Kotetsu also manages to get the go-ahead to jump back in the game while the 2nd League Heroes were helping Fire Emblem recover. It's a good moment for them considering they got canned for not making any company money earlier.    I also loved Rock Bison's little moment of SEND ME FLYING and throwing up the horns after. He was sitting in dead last point-wise and was even desperate enough to start copying other people's bits in order to make himself more likeable to poor results due to how obvious the imitation was.     The Fastball Special is a time-honored tradition in superheroism; I salute Rock Bison in return. It's only a matter of time before the MCU makes it utterly obnoxious.   It also goes into some other themes about imitation, like Kotetsu's daughter trying to figure out how to write a good poem for her assignment but running into a wall when she keeps trying to imitate. Kotetsu surprisingly offers some worldly advice, which gets thrown right back at him.    Everyone keeps trying to live up to what they think they should be doing and not necessarily what they can with their abilities or being true to their feelings.   It turns out that none of the disasters have any kind of divine origin: it's all revenge, baby! A man named Virgil is responsible for organizing the NEXTs that kicked the whole thing off. Using Sternbild's mythology against them, Virgil's goal is revenge against Schneider. Years ago, Schneider took advantage of Virgil's father in a business deal, which led to Virgil's father taking his own life. Virgil teamed up with three other NEXTs whose lives had been ruined by Schneider's wheeling-and-dealing in order to take out their revenge.         Which ties into some stuff in the series. Longtime villain and villain-killer Lunatic shows up to help Virgil to enact his own sense of justice and stand as Kotetsu's ideological opposite while Barnaby stands against Virgil as his mirror and opposite. Both of them state that it's important to be able to center yourself in the present, move on, and not be stuck in the past.      I can't be the only one who thinks Lunatic resembles a weird cross between Purple Haze and King Crimson. Anyway, Virgil becomes a giant robot crab made out of junk metal and fights off Wild Tiger and Barnaby in an attempt at carrying out his own revenge, claiming justification because Barnaby also took his revenge on the man that killed his parents.     Using Kotetsu's only one minute of power they unleash a big show-stopping team-up climax! Sweet.      The fantastic showing reinvigorates the public's desire for the old Wild Tiger/Barnaby team-up too, and even Golden Ryan helps spur them back into teaming up again.     With a nice poem from Kotetsu's daughter, the movie closes with the heroes continuing their duty of protecting Sternbild. It's a really solid ending for a solid pair of movies.     I thought these were both good as a re-introduction but also an epilogue for the series. It doesn't cover everything but it deals with a lot of elements that make Tiger & Bunny stand out.   As a Tiger & Bunny neophyte, I think these movies also serve really well as an introduction to the series. You get just enough of a taste of the other heroes to want to see more, the dynamic between Kotetsu and Barnaby is well-established, and the general feel of Sternbild is introduced. It's a unique world with interesting heroes, and I'm glad it's priming to make a big comeback to the world of anime. I hope Tiger & Bunny reaches a much bigger crowd this time around.   Yeah, I actually missed the initial boat for this one 10 years ago and had to binge the first season shortly before this because I kept putting it off until the second season was just around the corner. But I don't regret a minute of it. I definitely regret the fact that this couldn't be a bigger hit when it came out for a myriad of complicated reasons. That doesn't mean it's too late. Just because it's over a decade now doesn't mean it still can't have its day in the sun!   Nothing would be truer to this fail-dad than being late to his own successful franchise, I tell you what!     Anyways, this is Nicky & Jean-Karlo, over and out!

Tiger & Bunny is conceptually rich because it fully breaks down the idea of commercialized heroing as an industry, including real company sponsors (which leads to some funny dissonance). The heroes of Sternbild receive live TV coverage and toe the line between being enforcers, performers, and public motivators, along with everything else that life throws at them, on and off the cameras. The focus on the corporate inner workings is part of what makes it feel more mature. It's not just some kids' fantasy of saving people, but a more detailed look at what would happen if someone really tried to make this their job.   Normally, all the heroes compete for points with each other. But when veteran Wild Tiger, real name Kotetsu Kaburagi, moves to a new company after his previous one folds, he's paired with the young and ambitious Barnaby Brooks Jr., to which he affectionally nicknames Bunny, much to his new partner's annoyance.      What makes Tiger & Bunny work – unlike a lot of ""these heroes are realistic!"" joints like The Boys – is that it's not relentlessly dour. The characters aren't irredeemable louts or psychopaths, they're just people trying to make an honest living while living under the whims of an unfeeling, uncaring management system. These people live or die by their sponsors. It's more Mystery Men than anything else, and that's a damn original place to start from when you're making a superhero movie.   It also leans heavily into the showbiz stuff more than any other cape thing I had watched before, but if anything its core is its ensemble cast of heroes and trying to build the companionship between the two main characters. Like many stories about manly bonds, the two of them start out pretty prickly at first, but both have also suffered severe losses of love in their lives. Kotetsu has a 10-year-old daughter he keeps his work secret from, and has previously lost his wife. Barnaby lost his family to a tragic (extremely plot related) incident that left him traumatized. Just knowing this, you can see how much they could benefit from having someone else to call family in their life. Y'know, assuming you could get one of them to open up.     Kotetsu is a really compelling character, and not just because he's a handsome fail-dad with a stylish outfit. He just needs some loving heart to make him better, or worse, that's a fantasy, too. He's goofy and his sense of heroism really doesn't jive with the mercenary world he's in, but rather than feeling like an idiot he just feels quaint. He's not wrong to want to help people, he's just shouldering more weight than he can carry because he just cares about people that much.     He's definitely meant to appeal to an older audience, a rarity for anime, and he's the the heart of the show despite being a lame guy who struggles to keep up with the younger competition. He constantly lets people down, including his own daughter, but you can tell he really values people's feelings just as much as being a hero.     As if to underline it all: his is the only ""conventional"" superhero outfit among all the other heroes. Everyone else has a fancy suit of armor, but Wild Tiger insists on a cape, a themed cowl, and a strongman suit. Even when he gets his updated power suit, he still wears his old one underneath. You can see him wearing the mask inside his helmet.   Barnaby however is the complete opposite, all suped up in the latest tech and uses his real name and face. He instantly saves Kotetsu's sorry ass and is eager to climb up the ladder. They also both happen to share the same type of power, including the fact that both of them have a time limit to use it.      Where Kotetsu wants to be a hero out of a genuine-to-a-fault desire to help people, Barnaby is wholly self-interested... or so he tells himself. He's convinced that putting his identity out there and acting as a hero can get him the funds and recognition he needs to track down the Oroboros group, the crime ring involved with the  murder of his parents. He may not want to care about other people, but he still cares nevertheless. Not that he'd ever admit it to such an embarrassing dad like Kotetsu.   Also, in a twist of fate, Barnaby Brooks Jr is Kotetsu's daughter's favorite superhero. Not even Wild Tiger. Eesh.      Kotetsu's old school ways doesn't make him popular, even with his own daughter. He was inspired by the King of Old Timers, Mr. Legend, so it makes sense that he clings to those ideals. Many people with super powers in this world – referred to as NEXT – don't always fit in when their powers are fresh and new, and even so, not everyone is fit to be a hero.      This is explored a bit more in The Rising, but a lot of NEXTs have powers that just skirt the line of being useful. Stuff like producing a toxin that just makes you really itchy. Or making your hand grow really, really big. Or, like... being really good at swimming. Kotetsu himself rides that line, partially because of his shtick, partially because his power on its own isn't the best (he can make himself one-hundred times stronger for a short period of time), and partially because he tends to leap before he looks. Like My Hero Academia and its many characters that have wholly-pedestrian Quirks, a lot of heroes in Tiger & Bunny just aren't meant for the big leagues.   When the series begins, Kotetsu is at least doing well enough to stand alongside the biggest heroes in the city: the immovable Rock Bison, the scaredy-cat ninja Origami Cyclone, the thunder-wielding Dragon Kid, the literally-flaming Fire Emblem, the King of Heroes Sky High, and the ice-wielding idol Blue Rose.       And even in The Beginning we really see how Kotetsu helps bring these people together. At first they don't really have much comradery with each other, they might even get in each other's way, something the villain of the first movie actively uses against all of them. But by the time The Rising happens you can really feel how they've grown close.   As always, the villain is capitalism. Because all of the heroes are part of Hero TV, a superhero reality tv show, they're all rated on their actions. You earn points for saving citizens and preventing disasters, but lose points if you fail to capture criminals or if they give you the slip. Getting points is important because you cannot become a hero without a sponsor, and doing well means your sponsor is happy. Happy sponsors, happy network, happy hero. Thus, it's against their best interests to help each other out: each hero scrambles for as many points as they can get.    This is also part of why Kotetsu is such a bomb in the ratings: much to his producer's chagrin, he values people's lives over ratings or network shares, so instead of waiting for a commercial break to let the audience get excited he goes and just tries to save people anyway.      Other than the recap portion of the movie, the plot of The Beginning is that someone nabs the city's very important golden statue of justice and nobody can catch the crook. All the heroes run around, get bamboozled by his power to swap places, and it's really just a fun excuse to allow the cast run around and interact. Anime movies often feel bad for being superfluous, but since Tiger & Bunny the series has quite a few episodes dedicated to just building up the characters, it doesn't really feel out of place for the franchise.     It helps that the other heroes aren't terribly complicated and nevertheless get plenty of scenes to themselves. When the team is called out to arrest thief Robin Baxter, they all go their separate ways... together. Dragon Kid and Blue Rose talk about earrings. Fire Emblem... flirts with Rock Bison. Sky High shows off his wind-control powers to Origami Cyclone, showing an uncharacteristically fun-loving side of himself. It's good stuff that does a good job of letting the cast start to see themselves as more than just competitors.       They each get their moments, whether it's Sky High being a little ""up in the clouds"" even though he's currently the top-rated hero, Rock Bison and Kotetsu being Old Guys together as pals at the bottom of the rankings, or Blue Rose's hilariously cheesy mandated catchphrase.   I also wanna point out that I love the character designs in Tiger & Bunny. It's not just Kotetsu's fancy outfits or Barnaby's flowing locks – everyone in this series looks amazing. Masakazu Katsura was brought onboard to handle character designs; he worked on the superhero-flavored Zetman but he's also known for the romantic comedies D.N.A.², Video Girl Ai, and I''s. His charming character designs are fantastic.   ... Also, he did a manga called Wingman about a toku-themed superhero and I'm dying to see that get brought back someday.    They're also more semi-realistic than most anime even ten years ago and it works better since most of the characters are older. The downside is that it makes them harder to animate too, so expect them to look off-model in places. But I think overall the movies look good even compared to today's standards, including the heavy use of CG for the suits and the action.     As it turns out, the CG is on purpose: because many of the costumes would otherwise have to be redrawn if sponsors for the heroes changed (or if the sponsorship brands had to be removed for foreign markets), it's just easier to render them as CG models. The only one who gets traditional animation is Blue Rose, partly because it's hard to shove a logo on her skimpy outfit, partly because she's T&B's source of T&A.     Which becomes upsetting when you remember she's supposed to be in high school still, for some reason. Why are there no adult female superheroes?!   Nobody said idol culture was healthy... A detail the movies leave out from the series is that Blue Rose might have romantic inclinations towards Kotetsu, who's like... twice her age. Thank goodness. Also, because let's be honest, Kotetsu and Barnaby all the way. A family can be a little girl and her two bickering superhero dads.     That's touched on in the series but I prefer to see it as a ""hero crush"" rather than just being hot for a single dad since she obviously takes Kotetsu's ideals to heart after a point. But it's not strong enough to get in the way of Kotetsu and Barnaby's intense married couple energy. The series very much leans in on the ""partner"" thing in more than just a joke or tongue-in-cheek way; they really are each other's emotional support. Which is why in The Rising the whole plot is just about them breaking up and trying to get back together. It's classic.     I wanna touch on one more thing from The Beginning before we get into The Rising: it ends with a really big show of trust for Barnaby from Kotetsu. Barnaby manages to trick Robin Baxter into imprisoning himself, but later finds that Kotetsu specifically went out of his way not only to let the other heroes allow Barnaby to do this alone, but also made sure to hang in the background to make sure Barnaby's plan went off. As much as Kotetsu chafes at Barnaby's antics, he still wants him to feel like a member of a team.      Oh yeah, it's a great moment of just the way Kotetsu quietly supports people even if they didn't ask for it or he doesn't always know how to show it, and the plan wouldn't have worked if Kotetsu never stuck his neck out to the others the way he did.    I'll also take a moment to shoutout to the dub. I found both language tracks to be pretty good, but Tiger & Bunny has a lot of what I miss in anime dubs. The script is adapted really well and fits the more natural and Americanized feel of the show and the more diverse cast.   Being that I'm more of a fan of older Japanese heroes, I do regret the more-Americanized takes on the recent Japanese superheroes. But this does mean that a lot of life is breathed into them in English dubs.   Anyway, Kotetsu starts The Rising out with his breath beaten out of him. Wild Tiger and Barnaby have sunk in the ratings in the time since The Beginning (it's been a few months and later events from the Tiger & Bunny series have transpired). They're knocked down to the ""Second League"", where a bunch of not-so-great superheroes dwell.      Kotetsu had gotten up in age to the point where he can't use his powers very long and is trying to take a slower pace to accommodate but fears that by doing so he's now drawing down his partner.   The good news is, a mogul named Mark Schneider bought out their old sponsor and pulls the strings needed to get Barnaby back up to the First League, teaming him up with a new hero named Golden Ryan. The bad news is, Schneider had no intention of doing anything for Kotetsu: without a sponsor, he's forced to retire from heroism and take up a job as a cab driver.     Golden Ryan (A pun on ""Golden Lion"" to Kotetsu's Tiger), is also a bit of a huge douchebag.     You think the guys at Banpresto had a laugh about their logo being emblazoned on such a tool of a hero? I can't see him making any Super Robot Wars cameos anytime soon...   At any rate, a series of disasters strikes the city. Barnaby puts the clues together and deduces that the disasters are connected to an old legend from the city's history: a goddess, angered by mankind's greed, sends earthquakes, sleeping sickness and a massive chasm to devour the city. The problem is just trying to convince the higher-ups to let the heroes investigate this.    Also compounding issues is Golden Ryan being concerned with just earning points for just him and Barnaby, instead of collaborating with other heroes--a selfishness helped along with Ryan's gravity-powers.      Barnaby may have been eager in the past, but he sticks to his ideals plenty compared to Ryan, whose dubious methods actively gets in the way of the other heroes, cause collateral damage, and puts citizens in danger just to get racked up on a point sheet.   It's here... that we can finally touch on Fire Emblem, because they're an important part of The Rising's story.   So... Fire Emblem is self-described as a gay superhero (and he's got fire powers, get it?). Being that they own their own company, they're their own sponsor. But like... Fire Emblem feels like a really bad take on a gay person, more akin to The Crying Game and that era of not differentiating gay men from trans-women or the like.    In a lot of ways, Fire Emblem reminds me of Levin from Tekkaman Blade (I'm going somewhere with this, bear with me). Levin was also swishy, flaming, and very flirty with the protagonist--and there's a very touching episode where Levin talks to a woman about living their truth. There's only one Levin in the world, and they live true to themselves, and Levin contains multitudes that just can't be described by simple binary concepts like ""man"" or ""woman."" And in a lot of ways, that's what Fire Emblem is going for: we see in their past that Nathan (Fire Emblem's real name) struggled with their attraction to men or presenting as a woman. Their big climactic moment while stuck in a nightmare of their own worst fears is having a Persona 4 moment and embracing their shadow, celebrating what it means to be themselves. This is really good and genuinely compelling and it does loads to keep Fire Emblem from just being a camp joke... if only Fire Emblem weren't always goosing the other men and touching their butts in what's clearly discomforting. Like, Levin also thirsted for D-Boy, but they kept their hands to themselves.       I'm actually really sweet on Fire Emblem for this type of extremely extra character. Anime doesn't have a good track record of portraying openly queer characters; they're often extremely one note, and while there are elements of Fire Emblem that still aid into negative stereotypes like occasionally making predatory statements or bad touching, there's also a lot of sincerity around the character as well. Fire Emblem regularly proves to be mature, competent, and an emotionally supportive character to others. The other characters never shun Nathan for who they are or who they love, and overall I'm glad that the series' writing does seem to take their character seriously even if it's not perfect.      Nathan's pros definitely outweigh his cons and I don't want to give the impression that I think they're an outright bad character; the phrase ""problematic"" was made for moments like these. They're a great hero, a trusted friend, and honestly the only ding on their journey of acceptance is the fact that they kept goosing the other guys. Nathan is a person of color and that's always a delight to see in anime. Also, I'm using they/them pronouns for Nathan because it's my understanding the new Tiger & Bunny anime is also doing so in the dub.   And once Fire Emblem comes back they lend one heck of an assist to Blue Rose and Dragon Kid... Also, Fire Emblem is sponsored by Domino's. That just amuses me.      Kotetsu also manages to get the go-ahead to jump back in the game while the 2nd League Heroes were helping Fire Emblem recover. It's a good moment for them considering they got canned for not making any company money earlier.    I also loved Rock Bison's little moment of SEND ME FLYING and throwing up the horns after. He was sitting in dead last point-wise and was even desperate enough to start copying other people's bits in order to make himself more likeable to poor results due to how obvious the imitation was.     The Fastball Special is a time-honored tradition in superheroism; I salute Rock Bison in return. It's only a matter of time before the MCU makes it utterly obnoxious.   It also goes into some other themes about imitation, like Kotetsu's daughter trying to figure out how to write a good poem for her assignment but running into a wall when she keeps trying to imitate. Kotetsu surprisingly offers some worldly advice, which gets thrown right back at him.    Everyone keeps trying to live up to what they think they should be doing and not necessarily what they can with their abilities or being true to their feelings.   It turns out that none of the disasters have any kind of divine origin: it's all revenge, baby! A man named Virgil is responsible for organizing the NEXTs that kicked the whole thing off. Using Sternbild's mythology against them, Virgil's goal is revenge against Schneider. Years ago, Schneider took advantage of Virgil's father in a business deal, which led to Virgil's father taking his own life. Virgil teamed up with three other NEXTs whose lives had been ruined by Schneider's wheeling-and-dealing in order to take out their revenge.         Which ties into some stuff in the series. Longtime villain and villain-killer Lunatic shows up to help Virgil to enact his own sense of justice and stand as Kotetsu's ideological opposite while Barnaby stands against Virgil as his mirror and opposite. Both of them state that it's important to be able to center yourself in the present, move on, and not be stuck in the past.      I can't be the only one who thinks Lunatic resembles a weird cross between Purple Haze and King Crimson. Anyway, Virgil becomes a giant robot crab made out of junk metal and fights off Wild Tiger and Barnaby in an attempt at carrying out his own revenge, claiming justification because Barnaby also took his revenge on the man that killed his parents.     Using Kotetsu's only one minute of power they unleash a big show-stopping team-up climax! Sweet.      The fantastic showing reinvigorates the public's desire for the old Wild Tiger/Barnaby team-up too, and even Golden Ryan helps spur them back into teaming up again.     With a nice poem from Kotetsu's daughter, the movie closes with the heroes continuing their duty of protecting Sternbild. It's a really solid ending for a solid pair of movies.     I thought these were both good as a re-introduction but also an epilogue for the series. It doesn't cover everything but it deals with a lot of elements that make Tiger & Bunny stand out.   As a Tiger & Bunny neophyte, I think these movies also serve really well as an introduction to the series. You get just enough of a taste of the other heroes to want to see more, the dynamic between Kotetsu and Barnaby is well-established, and the general feel of Sternbild is introduced. It's a unique world with interesting heroes, and I'm glad it's priming to make a big comeback to the world of anime. I hope Tiger & Bunny reaches a much bigger crowd this time around.   Yeah, I actually missed the initial boat for this one 10 years ago and had to binge the first season shortly before this because I kept putting it off until the second season was just around the corner. But I don't regret a minute of it. I definitely regret the fact that this couldn't be a bigger hit when it came out for a myriad of complicated reasons. That doesn't mean it's too late. Just because it's over a decade now doesn't mean it still can't have its day in the sun!   Nothing would be truer to this fail-dad than being late to his own successful franchise, I tell you what!     Anyways, this is Nicky & Jean-Karlo, over and out!

Jean-Karlo  This week's This Week in Anime was brought to you by Crab! It all comes crawling back to Crab™!     Crab and very region-specific Pepsi sounds like an interesting flavor combo, NGL. But still not as interesting of a combo as the hero duo Tiger & Bunny!     The original Tiger & Bunny anime came out a bit before the massive influx of superheroes became the mono-culture in the U.S. And weirdly enough, it's taken this long for the series to come back with a new season. Netflix is also streaming two movies for the Tiger & Bunny series, The Beginning and The Rising.   These two films came out in 2012 and 2014 respectively but have just now been re-released for streaming on Netflix in honor of that hot new second season. The Beginning is half re-cap of the early part of the series and serves as a great re-introduction for our Super Hero Buddy Cops, while The Rising takes place after the series proper with entirely new material.     Now, I love me some Japanese superheroes, especially the old blood. Yatterman, Gatchaman, Kamen Rider, Casshern, Ultraman, that stuff. And I was always interested in how Japan would handle a take on more Americanized superheroes. Tiger & Bunny has been beloved by fans since its premiere, and not just because of the wave of heroes the Mouse of House churns out on a daily basis. It's a fascinating show, all the way down to the folks wearing those fancy sponsored CG costumes.   Tiger & Bunny is conceptually rich because it fully breaks down the idea of commercialized heroing as an industry, including real company sponsors (which leads to some funny dissonance).

The focus on the corporate inner workings is part of what makes it feel more mature. It's not just some kids' fantasy of saving people, but a more detailed look at what would happen if someone really tried to make this their job.   Normally, all the heroes compete for points with each other. But when veteran Wild Tiger, real name Kotetsu Kaburagi, moves to a new company after his previous one folds, he's paired with the young and ambitious Barnaby Brooks Jr., to which he affectionally nicknames Bunny, much to his new partner's annoyance.

His charming character designs are fantastic.   ... Also, he did a manga called Wingman about a toku-themed superhero and I'm dying to see that get brought back someday.    They're also more semi-realistic than most anime even ten years ago and it works better since most of the characters are older. The downside is that it makes them harder to animate too, so expect them to look off-model in places. But I think overall the movies look good even compared to today's standards, including the heavy use of CG for the suits and the action.     As it turns out, the CG is on purpose: because many of the costumes would otherwise have to be redrawn if sponsors for the heroes changed (or if the sponsorship brands had to be removed for foreign markets), it's just easier to render them as CG models. The only one who gets traditional animation is Blue Rose, partly because it's hard to shove a logo on her skimpy outfit, partly because she's T&B's source of T&A.     Which becomes upsetting when you remember she's supposed to be in high school still, for some reason. Why are there no adult female superheroes?!   Nobody said idol culture was healthy... A detail the movies leave out from the series is that Blue Rose might have romantic inclinations towards Kotetsu, who's like... twice her age. Thank goodness. Also, because let's be honest, Kotetsu and Barnaby all the way. A family can be a little girl and her two bickering superhero dads.     That's touched on in the series but I prefer to see it as a ""hero crush"" rather than just being hot for a single dad since she obviously takes Kotetsu's ideals to heart after a point. But it's not strong enough to get in the way of Kotetsu and Barnaby's intense married couple energy. The series very much leans in on the ""partner"" thing in more than just a joke or tongue-in-cheek way; they really are each other's emotional support. Which is why in The Rising the whole plot is just about them breaking up and trying to get back together. It's classic.     I wanna touch on one more thing from The Beginning before we get into The Rising: it ends with a really big show of trust for Barnaby from Kotetsu. Barnaby manages to trick Robin Baxter into imprisoning himself, but later finds that Kotetsu specifically went out of his way not only to let the other heroes allow Barnaby to do this alone, but also made sure to hang in the background to make sure Barnaby's plan went off. As much as Kotetsu chafes at Barnaby's antics, he still wants him to feel like a member of a team.      Oh yeah, it's a great moment of just the way Kotetsu quietly supports people even if they didn't ask for it or he doesn't always know how to show it, and the plan wouldn't have worked if Kotetsu never stuck his neck out to the others the way he did.    I'll also take a moment to shoutout to the dub. I found both language tracks to be pretty good, but Tiger & Bunny has a lot of what I miss in anime dubs. The script is adapted really well and fits the more natural and Americanized feel of the show and the more diverse cast.   Being that I'm more of a fan of older Japanese heroes, I do regret the more-Americanized takes on the recent Japanese superheroes. But this does mean that a lot of life is breathed into them in English dubs.   Anyway, Kotetsu starts The Rising out with his breath beaten out of him. Wild Tiger and Barnaby have sunk in the ratings in the time since The Beginning (it's been a few months and later events from the Tiger & Bunny series have transpired). They're knocked down to the ""Second League"", where a bunch of not-so-great superheroes dwell.      Kotetsu had gotten up in age to the point where he can't use his powers very long and is trying to take a slower pace to accommodate but fears that by doing so he's now drawing down his partner.   The good news is, a mogul named Mark Schneider bought out their old sponsor and pulls the strings needed to get Barnaby back up to the First League, teaming him up with a new hero named Golden Ryan. The bad news is, Schneider had no intention of doing anything for Kotetsu: without a sponsor, he's forced to retire from heroism and take up a job as a cab driver.     Golden Ryan (A pun on ""Golden Lion"" to Kotetsu's Tiger), is also a bit of a huge douchebag.     You think the guys at Banpresto had a laugh about their logo being emblazoned on such a tool of a hero? I can't see him making any Super Robot Wars cameos anytime soon...   At any rate, a series of disasters strikes the city. Barnaby puts the clues together and deduces that the disasters are connected to an old legend from the city's history: a goddess, angered by mankind's greed, sends earthquakes, sleeping sickness and a massive chasm to devour the city. The problem is just trying to convince the higher-ups to let the heroes investigate this.    Also compounding issues is Golden Ryan being concerned with just earning points for just him and Barnaby, instead of collaborating with other heroes--a selfishness helped along with Ryan's gravity-powers.      Barnaby may have been eager in the past, but he sticks to his ideals plenty compared to Ryan, whose dubious methods actively gets in the way of the other heroes, cause collateral damage, and puts citizens in danger just to get racked up on a point sheet.   It's here... that we can finally touch on Fire Emblem, because they're an important part of The Rising's story.   So... Fire Emblem is self-described as a gay superhero (and he's got fire powers, get it?). Being that they own their own company, they're their own sponsor. But like... Fire Emblem feels like a really bad take on a gay person, more akin to The Crying Game and that era of not differentiating gay men from trans-women or the like.    In a lot of ways, Fire Emblem reminds me of Levin from Tekkaman Blade (I'm going somewhere with this, bear with me). Levin was also swishy, flaming, and very flirty with the protagonist--and there's a very touching episode where Levin talks to a woman about living their truth. There's only one Levin in the world, and they live true to themselves, and Levin contains multitudes that just can't be described by simple binary concepts like ""man"" or ""woman."" And in a lot of ways, that's what Fire Emblem is going for: we see in their past that Nathan (Fire Emblem's real name) struggled with their attraction to men or presenting as a woman. Their big climactic moment while stuck in a nightmare of their own worst fears is having a Persona 4 moment and embracing their shadow, celebrating what it means to be themselves. This is really good and genuinely compelling and it does loads to keep Fire Emblem from just being a camp joke... if only Fire Emblem weren't always goosing the other men and touching their butts in what's clearly discomforting. Like, Levin also thirsted for D-Boy, but they kept their hands to themselves.       I'm actually really sweet on Fire Emblem for this type of extremely extra character. Anime doesn't have a good track record of portraying openly queer characters; they're often extremely one note, and while there are elements of Fire Emblem that still aid into negative stereotypes like occasionally making predatory statements or bad touching, there's also a lot of sincerity around the character as well. Fire Emblem regularly proves to be mature, competent, and an emotionally supportive character to others. The other characters never shun Nathan for who they are or who they love, and overall I'm glad that the series' writing does seem to take their character seriously even if it's not perfect.      Nathan's pros definitely outweigh his cons and I don't want to give the impression that I think they're an outright bad character; the phrase ""problematic"" was made for moments like these. They're a great hero, a trusted friend, and honestly the only ding on their journey of acceptance is the fact that they kept goosing the other guys. Nathan is a person of color and that's always a delight to see in anime. Also, I'm using they/them pronouns for Nathan because it's my understanding the new Tiger & Bunny anime is also doing so in the dub.   And once Fire Emblem comes back they lend one heck of an assist to Blue Rose and Dragon Kid... Also, Fire Emblem is sponsored by Domino's. That just amuses me.      Kotetsu also manages to get the go-ahead to jump back in the game while the 2nd League Heroes were helping Fire Emblem recover. It's a good moment for them considering they got canned for not making any company money earlier.    I also loved Rock Bison's little moment of SEND ME FLYING and throwing up the horns after. He was sitting in dead last point-wise and was even desperate enough to start copying other people's bits in order to make himself more likeable to poor results due to how obvious the imitation was.     The Fastball Special is a time-honored tradition in superheroism; I salute Rock Bison in return. It's only a matter of time before the MCU makes it utterly obnoxious.   It also goes into some other themes about imitation, like Kotetsu's daughter trying to figure out how to write a good poem for her assignment but running into a wall when she keeps trying to imitate. Kotetsu surprisingly offers some worldly advice, which gets thrown right back at him.    Everyone keeps trying to live up to what they think they should be doing and not necessarily what they can with their abilities or being true to their feelings.   It turns out that none of the disasters have any kind of divine origin: it's all revenge, baby! A man named Virgil is responsible for organizing the NEXTs that kicked the whole thing off. Using Sternbild's mythology against them, Virgil's goal is revenge against Schneider. Years ago, Schneider took advantage of Virgil's father in a business deal, which led to Virgil's father taking his own life. Virgil teamed up with three other NEXTs whose lives had been ruined by Schneider's wheeling-and-dealing in order to take out their revenge.         Which ties into some stuff in the series. Longtime villain and villain-killer Lunatic shows up to help Virgil to enact his own sense of justice and stand as Kotetsu's ideological opposite while Barnaby stands against Virgil as his mirror and opposite. Both of them state that it's important to be able to center yourself in the present, move on, and not be stuck in the past.      I can't be the only one who thinks Lunatic resembles a weird cross between Purple Haze and King Crimson. Anyway, Virgil becomes a giant robot crab made out of junk metal and fights off Wild Tiger and Barnaby in an attempt at carrying out his own revenge, claiming justification because Barnaby also took his revenge on the man that killed his parents.     Using Kotetsu's only one minute of power they unleash a big show-stopping team-up climax! Sweet.      The fantastic showing reinvigorates the public's desire for the old Wild Tiger/Barnaby team-up too, and even Golden Ryan helps spur them back into teaming up again.     With a nice poem from Kotetsu's daughter, the movie closes with the heroes continuing their duty of protecting Sternbild. It's a really solid ending for a solid pair of movies.     I thought these were both good as a re-introduction but also an epilogue for the series. It doesn't cover everything but it deals with a lot of elements that make Tiger & Bunny stand out.   As a Tiger & Bunny neophyte, I think these movies also serve really well as an introduction to the series. You get just enough of a taste of the other heroes to want to see more, the dynamic between Kotetsu and Barnaby is well-established, and the general feel of Sternbild is introduced. It's a unique world with interesting heroes, and I'm glad it's priming to make a big comeback to the world of anime. I hope Tiger & Bunny reaches a much bigger crowd this time around.   Yeah, I actually missed the initial boat for this one 10 years ago and had to binge the first season shortly before this because I kept putting it off until the second season was just around the corner. But I don't regret a minute of it. I definitely regret the fact that this couldn't be a bigger hit when it came out for a myriad of complicated reasons. That doesn't mean it's too late. Just because it's over a decade now doesn't mean it still can't have its day in the sun!   Nothing would be truer to this fail-dad than being late to his own successful franchise, I tell you what!     Anyways, this is Nicky & Jean-Karlo, over and out!

Jean-Karlo  This week's This Week in Anime was brought to you by Crab! It all comes crawling back to Crab™!     Crab and very region-specific Pepsi sounds like an interesting flavor combo, NGL. But still not as interesting of a combo as the hero duo Tiger & Bunny!     The original Tiger & Bunny anime came out a bit before the massive influx of superheroes became the mono-culture in the U.S. And weirdly enough, it's taken this long for the series to come back with a new season. Netflix is also streaming two movies for the Tiger & Bunny series, The Beginning and The Rising.   These two films came out in 2012 and 2014 respectively but have just now been re-released for streaming on Netflix in honor of that hot new second season. The Beginning is half re-cap of the early part of the series and serves as a great re-introduction for our Super Hero Buddy Cops, while The Rising takes place after the series proper with entirely new material.     Now, I love me some Japanese superheroes, especially the old blood. Yatterman, Gatchaman, Kamen Rider, Casshern, Ultraman, that stuff. And I was always interested in how Japan would handle a take on more Americanized superheroes. Tiger & Bunny has been beloved by fans since its premiere, and not just because of the wave of heroes the Mouse of House churns out on a daily basis. It's a fascinating show, all the way down to the folks wearing those fancy sponsored CG costumes.   Tiger & Bunny is conceptually rich because it fully breaks down the idea of commercialized heroing as an industry, including real company sponsors (which leads to some funny dissonance). The heroes of Sternbild receive live TV coverage and toe the line between being enforcers, performers, and public motivators, along with everything else that life throws at them, on and off the cameras. The focus on the corporate inner workings is part of what makes it feel more mature. It's not just some kids' fantasy of saving people, but a more detailed look at what would happen if someone really tried to make this their job.   Normally, all the heroes compete for points with each other. But when veteran Wild Tiger, real name Kotetsu Kaburagi, moves to a new company after his previous one folds, he's paired with the young and ambitious Barnaby Brooks Jr., to which he affectionally nicknames Bunny, much to his new partner's annoyance.      What makes Tiger & Bunny work – unlike a lot of ""these heroes are realistic!"" joints like The Boys – is that it's not relentlessly dour. The characters aren't irredeemable louts or psychopaths, they're just people trying to make an honest living while living under the whims of an unfeeling, uncaring management system. These people live or die by their sponsors. It's more Mystery Men than anything else, and that's a damn original place to start from when you're making a superhero movie.   It also leans heavily into the showbiz stuff more than any other cape thing I had watched before, but if anything its core is its ensemble cast of heroes and trying to build the companionship between the two main characters. Like many stories about manly bonds, the two of them start out pretty prickly at first, but both have also suffered severe losses of love in their lives. Kotetsu has a 10-year-old daughter he keeps his work secret from, and has previously lost his wife. Barnaby lost his family to a tragic (extremely plot related) incident that left him traumatized. Just knowing this, you can see how much they could benefit from having someone else to call family in their life. Y'know, assuming you could get one of them to open up.     Kotetsu is a really compelling character, and not just because he's a handsome fail-dad with a stylish outfit. He just needs some loving heart to make him better, or worse, that's a fantasy, too. He's goofy and his sense of heroism really doesn't jive with the mercenary world he's in, but rather than feeling like an idiot he just feels quaint. He's not wrong to want to help people, he's just shouldering more weight than he can carry because he just cares about people that much.     He's definitely meant to appeal to an older audience, a rarity for anime, and he's the the heart of the show despite being a lame guy who struggles to keep up with the younger competition. He constantly lets people down, including his own daughter, but you can tell he really values people's feelings just as much as being a hero.     As if to underline it all: his is the only ""conventional"" superhero outfit among all the other heroes. Everyone else has a fancy suit of armor, but Wild Tiger insists on a cape, a themed cowl, and a strongman suit. Even when he gets his updated power suit, he still wears his old one underneath. You can see him wearing the mask inside his helmet.   Barnaby however is the complete opposite, all suped up in the latest tech and uses his real name and face. He instantly saves Kotetsu's sorry ass and is eager to climb up the ladder. They also both happen to share the same type of power, including the fact that both of them have a time limit to use it.      Where Kotetsu wants to be a hero out of a genuine-to-a-fault desire to help people, Barnaby is wholly self-interested... or so he tells himself. He's convinced that putting his identity out there and acting as a hero can get him the funds and recognition he needs to track down the Oroboros group, the crime ring involved with the  murder of his parents. He may not want to care about other people, but he still cares nevertheless. Not that he'd ever admit it to such an embarrassing dad like Kotetsu.   Also, in a twist of fate, Barnaby Brooks Jr is Kotetsu's daughter's favorite superhero. Not even Wild Tiger. Eesh.      Kotetsu's old school ways doesn't make him popular, even with his own daughter. He was inspired by the King of Old Timers, Mr. Legend, so it makes sense that he clings to those ideals. Many people with super powers in this world – referred to as NEXT – don't always fit in when their powers are fresh and new, and even so, not everyone is fit to be a hero.      This is explored a bit more in The Rising, but a lot of NEXTs have powers that just skirt the line of being useful. Stuff like producing a toxin that just makes you really itchy. Or making your hand grow really, really big. Or, like... being really good at swimming. Kotetsu himself rides that line, partially because of his shtick, partially because his power on its own isn't the best (he can make himself one-hundred times stronger for a short period of time), and partially because he tends to leap before he looks. Like My Hero Academia and its many characters that have wholly-pedestrian Quirks, a lot of heroes in Tiger & Bunny just aren't meant for the big leagues.   When the series begins, Kotetsu is at least doing well enough to stand alongside the biggest heroes in the city: the immovable Rock Bison, the scaredy-cat ninja Origami Cyclone, the thunder-wielding Dragon Kid, the literally-flaming Fire Emblem, the King of Heroes Sky High, and the ice-wielding idol Blue Rose.       And even in The Beginning we really see how Kotetsu helps bring these people together. At first they don't really have much comradery with each other, they might even get in each other's way, something the villain of the first movie actively uses against all of them. But by the time The Rising happens you can really feel how they've grown close.   As always, the villain is capitalism. Because all of the heroes are part of Hero TV, a superhero reality tv show, they're all rated on their actions. You earn points for saving citizens and preventing disasters, but lose points if you fail to capture criminals or if they give you the slip. Getting points is important because you cannot become a hero without a sponsor, and doing well means your sponsor is happy. Happy sponsors, happy network, happy hero. Thus, it's against their best interests to help each other out: each hero scrambles for as many points as they can get.    This is also part of why Kotetsu is such a bomb in the ratings: much to his producer's chagrin, he values people's lives over ratings or network shares, so instead of waiting for a commercial break to let the audience get excited he goes and just tries to save people anyway.      Other than the recap portion of the movie, the plot of The Beginning is that someone nabs the city's very important golden statue of justice and nobody can catch the crook. All the heroes run around, get bamboozled by his power to swap places, and it's really just a fun excuse to allow the cast run around and interact. Anime movies often feel bad for being superfluous, but since Tiger & Bunny the series has quite a few episodes dedicated to just building up the characters, it doesn't really feel out of place for the franchise.     It helps that the other heroes aren't terribly complicated and nevertheless get plenty of scenes to themselves. When the team is called out to arrest thief Robin Baxter, they all go their separate ways... together. Dragon Kid and Blue Rose talk about earrings. Fire Emblem... flirts with Rock Bison. Sky High shows off his wind-control powers to Origami Cyclone, showing an uncharacteristically fun-loving side of himself. It's good stuff that does a good job of letting the cast start to see themselves as more than just competitors.       They each get their moments, whether it's Sky High being a little ""up in the clouds"" even though he's currently the top-rated hero, Rock Bison and Kotetsu being Old Guys together as pals at the bottom of the rankings, or Blue Rose's hilariously cheesy mandated catchphrase.   I also wanna point out that I love the character designs in Tiger & Bunny. It's not just Kotetsu's fancy outfits or Barnaby's flowing locks – everyone in this series looks amazing. Masakazu Katsura was brought onboard to handle character designs; he worked on the superhero-flavored Zetman but he's also known for the romantic comedies D.N.A.², Video Girl Ai, and I''s.

It's a good moment for them considering they got canned for not making any company money earlier.    I also loved Rock Bison's little moment of SEND ME FLYING and throwing up the horns after. He was sitting in dead last point-wise and was even desperate enough to start copying other people's bits in order to make himself more likeable to poor results due to how obvious the imitation was.     The Fastball Special is a time-honored tradition in superheroism; I salute Rock Bison in return. It's only a matter of time before the MCU makes it utterly obnoxious.   It also goes into some other themes about imitation, like Kotetsu's daughter trying to figure out how to write a good poem for her assignment but running into a wall when she keeps trying to imitate. Kotetsu surprisingly offers some worldly advice, which gets thrown right back at him.    Everyone keeps trying to live up to what they think they should be doing and not necessarily what they can with their abilities or being true to their feelings.   It turns out that none of the disasters have any kind of divine origin: it's all revenge, baby! A man named Virgil is responsible for organizing the NEXTs that kicked the whole thing off. Using Sternbild's mythology against them, Virgil's goal is revenge against Schneider. Years ago, Schneider took advantage of Virgil's father in a business deal, which led to Virgil's father taking his own life. Virgil teamed up with three other NEXTs whose lives had been ruined by Schneider's wheeling-and-dealing in order to take out their revenge.         Which ties into some stuff in the series. Longtime villain and villain-killer Lunatic shows up to help Virgil to enact his own sense of justice and stand as Kotetsu's ideological opposite while Barnaby stands against Virgil as his mirror and opposite. Both of them state that it's important to be able to center yourself in the present, move on, and not be stuck in the past.      I can't be the only one who thinks Lunatic resembles a weird cross between Purple Haze and King Crimson. Anyway, Virgil becomes a giant robot crab made out of junk metal and fights off Wild Tiger and Barnaby in an attempt at carrying out his own revenge, claiming justification because Barnaby also took his revenge on the man that killed his parents.     Using Kotetsu's only one minute of power they unleash a big show-stopping team-up climax! Sweet.      The fantastic showing reinvigorates the public's desire for the old Wild Tiger/Barnaby team-up too, and even Golden Ryan helps spur them back into teaming up again.     With a nice poem from Kotetsu's daughter, the movie closes with the heroes continuing their duty of protecting Sternbild. It's a really solid ending for a solid pair of movies.     I thought these were both good as a re-introduction but also an epilogue for the series. It doesn't cover everything but it deals with a lot of elements that make Tiger & Bunny stand out.   As a Tiger & Bunny neophyte, I think these movies also serve really well as an introduction to the series. You get just enough of a taste of the other heroes to want to see more, the dynamic between Kotetsu and Barnaby is well-established, and the general feel of Sternbild is introduced. It's a unique world with interesting heroes, and I'm glad it's priming to make a big comeback to the world of anime. I hope Tiger & Bunny reaches a much bigger crowd this time around.   Yeah, I actually missed the initial boat for this one 10 years ago and had to binge the first season shortly before this because I kept putting it off until the second season was just around the corner. But I don't regret a minute of it. I definitely regret the fact that this couldn't be a bigger hit when it came out for a myriad of complicated reasons. That doesn't mean it's too late. Just because it's over a decade now doesn't mean it still can't have its day in the sun!

Jean-Karlo  This week's This Week in Anime was brought to you by Crab! It all comes crawling back to Crab™!     Crab and very region-specific Pepsi sounds like an interesting flavor combo, NGL. But still not as interesting of a combo as the hero duo Tiger & Bunny!     The original Tiger & Bunny anime came out a bit before the massive influx of superheroes became the mono-culture in the U.S. And weirdly enough, it's taken this long for the series to come back with a new season. Netflix is also streaming two movies for the Tiger & Bunny series, The Beginning and The Rising.   These two films came out in 2012 and 2014 respectively but have just now been re-released for streaming on Netflix in honor of that hot new second season. The Beginning is half re-cap of the early part of the series and serves as a great re-introduction for our Super Hero Buddy Cops, while The Rising takes place after the series proper with entirely new material.     Now, I love me some Japanese superheroes, especially the old blood. Yatterman, Gatchaman, Kamen Rider, Casshern, Ultraman, that stuff. And I was always interested in how Japan would handle a take on more Americanized superheroes. Tiger & Bunny has been beloved by fans since its premiere, and not just because of the wave of heroes the Mouse of House churns out on a daily basis. It's a fascinating show, all the way down to the folks wearing those fancy sponsored CG costumes.   Tiger & Bunny is conceptually rich because it fully breaks down the idea of commercialized heroing as an industry, including real company sponsors (which leads to some funny dissonance). The heroes of Sternbild receive live TV coverage and toe the line between being enforcers, performers, and public motivators, along with everything else that life throws at them, on and off the cameras. The focus on the corporate inner workings is part of what makes it feel more mature. It's not just some kids' fantasy of saving people, but a more detailed look at what would happen if someone really tried to make this their job.   Normally, all the heroes compete for points with each other. But when veteran Wild Tiger, real name Kotetsu Kaburagi, moves to a new company after his previous one folds, he's paired with the young and ambitious Barnaby Brooks Jr., to which he affectionally nicknames Bunny, much to his new partner's annoyance.      What makes Tiger & Bunny work – unlike a lot of ""these heroes are realistic!"" joints like The Boys – is that it's not relentlessly dour. The characters aren't irredeemable louts or psychopaths, they're just people trying to make an honest living while living under the whims of an unfeeling, uncaring management system. These people live or die by their sponsors. It's more Mystery Men than anything else, and that's a damn original place to start from when you're making a superhero movie.   It also leans heavily into the showbiz stuff more than any other cape thing I had watched before, but if anything its core is its ensemble cast of heroes and trying to build the companionship between the two main characters. Like many stories about manly bonds, the two of them start out pretty prickly at first, but both have also suffered severe losses of love in their lives. Kotetsu has a 10-year-old daughter he keeps his work secret from, and has previously lost his wife. Barnaby lost his family to a tragic (extremely plot related) incident that left him traumatized. Just knowing this, you can see how much they could benefit from having someone else to call family in their life. Y'know, assuming you could get one of them to open up.     Kotetsu is a really compelling character, and not just because he's a handsome fail-dad with a stylish outfit. He just needs some loving heart to make him better, or worse, that's a fantasy, too. He's goofy and his sense of heroism really doesn't jive with the mercenary world he's in, but rather than feeling like an idiot he just feels quaint. He's not wrong to want to help people, he's just shouldering more weight than he can carry because he just cares about people that much.     He's definitely meant to appeal to an older audience, a rarity for anime, and he's the the heart of the show despite being a lame guy who struggles to keep up with the younger competition. He constantly lets people down, including his own daughter, but you can tell he really values people's feelings just as much as being a hero.     As if to underline it all: his is the only ""conventional"" superhero outfit among all the other heroes. Everyone else has a fancy suit of armor, but Wild Tiger insists on a cape, a themed cowl, and a strongman suit. Even when he gets his updated power suit, he still wears his old one underneath. You can see him wearing the mask inside his helmet.   Barnaby however is the complete opposite, all suped up in the latest tech and uses his real name and face. He instantly saves Kotetsu's sorry ass and is eager to climb up the ladder. They also both happen to share the same type of power, including the fact that both of them have a time limit to use it.      Where Kotetsu wants to be a hero out of a genuine-to-a-fault desire to help people, Barnaby is wholly self-interested... or so he tells himself. He's convinced that putting his identity out there and acting as a hero can get him the funds and recognition he needs to track down the Oroboros group, the crime ring involved with the  murder of his parents. He may not want to care about other people, but he still cares nevertheless. Not that he'd ever admit it to such an embarrassing dad like Kotetsu.   Also, in a twist of fate, Barnaby Brooks Jr is Kotetsu's daughter's favorite superhero. Not even Wild Tiger. Eesh.      Kotetsu's old school ways doesn't make him popular, even with his own daughter. He was inspired by the King of Old Timers, Mr. Legend, so it makes sense that he clings to those ideals. Many people with super powers in this world – referred to as NEXT – don't always fit in when their powers are fresh and new, and even so, not everyone is fit to be a hero.      This is explored a bit more in The Rising, but a lot of NEXTs have powers that just skirt the line of being useful. Stuff like producing a toxin that just makes you really itchy. Or making your hand grow really, really big. Or, like... being really good at swimming. Kotetsu himself rides that line, partially because of his shtick, partially because his power on its own isn't the best (he can make himself one-hundred times stronger for a short period of time), and partially because he tends to leap before he looks. Like My Hero Academia and its many characters that have wholly-pedestrian Quirks, a lot of heroes in Tiger & Bunny just aren't meant for the big leagues.   When the series begins, Kotetsu is at least doing well enough to stand alongside the biggest heroes in the city: the immovable Rock Bison, the scaredy-cat ninja Origami Cyclone, the thunder-wielding Dragon Kid, the literally-flaming Fire Emblem, the King of Heroes Sky High, and the ice-wielding idol Blue Rose.       And even in The Beginning we really see how Kotetsu helps bring these people together. At first they don't really have much comradery with each other, they might even get in each other's way, something the villain of the first movie actively uses against all of them. But by the time The Rising happens you can really feel how they've grown close.   As always, the villain is capitalism. Because all of the heroes are part of Hero TV, a superhero reality tv show, they're all rated on their actions. You earn points for saving citizens and preventing disasters, but lose points if you fail to capture criminals or if they give you the slip. Getting points is important because you cannot become a hero without a sponsor, and doing well means your sponsor is happy. Happy sponsors, happy network, happy hero. Thus, it's against their best interests to help each other out: each hero scrambles for as many points as they can get.    This is also part of why Kotetsu is such a bomb in the ratings: much to his producer's chagrin, he values people's lives over ratings or network shares, so instead of waiting for a commercial break to let the audience get excited he goes and just tries to save people anyway.      Other than the recap portion of the movie, the plot of The Beginning is that someone nabs the city's very important golden statue of justice and nobody can catch the crook. All the heroes run around, get bamboozled by his power to swap places, and it's really just a fun excuse to allow the cast run around and interact. Anime movies often feel bad for being superfluous, but since Tiger & Bunny the series has quite a few episodes dedicated to just building up the characters, it doesn't really feel out of place for the franchise.     It helps that the other heroes aren't terribly complicated and nevertheless get plenty of scenes to themselves. When the team is called out to arrest thief Robin Baxter, they all go their separate ways... together. Dragon Kid and Blue Rose talk about earrings. Fire Emblem... flirts with Rock Bison. Sky High shows off his wind-control powers to Origami Cyclone, showing an uncharacteristically fun-loving side of himself. It's good stuff that does a good job of letting the cast start to see themselves as more than just competitors.       They each get their moments, whether it's Sky High being a little ""up in the clouds"" even though he's currently the top-rated hero, Rock Bison and Kotetsu being Old Guys together as pals at the bottom of the rankings, or Blue Rose's hilariously cheesy mandated catchphrase.   I also wanna point out that I love the character designs in Tiger & Bunny. It's not just Kotetsu's fancy outfits or Barnaby's flowing locks – everyone in this series looks amazing. Masakazu Katsura was brought onboard to handle character designs; he worked on the superhero-flavored Zetman but he's also known for the romantic comedies D.N.A.², Video Girl Ai, and I''s. His charming character designs are fantastic.   ... Also, he did a manga called Wingman about a toku-themed superhero and I'm dying to see that get brought back someday.    They're also more semi-realistic than most anime even ten years ago and it works better since most of the characters are older. The downside is that it makes them harder to animate too, so expect them to look off-model in places. But I think overall the movies look good even compared to today's standards, including the heavy use of CG for the suits and the action.     As it turns out, the CG is on purpose: because many of the costumes would otherwise have to be redrawn if sponsors for the heroes changed (or if the sponsorship brands had to be removed for foreign markets), it's just easier to render them as CG models. The only one who gets traditional animation is Blue Rose, partly because it's hard to shove a logo on her skimpy outfit, partly because she's T&B's source of T&A.     Which becomes upsetting when you remember she's supposed to be in high school still, for some reason. Why are there no adult female superheroes?!   Nobody said idol culture was healthy... A detail the movies leave out from the series is that Blue Rose might have romantic inclinations towards Kotetsu, who's like... twice her age. Thank goodness. Also, because let's be honest, Kotetsu and Barnaby all the way. A family can be a little girl and her two bickering superhero dads.     That's touched on in the series but I prefer to see it as a ""hero crush"" rather than just being hot for a single dad since she obviously takes Kotetsu's ideals to heart after a point. But it's not strong enough to get in the way of Kotetsu and Barnaby's intense married couple energy. The series very much leans in on the ""partner"" thing in more than just a joke or tongue-in-cheek way; they really are each other's emotional support. Which is why in The Rising the whole plot is just about them breaking up and trying to get back together. It's classic.     I wanna touch on one more thing from The Beginning before we get into The Rising: it ends with a really big show of trust for Barnaby from Kotetsu. Barnaby manages to trick Robin Baxter into imprisoning himself, but later finds that Kotetsu specifically went out of his way not only to let the other heroes allow Barnaby to do this alone, but also made sure to hang in the background to make sure Barnaby's plan went off. As much as Kotetsu chafes at Barnaby's antics, he still wants him to feel like a member of a team.      Oh yeah, it's a great moment of just the way Kotetsu quietly supports people even if they didn't ask for it or he doesn't always know how to show it, and the plan wouldn't have worked if Kotetsu never stuck his neck out to the others the way he did.    I'll also take a moment to shoutout to the dub. I found both language tracks to be pretty good, but Tiger & Bunny has a lot of what I miss in anime dubs. The script is adapted really well and fits the more natural and Americanized feel of the show and the more diverse cast.   Being that I'm more of a fan of older Japanese heroes, I do regret the more-Americanized takes on the recent Japanese superheroes. But this does mean that a lot of life is breathed into them in English dubs.   Anyway, Kotetsu starts The Rising out with his breath beaten out of him. Wild Tiger and Barnaby have sunk in the ratings in the time since The Beginning (it's been a few months and later events from the Tiger & Bunny series have transpired). They're knocked down to the ""Second League"", where a bunch of not-so-great superheroes dwell.      Kotetsu had gotten up in age to the point where he can't use his powers very long and is trying to take a slower pace to accommodate but fears that by doing so he's now drawing down his partner.   The good news is, a mogul named Mark Schneider bought out their old sponsor and pulls the strings needed to get Barnaby back up to the First League, teaming him up with a new hero named Golden Ryan. The bad news is, Schneider had no intention of doing anything for Kotetsu: without a sponsor, he's forced to retire from heroism and take up a job as a cab driver.     Golden Ryan (A pun on ""Golden Lion"" to Kotetsu's Tiger), is also a bit of a huge douchebag.     You think the guys at Banpresto had a laugh about their logo being emblazoned on such a tool of a hero? I can't see him making any Super Robot Wars cameos anytime soon...   At any rate, a series of disasters strikes the city. Barnaby puts the clues together and deduces that the disasters are connected to an old legend from the city's history: a goddess, angered by mankind's greed, sends earthquakes, sleeping sickness and a massive chasm to devour the city. The problem is just trying to convince the higher-ups to let the heroes investigate this.    Also compounding issues is Golden Ryan being concerned with just earning points for just him and Barnaby, instead of collaborating with other heroes--a selfishness helped along with Ryan's gravity-powers.      Barnaby may have been eager in the past, but he sticks to his ideals plenty compared to Ryan, whose dubious methods actively gets in the way of the other heroes, cause collateral damage, and puts citizens in danger just to get racked up on a point sheet.   It's here... that we can finally touch on Fire Emblem, because they're an important part of The Rising's story.   So... Fire Emblem is self-described as a gay superhero (and he's got fire powers, get it?). Being that they own their own company, they're their own sponsor. But like... Fire Emblem feels like a really bad take on a gay person, more akin to The Crying Game and that era of not differentiating gay men from trans-women or the like.    In a lot of ways, Fire Emblem reminds me of Levin from Tekkaman Blade (I'm going somewhere with this, bear with me). Levin was also swishy, flaming, and very flirty with the protagonist--and there's a very touching episode where Levin talks to a woman about living their truth. There's only one Levin in the world, and they live true to themselves, and Levin contains multitudes that just can't be described by simple binary concepts like ""man"" or ""woman."" And in a lot of ways, that's what Fire Emblem is going for: we see in their past that Nathan (Fire Emblem's real name) struggled with their attraction to men or presenting as a woman. Their big climactic moment while stuck in a nightmare of their own worst fears is having a Persona 4 moment and embracing their shadow, celebrating what it means to be themselves. This is really good and genuinely compelling and it does loads to keep Fire Emblem from just being a camp joke... if only Fire Emblem weren't always goosing the other men and touching their butts in what's clearly discomforting. Like, Levin also thirsted for D-Boy, but they kept their hands to themselves.       I'm actually really sweet on Fire Emblem for this type of extremely extra character. Anime doesn't have a good track record of portraying openly queer characters; they're often extremely one note, and while there are elements of Fire Emblem that still aid into negative stereotypes like occasionally making predatory statements or bad touching, there's also a lot of sincerity around the character as well. Fire Emblem regularly proves to be mature, competent, and an emotionally supportive character to others. The other characters never shun Nathan for who they are or who they love, and overall I'm glad that the series' writing does seem to take their character seriously even if it's not perfect.      Nathan's pros definitely outweigh his cons and I don't want to give the impression that I think they're an outright bad character; the phrase ""problematic"" was made for moments like these. They're a great hero, a trusted friend, and honestly the only ding on their journey of acceptance is the fact that they kept goosing the other guys. Nathan is a person of color and that's always a delight to see in anime. Also, I'm using they/them pronouns for Nathan because it's my understanding the new Tiger & Bunny anime is also doing so in the dub.   And once Fire Emblem comes back they lend one heck of an assist to Blue Rose and Dragon Kid... Also, Fire Emblem is sponsored by Domino's. That just amuses me.      Kotetsu also manages to get the go-ahead to jump back in the game while the 2nd League Heroes were helping Fire Emblem recover. It's a good moment for them considering they got canned for not making any company money earlier.    I also loved Rock Bison's little moment of SEND ME FLYING and throwing up the horns after. He was sitting in dead last point-wise and was even desperate enough to start copying other people's bits in order to make himself more likeable to poor results due to how obvious the imitation was.

The characters aren't irredeemable louts or psychopaths, they're just people trying to make an honest living while living under the whims of an unfeeling, uncaring management system. These people live or die by their sponsors. It's more Mystery Men than anything else, and that's a damn original place to start from when you're making a superhero movie.   It also leans heavily into the showbiz stuff more than any other cape thing I had watched before, but if anything its core is its ensemble cast of heroes and trying to build the companionship between the two main characters. Like many stories about manly bonds, the two of them start out pretty prickly at first, but both have also suffered severe losses of love in their lives. Kotetsu has a 10-year-old daughter he keeps his work secret from, and has previously lost his wife. Barnaby lost his family to a tragic (extremely plot related) incident that left him traumatized. Just knowing this, you can see how much they could benefit from having someone else to call family in their life. Y'know, assuming you could get one of them to open up.     Kotetsu is a really compelling character, and not just because he's a handsome fail-dad with a stylish outfit. He just needs some loving heart to make him better, or worse, that's a fantasy, too. He's goofy and his sense of heroism really doesn't jive with the mercenary world he's in, but rather than feeling like an idiot he just feels quaint. He's not wrong to want to help people, he's just shouldering more weight than he can carry because he just cares about people that much.     He's definitely meant to appeal to an older audience, a rarity for anime, and he's the the heart of the show despite being a lame guy who struggles to keep up with the younger competition. He constantly lets people down, including his own daughter, but you can tell he really values people's feelings just as much as being a hero.     As if to underline it all: his is the only ""conventional"" superhero outfit among all the other heroes. Everyone else has a fancy suit of armor, but Wild Tiger insists on a cape, a themed cowl, and a strongman suit. Even when he gets his updated power suit, he still wears his old one underneath. You can see him wearing the mask inside his helmet.   Barnaby however is the complete opposite, all suped up in the latest tech and uses his real name and face. He instantly saves Kotetsu's sorry ass and is eager to climb up the ladder. They also both happen to share the same type of power, including the fact that both of them have a time limit to use it.      Where Kotetsu wants to be a hero out of a genuine-to-a-fault desire to help people, Barnaby is wholly self-interested... or so he tells himself. He's convinced that putting his identity out there and acting as a hero can get him the funds and recognition he needs to track down the Oroboros group, the crime ring involved with the  murder of his parents. He may not want to care about other people, but he still cares nevertheless. Not that he'd ever admit it to such an embarrassing dad like Kotetsu.   Also, in a twist of fate, Barnaby Brooks Jr is Kotetsu's daughter's favorite superhero. Not even Wild Tiger. Eesh.      Kotetsu's old school ways doesn't make him popular, even with his own daughter. He was inspired by the King of Old Timers, Mr. Legend, so it makes sense that he clings to those ideals. Many people with super powers in this world – referred to as NEXT – don't always fit in when their powers are fresh and new, and even so, not everyone is fit to be a hero.      This is explored a bit more in The Rising, but a lot of NEXTs have powers that just skirt the line of being useful. Stuff like producing a toxin that just makes you really itchy. Or making your hand grow really, really big. Or, like... being really good at swimming. Kotetsu himself rides that line, partially because of his shtick, partially because his power on its own isn't the best (he can make himself one-hundred times stronger for a short period of time), and partially because he tends to leap before he looks. Like My Hero Academia and its many characters that have wholly-pedestrian Quirks, a lot of heroes in Tiger & Bunny just aren't meant for the big leagues.   When the series begins, Kotetsu is at least doing well enough to stand alongside the biggest heroes in the city: the immovable Rock Bison, the scaredy-cat ninja Origami Cyclone, the thunder-wielding Dragon Kid, the literally-flaming Fire Emblem, the King of Heroes Sky High, and the ice-wielding idol Blue Rose.       And even in The Beginning we really see how Kotetsu helps bring these people together. At first they don't really have much comradery with each other, they might even get in each other's way, something the villain of the first movie actively uses against all of them. But by the time The Rising happens you can really feel how they've grown close.   As always, the villain is capitalism. Because all of the heroes are part of Hero TV, a superhero reality tv show, they're all rated on their actions. You earn points for saving citizens and preventing disasters, but lose points if you fail to capture criminals or if they give you the slip. Getting points is important because you cannot become a hero without a sponsor, and doing well means your sponsor is happy. Happy sponsors, happy network, happy hero. Thus, it's against their best interests to help each other out: each hero scrambles for as many points as they can get.    This is also part of why Kotetsu is such a bomb in the ratings: much to his producer's chagrin, he values people's lives over ratings or network shares, so instead of waiting for a commercial break to let the audience get excited he goes and just tries to save people anyway.      Other than the recap portion of the movie, the plot of The Beginning is that someone nabs the city's very important golden statue of justice and nobody can catch the crook. All the heroes run around, get bamboozled by his power to swap places, and it's really just a fun excuse to allow the cast run around and interact. Anime movies often feel bad for being superfluous, but since Tiger & Bunny the series has quite a few episodes dedicated to just building up the characters, it doesn't really feel out of place for the franchise.     It helps that the other heroes aren't terribly complicated and nevertheless get plenty of scenes to themselves. When the team is called out to arrest thief Robin Baxter, they all go their separate ways... together. Dragon Kid and Blue Rose talk about earrings. Fire Emblem... flirts with Rock Bison. Sky High shows off his wind-control powers to Origami Cyclone, showing an uncharacteristically fun-loving side of himself. It's good stuff that does a good job of letting the cast start to see themselves as more than just competitors.       They each get their moments, whether it's Sky High being a little ""up in the clouds"" even though he's currently the top-rated hero, Rock Bison and Kotetsu being Old Guys together as pals at the bottom of the rankings, or Blue Rose's hilariously cheesy mandated catchphrase.   I also wanna point out that I love the character designs in Tiger & Bunny. It's not just Kotetsu's fancy outfits or Barnaby's flowing locks – everyone in this series looks amazing. Masakazu Katsura was brought onboard to handle character designs; he worked on the superhero-flavored Zetman but he's also known for the romantic comedies D.N.A.², Video Girl Ai, and I''s. His charming character designs are fantastic.   ... Also, he did a manga called Wingman about a toku-themed superhero and I'm dying to see that get brought back someday.    They're also more semi-realistic than most anime even ten years ago and it works better since most of the characters are older. The downside is that it makes them harder to animate too, so expect them to look off-model in places. But I think overall the movies look good even compared to today's standards, including the heavy use of CG for the suits and the action.     As it turns out, the CG is on purpose: because many of the costumes would otherwise have to be redrawn if sponsors for the heroes changed (or if the sponsorship brands had to be removed for foreign markets), it's just easier to render them as CG models. The only one who gets traditional animation is Blue Rose, partly because it's hard to shove a logo on her skimpy outfit, partly because she's T&B's source of T&A.     Which becomes upsetting when you remember she's supposed to be in high school still, for some reason. Why are there no adult female superheroes?!   Nobody said idol culture was healthy... A detail the movies leave out from the series is that Blue Rose might have romantic inclinations towards Kotetsu, who's like... twice her age. Thank goodness. Also, because let's be honest, Kotetsu and Barnaby all the way. A family can be a little girl and her two bickering superhero dads.     That's touched on in the series but I prefer to see it as a ""hero crush"" rather than just being hot for a single dad since she obviously takes Kotetsu's ideals to heart after a point. But it's not strong enough to get in the way of Kotetsu and Barnaby's intense married couple energy. The series very much leans in on the ""partner"" thing in more than just a joke or tongue-in-cheek way; they really are each other's emotional support. Which is why in The Rising the whole plot is just about them breaking up and trying to get back together. It's classic.     I wanna touch on one more thing from The Beginning before we get into The Rising: it ends with a really big show of trust for Barnaby from Kotetsu. Barnaby manages to trick Robin Baxter into imprisoning himself, but later finds that Kotetsu specifically went out of his way not only to let the other heroes allow Barnaby to do this alone, but also made sure to hang in the background to make sure Barnaby's plan went off. As much as Kotetsu chafes at Barnaby's antics, he still wants him to feel like a member of a team.      Oh yeah, it's a great moment of just the way Kotetsu quietly supports people even if they didn't ask for it or he doesn't always know how to show it, and the plan wouldn't have worked if Kotetsu never stuck his neck out to the others the way he did.    I'll also take a moment to shoutout to the dub. I found both language tracks to be pretty good, but Tiger & Bunny has a lot of what I miss in anime dubs. The script is adapted really well and fits the more natural and Americanized feel of the show and the more diverse cast.   Being that I'm more of a fan of older Japanese heroes, I do regret the more-Americanized takes on the recent Japanese superheroes. But this does mean that a lot of life is breathed into them in English dubs.   Anyway, Kotetsu starts The Rising out with his breath beaten out of him. Wild Tiger and Barnaby have sunk in the ratings in the time since The Beginning (it's been a few months and later events from the Tiger & Bunny series have transpired). They're knocked down to the ""Second League"", where a bunch of not-so-great superheroes dwell.      Kotetsu had gotten up in age to the point where he can't use his powers very long and is trying to take a slower pace to accommodate but fears that by doing so he's now drawing down his partner.   The good news is, a mogul named Mark Schneider bought out their old sponsor and pulls the strings needed to get Barnaby back up to the First League, teaming him up with a new hero named Golden Ryan. The bad news is, Schneider had no intention of doing anything for Kotetsu: without a sponsor, he's forced to retire from heroism and take up a job as a cab driver.     Golden Ryan (A pun on ""Golden Lion"" to Kotetsu's Tiger), is also a bit of a huge douchebag.     You think the guys at Banpresto had a laugh about their logo being emblazoned on such a tool of a hero? I can't see him making any Super Robot Wars cameos anytime soon...   At any rate, a series of disasters strikes the city. Barnaby puts the clues together and deduces that the disasters are connected to an old legend from the city's history: a goddess, angered by mankind's greed, sends earthquakes, sleeping sickness and a massive chasm to devour the city. The problem is just trying to convince the higher-ups to let the heroes investigate this.    Also compounding issues is Golden Ryan being concerned with just earning points for just him and Barnaby, instead of collaborating with other heroes--a selfishness helped along with Ryan's gravity-powers.      Barnaby may have been eager in the past, but he sticks to his ideals plenty compared to Ryan, whose dubious methods actively gets in the way of the other heroes, cause collateral damage, and puts citizens in danger just to get racked up on a point sheet.   It's here... that we can finally touch on Fire Emblem, because they're an important part of The Rising's story.   So... Fire Emblem is self-described as a gay superhero (and he's got fire powers, get it?). Being that they own their own company, they're their own sponsor. But like... Fire Emblem feels like a really bad take on a gay person, more akin to The Crying Game and that era of not differentiating gay men from trans-women or the like.    In a lot of ways, Fire Emblem reminds me of Levin from Tekkaman Blade (I'm going somewhere with this, bear with me). Levin was also swishy, flaming, and very flirty with the protagonist--and there's a very touching episode where Levin talks to a woman about living their truth. There's only one Levin in the world, and they live true to themselves, and Levin contains multitudes that just can't be described by simple binary concepts like ""man"" or ""woman."" And in a lot of ways, that's what Fire Emblem is going for: we see in their past that Nathan (Fire Emblem's real name) struggled with their attraction to men or presenting as a woman. Their big climactic moment while stuck in a nightmare of their own worst fears is having a Persona 4 moment and embracing their shadow, celebrating what it means to be themselves. This is really good and genuinely compelling and it does loads to keep Fire Emblem from just being a camp joke... if only Fire Emblem weren't always goosing the other men and touching their butts in what's clearly discomforting. Like, Levin also thirsted for D-Boy, but they kept their hands to themselves.       I'm actually really sweet on Fire Emblem for this type of extremely extra character. Anime doesn't have a good track record of portraying openly queer characters; they're often extremely one note, and while there are elements of Fire Emblem that still aid into negative stereotypes like occasionally making predatory statements or bad touching, there's also a lot of sincerity around the character as well. Fire Emblem regularly proves to be mature, competent, and an emotionally supportive character to others. The other characters never shun Nathan for who they are or who they love, and overall I'm glad that the series' writing does seem to take their character seriously even if it's not perfect.      Nathan's pros definitely outweigh his cons and I don't want to give the impression that I think they're an outright bad character; the phrase ""problematic"" was made for moments like these. They're a great hero, a trusted friend, and honestly the only ding on their journey of acceptance is the fact that they kept goosing the other guys. Nathan is a person of color and that's always a delight to see in anime. Also, I'm using they/them pronouns for Nathan because it's my understanding the new Tiger & Bunny anime is also doing so in the dub.   And once Fire Emblem comes back they lend one heck of an assist to Blue Rose and Dragon Kid... Also, Fire Emblem is sponsored by Domino's. That just amuses me.      Kotetsu also manages to get the go-ahead to jump back in the game while the 2nd League Heroes were helping Fire Emblem recover. It's a good moment for them considering they got canned for not making any company money earlier.    I also loved Rock Bison's little moment of SEND ME FLYING and throwing up the horns after. He was sitting in dead last point-wise and was even desperate enough to start copying other people's bits in order to make himself more likeable to poor results due to how obvious the imitation was.     The Fastball Special is a time-honored tradition in superheroism; I salute Rock Bison in return. It's only a matter of time before the MCU makes it utterly obnoxious.   It also goes into some other themes about imitation, like Kotetsu's daughter trying to figure out how to write a good poem for her assignment but running into a wall when she keeps trying to imitate. Kotetsu surprisingly offers some worldly advice, which gets thrown right back at him.    Everyone keeps trying to live up to what they think they should be doing and not necessarily what they can with their abilities or being true to their feelings.   It turns out that none of the disasters have any kind of divine origin: it's all revenge, baby! A man named Virgil is responsible for organizing the NEXTs that kicked the whole thing off. Using Sternbild's mythology against them, Virgil's goal is revenge against Schneider. Years ago, Schneider took advantage of Virgil's father in a business deal, which led to Virgil's father taking his own life. Virgil teamed up with three other NEXTs whose lives had been ruined by Schneider's wheeling-and-dealing in order to take out their revenge.         Which ties into some stuff in the series. Longtime villain and villain-killer Lunatic shows up to help Virgil to enact his own sense of justice and stand as Kotetsu's ideological opposite while Barnaby stands against Virgil as his mirror and opposite. Both of them state that it's important to be able to center yourself in the present, move on, and not be stuck in the past.      I can't be the only one who thinks Lunatic resembles a weird cross between Purple Haze and King Crimson. Anyway, Virgil becomes a giant robot crab made out of junk metal and fights off Wild Tiger and Barnaby in an attempt at carrying out his own revenge, claiming justification because Barnaby also took his revenge on the man that killed his parents.     Using Kotetsu's only one minute of power they unleash a big show-stopping team-up climax! Sweet.      The fantastic showing reinvigorates the public's desire for the old Wild Tiger/Barnaby team-up too, and even Golden Ryan helps spur them back into teaming up again.     With a nice poem from Kotetsu's daughter, the movie closes with the heroes continuing their duty of protecting Sternbild. It's a really solid ending for a solid pair of movies.     I thought these were both good as a re-introduction but also an epilogue for the series. It doesn't cover everything but it deals with a lot of elements that make Tiger & Bunny stand out.   As a Tiger & Bunny neophyte, I think these movies also serve really well as an introduction to the series. You get just enough of a taste of the other heroes to want to see more, the dynamic between Kotetsu and Barnaby is well-established, and the general feel of Sternbild is introduced. It's a unique world with interesting heroes, and I'm glad it's priming to make a big comeback to the world of anime. I hope Tiger & Bunny reaches a much bigger crowd this time around.   Yeah, I actually missed the initial boat for this one 10 years ago and had to binge the first season shortly before this because I kept putting it off until the second season was just around the corner. But I don't regret a minute of it. I definitely regret the fact that this couldn't be a bigger hit when it came out for a myriad of complicated reasons. That doesn't mean it's too late. Just because it's over a decade now doesn't mean it still can't have its day in the sun!   Nothing would be truer to this fail-dad than being late to his own successful franchise, I tell you what!     Anyways, this is Nicky & Jean-Karlo, over and out!

Jean-Karlo  This week's This Week in Anime was brought to you by Crab! It all comes crawling back to Crab™!     Crab and very region-specific Pepsi sounds like an interesting flavor combo, NGL. But still not as interesting of a combo as the hero duo Tiger & Bunny!     The original Tiger & Bunny anime came out a bit before the massive influx of superheroes became the mono-culture in the U.S. And weirdly enough, it's taken this long for the series to come back with a new season. Netflix is also streaming two movies for the Tiger & Bunny series, The Beginning and The Rising.   These two films came out in 2012 and 2014 respectively but have just now been re-released for streaming on Netflix in honor of that hot new second season. The Beginning is half re-cap of the early part of the series and serves as a great re-introduction for our Super Hero Buddy Cops, while The Rising takes place after the series proper with entirely new material.     Now, I love me some Japanese superheroes, especially the old blood. Yatterman, Gatchaman, Kamen Rider, Casshern, Ultraman, that stuff. And I was always interested in how Japan would handle a take on more Americanized superheroes. Tiger & Bunny has been beloved by fans since its premiere, and not just because of the wave of heroes the Mouse of House churns out on a daily basis. It's a fascinating show, all the way down to the folks wearing those fancy sponsored CG costumes.   Tiger & Bunny is conceptually rich because it fully breaks down the idea of commercialized heroing as an industry, including real company sponsors (which leads to some funny dissonance). The heroes of Sternbild receive live TV coverage and toe the line between being enforcers, performers, and public motivators, along with everything else that life throws at them, on and off the cameras. The focus on the corporate inner workings is part of what makes it feel more mature. It's not just some kids' fantasy of saving people, but a more detailed look at what would happen if someone really tried to make this their job.   Normally, all the heroes compete for points with each other. But when veteran Wild Tiger, real name Kotetsu Kaburagi, moves to a new company after his previous one folds, he's paired with the young and ambitious Barnaby Brooks Jr., to which he affectionally nicknames Bunny, much to his new partner's annoyance.      What makes Tiger & Bunny work – unlike a lot of ""these heroes are realistic!"" joints like The Boys – is that it's not relentlessly dour. The characters aren't irredeemable louts or psychopaths, they're just people trying to make an honest living while living under the whims of an unfeeling, uncaring management system.

A detail the movies leave out from the series is that Blue Rose might have romantic inclinations towards Kotetsu, who's like... twice her age. Thank goodness. Also, because let's be honest, Kotetsu and Barnaby all the way. A family can be a little girl and her two bickering superhero dads.     That's touched on in the series but I prefer to see it as a ""hero crush"" rather than just being hot for a single dad since she obviously takes Kotetsu's ideals to heart after a point. But it's not strong enough to get in the way of Kotetsu and Barnaby's intense married couple energy. The series very much leans in on the ""partner"" thing in more than just a joke or tongue-in-cheek way; they really are each other's emotional support. Which is why in The Rising the whole plot is just about them breaking up and trying to get back together. It's classic.     I wanna touch on one more thing from The Beginning before we get into The Rising: it ends with a really big show of trust for Barnaby from Kotetsu. Barnaby manages to trick Robin Baxter into imprisoning himself, but later finds that Kotetsu specifically went out of his way not only to let the other heroes allow Barnaby to do this alone, but also made sure to hang in the background to make sure Barnaby's plan went off. As much as Kotetsu chafes at Barnaby's antics, he still wants him to feel like a member of a team.      Oh yeah, it's a great moment of just the way Kotetsu quietly supports people even if they didn't ask for it or he doesn't always know how to show it, and the plan wouldn't have worked if Kotetsu never stuck his neck out to the others the way he did.    I'll also take a moment to shoutout to the dub. I found both language tracks to be pretty good, but Tiger & Bunny has a lot of what I miss in anime dubs. The script is adapted really well and fits the more natural and Americanized feel of the show and the more diverse cast.   Being that I'm more of a fan of older Japanese heroes, I do regret the more-Americanized takes on the recent Japanese superheroes. But this does mean that a lot of life is breathed into them in English dubs.   Anyway, Kotetsu starts The Rising out with his breath beaten out of him. Wild Tiger and Barnaby have sunk in the ratings in the time since The Beginning (it's been a few months and later events from the Tiger & Bunny series have transpired). They're knocked down to the ""Second League"", where a bunch of not-so-great superheroes dwell.      Kotetsu had gotten up in age to the point where he can't use his powers very long and is trying to take a slower pace to accommodate but fears that by doing so he's now drawing down his partner.   The good news is, a mogul named Mark Schneider bought out their old sponsor and pulls the strings needed to get Barnaby back up to the First League, teaming him up with a new hero named Golden Ryan. The bad news is, Schneider had no intention of doing anything for Kotetsu: without a sponsor, he's forced to retire from heroism and take up a job as a cab driver.     Golden Ryan (A pun on ""Golden Lion"" to Kotetsu's Tiger), is also a bit of a huge douchebag.     You think the guys at Banpresto had a laugh about their logo being emblazoned on such a tool of a hero? I can't see him making any Super Robot Wars cameos anytime soon...   At any rate, a series of disasters strikes the city. Barnaby puts the clues together and deduces that the disasters are connected to an old legend from the city's history: a goddess, angered by mankind's greed, sends earthquakes, sleeping sickness and a massive chasm to devour the city. The problem is just trying to convince the higher-ups to let the heroes investigate this.    Also compounding issues is Golden Ryan being concerned with just earning points for just him and Barnaby, instead of collaborating with other heroes--a selfishness helped along with Ryan's gravity-powers.      Barnaby may have been eager in the past, but he sticks to his ideals plenty compared to Ryan, whose dubious methods actively gets in the way of the other heroes, cause collateral damage, and puts citizens in danger just to get racked up on a point sheet.   It's here... that we can finally touch on Fire Emblem, because they're an important part of The Rising's story.   So... Fire Emblem is self-described as a gay superhero (and he's got fire powers, get it?). Being that they own their own company, they're their own sponsor. But like... Fire Emblem feels like a really bad take on a gay person, more akin to The Crying Game and that era of not differentiating gay men from trans-women or the like.    In a lot of ways, Fire Emblem reminds me of Levin from Tekkaman Blade (I'm going somewhere with this, bear with me). Levin was also swishy, flaming, and very flirty with the protagonist--and there's a very touching episode where Levin talks to a woman about living their truth. There's only one Levin in the world, and they live true to themselves, and Levin contains multitudes that just can't be described by simple binary concepts like ""man"" or ""woman."" And in a lot of ways, that's what Fire Emblem is going for: we see in their past that Nathan (Fire Emblem's real name) struggled with their attraction to men or presenting as a woman. Their big climactic moment while stuck in a nightmare of their own worst fears is having a Persona 4 moment and embracing their shadow, celebrating what it means to be themselves. This is really good and genuinely compelling and it does loads to keep Fire Emblem from just being a camp joke... if only Fire Emblem weren't always goosing the other men and touching their butts in what's clearly discomforting. Like, Levin also thirsted for D-Boy, but they kept their hands to themselves.       I'm actually really sweet on Fire Emblem for this type of extremely extra character. Anime doesn't have a good track record of portraying openly queer characters; they're often extremely one note, and while there are elements of Fire Emblem that still aid into negative stereotypes like occasionally making predatory statements or bad touching, there's also a lot of sincerity around the character as well. Fire Emblem regularly proves to be mature, competent, and an emotionally supportive character to others. The other characters never shun Nathan for who they are or who they love, and overall I'm glad that the series' writing does seem to take their character seriously even if it's not perfect.      Nathan's pros definitely outweigh his cons and I don't want to give the impression that I think they're an outright bad character; the phrase ""problematic"" was made for moments like these. They're a great hero, a trusted friend, and honestly the only ding on their journey of acceptance is the fact that they kept goosing the other guys. Nathan is a person of color and that's always a delight to see in anime. Also, I'm using they/them pronouns for Nathan because it's my understanding the new Tiger & Bunny anime is also doing so in the dub.   And once Fire Emblem comes back they lend one heck of an assist to Blue Rose and Dragon Kid... Also, Fire Emblem is sponsored by Domino's. That just amuses me.      Kotetsu also manages to get the go-ahead to jump back in the game while the 2nd League Heroes were helping Fire Emblem recover. It's a good moment for them considering they got canned for not making any company money earlier.    I also loved Rock Bison's little moment of SEND ME FLYING and throwing up the horns after. He was sitting in dead last point-wise and was even desperate enough to start copying other people's bits in order to make himself more likeable to poor results due to how obvious the imitation was.     The Fastball Special is a time-honored tradition in superheroism; I salute Rock Bison in return. It's only a matter of time before the MCU makes it utterly obnoxious.   It also goes into some other themes about imitation, like Kotetsu's daughter trying to figure out how to write a good poem for her assignment but running into a wall when she keeps trying to imitate. Kotetsu surprisingly offers some worldly advice, which gets thrown right back at him.    Everyone keeps trying to live up to what they think they should be doing and not necessarily what they can with their abilities or being true to their feelings.   It turns out that none of the disasters have any kind of divine origin: it's all revenge, baby! A man named Virgil is responsible for organizing the NEXTs that kicked the whole thing off. Using Sternbild's mythology against them, Virgil's goal is revenge against Schneider. Years ago, Schneider took advantage of Virgil's father in a business deal, which led to Virgil's father taking his own life. Virgil teamed up with three other NEXTs whose lives had been ruined by Schneider's wheeling-and-dealing in order to take out their revenge.         Which ties into some stuff in the series. Longtime villain and villain-killer Lunatic shows up to help Virgil to enact his own sense of justice and stand as Kotetsu's ideological opposite while Barnaby stands against Virgil as his mirror and opposite. Both of them state that it's important to be able to center yourself in the present, move on, and not be stuck in the past.      I can't be the only one who thinks Lunatic resembles a weird cross between Purple Haze and King Crimson. Anyway, Virgil becomes a giant robot crab made out of junk metal and fights off Wild Tiger and Barnaby in an attempt at carrying out his own revenge, claiming justification because Barnaby also took his revenge on the man that killed his parents.     Using Kotetsu's only one minute of power they unleash a big show-stopping team-up climax! Sweet.      The fantastic showing reinvigorates the public's desire for the old Wild Tiger/Barnaby team-up too, and even Golden Ryan helps spur them back into teaming up again.     With a nice poem from Kotetsu's daughter, the movie closes with the heroes continuing their duty of protecting Sternbild. It's a really solid ending for a solid pair of movies.     I thought these were both good as a re-introduction but also an epilogue for the series. It doesn't cover everything but it deals with a lot of elements that make Tiger & Bunny stand out.   As a Tiger & Bunny neophyte, I think these movies also serve really well as an introduction to the series. You get just enough of a taste of the other heroes to want to see more, the dynamic between Kotetsu and Barnaby is well-established, and the general feel of Sternbild is introduced. It's a unique world with interesting heroes, and I'm glad it's priming to make a big comeback to the world of anime. I hope Tiger & Bunny reaches a much bigger crowd this time around.   Yeah, I actually missed the initial boat for this one 10 years ago and had to binge the first season shortly before this because I kept putting it off until the second season was just around the corner. But I don't regret a minute of it. I definitely regret the fact that this couldn't be a bigger hit when it came out for a myriad of complicated reasons. That doesn't mean it's too late. Just because it's over a decade now doesn't mean it still can't have its day in the sun!   Nothing would be truer to this fail-dad than being late to his own successful franchise, I tell you what!     Anyways, this is Nicky & Jean-Karlo, over and out! Til next time.

Jean-Karlo  This week's This Week in Anime was brought to you by Crab! It all comes crawling back to Crab™!     Crab and very region-specific Pepsi sounds like an interesting flavor combo, NGL. But still not as interesting of a combo as the hero duo Tiger & Bunny!     The original Tiger & Bunny anime came out a bit before the massive influx of superheroes became the mono-culture in the U.S. And weirdly enough, it's taken this long for the series to come back with a new season. Netflix is also streaming two movies for the Tiger & Bunny series, The Beginning and The Rising.   These two films came out in 2012 and 2014 respectively but have just now been re-released for streaming on Netflix in honor of that hot new second season. The Beginning is half re-cap of the early part of the series and serves as a great re-introduction for our Super Hero Buddy Cops, while The Rising takes place after the series proper with entirely new material.     Now, I love me some Japanese superheroes, especially the old blood. Yatterman, Gatchaman, Kamen Rider, Casshern, Ultraman, that stuff. And I was always interested in how Japan would handle a take on more Americanized superheroes. Tiger & Bunny has been beloved by fans since its premiere, and not just because of the wave of heroes the Mouse of House churns out on a daily basis. It's a fascinating show, all the way down to the folks wearing those fancy sponsored CG costumes.   Tiger & Bunny is conceptually rich because it fully breaks down the idea of commercialized heroing as an industry, including real company sponsors (which leads to some funny dissonance). The heroes of Sternbild receive live TV coverage and toe the line between being enforcers, performers, and public motivators, along with everything else that life throws at them, on and off the cameras. The focus on the corporate inner workings is part of what makes it feel more mature. It's not just some kids' fantasy of saving people, but a more detailed look at what would happen if someone really tried to make this their job.   Normally, all the heroes compete for points with each other. But when veteran Wild Tiger, real name Kotetsu Kaburagi, moves to a new company after his previous one folds, he's paired with the young and ambitious Barnaby Brooks Jr., to which he affectionally nicknames Bunny, much to his new partner's annoyance.      What makes Tiger & Bunny work – unlike a lot of ""these heroes are realistic!"" joints like The Boys – is that it's not relentlessly dour. The characters aren't irredeemable louts or psychopaths, they're just people trying to make an honest living while living under the whims of an unfeeling, uncaring management system. These people live or die by their sponsors. It's more Mystery Men than anything else, and that's a damn original place to start from when you're making a superhero movie.   It also leans heavily into the showbiz stuff more than any other cape thing I had watched before, but if anything its core is its ensemble cast of heroes and trying to build the companionship between the two main characters. Like many stories about manly bonds, the two of them start out pretty prickly at first, but both have also suffered severe losses of love in their lives. Kotetsu has a 10-year-old daughter he keeps his work secret from, and has previously lost his wife. Barnaby lost his family to a tragic (extremely plot related) incident that left him traumatized. Just knowing this, you can see how much they could benefit from having someone else to call family in their life. Y'know, assuming you could get one of them to open up.     Kotetsu is a really compelling character, and not just because he's a handsome fail-dad with a stylish outfit. He just needs some loving heart to make him better, or worse, that's a fantasy, too. He's goofy and his sense of heroism really doesn't jive with the mercenary world he's in, but rather than feeling like an idiot he just feels quaint. He's not wrong to want to help people, he's just shouldering more weight than he can carry because he just cares about people that much.     He's definitely meant to appeal to an older audience, a rarity for anime, and he's the the heart of the show despite being a lame guy who struggles to keep up with the younger competition. He constantly lets people down, including his own daughter, but you can tell he really values people's feelings just as much as being a hero.     As if to underline it all: his is the only ""conventional"" superhero outfit among all the other heroes. Everyone else has a fancy suit of armor, but Wild Tiger insists on a cape, a themed cowl, and a strongman suit. Even when he gets his updated power suit, he still wears his old one underneath. You can see him wearing the mask inside his helmet.   Barnaby however is the complete opposite, all suped up in the latest tech and uses his real name and face. He instantly saves Kotetsu's sorry ass and is eager to climb up the ladder. They also both happen to share the same type of power, including the fact that both of them have a time limit to use it.      Where Kotetsu wants to be a hero out of a genuine-to-a-fault desire to help people, Barnaby is wholly self-interested... or so he tells himself. He's convinced that putting his identity out there and acting as a hero can get him the funds and recognition he needs to track down the Oroboros group, the crime ring involved with the  murder of his parents. He may not want to care about other people, but he still cares nevertheless. Not that he'd ever admit it to such an embarrassing dad like Kotetsu.   Also, in a twist of fate, Barnaby Brooks Jr is Kotetsu's daughter's favorite superhero. Not even Wild Tiger. Eesh.      Kotetsu's old school ways doesn't make him popular, even with his own daughter. He was inspired by the King of Old Timers, Mr. Legend, so it makes sense that he clings to those ideals. Many people with super powers in this world – referred to as NEXT – don't always fit in when their powers are fresh and new, and even so, not everyone is fit to be a hero.      This is explored a bit more in The Rising, but a lot of NEXTs have powers that just skirt the line of being useful. Stuff like producing a toxin that just makes you really itchy. Or making your hand grow really, really big. Or, like... being really good at swimming. Kotetsu himself rides that line, partially because of his shtick, partially because his power on its own isn't the best (he can make himself one-hundred times stronger for a short period of time), and partially because he tends to leap before he looks. Like My Hero Academia and its many characters that have wholly-pedestrian Quirks, a lot of heroes in Tiger & Bunny just aren't meant for the big leagues.   When the series begins, Kotetsu is at least doing well enough to stand alongside the biggest heroes in the city: the immovable Rock Bison, the scaredy-cat ninja Origami Cyclone, the thunder-wielding Dragon Kid, the literally-flaming Fire Emblem, the King of Heroes Sky High, and the ice-wielding idol Blue Rose.       And even in The Beginning we really see how Kotetsu helps bring these people together. At first they don't really have much comradery with each other, they might even get in each other's way, something the villain of the first movie actively uses against all of them. But by the time The Rising happens you can really feel how they've grown close.   As always, the villain is capitalism. Because all of the heroes are part of Hero TV, a superhero reality tv show, they're all rated on their actions. You earn points for saving citizens and preventing disasters, but lose points if you fail to capture criminals or if they give you the slip. Getting points is important because you cannot become a hero without a sponsor, and doing well means your sponsor is happy. Happy sponsors, happy network, happy hero. Thus, it's against their best interests to help each other out: each hero scrambles for as many points as they can get.    This is also part of why Kotetsu is such a bomb in the ratings: much to his producer's chagrin, he values people's lives over ratings or network shares, so instead of waiting for a commercial break to let the audience get excited he goes and just tries to save people anyway.      Other than the recap portion of the movie, the plot of The Beginning is that someone nabs the city's very important golden statue of justice and nobody can catch the crook. All the heroes run around, get bamboozled by his power to swap places, and it's really just a fun excuse to allow the cast run around and interact. Anime movies often feel bad for being superfluous, but since Tiger & Bunny the series has quite a few episodes dedicated to just building up the characters, it doesn't really feel out of place for the franchise.     It helps that the other heroes aren't terribly complicated and nevertheless get plenty of scenes to themselves. When the team is called out to arrest thief Robin Baxter, they all go their separate ways... together. Dragon Kid and Blue Rose talk about earrings. Fire Emblem... flirts with Rock Bison. Sky High shows off his wind-control powers to Origami Cyclone, showing an uncharacteristically fun-loving side of himself. It's good stuff that does a good job of letting the cast start to see themselves as more than just competitors.       They each get their moments, whether it's Sky High being a little ""up in the clouds"" even though he's currently the top-rated hero, Rock Bison and Kotetsu being Old Guys together as pals at the bottom of the rankings, or Blue Rose's hilariously cheesy mandated catchphrase.   I also wanna point out that I love the character designs in Tiger & Bunny. It's not just Kotetsu's fancy outfits or Barnaby's flowing locks – everyone in this series looks amazing. Masakazu Katsura was brought onboard to handle character designs; he worked on the superhero-flavored Zetman but he's also known for the romantic comedies D.N.A.², Video Girl Ai, and I''s. His charming character designs are fantastic.   ... Also, he did a manga called Wingman about a toku-themed superhero and I'm dying to see that get brought back someday.    They're also more semi-realistic than most anime even ten years ago and it works better since most of the characters are older. The downside is that it makes them harder to animate too, so expect them to look off-model in places. But I think overall the movies look good even compared to today's standards, including the heavy use of CG for the suits and the action.     As it turns out, the CG is on purpose: because many of the costumes would otherwise have to be redrawn if sponsors for the heroes changed (or if the sponsorship brands had to be removed for foreign markets), it's just easier to render them as CG models. The only one who gets traditional animation is Blue Rose, partly because it's hard to shove a logo on her skimpy outfit, partly because she's T&B's source of T&A.     Which becomes upsetting when you remember she's supposed to be in high school still, for some reason. Why are there no adult female superheroes?!   Nobody said idol culture was healthy... A detail the movies leave out from the series is that Blue Rose might have romantic inclinations towards Kotetsu, who's like... twice her age. Thank goodness. Also, because let's be honest, Kotetsu and Barnaby all the way. A family can be a little girl and her two bickering superhero dads.     That's touched on in the series but I prefer to see it as a ""hero crush"" rather than just being hot for a single dad since she obviously takes Kotetsu's ideals to heart after a point.

Longtime villain and villain-killer Lunatic shows up to help Virgil to enact his own sense of justice and stand as Kotetsu's ideological opposite while Barnaby stands against Virgil as his mirror and opposite. Both of them state that it's important to be able to center yourself in the present, move on, and not be stuck in the past.      I can't be the only one who thinks Lunatic resembles a weird cross between Purple Haze and King Crimson. Anyway, Virgil becomes a giant robot crab made out of junk metal and fights off Wild Tiger and Barnaby in an attempt at carrying out his own revenge, claiming justification because Barnaby also took his revenge on the man that killed his parents.     Using Kotetsu's only one minute of power they unleash a big show-stopping team-up climax! Sweet.      The fantastic showing reinvigorates the public's desire for the old Wild Tiger/Barnaby team-up too, and even Golden Ryan helps spur them back into teaming up again.     With a nice poem from Kotetsu's daughter, the movie closes with the heroes continuing their duty of protecting Sternbild. It's a really solid ending for a solid pair of movies.     I thought these were both good as a re-introduction but also an epilogue for the series. It doesn't cover everything but it deals with a lot of elements that make Tiger & Bunny stand out.   As a Tiger & Bunny neophyte, I think these movies also serve really well as an introduction to the series. You get just enough of a taste of the other heroes to want to see more, the dynamic between Kotetsu and Barnaby is well-established, and the general feel of Sternbild is introduced. It's a unique world with interesting heroes, and I'm glad it's priming to make a big comeback to the world of anime. I hope Tiger & Bunny reaches a much bigger crowd this time around.   Yeah, I actually missed the initial boat for this one 10 years ago and had to binge the first season shortly before this because I kept putting it off until the second season was just around the corner. But I don't regret a minute of it. I definitely regret the fact that this couldn't be a bigger hit when it came out for a myriad of complicated reasons. That doesn't mean it's too late. Just because it's over a decade now doesn't mean it still can't have its day in the sun!   Nothing would be truer to this fail-dad than being late to his own successful franchise, I tell you what!     Anyways, this is Nicky & Jean-Karlo, over and out! Til next time.

Netflix is also streaming two movies for the Tiger & Bunny series, The Beginning and The Rising.

The downside is that it makes them harder to animate too, so expect them to look off-model in places. But I think overall the movies look good even compared to today's standards, including the heavy use of CG for the suits and the action.

I'll also take a moment to shoutout to the dub. I found both language tracks to be pretty good, but Tiger & Bunny has a lot of what I miss in anime dubs. The script is adapted really well and fits the more natural and Americanized feel of the show and the more diverse cast.

They're a great hero, a trusted friend, and honestly the only ding on their journey of acceptance is the fact that they kept goosing the other guys. Nathan is a person of color and that's always a delight to see in anime. Also, I'm using they/them pronouns for Nathan because it's my understanding the new Tiger & Bunny anime is also doing so in the dub.   And once Fire Emblem comes back they lend one heck of an assist to Blue Rose and Dragon Kid... Also, Fire Emblem is sponsored by Domino's. That just amuses me.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic   Apr  9th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Kaguya-sama: Love is War -Ultra Romantic- ?                     Community score: 4.6              What is this?   Kaguya Shinomiya and Miyuki Shirogane are two geniuses who stand atop their prestigious academy's student council, making them the elite among elite. But it's lonely at the top and each has fallen for the other. There's just one huge problem standing in the way of lovey-dovey bliss—they're both too prideful to be the first to confess their romantic feelings and thus become the “loser” in the competition of love.    Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic is the latest entry in the television anime based on Aka Akasaka's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                I can't believe that in one day, two of my favorite romances had new seasons start! Premiere season is tough, but days like this make it worth it. Kaguya-sama: Love is War has returned for a third season, picking right back where the previous season left off, and boy, am I glad to see these kids with all their weird little quirks and foibles again.    I wasn't totally sold on Miko Iino by the end of the previous season, unsure of where she would fit into the group dynamic with rigid prudishness as her primary character trait. So of course, the episode leads with a skit between her and Ishigami, who once upon a time was one of the worst characters but is now one of the best. Miko's strange listening habits, and Ishigami's attempt at taking the fall for her, made her feel more like a little weirdo, and by now, a bit of weirdness is basically a requirement to be a student council member.    This is important because there's a playfulness inherent to Kaguya-sama that Iino's rigidity seemed antithetical to, but ended up on full display for the rest of the episode. Teenagers aren't my area of expertise, but they're still kids, and kids need to play! They need to be awkward and obsess over things like read receipts on messaging apps and boast and set up arm-wrestling tournaments instead of doing their actual work. Their personalities are exaggerated and caricatured, but few comedies capture those special moments where you get a strange idea and just keep going with it.    That playfulness extends to the visual presentation as well. The animation in this season has so far been fairly middle of the road, and thus I haven't commented on it much, but Kaguya-sama has some of the best goddamn direction and animation in the medium. Mamoru Hatakeyama and his team almost always manage to elevate the manga's punchlines into something special, and they held nothing back this episode. From the camel wandering around in the background as Iino studies, to Shirogane's shifting body language as he realizes he has the upper hand on Kaguya over the phone, to making the picture quality look like a VHS transfer – every frame has something joyful and unexpected. Big gags and subtle expressions alike have been animated with equal levels of care.    If you haven't watched Kaguya-sama: Love is War yet… why not? It's seriously one of the best anime comedies ever made. Why deprive yourself?       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               After having watched two full seasons, it's become perfectly clear that Kaguya-sama isn't for me (except in the rare cases where it is). Being mostly a series of short gags—usually involving instant karma as one of the student council members attempts to assert dominance over the others in some way—means that there's not much to further develop the characters or progress the love story between Shinomiya and Shirogane. The episodes of the series I most enjoy tend to be the final few of the season where meaningful things happen and there is real drama and tangible stakes. This season premiere was most certainly not one of those episodes.    Now, that's not to say I don't find the humor of the show funny in its own right. From Ishigami futilely trying to stop Iino from embarrassing herself to Shinomiya's ignorance about the differences between email and texting, there are a ton of great gags in this episode. The final self-contained story about the arm wrestling tournament takes things to a whole other level—especially with its post-credits scene showing that Fujiwara was just talking trash the whole time and couldn't win without cheating.    But what takes all these gags to the next level is the animation that merges what's really going on with what the characters are thinking to create something as funny as it is surreal. From the large camel making noises in Iino's ear to the mountain of bodybuilders supporting Shinomiya, it's all but impossible not to laugh.    So while Kaguya-sama isn't my cup of tea in general, I wouldn't say that this is a bad episode. In fact, it is pretty much the epitome of what Kaguya-sama is at its essence. If you ever need a laugh, Kaguya-sama is eager to deliver—just don't expect anything more.       James Beckett  Rating:               One of the “benefits” of being a teacher is getting to essentially serve as a kind of covert anthropologist that specializes in that most elusive and influential of species: The modern teenager. I'm like Jane Goodall; I live among them, in their native environment, and since they give absolutely zero shits about what I think, I have free reign to study the peculiar social rituals and developmental adaptations that these hormonal and aggressive pack animals undergo. As such, I feel like I can say, with legitimately authoritative expertise, that one of the things that makes Kaguya-sama: Love is War such a smashing success is how well it understands the interior lives of teenagers. Specifically, it has a comprehensive understanding of all the ridiculously dumb shit that teenagers will do to and with one another when left to their own devices. More importantly, it gets that all of this inane tomfoolery, no matter how stupid, will feel to a teenager like the most earth-shatteringly consequential events that will ever occur in their lifetimes.    Kaguya-sama: Love is War –Ultra Romantic– is essentially more of the same, in that regard. The goofy kids of Shuchiin Academy's student council spend their days getting into the most ridiculous of shenanigans, while Kaguya and Miyuki sloooooooowly progress along their romantic destinies with one another. “More of the same” can come across as a backhanded compliment, but that couldn't be further from the truth in the case of an anime like Kaguya-sama, considering that the “same” in question happens to be some of the most consistently hilarious and expertly animated comedy in the business.    Each of the three sketches in this premiere does what Kaguya-sama does best, in that they take painfully relatable, everyday scenarios and crank the intensity so far past the eleven mark that the the dial may as well be ripped clean off. The opening sketch is perhaps the weakest of the three, since it focuses on Yu trying to deal with Miko not realizing that people can hear the weird crap she listens to when she's studying, and neither of these characters are the strongest of the ensemble. The joke about Miko's weird listening habits is also just not terribly funny, though that might be because that my own ADHD has had me go to some truly strange and avant garde places in search of distracting sounds to play when I'm trying to focus.    The other two scenes are golden, though, and they show off a wide variety of Kaguya-sama's strengths. The “Read Receipts” sketch is a masterpiece of observational humor, mining Kaguya's technological naivety and featuring Miyuki in full-on petty-goblin mode. It's one of those bits where the show manages to generate horror movie levels of tension on behalf of these loveably awkward children and their inability to just have a normal conversation. We also get a lot of good Ai content, which is always a bonus.    The “Arm Wrestling” sketch is just as hilarious, mostly because it's one of those showcases that gets the whole cast in on a silly mess-around that allows the artists at A-1 Pictures to really strut their stuff. It would already have been funny to have Chika get so obsessed with putting on an arm- wrestling contest, but Kaguya-sama goes the extra mile by animating the ever-loving hell out of it all. I demand a raise specifically for whoever got to handle the cut where Miyuki's face nearly implodes against the fury of Kaguya's sweat-hands fury (we've all been there, girl, there's no shame in it).    Do you honestly need me to tell you that Kaguya-sama's third season is mandatory viewing for this spring? Of course not. It's proven itself time and time again. Still, in case it needs to be said: Yes, the show is great, and you should absolutely watch it. Duh-doy, Britta.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               There really is nothing else quite like Kaguya-sama is there? Even as a self-proclaimed connoisseur of romcoms, it's hard to think of another series that managed to take such a simple premise and spin it into one of the most infectiously hilarious – and consistent – anime comedies of the past decade. But whatever alchemy is happening between the source material and the always exuberant adaptation team is still firing on all cylinders, and they've come back from season two without missing a step.    The series isn't resting on its laurels for this sequel either. It'd be easy to throw us back in with a classic Kaguya vs Shirogane battle, but instead they used the opportunity to demonstrate just how much good the previous season did for the show's weakest characters. Not only are Ishigami and Iino capable of carrying a skit almost entirely on their own, but they're able to do it in a way that capitalizes on all of  Ishigami's growth from the previous arc, going from the show's go-to punching bag to the kind of selfless idiot-genius that butters this show's bread. It's an unconventional way to welcome viewers back, but nonetheless promises to be just as hilarious as always.    From there, it's the same Kaguya-sama that steamrolled through our hearts in the previous seasons. The characters are still a blast, and the direction is as committed as ever to ridiculous, eclectic, and endlessly creative visual gags to sell every joke. It's not doing anything particularly new for the series, but that's a “don't mess with perfection” situation if ever there was one. I can attest to having a stupid smile plastered on my face across the entire premiere, and I busted out laughing as these kids tried to Death Note their way through being left on read, or when an homage to the soundtrack of Over The Top started playing during their arm-wrestling tournament. It's the kind of layered, high-effort joke that sets this show apart from the rest of its subgenre, and it's just so nice to have it back.    If you've missed this runaway train of a show, there probably aren't enough creatively directed romantic mind games in the world to convince you at this point. But if you're already a fan who was just worried the magic might have run out after all this time, you've got nothing to worry about. Kaguya-sama is back and in championship form once again.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          3 comments       Jujutsu Kaisen Stage Play's Video Introduces Cast in Costume   Apr 15, 07:02 3 comments                 live-action    Ryūji Satō, Ryosuke Miura star in July-August play ― A press conference for the stage play of Gege Akutami's Jujutsu Kaisen manga introduced the production's promotional video, main cast, and other details on Wednesday.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic   Apr  9th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Kaguya-sama: Love is War -Ultra Romantic- ?                     Community score: 4.6              What is this?   Kaguya Shinomiya and Miyuki Shirogane are two geniuses who stand atop their prestigious academy's student council, making them the elite among elite. But it's lonely at the top and each has fallen for the other. There's just one huge problem standing in the way of lovey-dovey bliss—they're both too prideful to be the first to confess their romantic feelings and thus become the “loser” in the competition of love.    Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic is the latest entry in the television anime based on Aka Akasaka's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                I can't believe that in one day, two of my favorite romances had new seasons start! Premiere season is tough, but days like this make it worth it. Kaguya-sama: Love is War has returned for a third season, picking right back where the previous season left off, and boy, am I glad to see these kids with all their weird little quirks and foibles again.    I wasn't totally sold on Miko Iino by the end of the previous season, unsure of where she would fit into the group dynamic with rigid prudishness as her primary character trait. So of course, the episode leads with a skit between her and Ishigami, who once upon a time was one of the worst characters but is now one of the best. Miko's strange listening habits, and Ishigami's attempt at taking the fall for her, made her feel more like a little weirdo, and by now, a bit of weirdness is basically a requirement to be a student council member.    This is important because there's a playfulness inherent to Kaguya-sama that Iino's rigidity seemed antithetical to, but ended up on full display for the rest of the episode. Teenagers aren't my area of expertise, but they're still kids, and kids need to play! They need to be awkward and obsess over things like read receipts on messaging apps and boast and set up arm-wrestling tournaments instead of doing their actual work. Their personalities are exaggerated and caricatured, but few comedies capture those special moments where you get a strange idea and just keep going with it.    That playfulness extends to the visual presentation as well. The animation in this season has so far been fairly middle of the road, and thus I haven't commented on it much, but Kaguya-sama has some of the best goddamn direction and animation in the medium. Mamoru Hatakeyama and his team almost always manage to elevate the manga's punchlines into something special, and they held nothing back this episode. From the camel wandering around in the background as Iino studies, to Shirogane's shifting body language as he realizes he has the upper hand on Kaguya over the phone, to making the picture quality look like a VHS transfer – every frame has something joyful and unexpected. Big gags and subtle expressions alike have been animated with equal levels of care.    If you haven't watched Kaguya-sama: Love is War yet… why not? It's seriously one of the best anime comedies ever made. Why deprive yourself?       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               After having watched two full seasons, it's become perfectly clear that Kaguya-sama isn't for me (except in the rare cases where it is). Being mostly a series of short gags—usually involving instant karma as one of the student council members attempts to assert dominance over the others in some way—means that there's not much to further develop the characters or progress the love story between Shinomiya and Shirogane. The episodes of the series I most enjoy tend to be the final few of the season where meaningful things happen and there is real drama and tangible stakes. This season premiere was most certainly not one of those episodes.    Now, that's not to say I don't find the humor of the show funny in its own right. From Ishigami futilely trying to stop Iino from embarrassing herself to Shinomiya's ignorance about the differences between email and texting, there are a ton of great gags in this episode. The final self-contained story about the arm wrestling tournament takes things to a whole other level—especially with its post-credits scene showing that Fujiwara was just talking trash the whole time and couldn't win without cheating.    But what takes all these gags to the next level is the animation that merges what's really going on with what the characters are thinking to create something as funny as it is surreal. From the large camel making noises in Iino's ear to the mountain of bodybuilders supporting Shinomiya, it's all but impossible not to laugh.    So while Kaguya-sama isn't my cup of tea in general, I wouldn't say that this is a bad episode. In fact, it is pretty much the epitome of what Kaguya-sama is at its essence. If you ever need a laugh, Kaguya-sama is eager to deliver—just don't expect anything more.       James Beckett  Rating:               One of the “benefits” of being a teacher is getting to essentially serve as a kind of covert anthropologist that specializes in that most elusive and influential of species: The modern teenager. I'm like Jane Goodall; I live among them, in their native environment, and since they give absolutely zero shits about what I think, I have free reign to study the peculiar social rituals and developmental adaptations that these hormonal and aggressive pack animals undergo. As such, I feel like I can say, with legitimately authoritative expertise, that one of the things that makes Kaguya-sama: Love is War such a smashing success is how well it understands the interior lives of teenagers. Specifically, it has a comprehensive understanding of all the ridiculously dumb shit that teenagers will do to and with one another when left to their own devices. More importantly, it gets that all of this inane tomfoolery, no matter how stupid, will feel to a teenager like the most earth-shatteringly consequential events that will ever occur in their lifetimes.    Kaguya-sama: Love is War –Ultra Romantic– is essentially more of the same, in that regard. The goofy kids of Shuchiin Academy's student council spend their days getting into the most ridiculous of shenanigans, while Kaguya and Miyuki sloooooooowly progress along their romantic destinies with one another. “More of the same” can come across as a backhanded compliment, but that couldn't be further from the truth in the case of an anime like Kaguya-sama, considering that the “same” in question happens to be some of the most consistently hilarious and expertly animated comedy in the business.    Each of the three sketches in this premiere does what Kaguya-sama does best, in that they take painfully relatable, everyday scenarios and crank the intensity so far past the eleven mark that the the dial may as well be ripped clean off. The opening sketch is perhaps the weakest of the three, since it focuses on Yu trying to deal with Miko not realizing that people can hear the weird crap she listens to when she's studying, and neither of these characters are the strongest of the ensemble. The joke about Miko's weird listening habits is also just not terribly funny, though that might be because that my own ADHD has had me go to some truly strange and avant garde places in search of distracting sounds to play when I'm trying to focus.    The other two scenes are golden, though, and they show off a wide variety of Kaguya-sama's strengths. The “Read Receipts” sketch is a masterpiece of observational humor, mining Kaguya's technological naivety and featuring Miyuki in full-on petty-goblin mode. It's one of those bits where the show manages to generate horror movie levels of tension on behalf of these loveably awkward children and their inability to just have a normal conversation. We also get a lot of good Ai content, which is always a bonus.    The “Arm Wrestling” sketch is just as hilarious, mostly because it's one of those showcases that gets the whole cast in on a silly mess-around that allows the artists at A-1 Pictures to really strut their stuff. It would already have been funny to have Chika get so obsessed with putting on an arm- wrestling contest, but Kaguya-sama goes the extra mile by animating the ever-loving hell out of it all. I demand a raise specifically for whoever got to handle the cut where Miyuki's face nearly implodes against the fury of Kaguya's sweat-hands fury (we've all been there, girl, there's no shame in it).    Do you honestly need me to tell you that Kaguya-sama's third season is mandatory viewing for this spring? Of course not. It's proven itself time and time again. Still, in case it needs to be said: Yes, the show is great, and you should absolutely watch it. Duh-doy, Britta.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               There really is nothing else quite like Kaguya-sama is there? Even as a self-proclaimed connoisseur of romcoms, it's hard to think of another series that managed to take such a simple premise and spin it into one of the most infectiously hilarious – and consistent – anime comedies of the past decade. But whatever alchemy is happening between the source material and the always exuberant adaptation team is still firing on all cylinders, and they've come back from season two without missing a step.    The series isn't resting on its laurels for this sequel either. It'd be easy to throw us back in with a classic Kaguya vs Shirogane battle, but instead they used the opportunity to demonstrate just how much good the previous season did for the show's weakest characters. Not only are Ishigami and Iino capable of carrying a skit almost entirely on their own, but they're able to do it in a way that capitalizes on all of  Ishigami's growth from the previous arc, going from the show's go-to punching bag to the kind of selfless idiot-genius that butters this show's bread. It's an unconventional way to welcome viewers back, but nonetheless promises to be just as hilarious as always.    From there, it's the same Kaguya-sama that steamrolled through our hearts in the previous seasons. The characters are still a blast, and the direction is as committed as ever to ridiculous, eclectic, and endlessly creative visual gags to sell every joke. It's not doing anything particularly new for the series, but that's a “don't mess with perfection” situation if ever there was one. I can attest to having a stupid smile plastered on my face across the entire premiere, and I busted out laughing as these kids tried to Death Note their way through being left on read, or when an homage to the soundtrack of Over The Top started playing during their arm-wrestling tournament. It's the kind of layered, high-effort joke that sets this show apart from the rest of its subgenre, and it's just so nice to have it back.    If you've missed this runaway train of a show, there probably aren't enough creatively directed romantic mind games in the world to convince you at this point. But if you're already a fan who was just worried the magic might have run out after all this time, you've got nothing to worry about. Kaguya-sama is back and in championship form once again.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          3 comments       Jujutsu Kaisen Stage Play's Video Introduces Cast in Costume   Apr 15, 07:02 3 comments                 live-action    Ryūji Satō, Ryosuke Miura star in July-August play ― A press conference for the stage play of Gege Akutami's Jujutsu Kaisen manga introduced the production's promotional video, main cast, and other details on Wednesday.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic   Apr  9th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Kaguya-sama: Love is War -Ultra Romantic- ?                     Community score: 4.6              What is this?   Kaguya Shinomiya and Miyuki Shirogane are two geniuses who stand atop their prestigious academy's student council, making them the elite among elite. But it's lonely at the top and each has fallen for the other. There's just one huge problem standing in the way of lovey-dovey bliss—they're both too prideful to be the first to confess their romantic feelings and thus become the “loser” in the competition of love.    Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic is the latest entry in the television anime based on Aka Akasaka's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                I can't believe that in one day, two of my favorite romances had new seasons start! Premiere season is tough, but days like this make it worth it. Kaguya-sama: Love is War has returned for a third season, picking right back where the previous season left off, and boy, am I glad to see these kids with all their weird little quirks and foibles again.    I wasn't totally sold on Miko Iino by the end of the previous season, unsure of where she would fit into the group dynamic with rigid prudishness as her primary character trait. So of course, the episode leads with a skit between her and Ishigami, who once upon a time was one of the worst characters but is now one of the best. Miko's strange listening habits, and Ishigami's attempt at taking the fall for her, made her feel more like a little weirdo, and by now, a bit of weirdness is basically a requirement to be a student council member.    This is important because there's a playfulness inherent to Kaguya-sama that Iino's rigidity seemed antithetical to, but ended up on full display for the rest of the episode. Teenagers aren't my area of expertise, but they're still kids, and kids need to play! They need to be awkward and obsess over things like read receipts on messaging apps and boast and set up arm-wrestling tournaments instead of doing their actual work. Their personalities are exaggerated and caricatured, but few comedies capture those special moments where you get a strange idea and just keep going with it.    That playfulness extends to the visual presentation as well. The animation in this season has so far been fairly middle of the road, and thus I haven't commented on it much, but Kaguya-sama has some of the best goddamn direction and animation in the medium. Mamoru Hatakeyama and his team almost always manage to elevate the manga's punchlines into something special, and they held nothing back this episode. From the camel wandering around in the background as Iino studies, to Shirogane's shifting body language as he realizes he has the upper hand on Kaguya over the phone, to making the picture quality look like a VHS transfer – every frame has something joyful and unexpected. Big gags and subtle expressions alike have been animated with equal levels of care.    If you haven't watched Kaguya-sama: Love is War yet… why not? It's seriously one of the best anime comedies ever made. Why deprive yourself?       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               After having watched two full seasons, it's become perfectly clear that Kaguya-sama isn't for me (except in the rare cases where it is). Being mostly a series of short gags—usually involving instant karma as one of the student council members attempts to assert dominance over the others in some way—means that there's not much to further develop the characters or progress the love story between Shinomiya and Shirogane. The episodes of the series I most enjoy tend to be the final few of the season where meaningful things happen and there is real drama and tangible stakes. This season premiere was most certainly not one of those episodes.    Now, that's not to say I don't find the humor of the show funny in its own right. From Ishigami futilely trying to stop Iino from embarrassing herself to Shinomiya's ignorance about the differences between email and texting, there are a ton of great gags in this episode. The final self-contained story about the arm wrestling tournament takes things to a whole other level—especially with its post-credits scene showing that Fujiwara was just talking trash the whole time and couldn't win without cheating.    But what takes all these gags to the next level is the animation that merges what's really going on with what the characters are thinking to create something as funny as it is surreal. From the large camel making noises in Iino's ear to the mountain of bodybuilders supporting Shinomiya, it's all but impossible not to laugh.    So while Kaguya-sama isn't my cup of tea in general, I wouldn't say that this is a bad episode. In fact, it is pretty much the epitome of what Kaguya-sama is at its essence. If you ever need a laugh, Kaguya-sama is eager to deliver—just don't expect anything more.       James Beckett  Rating:               One of the “benefits” of being a teacher is getting to essentially serve as a kind of covert anthropologist that specializes in that most elusive and influential of species: The modern teenager. I'm like Jane Goodall; I live among them, in their native environment, and since they give absolutely zero shits about what I think, I have free reign to study the peculiar social rituals and developmental adaptations that these hormonal and aggressive pack animals undergo. As such, I feel like I can say, with legitimately authoritative expertise, that one of the things that makes Kaguya-sama: Love is War such a smashing success is how well it understands the interior lives of teenagers. Specifically, it has a comprehensive understanding of all the ridiculously dumb shit that teenagers will do to and with one another when left to their own devices. More importantly, it gets that all of this inane tomfoolery, no matter how stupid, will feel to a teenager like the most earth-shatteringly consequential events that will ever occur in their lifetimes.    Kaguya-sama: Love is War –Ultra Romantic– is essentially more of the same, in that regard. The goofy kids of Shuchiin Academy's student council spend their days getting into the most ridiculous of shenanigans, while Kaguya and Miyuki sloooooooowly progress along their romantic destinies with one another. “More of the same” can come across as a backhanded compliment, but that couldn't be further from the truth in the case of an anime like Kaguya-sama, considering that the “same” in question happens to be some of the most consistently hilarious and expertly animated comedy in the business.    Each of the three sketches in this premiere does what Kaguya-sama does best, in that they take painfully relatable, everyday scenarios and crank the intensity so far past the eleven mark that the the dial may as well be ripped clean off. The opening sketch is perhaps the weakest of the three, since it focuses on Yu trying to deal with Miko not realizing that people can hear the weird crap she listens to when she's studying, and neither of these characters are the strongest of the ensemble. The joke about Miko's weird listening habits is also just not terribly funny, though that might be because that my own ADHD has had me go to some truly strange and avant garde places in search of distracting sounds to play when I'm trying to focus.    The other two scenes are golden, though, and they show off a wide variety of Kaguya-sama's strengths. The “Read Receipts” sketch is a masterpiece of observational humor, mining Kaguya's technological naivety and featuring Miyuki in full-on petty-goblin mode. It's one of those bits where the show manages to generate horror movie levels of tension on behalf of these loveably awkward children and their inability to just have a normal conversation. We also get a lot of good Ai content, which is always a bonus.    The “Arm Wrestling” sketch is just as hilarious, mostly because it's one of those showcases that gets the whole cast in on a silly mess-around that allows the artists at A-1 Pictures to really strut their stuff. It would already have been funny to have Chika get so obsessed with putting on an arm- wrestling contest, but Kaguya-sama goes the extra mile by animating the ever-loving hell out of it all. I demand a raise specifically for whoever got to handle the cut where Miyuki's face nearly implodes against the fury of Kaguya's sweat-hands fury (we've all been there, girl, there's no shame in it).    Do you honestly need me to tell you that Kaguya-sama's third season is mandatory viewing for this spring? Of course not. It's proven itself time and time again. Still, in case it needs to be said: Yes, the show is great, and you should absolutely watch it. Duh-doy, Britta.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               There really is nothing else quite like Kaguya-sama is there? Even as a self-proclaimed connoisseur of romcoms, it's hard to think of another series that managed to take such a simple premise and spin it into one of the most infectiously hilarious – and consistent – anime comedies of the past decade. But whatever alchemy is happening between the source material and the always exuberant adaptation team is still firing on all cylinders, and they've come back from season two without missing a step.    The series isn't resting on its laurels for this sequel either. It'd be easy to throw us back in with a classic Kaguya vs Shirogane battle, but instead they used the opportunity to demonstrate just how much good the previous season did for the show's weakest characters. Not only are Ishigami and Iino capable of carrying a skit almost entirely on their own, but they're able to do it in a way that capitalizes on all of  Ishigami's growth from the previous arc, going from the show's go-to punching bag to the kind of selfless idiot-genius that butters this show's bread. It's an unconventional way to welcome viewers back, but nonetheless promises to be just as hilarious as always.    From there, it's the same Kaguya-sama that steamrolled through our hearts in the previous seasons. The characters are still a blast, and the direction is as committed as ever to ridiculous, eclectic, and endlessly creative visual gags to sell every joke. It's not doing anything particularly new for the series, but that's a “don't mess with perfection” situation if ever there was one. I can attest to having a stupid smile plastered on my face across the entire premiere, and I busted out laughing as these kids tried to Death Note their way through being left on read, or when an homage to the soundtrack of Over The Top started playing during their arm-wrestling tournament. It's the kind of layered, high-effort joke that sets this show apart from the rest of its subgenre, and it's just so nice to have it back.    If you've missed this runaway train of a show, there probably aren't enough creatively directed romantic mind games in the world to convince you at this point. But if you're already a fan who was just worried the magic might have run out after all this time, you've got nothing to worry about. Kaguya-sama is back and in championship form once again.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          3 comments       Jujutsu Kaisen Stage Play's Video Introduces Cast in Costume   Apr 15, 07:02 3 comments                 live-action    Ryūji Satō, Ryosuke Miura star in July-August play ― A press conference for the stage play of Gege Akutami's Jujutsu Kaisen manga introduced the production's promotional video, main cast, and other details on Wednesday.

The joke about Miko's weird listening habits is also just not terribly funny, though that might be because that my own ADHD has had me go to some truly strange and avant garde places in search of distracting sounds to play when I'm trying to focus.    The other two scenes are golden, though, and they show off a wide variety of Kaguya-sama's strengths. The “Read Receipts” sketch is a masterpiece of observational humor, mining Kaguya's technological naivety and featuring Miyuki in full-on petty-goblin mode. It's one of those bits where the show manages to generate horror movie levels of tension on behalf of these loveably awkward children and their inability to just have a normal conversation. We also get a lot of good Ai content, which is always a bonus.    The “Arm Wrestling” sketch is just as hilarious, mostly because it's one of those showcases that gets the whole cast in on a silly mess-around that allows the artists at A-1 Pictures to really strut their stuff. It would already have been funny to have Chika get so obsessed with putting on an arm- wrestling contest, but Kaguya-sama goes the extra mile by animating the ever-loving hell out of it all. I demand a raise specifically for whoever got to handle the cut where Miyuki's face nearly implodes against the fury of Kaguya's sweat-hands fury (we've all been there, girl, there's no shame in it).    Do you honestly need me to tell you that Kaguya-sama's third season is mandatory viewing for this spring? Of course not. It's proven itself time and time again. Still, in case it needs to be said: Yes, the show is great, and you should absolutely watch it. Duh-doy, Britta.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               There really is nothing else quite like Kaguya-sama is there? Even as a self-proclaimed connoisseur of romcoms, it's hard to think of another series that managed to take such a simple premise and spin it into one of the most infectiously hilarious – and consistent – anime comedies of the past decade. But whatever alchemy is happening between the source material and the always exuberant adaptation team is still firing on all cylinders, and they've come back from season two without missing a step.    The series isn't resting on its laurels for this sequel either. It'd be easy to throw us back in with a classic Kaguya vs Shirogane battle, but instead they used the opportunity to demonstrate just how much good the previous season did for the show's weakest characters. Not only are Ishigami and Iino capable of carrying a skit almost entirely on their own, but they're able to do it in a way that capitalizes on all of  Ishigami's growth from the previous arc, going from the show's go-to punching bag to the kind of selfless idiot-genius that butters this show's bread. It's an unconventional way to welcome viewers back, but nonetheless promises to be just as hilarious as always.    From there, it's the same Kaguya-sama that steamrolled through our hearts in the previous seasons. The characters are still a blast, and the direction is as committed as ever to ridiculous, eclectic, and endlessly creative visual gags to sell every joke. It's not doing anything particularly new for the series, but that's a “don't mess with perfection” situation if ever there was one. I can attest to having a stupid smile plastered on my face across the entire premiere, and I busted out laughing as these kids tried to Death Note their way through being left on read, or when an homage to the soundtrack of Over The Top started playing during their arm-wrestling tournament. It's the kind of layered, high-effort joke that sets this show apart from the rest of its subgenre, and it's just so nice to have it back.    If you've missed this runaway train of a show, there probably aren't enough creatively directed romantic mind games in the world to convince you at this point. But if you're already a fan who was just worried the magic might have run out after all this time, you've got nothing to worry about. Kaguya-sama is back and in championship form once again.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          3 comments       Jujutsu Kaisen Stage Play's Video Introduces Cast in Costume   Apr 15, 07:02 3 comments                 live-action    Ryūji Satō, Ryosuke Miura star in July-August play ― A press conference for the stage play of Gege Akutami's Jujutsu Kaisen manga introduced the production's promotional video, main cast, and other details on Wednesday.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic   Apr  9th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Kaguya-sama: Love is War -Ultra Romantic- ?                     Community score: 4.6              What is this?   Kaguya Shinomiya and Miyuki Shirogane are two geniuses who stand atop their prestigious academy's student council, making them the elite among elite. But it's lonely at the top and each has fallen for the other. There's just one huge problem standing in the way of lovey-dovey bliss—they're both too prideful to be the first to confess their romantic feelings and thus become the “loser” in the competition of love.    Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic is the latest entry in the television anime based on Aka Akasaka's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                I can't believe that in one day, two of my favorite romances had new seasons start! Premiere season is tough, but days like this make it worth it. Kaguya-sama: Love is War has returned for a third season, picking right back where the previous season left off, and boy, am I glad to see these kids with all their weird little quirks and foibles again.    I wasn't totally sold on Miko Iino by the end of the previous season, unsure of where she would fit into the group dynamic with rigid prudishness as her primary character trait. So of course, the episode leads with a skit between her and Ishigami, who once upon a time was one of the worst characters but is now one of the best. Miko's strange listening habits, and Ishigami's attempt at taking the fall for her, made her feel more like a little weirdo, and by now, a bit of weirdness is basically a requirement to be a student council member.    This is important because there's a playfulness inherent to Kaguya-sama that Iino's rigidity seemed antithetical to, but ended up on full display for the rest of the episode. Teenagers aren't my area of expertise, but they're still kids, and kids need to play! They need to be awkward and obsess over things like read receipts on messaging apps and boast and set up arm-wrestling tournaments instead of doing their actual work. Their personalities are exaggerated and caricatured, but few comedies capture those special moments where you get a strange idea and just keep going with it.    That playfulness extends to the visual presentation as well. The animation in this season has so far been fairly middle of the road, and thus I haven't commented on it much, but Kaguya-sama has some of the best goddamn direction and animation in the medium. Mamoru Hatakeyama and his team almost always manage to elevate the manga's punchlines into something special, and they held nothing back this episode. From the camel wandering around in the background as Iino studies, to Shirogane's shifting body language as he realizes he has the upper hand on Kaguya over the phone, to making the picture quality look like a VHS transfer – every frame has something joyful and unexpected. Big gags and subtle expressions alike have been animated with equal levels of care.    If you haven't watched Kaguya-sama: Love is War yet… why not? It's seriously one of the best anime comedies ever made. Why deprive yourself?       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               After having watched two full seasons, it's become perfectly clear that Kaguya-sama isn't for me (except in the rare cases where it is). Being mostly a series of short gags—usually involving instant karma as one of the student council members attempts to assert dominance over the others in some way—means that there's not much to further develop the characters or progress the love story between Shinomiya and Shirogane. The episodes of the series I most enjoy tend to be the final few of the season where meaningful things happen and there is real drama and tangible stakes. This season premiere was most certainly not one of those episodes.    Now, that's not to say I don't find the humor of the show funny in its own right. From Ishigami futilely trying to stop Iino from embarrassing herself to Shinomiya's ignorance about the differences between email and texting, there are a ton of great gags in this episode. The final self-contained story about the arm wrestling tournament takes things to a whole other level—especially with its post-credits scene showing that Fujiwara was just talking trash the whole time and couldn't win without cheating.    But what takes all these gags to the next level is the animation that merges what's really going on with what the characters are thinking to create something as funny as it is surreal. From the large camel making noises in Iino's ear to the mountain of bodybuilders supporting Shinomiya, it's all but impossible not to laugh.    So while Kaguya-sama isn't my cup of tea in general, I wouldn't say that this is a bad episode. In fact, it is pretty much the epitome of what Kaguya-sama is at its essence. If you ever need a laugh, Kaguya-sama is eager to deliver—just don't expect anything more.       James Beckett  Rating:               One of the “benefits” of being a teacher is getting to essentially serve as a kind of covert anthropologist that specializes in that most elusive and influential of species: The modern teenager. I'm like Jane Goodall; I live among them, in their native environment, and since they give absolutely zero shits about what I think, I have free reign to study the peculiar social rituals and developmental adaptations that these hormonal and aggressive pack animals undergo. As such, I feel like I can say, with legitimately authoritative expertise, that one of the things that makes Kaguya-sama: Love is War such a smashing success is how well it understands the interior lives of teenagers. Specifically, it has a comprehensive understanding of all the ridiculously dumb shit that teenagers will do to and with one another when left to their own devices. More importantly, it gets that all of this inane tomfoolery, no matter how stupid, will feel to a teenager like the most earth-shatteringly consequential events that will ever occur in their lifetimes.    Kaguya-sama: Love is War –Ultra Romantic– is essentially more of the same, in that regard. The goofy kids of Shuchiin Academy's student council spend their days getting into the most ridiculous of shenanigans, while Kaguya and Miyuki sloooooooowly progress along their romantic destinies with one another. “More of the same” can come across as a backhanded compliment, but that couldn't be further from the truth in the case of an anime like Kaguya-sama, considering that the “same” in question happens to be some of the most consistently hilarious and expertly animated comedy in the business.    Each of the three sketches in this premiere does what Kaguya-sama does best, in that they take painfully relatable, everyday scenarios and crank the intensity so far past the eleven mark that the the dial may as well be ripped clean off. The opening sketch is perhaps the weakest of the three, since it focuses on Yu trying to deal with Miko not realizing that people can hear the weird crap she listens to when she's studying, and neither of these characters are the strongest of the ensemble.

Being mostly a series of short gags—usually involving instant karma as one of the student council members attempts to assert dominance over the others in some way—means that there's not much to further develop the characters or progress the love story between Shinomiya and Shirogane. The episodes of the series I most enjoy tend to be the final few of the season where meaningful things happen and there is real drama and tangible stakes. This season premiere was most certainly not one of those episodes.    Now, that's not to say I don't find the humor of the show funny in its own right. From Ishigami futilely trying to stop Iino from embarrassing herself to Shinomiya's ignorance about the differences between email and texting, there are a ton of great gags in this episode. The final self-contained story about the arm wrestling tournament takes things to a whole other level—especially with its post-credits scene showing that Fujiwara was just talking trash the whole time and couldn't win without cheating.    But what takes all these gags to the next level is the animation that merges what's really going on with what the characters are thinking to create something as funny as it is surreal. From the large camel making noises in Iino's ear to the mountain of bodybuilders supporting Shinomiya, it's all but impossible not to laugh.    So while Kaguya-sama isn't my cup of tea in general, I wouldn't say that this is a bad episode. In fact, it is pretty much the epitome of what Kaguya-sama is at its essence. If you ever need a laugh, Kaguya-sama is eager to deliver—just don't expect anything more.       James Beckett  Rating:               One of the “benefits” of being a teacher is getting to essentially serve as a kind of covert anthropologist that specializes in that most elusive and influential of species: The modern teenager. I'm like Jane Goodall; I live among them, in their native environment, and since they give absolutely zero shits about what I think, I have free reign to study the peculiar social rituals and developmental adaptations that these hormonal and aggressive pack animals undergo. As such, I feel like I can say, with legitimately authoritative expertise, that one of the things that makes Kaguya-sama: Love is War such a smashing success is how well it understands the interior lives of teenagers. Specifically, it has a comprehensive understanding of all the ridiculously dumb shit that teenagers will do to and with one another when left to their own devices. More importantly, it gets that all of this inane tomfoolery, no matter how stupid, will feel to a teenager like the most earth-shatteringly consequential events that will ever occur in their lifetimes.    Kaguya-sama: Love is War –Ultra Romantic– is essentially more of the same, in that regard. The goofy kids of Shuchiin Academy's student council spend their days getting into the most ridiculous of shenanigans, while Kaguya and Miyuki sloooooooowly progress along their romantic destinies with one another. “More of the same” can come across as a backhanded compliment, but that couldn't be further from the truth in the case of an anime like Kaguya-sama, considering that the “same” in question happens to be some of the most consistently hilarious and expertly animated comedy in the business.    Each of the three sketches in this premiere does what Kaguya-sama does best, in that they take painfully relatable, everyday scenarios and crank the intensity so far past the eleven mark that the the dial may as well be ripped clean off. The opening sketch is perhaps the weakest of the three, since it focuses on Yu trying to deal with Miko not realizing that people can hear the weird crap she listens to when she's studying, and neither of these characters are the strongest of the ensemble. The joke about Miko's weird listening habits is also just not terribly funny, though that might be because that my own ADHD has had me go to some truly strange and avant garde places in search of distracting sounds to play when I'm trying to focus.    The other two scenes are golden, though, and they show off a wide variety of Kaguya-sama's strengths. The “Read Receipts” sketch is a masterpiece of observational humor, mining Kaguya's technological naivety and featuring Miyuki in full-on petty-goblin mode. It's one of those bits where the show manages to generate horror movie levels of tension on behalf of these loveably awkward children and their inability to just have a normal conversation. We also get a lot of good Ai content, which is always a bonus.    The “Arm Wrestling” sketch is just as hilarious, mostly because it's one of those showcases that gets the whole cast in on a silly mess-around that allows the artists at A-1 Pictures to really strut their stuff. It would already have been funny to have Chika get so obsessed with putting on an arm- wrestling contest, but Kaguya-sama goes the extra mile by animating the ever-loving hell out of it all. I demand a raise specifically for whoever got to handle the cut where Miyuki's face nearly implodes against the fury of Kaguya's sweat-hands fury (we've all been there, girl, there's no shame in it).    Do you honestly need me to tell you that Kaguya-sama's third season is mandatory viewing for this spring? Of course not. It's proven itself time and time again. Still, in case it needs to be said: Yes, the show is great, and you should absolutely watch it. Duh-doy, Britta.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               There really is nothing else quite like Kaguya-sama is there? Even as a self-proclaimed connoisseur of romcoms, it's hard to think of another series that managed to take such a simple premise and spin it into one of the most infectiously hilarious – and consistent – anime comedies of the past decade.

The series isn't resting on its laurels for this sequel either. It'd be easy to throw us back in with a classic Kaguya vs Shirogane battle, but instead they used the opportunity to demonstrate just how much good the previous season did for the show's weakest characters. Not only are Ishigami and Iino capable of carrying a skit almost entirely on their own, but they're able to do it in a way that capitalizes on all of  Ishigami's growth from the previous arc, going from the show's go-to punching bag to the kind of selfless idiot-genius that butters this show's bread. It's an unconventional way to welcome viewers back, but nonetheless promises to be just as hilarious as always.    From there, it's the same Kaguya-sama that steamrolled through our hearts in the previous seasons. The characters are still a blast, and the direction is as committed as ever to ridiculous, eclectic, and endlessly creative visual gags to sell every joke. It's not doing anything particularly new for the series, but that's a “don't mess with perfection” situation if ever there was one. I can attest to having a stupid smile plastered on my face across the entire premiere, and I busted out laughing as these kids tried to Death Note their way through being left on read, or when an homage to the soundtrack of Over The Top started playing during their arm-wrestling tournament.

Community score: 4.6              What is this?   Kaguya Shinomiya and Miyuki Shirogane are two geniuses who stand atop their prestigious academy's student council, making them the elite among elite. But it's lonely at the top and each has fallen for the other. There's just one huge problem standing in the way of lovey-dovey bliss—they're both too prideful to be the first to confess their romantic feelings and thus become the “loser” in the competition of love.    Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic is the latest entry in the television anime based on Aka Akasaka's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                I can't believe that in one day, two of my favorite romances had new seasons start! Premiere season is tough, but days like this make it worth it. Kaguya-sama: Love is War has returned for a third season, picking right back where the previous season left off, and boy, am I glad to see these kids with all their weird little quirks and foibles again.    I wasn't totally sold on Miko Iino by the end of the previous season, unsure of where she would fit into the group dynamic with rigid prudishness as her primary character trait. So of course, the episode leads with a skit between her and Ishigami, who once upon a time was one of the worst characters but is now one of the best. Miko's strange listening habits, and Ishigami's attempt at taking the fall for her, made her feel more like a little weirdo, and by now, a bit of weirdness is basically a requirement to be a student council member.    This is important because there's a playfulness inherent to Kaguya-sama that Iino's rigidity seemed antithetical to, but ended up on full display for the rest of the episode. Teenagers aren't my area of expertise, but they're still kids, and kids need to play! They need to be awkward and obsess over things like read receipts on messaging apps and boast and set up arm-wrestling tournaments instead of doing their actual work. Their personalities are exaggerated and caricatured, but few comedies capture those special moments where you get a strange idea and just keep going with it.    That playfulness extends to the visual presentation as well. The animation in this season has so far been fairly middle of the road, and thus I haven't commented on it much, but Kaguya-sama has some of the best goddamn direction and animation in the medium. Mamoru Hatakeyama and his team almost always manage to elevate the manga's punchlines into something special, and they held nothing back this episode. From the camel wandering around in the background as Iino studies, to Shirogane's shifting body language as he realizes he has the upper hand on Kaguya over the phone, to making the picture quality look like a VHS transfer – every frame has something joyful and unexpected. Big gags and subtle expressions alike have been animated with equal levels of care.    If you haven't watched Kaguya-sama: Love is War yet… why not? It's seriously one of the best anime comedies ever made. Why deprive yourself?

Community score: 4.6              What is this?   Kaguya Shinomiya and Miyuki Shirogane are two geniuses who stand atop their prestigious academy's student council, making them the elite among elite. But it's lonely at the top and each has fallen for the other. There's just one huge problem standing in the way of lovey-dovey bliss—they're both too prideful to be the first to confess their romantic feelings and thus become the “loser” in the competition of love.    Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic is the latest entry in the television anime based on Aka Akasaka's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                I can't believe that in one day, two of my favorite romances had new seasons start! Premiere season is tough, but days like this make it worth it. Kaguya-sama: Love is War has returned for a third season, picking right back where the previous season left off, and boy, am I glad to see these kids with all their weird little quirks and foibles again.    I wasn't totally sold on Miko Iino by the end of the previous season, unsure of where she would fit into the group dynamic with rigid prudishness as her primary character trait. So of course, the episode leads with a skit between her and Ishigami, who once upon a time was one of the worst characters but is now one of the best. Miko's strange listening habits, and Ishigami's attempt at taking the fall for her, made her feel more like a little weirdo, and by now, a bit of weirdness is basically a requirement to be a student council member.    This is important because there's a playfulness inherent to Kaguya-sama that Iino's rigidity seemed antithetical to, but ended up on full display for the rest of the episode. Teenagers aren't my area of expertise, but they're still kids, and kids need to play! They need to be awkward and obsess over things like read receipts on messaging apps and boast and set up arm-wrestling tournaments instead of doing their actual work. Their personalities are exaggerated and caricatured, but few comedies capture those special moments where you get a strange idea and just keep going with it.    That playfulness extends to the visual presentation as well. The animation in this season has so far been fairly middle of the road, and thus I haven't commented on it much, but Kaguya-sama has some of the best goddamn direction and animation in the medium. Mamoru Hatakeyama and his team almost always manage to elevate the manga's punchlines into something special, and they held nothing back this episode. From the camel wandering around in the background as Iino studies, to Shirogane's shifting body language as he realizes he has the upper hand on Kaguya over the phone, to making the picture quality look like a VHS transfer – every frame has something joyful and unexpected. Big gags and subtle expressions alike have been animated with equal levels of care.    If you haven't watched Kaguya-sama: Love is War yet… why not? It's seriously one of the best anime comedies ever made. Why deprive yourself?       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               After having watched two full seasons, it's become perfectly clear that Kaguya-sama isn't for me (except in the rare cases where it is). Being mostly a series of short gags—usually involving instant karma as one of the student council members attempts to assert dominance over the others in some way—means that there's not much to further develop the characters or progress the love story between Shinomiya and Shirogane. The episodes of the series I most enjoy tend to be the final few of the season where meaningful things happen and there is real drama and tangible stakes. This season premiere was most certainly not one of those episodes.    Now, that's not to say I don't find the humor of the show funny in its own right. From Ishigami futilely trying to stop Iino from embarrassing herself to Shinomiya's ignorance about the differences between email and texting, there are a ton of great gags in this episode. The final self-contained story about the arm wrestling tournament takes things to a whole other level—especially with its post-credits scene showing that Fujiwara was just talking trash the whole time and couldn't win without cheating.    But what takes all these gags to the next level is the animation that merges what's really going on with what the characters are thinking to create something as funny as it is surreal. From the large camel making noises in Iino's ear to the mountain of bodybuilders supporting Shinomiya, it's all but impossible not to laugh.    So while Kaguya-sama isn't my cup of tea in general, I wouldn't say that this is a bad episode. In fact, it is pretty much the epitome of what Kaguya-sama is at its essence. If you ever need a laugh, Kaguya-sama is eager to deliver—just don't expect anything more.       James Beckett  Rating:               One of the “benefits” of being a teacher is getting to essentially serve as a kind of covert anthropologist that specializes in that most elusive and influential of species: The modern teenager. I'm like Jane Goodall; I live among them, in their native environment, and since they give absolutely zero shits about what I think, I have free reign to study the peculiar social rituals and developmental adaptations that these hormonal and aggressive pack animals undergo. As such, I feel like I can say, with legitimately authoritative expertise, that one of the things that makes Kaguya-sama: Love is War such a smashing success is how well it understands the interior lives of teenagers. Specifically, it has a comprehensive understanding of all the ridiculously dumb shit that teenagers will do to and with one another when left to their own devices. More importantly, it gets that all of this inane tomfoolery, no matter how stupid, will feel to a teenager like the most earth-shatteringly consequential events that will ever occur in their lifetimes.    Kaguya-sama: Love is War –Ultra Romantic– is essentially more of the same, in that regard. The goofy kids of Shuchiin Academy's student council spend their days getting into the most ridiculous of shenanigans, while Kaguya and Miyuki sloooooooowly progress along their romantic destinies with one another. “More of the same” can come across as a backhanded compliment, but that couldn't be further from the truth in the case of an anime like Kaguya-sama, considering that the “same” in question happens to be some of the most consistently hilarious and expertly animated comedy in the business.    Each of the three sketches in this premiere does what Kaguya-sama does best, in that they take painfully relatable, everyday scenarios and crank the intensity so far past the eleven mark that the the dial may as well be ripped clean off. The opening sketch is perhaps the weakest of the three, since it focuses on Yu trying to deal with Miko not realizing that people can hear the weird crap she listens to when she's studying, and neither of these characters are the strongest of the ensemble. The joke about Miko's weird listening habits is also just not terribly funny, though that might be because that my own ADHD has had me go to some truly strange and avant garde places in search of distracting sounds to play when I'm trying to focus.    The other two scenes are golden, though, and they show off a wide variety of Kaguya-sama's strengths. The “Read Receipts” sketch is a masterpiece of observational humor, mining Kaguya's technological naivety and featuring Miyuki in full-on petty-goblin mode. It's one of those bits where the show manages to generate horror movie levels of tension on behalf of these loveably awkward children and their inability to just have a normal conversation. We also get a lot of good Ai content, which is always a bonus.    The “Arm Wrestling” sketch is just as hilarious, mostly because it's one of those showcases that gets the whole cast in on a silly mess-around that allows the artists at A-1 Pictures to really strut their stuff. It would already have been funny to have Chika get so obsessed with putting on an arm- wrestling contest, but Kaguya-sama goes the extra mile by animating the ever-loving hell out of it all. I demand a raise specifically for whoever got to handle the cut where Miyuki's face nearly implodes against the fury of Kaguya's sweat-hands fury (we've all been there, girl, there's no shame in it).    Do you honestly need me to tell you that Kaguya-sama's third season is mandatory viewing for this spring? Of course not. It's proven itself time and time again. Still, in case it needs to be said: Yes, the show is great, and you should absolutely watch it. Duh-doy, Britta.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               There really is nothing else quite like Kaguya-sama is there? Even as a self-proclaimed connoisseur of romcoms, it's hard to think of another series that managed to take such a simple premise and spin it into one of the most infectiously hilarious – and consistent – anime comedies of the past decade. But whatever alchemy is happening between the source material and the always exuberant adaptation team is still firing on all cylinders, and they've come back from season two without missing a step.    The series isn't resting on its laurels for this sequel either. It'd be easy to throw us back in with a classic Kaguya vs Shirogane battle, but instead they used the opportunity to demonstrate just how much good the previous season did for the show's weakest characters. Not only are Ishigami and Iino capable of carrying a skit almost entirely on their own, but they're able to do it in a way that capitalizes on all of  Ishigami's growth from the previous arc, going from the show's go-to punching bag to the kind of selfless idiot-genius that butters this show's bread. It's an unconventional way to welcome viewers back, but nonetheless promises to be just as hilarious as always.    From there, it's the same Kaguya-sama that steamrolled through our hearts in the previous seasons. The characters are still a blast, and the direction is as committed as ever to ridiculous, eclectic, and endlessly creative visual gags to sell every joke. It's not doing anything particularly new for the series, but that's a “don't mess with perfection” situation if ever there was one. I can attest to having a stupid smile plastered on my face across the entire premiere, and I busted out laughing as these kids tried to Death Note their way through being left on read, or when an homage to the soundtrack of Over The Top started playing during their arm-wrestling tournament. It's the kind of layered, high-effort joke that sets this show apart from the rest of its subgenre, and it's just so nice to have it back.    If you've missed this runaway train of a show, there probably aren't enough creatively directed romantic mind games in the world to convince you at this point.

The “Read Receipts” sketch is a masterpiece of observational humor, mining Kaguya's technological naivety and featuring Miyuki in full-on petty-goblin mode. It's one of those bits where the show manages to generate horror movie levels of tension on behalf of these loveably awkward children and their inability to just have a normal conversation. We also get a lot of good Ai content, which is always a bonus.    The “Arm Wrestling” sketch is just as hilarious, mostly because it's one of those showcases that gets the whole cast in on a silly mess-around that allows the artists at A-1 Pictures to really strut their stuff. It would already have been funny to have Chika get so obsessed with putting on an arm- wrestling contest, but Kaguya-sama goes the extra mile by animating the ever-loving hell out of it all. I demand a raise specifically for whoever got to handle the cut where Miyuki's face nearly implodes against the fury of Kaguya's sweat-hands fury (we've all been there, girl, there's no shame in it).    Do you honestly need me to tell you that Kaguya-sama's third season is mandatory viewing for this spring? Of course not. It's proven itself time and time again. Still, in case it needs to be said: Yes, the show is great, and you should absolutely watch it. Duh-doy, Britta.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               There really is nothing else quite like Kaguya-sama is there? Even as a self-proclaimed connoisseur of romcoms, it's hard to think of another series that managed to take such a simple premise and spin it into one of the most infectiously hilarious – and consistent – anime comedies of the past decade. But whatever alchemy is happening between the source material and the always exuberant adaptation team is still firing on all cylinders, and they've come back from season two without missing a step.    The series isn't resting on its laurels for this sequel either. It'd be easy to throw us back in with a classic Kaguya vs Shirogane battle, but instead they used the opportunity to demonstrate just how much good the previous season did for the show's weakest characters. Not only are Ishigami and Iino capable of carrying a skit almost entirely on their own, but they're able to do it in a way that capitalizes on all of  Ishigami's growth from the previous arc, going from the show's go-to punching bag to the kind of selfless idiot-genius that butters this show's bread. It's an unconventional way to welcome viewers back, but nonetheless promises to be just as hilarious as always.    From there, it's the same Kaguya-sama that steamrolled through our hearts in the previous seasons. The characters are still a blast, and the direction is as committed as ever to ridiculous, eclectic, and endlessly creative visual gags to sell every joke. It's not doing anything particularly new for the series, but that's a “don't mess with perfection” situation if ever there was one. I can attest to having a stupid smile plastered on my face across the entire premiere, and I busted out laughing as these kids tried to Death Note their way through being left on read, or when an homage to the soundtrack of Over The Top started playing during their arm-wrestling tournament. It's the kind of layered, high-effort joke that sets this show apart from the rest of its subgenre, and it's just so nice to have it back.    If you've missed this runaway train of a show, there probably aren't enough creatively directed romantic mind games in the world to convince you at this point. But if you're already a fan who was just worried the magic might have run out after all this time, you've got nothing to worry about. Kaguya-sama is back and in championship form once again.

15-04-2022,anime,4,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/preview-guide/2022/spring/kaguya-sama-love-is-war-ultra-romantic/.183619,Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic - The Spring 2022 Preview Guide - Anime News Network:SEA,"            How would you rate episode 1 of Kaguya-sama: Love is War -Ultra Romantic- ?                     Community score: 4.6              What is this?   Kaguya Shinomiya and Miyuki Shirogane are two geniuses who stand atop their prestigious academy's student council, making them the elite among elite. But it's lonely at the top and each has fallen for the other. There's just one huge problem standing in the way of lovey-dovey bliss—they're both too prideful to be the first to confess their romantic feelings and thus become the “loser” in the competition of love.    Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic is the latest entry in the television anime based on Aka Akasaka's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                I can't believe that in one day, two of my favorite romances had new seasons start! Premiere season is tough, but days like this make it worth it. Kaguya-sama: Love is War has returned for a third season, picking right back where the previous season left off, and boy, am I glad to see these kids with all their weird little quirks and foibles again.    I wasn't totally sold on Miko Iino by the end of the previous season, unsure of where she would fit into the group dynamic with rigid prudishness as her primary character trait. So of course, the episode leads with a skit between her and Ishigami, who once upon a time was one of the worst characters but is now one of the best. Miko's strange listening habits, and Ishigami's attempt at taking the fall for her, made her feel more like a little weirdo, and by now, a bit of weirdness is basically a requirement to be a student council member.    This is important because there's a playfulness inherent to Kaguya-sama that Iino's rigidity seemed antithetical to, but ended up on full display for the rest of the episode. Teenagers aren't my area of expertise, but they're still kids, and kids need to play! They need to be awkward and obsess over things like read receipts on messaging apps and boast and set up arm-wrestling tournaments instead of doing their actual work. Their personalities are exaggerated and caricatured, but few comedies capture those special moments where you get a strange idea and just keep going with it.    That playfulness extends to the visual presentation as well. The animation in this season has so far been fairly middle of the road, and thus I haven't commented on it much, but Kaguya-sama has some of the best goddamn direction and animation in the medium. Mamoru Hatakeyama and his team almost always manage to elevate the manga's punchlines into something special, and they held nothing back this episode. From the camel wandering around in the background as Iino studies, to Shirogane's shifting body language as he realizes he has the upper hand on Kaguya over the phone, to making the picture quality look like a VHS transfer – every frame has something joyful and unexpected. Big gags and subtle expressions alike have been animated with equal levels of care.    If you haven't watched Kaguya-sama: Love is War yet… why not? It's seriously one of the best anime comedies ever made. Why deprive yourself?       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               After having watched two full seasons, it's become perfectly clear that Kaguya-sama isn't for me (except in the rare cases where it is). Being mostly a series of short gags—usually involving instant karma as one of the student council members attempts to assert dominance over the others in some way—means that there's not much to further develop the characters or progress the love story between Shinomiya and Shirogane. The episodes of the series I most enjoy tend to be the final few of the season where meaningful things happen and there is real drama and tangible stakes. This season premiere was most certainly not one of those episodes.    Now, that's not to say I don't find the humor of the show funny in its own right. From Ishigami futilely trying to stop Iino from embarrassing herself to Shinomiya's ignorance about the differences between email and texting, there are a ton of great gags in this episode. The final self-contained story about the arm wrestling tournament takes things to a whole other level—especially with its post-credits scene showing that Fujiwara was just talking trash the whole time and couldn't win without cheating.    But what takes all these gags to the next level is the animation that merges what's really going on with what the characters are thinking to create something as funny as it is surreal. From the large camel making noises in Iino's ear to the mountain of bodybuilders supporting Shinomiya, it's all but impossible not to laugh.    So while Kaguya-sama isn't my cup of tea in general, I wouldn't say that this is a bad episode. In fact, it is pretty much the epitome of what Kaguya-sama is at its essence. If you ever need a laugh, Kaguya-sama is eager to deliver—just don't expect anything more.       James Beckett  Rating:               One of the “benefits” of being a teacher is getting to essentially serve as a kind of covert anthropologist that specializes in that most elusive and influential of species: The modern teenager. I'm like Jane Goodall; I live among them, in their native environment, and since they give absolutely zero shits about what I think, I have free reign to study the peculiar social rituals and developmental adaptations that these hormonal and aggressive pack animals undergo. As such, I feel like I can say, with legitimately authoritative expertise, that one of the things that makes Kaguya-sama: Love is War such a smashing success is how well it understands the interior lives of teenagers. Specifically, it has a comprehensive understanding of all the ridiculously dumb shit that teenagers will do to and with one another when left to their own devices. More importantly, it gets that all of this inane tomfoolery, no matter how stupid, will feel to a teenager like the most earth-shatteringly consequential events that will ever occur in their lifetimes.    Kaguya-sama: Love is War –Ultra Romantic– is essentially more of the same, in that regard. The goofy kids of Shuchiin Academy's student council spend their days getting into the most ridiculous of shenanigans, while Kaguya and Miyuki sloooooooowly progress along their romantic destinies with one another. “More of the same” can come across as a backhanded compliment, but that couldn't be further from the truth in the case of an anime like Kaguya-sama, considering that the “same” in question happens to be some of the most consistently hilarious and expertly animated comedy in the business.    Each of the three sketches in this premiere does what Kaguya-sama does best, in that they take painfully relatable, everyday scenarios and crank the intensity so far past the eleven mark that the the dial may as well be ripped clean off. The opening sketch is perhaps the weakest of the three, since it focuses on Yu trying to deal with Miko not realizing that people can hear the weird crap she listens to when she's studying, and neither of these characters are the strongest of the ensemble. The joke about Miko's weird listening habits is also just not terribly funny, though that might be because that my own ADHD has had me go to some truly strange and avant garde places in search of distracting sounds to play when I'm trying to focus.    The other two scenes are golden, though, and they show off a wide variety of Kaguya-sama's strengths.

News Ayano Tsuji Composes Insert Song for Deaimon Anime   posted on 2022-04-12 18:03 UTC-8 by Crystalyn Hodgkins          Minori Suzuki to perform insert song in show's 2nd episode    The official website for the television anime of Rin Asano's Deaimon manga revealed on Tuesday that Kyoto-born singer-songwriter Ayano Tsuji (theme song for The Cat Returns) is composing and writing the lyrics for an insert song in the anime. The song ""Yae ni Saku"" will appear in the show's second episode on April 13. Minori Suzuki, who plays Mitsuru Horikawa in the series, is singing the song.    The anime premiered in Japan on April 6, and Crunchyroll is streaming the series as it airs uner the title Deaimon: Recipe for Happiness.    The manga's story centers on Nagomu, a man who left his home in Kyoto and his family's confectionary shop when he became a musician. Upon hearing that his father has been hospitalized though, he comes back home to take over the family business. However, while he was gone, a young girl named Itsuka started working at the shop. The whereabouts of Itsuka's parents is unknown, and she has no other relatives, and Nagomu finds himself as foster parent for Itsuka. Itsuka, on the other hand, dislikes Nagomu for abandoning the family to become a musician. She proclaims that it will be her who will take over the shop one day instead of Nagomu.    Fumitoshi Oizaki (A Centaur's Life, Romeo × Juliet, AOKANA: Four Rhythm Across the Blue) is directing the anime at Encourage Films (Is the order a rabbit? BLOOM, Etotama, Isekai Cheat Magician). Reiko Yoshida (K-ON!, Tamako Love Story, Liz and the Blue Bird) is overseeing the series scripts, and Sakae Shibuya (A Centaur's Life, Magical Girl Site) is the character designer and chief animation director.    Maaya Sakamoto is performing the anime's opening theme song ""Sumire"" (Pansy), and she wrote the song's lyrics. The special unit Deaimon — singer-songwriter ayaho and musician and composer Junichi Soga — is performing the ending theme song ""Koko ni Aru Yakusoku.""

News Ayano Tsuji Composes Insert Song for Deaimon Anime   posted on 2022-04-12 18:03 UTC-8 by Crystalyn Hodgkins          Minori Suzuki to perform insert song in show's 2nd episode    The official website for the television anime of Rin Asano's Deaimon manga revealed on Tuesday that Kyoto-born singer-songwriter Ayano Tsuji (theme song for The Cat Returns) is composing and writing the lyrics for an insert song in the anime. The song ""Yae ni Saku"" will appear in the show's second episode on April 13. Minori Suzuki, who plays Mitsuru Horikawa in the series, is singing the song.    The anime premiered in Japan on April 6, and Crunchyroll is streaming the series as it airs uner the title Deaimon: Recipe for Happiness.    The manga's story centers on Nagomu, a man who left his home in Kyoto and his family's confectionary shop when he became a musician. Upon hearing that his father has been hospitalized though, he comes back home to take over the family business. However, while he was gone, a young girl named Itsuka started working at the shop. The whereabouts of Itsuka's parents is unknown, and she has no other relatives, and Nagomu finds himself as foster parent for Itsuka. Itsuka, on the other hand, dislikes Nagomu for abandoning the family to become a musician. She proclaims that it will be her who will take over the shop one day instead of Nagomu.    Fumitoshi Oizaki (A Centaur's Life, Romeo × Juliet, AOKANA: Four Rhythm Across the Blue) is directing the anime at Encourage Films (Is the order a rabbit? BLOOM, Etotama, Isekai Cheat Magician). Reiko Yoshida (K-ON!, Tamako Love Story, Liz and the Blue Bird) is overseeing the series scripts, and Sakae Shibuya (A Centaur's Life, Magical Girl Site) is the character designer and chief animation director.    Maaya Sakamoto is performing the anime's opening theme song ""Sumire"" (Pansy), and she wrote the song's lyrics. The special unit Deaimon — singer-songwriter ayaho and musician and composer Junichi Soga — is performing the ending theme song ""Koko ni Aru Yakusoku.""

News Ayano Tsuji Composes Insert Song for Deaimon Anime   posted on 2022-04-12 18:03 UTC-8 by Crystalyn Hodgkins          Minori Suzuki to perform insert song in show's 2nd episode    The official website for the television anime of Rin Asano's Deaimon manga revealed on Tuesday that Kyoto-born singer-songwriter Ayano Tsuji (theme song for The Cat Returns) is composing and writing the lyrics for an insert song in the anime.

The anime premiered in Japan on April 6, and Crunchyroll is streaming the series as it airs uner the title Deaimon: Recipe for Happiness.

Upon hearing that his father has been hospitalized though, he comes back home to take over the family business. However, while he was gone, a young girl named Itsuka started working at the shop. The whereabouts of Itsuka's parents is unknown, and she has no other relatives, and Nagomu finds himself as foster parent for Itsuka. Itsuka, on the other hand, dislikes Nagomu for abandoning the family to become a musician. She proclaims that it will be her who will take over the shop one day instead of Nagomu.    Fumitoshi Oizaki (A Centaur's Life, Romeo × Juliet, AOKANA: Four Rhythm Across the Blue) is directing the anime at Encourage Films (Is the order a rabbit? BLOOM, Etotama, Isekai Cheat Magician).

His peaceful daily life comes to an end when 2 million yen (about US$20,000) in school trip fees goes missing.

Interest Pompo: The Cinéphile Anime Film Director Comments on Nathalie's Fortnite Dance   posted on 2022-04-14 03:45 UTC-8 by Kim Morrissy          Takayuki Hirao's inspiration was DA PUMP's “U.S.A."" dance, which was huge in Japan    Pompo: The Cinéphile anime film director Takayuki Hirao participated in an Ask Me Anything (AMA) on the r/anime subreddit on Tuesday ahead of the film's U.S. release on April 29. Hirao took questions from fans about the film—including one amusing question highlighting Nathalie's dance sequence. The brief clip became a meme in the English-speaking community because the dance is featured as an emote in the popular Fortnite survival game.    In his response (quoted below), Hirao explained his reasoning for including it in the film and his Japanese inspiration:   I'm surprised that this dance is a popular meme in America! In Japan, it's called the iine—or “thumbs up” dance. Two years ago a band called DA PUMP released a song called “U.S.A."" and everyone was doing the dance in Japan. Nathalie tends to express her emotions with her body. So when she's confused or nervous, she dances. And because the song is called “U.S.A.” and there are a lot of U.S. references in the film, we thought it would be perfect. So it would be an homage!  avex released DA PUMP's music video in 2018. American rapper BloBoy JB displayed the original dance move in his ""Shoot"" music video in 2017.    Hirao also shared his favorite film directors, his techniques for representing live-action camerawork in anime, and his experiences working at ufotable and with the legendary director Satoshi Kon.    GKIDS will begin screening the  anime film of Shogo Sugitani's Pompo: The Cinéphile (Eiga Daisuki Pompo-san) manga in the U.S. on April 29 in select theaters, with a special fan preview screening on April 27-28. The movie will screen in Japanese with English subtitles and an English dub. Tickets are currently on sale.    Preview screenings will feature an introduction from Hirao.    NYICFF describes the film:  If you're reading this, chances are you like movies. You'll feel right at home with Pompo, the talented and gutsy producer whose love of cinema is unflinching and unapologetic. One day, Pompo turns her uncanny eye for talent to her movie-loving but apprehensive assistant Gene, selecting him to make his directorial debut with her latest script. But Gene has his work cut out for him with a young starlet looking for her first big break and a legendary, aging, Brando-like superstar in front of the camera. It's not an action movie, but Pompo's breakneck pace combined with the high stakes of creative fulfillment pack in as much excitement as standard superhero fare. Add to that a slew of insider movie references and countless winks and nods to the filmmaking process, this hilarious and heartful dramedy has what it takes to fulfill even your wildest celluloid dreams.  Takayuki Hirao (The Garden of Sinners movie 5, God Eater) directed the film at CLAP. Shingo Adachi (Sword Art Online, Wagnaria!!) designed the characters. Ryoichiro Matsuo (In This Corner of the World) served as producer. Vocaloid producer Iori Kanzaki composed three vocal songs for the film. Virtual singer Kaf performed one insert song ""Tatoeba"" (For Example), and DUSTCELL vocalist EMA performed the film's other insert song ""Hangyakusha no Bokura"" (We the Rebels). In addition, Seiko Niizuma performed the film's opening number ""Dance on Fire."" Rookie female singer CIEL performed the film's theme song ""Mado wo Akete"" (Open a Window).    The anime film premiered in North America at Montreal's 25th Fantasia International Film Festival in August.

Interest Pompo: The Cinéphile Anime Film Director Comments on Nathalie's Fortnite Dance   posted on 2022-04-14 03:45 UTC-8 by Kim Morrissy          Takayuki Hirao's inspiration was DA PUMP's “U.S.A."" dance, which was huge in Japan    Pompo: The Cinéphile anime film director Takayuki Hirao participated in an Ask Me Anything (AMA) on the r/anime subreddit on Tuesday ahead of the film's U.S. release on April 29. Hirao took questions from fans about the film—including one amusing question highlighting Nathalie's dance sequence. The brief clip became a meme in the English-speaking community because the dance is featured as an emote in the popular Fortnite survival game.    In his response (quoted below), Hirao explained his reasoning for including it in the film and his Japanese inspiration:   I'm surprised that this dance is a popular meme in America! In Japan, it's called the iine—or “thumbs up” dance. Two years ago a band called DA PUMP released a song called “U.S.A."" and everyone was doing the dance in Japan. Nathalie tends to express her emotions with her body. So when she's confused or nervous, she dances. And because the song is called “U.S.A.” and there are a lot of U.S. references in the film, we thought it would be perfect. So it would be an homage!  avex released DA PUMP's music video in 2018. American rapper BloBoy JB displayed the original dance move in his ""Shoot"" music video in 2017.    Hirao also shared his favorite film directors, his techniques for representing live-action camerawork in anime, and his experiences working at ufotable and with the legendary director Satoshi Kon.    GKIDS will begin screening the  anime film of Shogo Sugitani's Pompo: The Cinéphile (Eiga Daisuki Pompo-san) manga in the U.S. on April 29 in select theaters, with a special fan preview screening on April 27-28. The movie will screen in Japanese with English subtitles and an English dub. Tickets are currently on sale.    Preview screenings will feature an introduction from Hirao.    NYICFF describes the film:  If you're reading this, chances are you like movies. You'll feel right at home with Pompo, the talented and gutsy producer whose love of cinema is unflinching and unapologetic. One day, Pompo turns her uncanny eye for talent to her movie-loving but apprehensive assistant Gene, selecting him to make his directorial debut with her latest script. But Gene has his work cut out for him with a young starlet looking for her first big break and a legendary, aging, Brando-like superstar in front of the camera. It's not an action movie, but Pompo's breakneck pace combined with the high stakes of creative fulfillment pack in as much excitement as standard superhero fare. Add to that a slew of insider movie references and countless winks and nods to the filmmaking process, this hilarious and heartful dramedy has what it takes to fulfill even your wildest celluloid dreams.  Takayuki Hirao (The Garden of Sinners movie 5, God Eater) directed the film at CLAP. Shingo Adachi (Sword Art Online, Wagnaria!!) designed the characters. Ryoichiro Matsuo (In This Corner of the World) served as producer. Vocaloid producer Iori Kanzaki composed three vocal songs for the film. Virtual singer Kaf performed one insert song ""Tatoeba"" (For Example), and DUSTCELL vocalist EMA performed the film's other insert song ""Hangyakusha no Bokura"" (We the Rebels). In addition, Seiko Niizuma performed the film's opening number ""Dance on Fire."" Rookie female singer CIEL performed the film's theme song ""Mado wo Akete"" (Open a Window).    The anime film premiered in North America at Montreal's 25th Fantasia International Film Festival in August.

But Gene has his work cut out for him with a young starlet looking for her first big break and a legendary, aging, Brando-like superstar in front of the camera. It's not an action movie, but Pompo's breakneck pace combined with the high stakes of creative fulfillment pack in as much excitement as standard superhero fare. Add to that a slew of insider movie references and countless winks and nods to the filmmaking process, this hilarious and heartful dramedy has what it takes to fulfill even your wildest celluloid dreams.  Takayuki Hirao (The Garden of Sinners movie 5, God Eater) directed the film at CLAP. Shingo Adachi (Sword Art Online, Wagnaria!!) designed the characters. Ryoichiro Matsuo (In This Corner of the World) served as producer. Vocaloid producer Iori Kanzaki composed three vocal songs for the film. Virtual singer Kaf performed one insert song ""Tatoeba"" (For Example), and DUSTCELL vocalist EMA performed the film's other insert song ""Hangyakusha no Bokura"" (We the Rebels). In addition, Seiko Niizuma performed the film's opening number ""Dance on Fire."" Rookie female singer CIEL performed the film's theme song ""Mado wo Akete"" (Open a Window).    The anime film premiered in North America at Montreal's 25th Fantasia International Film Festival in August.

Hirao took questions from fans about the film—including one amusing question highlighting Nathalie's dance sequence. The brief clip became a meme in the English-speaking community because the dance is featured as an emote in the popular Fortnite survival game.    In his response (quoted below), Hirao explained his reasoning for including it in the film and his Japanese inspiration:   I'm surprised that this dance is a popular meme in America! In Japan, it's called the iine—or “thumbs up” dance. Two years ago a band called DA PUMP released a song called “U.S.A."" and everyone was doing the dance in Japan. Nathalie tends to express her emotions with her body. So when she's confused or nervous, she dances. And because the song is called “U.S.A.” and there are a lot of U.S. references in the film, we thought it would be perfect. So it would be an homage!  avex released DA PUMP's music video in 2018. American rapper BloBoy JB displayed the original dance move in his ""Shoot"" music video in 2017.    Hirao also shared his favorite film directors, his techniques for representing live-action camerawork in anime, and his experiences working at ufotable and with the legendary director Satoshi Kon.    GKIDS will begin screening the  anime film of Shogo Sugitani's Pompo: The Cinéphile (Eiga Daisuki Pompo-san) manga in the U.S. on April 29 in select theaters, with a special fan preview screening on April 27-28. The movie will screen in Japanese with English subtitles and an English dub. Tickets are currently on sale.    Preview screenings will feature an introduction from Hirao.    NYICFF describes the film:  If you're reading this, chances are you like movies. You'll feel right at home with Pompo, the talented and gutsy producer whose love of cinema is unflinching and unapologetic.

Interest Pompo: The Cinéphile Anime Film Director Comments on Nathalie's Fortnite Dance   posted on 2022-04-14 03:45 UTC-8 by Kim Morrissy          Takayuki Hirao's inspiration was DA PUMP's “U.S.A."" dance, which was huge in Japan    Pompo: The Cinéphile anime film director Takayuki Hirao participated in an Ask Me Anything (AMA) on the r/anime subreddit on Tuesday ahead of the film's U.S. release on April 29. Hirao took questions from fans about the film—including one amusing question highlighting Nathalie's dance sequence. The brief clip became a meme in the English-speaking community because the dance is featured as an emote in the popular Fortnite survival game.    In his response (quoted below), Hirao explained his reasoning for including it in the film and his Japanese inspiration:   I'm surprised that this dance is a popular meme in America! In Japan, it's called the iine—or “thumbs up” dance. Two years ago a band called DA PUMP released a song called “U.S.A."" and everyone was doing the dance in Japan. Nathalie tends to express her emotions with her body. So when she's confused or nervous, she dances. And because the song is called “U.S.A.” and there are a lot of U.S. references in the film, we thought it would be perfect. So it would be an homage!  avex released DA PUMP's music video in 2018. American rapper BloBoy JB displayed the original dance move in his ""Shoot"" music video in 2017.    Hirao also shared his favorite film directors, his techniques for representing live-action camerawork in anime, and his experiences working at ufotable and with the legendary director Satoshi Kon.    GKIDS will begin screening the  anime film of Shogo Sugitani's Pompo: The Cinéphile (Eiga Daisuki Pompo-san) manga in the U.S. on April 29 in select theaters, with a special fan preview screening on April 27-28. The movie will screen in Japanese with English subtitles and an English dub. Tickets are currently on sale.    Preview screenings will feature an introduction from Hirao.    NYICFF describes the film:  If you're reading this, chances are you like movies. You'll feel right at home with Pompo, the talented and gutsy producer whose love of cinema is unflinching and unapologetic. One day, Pompo turns her uncanny eye for talent to her movie-loving but apprehensive assistant Gene, selecting him to make his directorial debut with her latest script. But Gene has his work cut out for him with a young starlet looking for her first big break and a legendary, aging, Brando-like superstar in front of the camera. It's not an action movie, but Pompo's breakneck pace combined with the high stakes of creative fulfillment pack in as much excitement as standard superhero fare. Add to that a slew of insider movie references and countless winks and nods to the filmmaking process, this hilarious and heartful dramedy has what it takes to fulfill even your wildest celluloid dreams.

Hirao took questions from fans about the film—including one amusing question highlighting Nathalie's dance sequence. The brief clip became a meme in the English-speaking community because the dance is featured as an emote in the popular Fortnite survival game.    In his response (quoted below), Hirao explained his reasoning for including it in the film and his Japanese inspiration:   I'm surprised that this dance is a popular meme in America! In Japan, it's called the iine—or “thumbs up” dance. Two years ago a band called DA PUMP released a song called “U.S.A."" and everyone was doing the dance in Japan. Nathalie tends to express her emotions with her body. So when she's confused or nervous, she dances. And because the song is called “U.S.A.” and there are a lot of U.S. references in the film, we thought it would be perfect. So it would be an homage!  avex released DA PUMP's music video in 2018. American rapper BloBoy JB displayed the original dance move in his ""Shoot"" music video in 2017.    Hirao also shared his favorite film directors, his techniques for representing live-action camerawork in anime, and his experiences working at ufotable and with the legendary director Satoshi Kon.    GKIDS will begin screening the  anime film of Shogo Sugitani's Pompo: The Cinéphile (Eiga Daisuki Pompo-san) manga in the U.S. on April 29 in select theaters, with a special fan preview screening on April 27-28. The movie will screen in Japanese with English subtitles and an English dub. Tickets are currently on sale.    Preview screenings will feature an introduction from Hirao.    NYICFF describes the film:  If you're reading this, chances are you like movies. You'll feel right at home with Pompo, the talented and gutsy producer whose love of cinema is unflinching and unapologetic. One day, Pompo turns her uncanny eye for talent to her movie-loving but apprehensive assistant Gene, selecting him to make his directorial debut with her latest script. But Gene has his work cut out for him with a young starlet looking for her first big break and a legendary, aging, Brando-like superstar in front of the camera. It's not an action movie, but Pompo's breakneck pace combined with the high stakes of creative fulfillment pack in as much excitement as standard superhero fare. Add to that a slew of insider movie references and countless winks and nods to the filmmaking process, this hilarious and heartful dramedy has what it takes to fulfill even your wildest celluloid dreams.

News To Your Eternity Anime's Season 2 Teaser Reveals New Director, Studio   posted on 2022-04-12 10:07 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda          Prétear's Kiyoko Sayama directs anime at Drive     The official website for the television anime of Yoshitoki Ōima's To Your Eternity (Fumetsu no Anata e) manga began streaming a new teaser promotional video for the second season of the anime on Tuesday. The teaser reveals the anime's new director and studio.       Kiyoko Sayama (Vampire Knight, Prétear, Amanchu! Advance) is the new director for the anime, replacing Masahiko Murata. Drive (ACTORS: Songs Connection, Vladlove) is the new animation studio, replacing Brains Base.    The rest of the main staff members return, including Shinzō Fujita as series script supervisor, Koji Yabuno as character designer, Ryo Kawasaki as music composer, and Takeshi Takadera as sound director.    The second season will premiere this fall.    The anime's first season premiered on NHK Educational in April 2021. The anime was originally slated to premiere in October 2020, but it was delayed to April 2021 due to the anime's production schedule being heavily affected by COVID-19.  Crunchyroll streamed the anime.    Kodansha Comics is publishing the manga in English, and it describes the story:  A new manga from the creator of the acclaimed A Silent Voice, featuring intimate, emotional drama and an epic story spanning time and space… A lonely boy wandering the Arctic regions of North America meets a wolf, and the two become fast friends, depending on each other to survive the harsh environment. But the boy has a history, and the wolf is more than meets the eye as well… To Your Eternity is a totally unique and moving manga about death, life, reincarnation, and the nature of love.  Crunchyroll is releasing the manga in English digitally, simultaneously with its Japanese release.    Ōima launched the manga in November 2016 in Weekly Shōnen Magazine. The manga's first arc ended in December 2019, and the second arc launched in January 2020. The manga won the Best Shōnen Manga award at the 43rd annual Kodansha Manga Awards in May 2019. The manga also ranked on the American Library Association's (ALA's) Young Adult Library Services Association's (YALSA) 2019 list of Great Graphic Novels for Teens.

News To Your Eternity Anime's Season 2 Teaser Reveals New Director, Studio   posted on 2022-04-12 10:07 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda          Prétear's Kiyoko Sayama directs anime at Drive     The official website for the television anime of Yoshitoki Ōima's To Your Eternity (Fumetsu no Anata e) manga began streaming a new teaser promotional video for the second season of the anime on Tuesday. The teaser reveals the anime's new director and studio.       Kiyoko Sayama (Vampire Knight, Prétear, Amanchu! Advance) is the new director for the anime, replacing Masahiko Murata. Drive (ACTORS: Songs Connection, Vladlove) is the new animation studio, replacing Brains Base.    The rest of the main staff members return, including Shinzō Fujita as series script supervisor, Koji Yabuno as character designer, Ryo Kawasaki as music composer, and Takeshi Takadera as sound director.    The second season will premiere this fall.    The anime's first season premiered on NHK Educational in April 2021. The anime was originally slated to premiere in October 2020, but it was delayed to April 2021 due to the anime's production schedule being heavily affected by COVID-19.  Crunchyroll streamed the anime.    Kodansha Comics is publishing the manga in English, and it describes the story:  A new manga from the creator of the acclaimed A Silent Voice, featuring intimate, emotional drama and an epic story spanning time and space… A lonely boy wandering the Arctic regions of North America meets a wolf, and the two become fast friends, depending on each other to survive the harsh environment. But the boy has a history, and the wolf is more than meets the eye as well… To Your Eternity is a totally unique and moving manga about death, life, reincarnation, and the nature of love.  Crunchyroll is releasing the manga in English digitally, simultaneously with its Japanese release.    Ōima launched the manga in November 2016 in Weekly Shōnen Magazine. The manga's first arc ended in December 2019, and the second arc launched in January 2020. The manga won the Best Shōnen Manga award at the 43rd annual Kodansha Manga Awards in May 2019. The manga also ranked on the American Library Association's (ALA's) Young Adult Library Services Association's (YALSA) 2019 list of Great Graphic Novels for Teens.

News To Your Eternity Anime's Season 2 Teaser Reveals New Director, Studio   posted on 2022-04-12 10:07 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda          Prétear's Kiyoko Sayama directs anime at Drive     The official website for the television anime of Yoshitoki Ōima's To Your Eternity (Fumetsu no Anata e) manga began streaming a new teaser promotional video for the second season of the anime on Tuesday. The teaser reveals the anime's new director and studio.       Kiyoko Sayama (Vampire Knight, Prétear, Amanchu! Advance) is the new director for the anime, replacing Masahiko Murata. Drive (ACTORS: Songs Connection, Vladlove) is the new animation studio, replacing Brains Base.    The rest of the main staff members return, including Shinzō Fujita as series script supervisor, Koji Yabuno as character designer, Ryo Kawasaki as music composer, and Takeshi Takadera as sound director.    The second season will premiere this fall.    The anime's first season premiered on NHK Educational in April 2021. The anime was originally slated to premiere in October 2020, but it was delayed to April 2021 due to the anime's production schedule being heavily affected by COVID-19.  Crunchyroll streamed the anime.    Kodansha Comics is publishing the manga in English, and it describes the story:  A new manga from the creator of the acclaimed A Silent Voice, featuring intimate, emotional drama and an epic story spanning time and space… A lonely boy wandering the Arctic regions of North America meets a wolf, and the two become fast friends, depending on each other to survive the harsh environment. But the boy has a history, and the wolf is more than meets the eye as well… To Your Eternity is a totally unique and moving manga about death, life, reincarnation, and the nature of love.  Crunchyroll is releasing the manga in English digitally, simultaneously with its Japanese release.    Ōima launched the manga in November 2016 in Weekly Shōnen Magazine. The manga's first arc ended in December 2019, and the second arc launched in January 2020. The manga won the Best Shōnen Manga award at the 43rd annual Kodansha Manga Awards in May 2019. The manga also ranked on the American Library Association's (ALA's) Young Adult Library Services Association's (YALSA) 2019 list of Great Graphic Novels for Teens.
