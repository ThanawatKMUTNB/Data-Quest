When Cantaloupe goes missing, melon factory employee Honeydew ducks out of their shift at Eglantine Industries to head to Hog Town, where melons are outlawed and corruption abounds. As Honeydew's search begins, an array of intertwining mysteries begin to unfold in the brand-new story-exploration game Melon Journey: Bittersweet Memories by indie developer Froach Club. Is the Cavity Crew a true threat? Is Kitten King the cause of all this? Honeydew will need to comb every inch of the green-tinted pixelated world, their every step accompanied by the beats of the jazzy lo-fi soundtrack, to save the day in this monochromatic mystery set for a 2022 launch.

Potionomics is targeting a Fall 2022 launch on Windows PC.

As Honeydew's search begins, an array of intertwining mysteries begin to unfold in the brand-new story-exploration game Melon Journey: Bittersweet Memories by indie developer Froach Club. Is the Cavity Crew a true threat? Is Kitten King the cause of all this? Honeydew will need to comb every inch of the green-tinted pixelated world, their every step accompanied by the beats of the jazzy lo-fi soundtrack, to save the day in this monochromatic mystery set for a 2022 launch.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   by The Anime News Network Editorial Team, Apr  1st 2022          Adblock+ breaks this page, consider whitelisting ANN   Welcome to Anime News Network's Spring 2022 Preview Guide! Here's how it goes: our team of critics write up their impressions instantly, to be posted here as they go along. Each critic will cover as many shows as they can handle, giving you alternate takes on most every show.    The guide is ongoing, organized by series and updated multiple times a day. Throughout the next week or two, we'll be updating as often as possible with new perspectives on new episodes from our team of critics. New reviews will be posted as soon as they're written, with each critic's name being added to the roster beneath the show's title. Check back a couple of times every day during the guide, and you're likely to see new shows pop up with multiple takes to enjoy!    Please remember that this is a preview guide. It is designed to give you a taste of the first episode of a show with a preliminary opinion and a few thoughts on whether or not the show has potential. These are not intended to be blanket judgments of these series as a whole. All reviews use the same ratings scale: 1-5, with 1 being the lowest.    Click on the survey at the top of each show's page to vote for your personal score and see how other people scored the show!   You can also check out this season's Trailer Watch Party with Lynzee Loveridge, Jacki Jing, and YouTube personality Geoff Thew (Mother's Basement) first impression of the season's shows.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   by The Anime News Network Editorial Team, Apr  1st 2022          Adblock+ breaks this page, consider whitelisting ANN   Welcome to Anime News Network's Spring 2022 Preview Guide! Here's how it goes: our team of critics write up their impressions instantly, to be posted here as they go along. Each critic will cover as many shows as they can handle, giving you alternate takes on most every show.    The guide is ongoing, organized by series and updated multiple times a day. Throughout the next week or two, we'll be updating as often as possible with new perspectives on new episodes from our team of critics. New reviews will be posted as soon as they're written, with each critic's name being added to the roster beneath the show's title. Check back a couple of times every day during the guide, and you're likely to see new shows pop up with multiple takes to enjoy!    Please remember that this is a preview guide. It is designed to give you a taste of the first episode of a show with a preliminary opinion and a few thoughts on whether or not the show has potential. These are not intended to be blanket judgments of these series as a whole. All reviews use the same ratings scale: 1-5, with 1 being the lowest.    Click on the survey at the top of each show's page to vote for your personal score and see how other people scored the show!   You can also check out this season's Trailer Watch Party with Lynzee Loveridge, Jacki Jing, and YouTube personality Geoff Thew (Mother's Basement) first impression of the season's shows.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Kotaro Lives Alone   Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Kotaro Lives Alone (ONA) ?                     Community score: 4.2              What is this?   The story centers on a 4-year-old boy named Kotarō Satо̄, who moves next door to Shin Karino, an unsuccessful manga artist. Kotarō has no parents and lives alone. Not only does he seem to earn a living, he actually seems more put together than his own strange neighbors.    Kotaro Lives Alone is based on Mami Tsumura's manga and streams on Netflix.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Because of my day job, I have a love-hate relationship with anime that feature young children. Write them well, and I'll gush over how the series really gets them; write them poorly or overly-precocious and it's difficult for me to suspend belief long enough to really get into the story. I'd heard good things about Kotaro Lives Alone, but I couldn't feel anything beyond the most cautious of optimism as I started up the first episode. I know four-year-olds, and it was hard to imagine a story where I could both believe a child is four and is capable of surviving on his own.    Somehow, miraculously, the first episode manages to strike that balance, painting a tragicomic picture of a young child who has been forced to grow up way too fast. Part of the reason it works is because of the way Kotaro wears certain affectations, such as copying the extremely formal and old-fashioned language from a samurai cartoon he likes, like a suit of armor as he imitates adult behavior. Moments like the brief shot of him reading a newspaper on the toilet – and Japanese newspapers have a lot of difficult kanji in them, at an age where a child is barely expected to read hiragana – with his little legs dangling speak volumes.    What Kotaro Lives Alone understands is that a four-year-old doesn't become this uncanny mix of adult and child from growing up in a healthy environment. Nothing has been explicitly stated so far, but there's a lot of little one-off lines that indicate that something in his former home life forced him to grow up way too early, and whatever happened, it was neither fun nor cute. There's a tragic undercurrent to every laugh, whether it's due to Kotaro or the hot messes that are the other adult tenants in his building, that keeps it from becoming cloying or too-sentimental. If anything, it's a bit too real of a reminder that children are denied their childhoods every day.       James Beckett  Rating:                I turned 30 this year, and the older I get, the happier I am to see domestic anime that focus on more “adult” issues. Despite the very peculiar and almost fantastical nature of its premise, Kotaro Lives Alone is right up my alley. Shin Karino is exactly the kind of protagonist that I'm interested in seeing more of these days: a real human person who deals with real everyday struggles. He's trying to rekindle his creative spark and salvage his career as a manga artist; he's got to deal with his colorful and bizarre neighbors; he even throws out his back just getting up from the table (it happens to the best of us, my man, don't sweat it). The only “weird” angle to Shin's life is that he's suddenly found himself involved in the day-to-day adventures of an incredibly precocious and eccentric four-year-old that apparently lives on his own.    This is the angle of the plot that I was unsure of, since unrealistically independent and intelligent tots are such a cliché for anime in general, but I like the way that Kotaro Lives Alone characterizes its titular tyke. The very childlike issues he goes through—figuring out how bathhouses work, successfully bandaging skinned knees, procuring a TV to watch his favorite cartoon—all contrast nicely with the jaded adults around him. Mizuki clearly has some drama in her personal life and work as a hostess, and even the outlandish Tamaru feels more grounded once you learn that he's having a hard time keeping his own family together. The jokey bits where Kotaro's “feudal lord” act clashes with his inherent immaturity could have come across as tacky or try-hard, but the show always manages to get the viewer to empathize with the boy's trials and tribulations as much as the grown-ups. Who among us hasn't also marched into a complete stranger's home just so they could tell you that you did a good job?    I only have one major complaint about Kotaro, but it's kind of a doozy: the show is pretty ugly. The art style is apparently going for this strange kind of abstraction that isn't quite Crayon Shin-chan, but all of the faces and bodies are just oddly proportioned and stretchy enough to look off-putting. It's a look that might appeal to some folks, but I just couldn't warm up to it no matter how hard I tried. Still, Kotaro Lives Alone was a very pleasant surprise, and if you can get past its rough presentation, you might come to love the kid just as much as his neighbors do.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Watching this episode, I couldn't decide whether I wanted to laugh or cry—and I suspect that's exactly what the creators were aiming for. After all, it's got a setup that is either inherently comedic or inherently tragic depending on the tone of the work. And let's be clear here, Kotaro Lives Alone works hard to walk the line right between them.    First, the comedic side of things. We have a four-year-old kid doing all the things a person living alone for the first time needs to do. 90% of the time, he does it just as well as any adult, which leads us to assume that this is his norm. The humor, therefore, comes from the unpredictable moments when he acts like the child he actually is, betraying our expectations in an obvious way. (This is exact same joke framework used for Stewie and Brian in Family Guy). It's an easy way to get a laugh, especially if you care for the character.    Then there's the tragic side of things. We have a kid, ostensibly with no parents, living alone in a rundown apartment building and surrounded by unscrupulous adults. Worse yet, he has a streetwise mindset that no child his age should have—such as knowing how to bring down the swelling from crying too much—which has some heartbreaking implications. Moreover, he clearly still wants to be loved: to have his hair washed by an adult and be praised for doing something on his own for the first time.    But the real hook of the show is that everyone in that apartment building is just as alone as Kotaro is. We have a manga artist who is struggling to live up to his breakout hit; a hostess who escapes her financially abusive boyfriend by getting drunk; and a low-level mobster who isn't allowed to meet his son anymore. Despite their circumstances, this group of broken people has a chance to become something by stepping up and becoming the family Kotaro so desperately needs. It's a show that plays with your emotions in the best way—and one I will most certainly be watching to the end.      Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                Is it weird to say the thing this premiere most reminded me of was Garfield fancomics? Not like, the body-horror ones that go viral on Twitter every once in a while, but the more grounded and dramatic ones that try to apply a sense of emotional realism to the static, archetypal characters of the eternal comic strip. Because the premise of this one – an eccentric kid named Kotaro Lives Alone in a low-rent apartment block and gets into low stakes adventures with his adult neighbors – feels like something you could find running for 20 years in a newspaper comic. That is, until it starts slipping in darker punchlines with much more serious implications.    It's an odd balance to strike, and not one this first episode totally manages to keep. There are long stretches of this episode that are just a couple of jokes being repeated and iterated upon without much escalation or change. Likewise, the initial shock of the implications about Kotaro's life before he wound up a Pre-K lease-holder wears off fairly quickly, and once those hints keep piling up it becomes decidedly harder to chuckle at him strutting around town with his plastic samurai sword. There's definitely a version of this setup that can work – be great even – but as of this premiere it doesn't feel like they've figured out the right formula.    Like sure, there are a handful of moments that are funny, or charming, or bittersweet, but they stand as isolated incidents that don't coalesce quite right. And since they don't properly gel, it winds up feeling like each fraction of what this show's going for is struggling for attention. Are you enjoying this silly segment of Kotaro being pestered by a bird? Well that's over so we can have him learn about his neighbor's failed marriage and struggle for visitation rights with his young son. Are you feeling compelled by Kotaro slowly letting his neighbor in, and perhaps accidentally admitting to his own loneliness? Try to hold onto that feeling while he and Kotaro walk around the supermarket and the guy freaks out over the thought of having an unknown baby of his own.    The upside is the entire series is already up on Netflix, so it's not much of a wait to see if things start to mesh better moving forward. And there is something genuinely engaging to this material – if nothing else Kotaro's striking eyes and bizarre speech patterns kept my attention through the entire first episode. So hopefully this can congeal into the best form of itself, because there's definitely potential here.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          3 comments       Jujutsu Kaisen Stage Play's Video Introduces Cast in Costume   Apr 15, 07:02 3 comments                 live-action    Ryūji Satō, Ryosuke Miura star in July-August play ― A press conference for the stage play of Gege Akutami's Jujutsu Kaisen manga introduced the production's promotional video, main cast, and other details on Wednesday.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Kotaro Lives Alone   Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Kotaro Lives Alone (ONA) ?                     Community score: 4.2              What is this?   The story centers on a 4-year-old boy named Kotarō Satо̄, who moves next door to Shin Karino, an unsuccessful manga artist. Kotarō has no parents and lives alone. Not only does he seem to earn a living, he actually seems more put together than his own strange neighbors.    Kotaro Lives Alone is based on Mami Tsumura's manga and streams on Netflix.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Because of my day job, I have a love-hate relationship with anime that feature young children. Write them well, and I'll gush over how the series really gets them; write them poorly or overly-precocious and it's difficult for me to suspend belief long enough to really get into the story. I'd heard good things about Kotaro Lives Alone, but I couldn't feel anything beyond the most cautious of optimism as I started up the first episode. I know four-year-olds, and it was hard to imagine a story where I could both believe a child is four and is capable of surviving on his own.    Somehow, miraculously, the first episode manages to strike that balance, painting a tragicomic picture of a young child who has been forced to grow up way too fast. Part of the reason it works is because of the way Kotaro wears certain affectations, such as copying the extremely formal and old-fashioned language from a samurai cartoon he likes, like a suit of armor as he imitates adult behavior. Moments like the brief shot of him reading a newspaper on the toilet – and Japanese newspapers have a lot of difficult kanji in them, at an age where a child is barely expected to read hiragana – with his little legs dangling speak volumes.    What Kotaro Lives Alone understands is that a four-year-old doesn't become this uncanny mix of adult and child from growing up in a healthy environment. Nothing has been explicitly stated so far, but there's a lot of little one-off lines that indicate that something in his former home life forced him to grow up way too early, and whatever happened, it was neither fun nor cute. There's a tragic undercurrent to every laugh, whether it's due to Kotaro or the hot messes that are the other adult tenants in his building, that keeps it from becoming cloying or too-sentimental. If anything, it's a bit too real of a reminder that children are denied their childhoods every day.       James Beckett  Rating:                I turned 30 this year, and the older I get, the happier I am to see domestic anime that focus on more “adult” issues. Despite the very peculiar and almost fantastical nature of its premise, Kotaro Lives Alone is right up my alley. Shin Karino is exactly the kind of protagonist that I'm interested in seeing more of these days: a real human person who deals with real everyday struggles. He's trying to rekindle his creative spark and salvage his career as a manga artist; he's got to deal with his colorful and bizarre neighbors; he even throws out his back just getting up from the table (it happens to the best of us, my man, don't sweat it). The only “weird” angle to Shin's life is that he's suddenly found himself involved in the day-to-day adventures of an incredibly precocious and eccentric four-year-old that apparently lives on his own.    This is the angle of the plot that I was unsure of, since unrealistically independent and intelligent tots are such a cliché for anime in general, but I like the way that Kotaro Lives Alone characterizes its titular tyke. The very childlike issues he goes through—figuring out how bathhouses work, successfully bandaging skinned knees, procuring a TV to watch his favorite cartoon—all contrast nicely with the jaded adults around him. Mizuki clearly has some drama in her personal life and work as a hostess, and even the outlandish Tamaru feels more grounded once you learn that he's having a hard time keeping his own family together. The jokey bits where Kotaro's “feudal lord” act clashes with his inherent immaturity could have come across as tacky or try-hard, but the show always manages to get the viewer to empathize with the boy's trials and tribulations as much as the grown-ups. Who among us hasn't also marched into a complete stranger's home just so they could tell you that you did a good job?    I only have one major complaint about Kotaro, but it's kind of a doozy: the show is pretty ugly. The art style is apparently going for this strange kind of abstraction that isn't quite Crayon Shin-chan, but all of the faces and bodies are just oddly proportioned and stretchy enough to look off-putting. It's a look that might appeal to some folks, but I just couldn't warm up to it no matter how hard I tried. Still, Kotaro Lives Alone was a very pleasant surprise, and if you can get past its rough presentation, you might come to love the kid just as much as his neighbors do.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Watching this episode, I couldn't decide whether I wanted to laugh or cry—and I suspect that's exactly what the creators were aiming for. After all, it's got a setup that is either inherently comedic or inherently tragic depending on the tone of the work. And let's be clear here, Kotaro Lives Alone works hard to walk the line right between them.    First, the comedic side of things. We have a four-year-old kid doing all the things a person living alone for the first time needs to do. 90% of the time, he does it just as well as any adult, which leads us to assume that this is his norm. The humor, therefore, comes from the unpredictable moments when he acts like the child he actually is, betraying our expectations in an obvious way. (This is exact same joke framework used for Stewie and Brian in Family Guy). It's an easy way to get a laugh, especially if you care for the character.    Then there's the tragic side of things. We have a kid, ostensibly with no parents, living alone in a rundown apartment building and surrounded by unscrupulous adults. Worse yet, he has a streetwise mindset that no child his age should have—such as knowing how to bring down the swelling from crying too much—which has some heartbreaking implications. Moreover, he clearly still wants to be loved: to have his hair washed by an adult and be praised for doing something on his own for the first time.    But the real hook of the show is that everyone in that apartment building is just as alone as Kotaro is. We have a manga artist who is struggling to live up to his breakout hit; a hostess who escapes her financially abusive boyfriend by getting drunk; and a low-level mobster who isn't allowed to meet his son anymore. Despite their circumstances, this group of broken people has a chance to become something by stepping up and becoming the family Kotaro so desperately needs. It's a show that plays with your emotions in the best way—and one I will most certainly be watching to the end.      Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                Is it weird to say the thing this premiere most reminded me of was Garfield fancomics? Not like, the body-horror ones that go viral on Twitter every once in a while, but the more grounded and dramatic ones that try to apply a sense of emotional realism to the static, archetypal characters of the eternal comic strip. Because the premise of this one – an eccentric kid named Kotaro Lives Alone in a low-rent apartment block and gets into low stakes adventures with his adult neighbors – feels like something you could find running for 20 years in a newspaper comic. That is, until it starts slipping in darker punchlines with much more serious implications.    It's an odd balance to strike, and not one this first episode totally manages to keep. There are long stretches of this episode that are just a couple of jokes being repeated and iterated upon without much escalation or change. Likewise, the initial shock of the implications about Kotaro's life before he wound up a Pre-K lease-holder wears off fairly quickly, and once those hints keep piling up it becomes decidedly harder to chuckle at him strutting around town with his plastic samurai sword. There's definitely a version of this setup that can work – be great even – but as of this premiere it doesn't feel like they've figured out the right formula.    Like sure, there are a handful of moments that are funny, or charming, or bittersweet, but they stand as isolated incidents that don't coalesce quite right. And since they don't properly gel, it winds up feeling like each fraction of what this show's going for is struggling for attention. Are you enjoying this silly segment of Kotaro being pestered by a bird? Well that's over so we can have him learn about his neighbor's failed marriage and struggle for visitation rights with his young son. Are you feeling compelled by Kotaro slowly letting his neighbor in, and perhaps accidentally admitting to his own loneliness? Try to hold onto that feeling while he and Kotaro walk around the supermarket and the guy freaks out over the thought of having an unknown baby of his own.    The upside is the entire series is already up on Netflix, so it's not much of a wait to see if things start to mesh better moving forward. And there is something genuinely engaging to this material – if nothing else Kotaro's striking eyes and bizarre speech patterns kept my attention through the entire first episode. So hopefully this can congeal into the best form of itself, because there's definitely potential here.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          3 comments       Jujutsu Kaisen Stage Play's Video Introduces Cast in Costume   Apr 15, 07:02 3 comments                 live-action    Ryūji Satō, Ryosuke Miura star in July-August play ― A press conference for the stage play of Gege Akutami's Jujutsu Kaisen manga introduced the production's promotional video, main cast, and other details on Wednesday.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Kotaro Lives Alone   Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Kotaro Lives Alone (ONA) ?                     Community score: 4.2              What is this?   The story centers on a 4-year-old boy named Kotarō Satо̄, who moves next door to Shin Karino, an unsuccessful manga artist. Kotarō has no parents and lives alone. Not only does he seem to earn a living, he actually seems more put together than his own strange neighbors.    Kotaro Lives Alone is based on Mami Tsumura's manga and streams on Netflix.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Because of my day job, I have a love-hate relationship with anime that feature young children. Write them well, and I'll gush over how the series really gets them; write them poorly or overly-precocious and it's difficult for me to suspend belief long enough to really get into the story. I'd heard good things about Kotaro Lives Alone, but I couldn't feel anything beyond the most cautious of optimism as I started up the first episode. I know four-year-olds, and it was hard to imagine a story where I could both believe a child is four and is capable of surviving on his own.    Somehow, miraculously, the first episode manages to strike that balance, painting a tragicomic picture of a young child who has been forced to grow up way too fast. Part of the reason it works is because of the way Kotaro wears certain affectations, such as copying the extremely formal and old-fashioned language from a samurai cartoon he likes, like a suit of armor as he imitates adult behavior. Moments like the brief shot of him reading a newspaper on the toilet – and Japanese newspapers have a lot of difficult kanji in them, at an age where a child is barely expected to read hiragana – with his little legs dangling speak volumes.    What Kotaro Lives Alone understands is that a four-year-old doesn't become this uncanny mix of adult and child from growing up in a healthy environment. Nothing has been explicitly stated so far, but there's a lot of little one-off lines that indicate that something in his former home life forced him to grow up way too early, and whatever happened, it was neither fun nor cute. There's a tragic undercurrent to every laugh, whether it's due to Kotaro or the hot messes that are the other adult tenants in his building, that keeps it from becoming cloying or too-sentimental. If anything, it's a bit too real of a reminder that children are denied their childhoods every day.       James Beckett  Rating:                I turned 30 this year, and the older I get, the happier I am to see domestic anime that focus on more “adult” issues. Despite the very peculiar and almost fantastical nature of its premise, Kotaro Lives Alone is right up my alley. Shin Karino is exactly the kind of protagonist that I'm interested in seeing more of these days: a real human person who deals with real everyday struggles. He's trying to rekindle his creative spark and salvage his career as a manga artist; he's got to deal with his colorful and bizarre neighbors; he even throws out his back just getting up from the table (it happens to the best of us, my man, don't sweat it). The only “weird” angle to Shin's life is that he's suddenly found himself involved in the day-to-day adventures of an incredibly precocious and eccentric four-year-old that apparently lives on his own.    This is the angle of the plot that I was unsure of, since unrealistically independent and intelligent tots are such a cliché for anime in general, but I like the way that Kotaro Lives Alone characterizes its titular tyke. The very childlike issues he goes through—figuring out how bathhouses work, successfully bandaging skinned knees, procuring a TV to watch his favorite cartoon—all contrast nicely with the jaded adults around him. Mizuki clearly has some drama in her personal life and work as a hostess, and even the outlandish Tamaru feels more grounded once you learn that he's having a hard time keeping his own family together. The jokey bits where Kotaro's “feudal lord” act clashes with his inherent immaturity could have come across as tacky or try-hard, but the show always manages to get the viewer to empathize with the boy's trials and tribulations as much as the grown-ups. Who among us hasn't also marched into a complete stranger's home just so they could tell you that you did a good job?    I only have one major complaint about Kotaro, but it's kind of a doozy: the show is pretty ugly. The art style is apparently going for this strange kind of abstraction that isn't quite Crayon Shin-chan, but all of the faces and bodies are just oddly proportioned and stretchy enough to look off-putting. It's a look that might appeal to some folks, but I just couldn't warm up to it no matter how hard I tried. Still, Kotaro Lives Alone was a very pleasant surprise, and if you can get past its rough presentation, you might come to love the kid just as much as his neighbors do.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Watching this episode, I couldn't decide whether I wanted to laugh or cry—and I suspect that's exactly what the creators were aiming for. After all, it's got a setup that is either inherently comedic or inherently tragic depending on the tone of the work. And let's be clear here, Kotaro Lives Alone works hard to walk the line right between them.    First, the comedic side of things. We have a four-year-old kid doing all the things a person living alone for the first time needs to do. 90% of the time, he does it just as well as any adult, which leads us to assume that this is his norm. The humor, therefore, comes from the unpredictable moments when he acts like the child he actually is, betraying our expectations in an obvious way. (This is exact same joke framework used for Stewie and Brian in Family Guy). It's an easy way to get a laugh, especially if you care for the character.    Then there's the tragic side of things. We have a kid, ostensibly with no parents, living alone in a rundown apartment building and surrounded by unscrupulous adults. Worse yet, he has a streetwise mindset that no child his age should have—such as knowing how to bring down the swelling from crying too much—which has some heartbreaking implications. Moreover, he clearly still wants to be loved: to have his hair washed by an adult and be praised for doing something on his own for the first time.    But the real hook of the show is that everyone in that apartment building is just as alone as Kotaro is. We have a manga artist who is struggling to live up to his breakout hit; a hostess who escapes her financially abusive boyfriend by getting drunk; and a low-level mobster who isn't allowed to meet his son anymore. Despite their circumstances, this group of broken people has a chance to become something by stepping up and becoming the family Kotaro so desperately needs. It's a show that plays with your emotions in the best way—and one I will most certainly be watching to the end.      Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                Is it weird to say the thing this premiere most reminded me of was Garfield fancomics? Not like, the body-horror ones that go viral on Twitter every once in a while, but the more grounded and dramatic ones that try to apply a sense of emotional realism to the static, archetypal characters of the eternal comic strip. Because the premise of this one – an eccentric kid named Kotaro Lives Alone in a low-rent apartment block and gets into low stakes adventures with his adult neighbors – feels like something you could find running for 20 years in a newspaper comic. That is, until it starts slipping in darker punchlines with much more serious implications.    It's an odd balance to strike, and not one this first episode totally manages to keep. There are long stretches of this episode that are just a couple of jokes being repeated and iterated upon without much escalation or change. Likewise, the initial shock of the implications about Kotaro's life before he wound up a Pre-K lease-holder wears off fairly quickly, and once those hints keep piling up it becomes decidedly harder to chuckle at him strutting around town with his plastic samurai sword. There's definitely a version of this setup that can work – be great even – but as of this premiere it doesn't feel like they've figured out the right formula.    Like sure, there are a handful of moments that are funny, or charming, or bittersweet, but they stand as isolated incidents that don't coalesce quite right. And since they don't properly gel, it winds up feeling like each fraction of what this show's going for is struggling for attention. Are you enjoying this silly segment of Kotaro being pestered by a bird? Well that's over so we can have him learn about his neighbor's failed marriage and struggle for visitation rights with his young son. Are you feeling compelled by Kotaro slowly letting his neighbor in, and perhaps accidentally admitting to his own loneliness? Try to hold onto that feeling while he and Kotaro walk around the supermarket and the guy freaks out over the thought of having an unknown baby of his own.    The upside is the entire series is already up on Netflix, so it's not much of a wait to see if things start to mesh better moving forward. And there is something genuinely engaging to this material – if nothing else Kotaro's striking eyes and bizarre speech patterns kept my attention through the entire first episode. So hopefully this can congeal into the best form of itself, because there's definitely potential here.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          3 comments       Jujutsu Kaisen Stage Play's Video Introduces Cast in Costume   Apr 15, 07:02 3 comments                 live-action    Ryūji Satō, Ryosuke Miura star in July-August play ― A press conference for the stage play of Gege Akutami's Jujutsu Kaisen manga introduced the production's promotional video, main cast, and other details on Wednesday.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Kotaro Lives Alone   Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Kotaro Lives Alone (ONA) ?                     Community score: 4.2              What is this?   The story centers on a 4-year-old boy named Kotarō Satо̄, who moves next door to Shin Karino, an unsuccessful manga artist. Kotarō has no parents and lives alone. Not only does he seem to earn a living, he actually seems more put together than his own strange neighbors.    Kotaro Lives Alone is based on Mami Tsumura's manga and streams on Netflix.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Because of my day job, I have a love-hate relationship with anime that feature young children. Write them well, and I'll gush over how the series really gets them; write them poorly or overly-precocious and it's difficult for me to suspend belief long enough to really get into the story. I'd heard good things about Kotaro Lives Alone, but I couldn't feel anything beyond the most cautious of optimism as I started up the first episode. I know four-year-olds, and it was hard to imagine a story where I could both believe a child is four and is capable of surviving on his own.    Somehow, miraculously, the first episode manages to strike that balance, painting a tragicomic picture of a young child who has been forced to grow up way too fast. Part of the reason it works is because of the way Kotaro wears certain affectations, such as copying the extremely formal and old-fashioned language from a samurai cartoon he likes, like a suit of armor as he imitates adult behavior. Moments like the brief shot of him reading a newspaper on the toilet – and Japanese newspapers have a lot of difficult kanji in them, at an age where a child is barely expected to read hiragana – with his little legs dangling speak volumes.    What Kotaro Lives Alone understands is that a four-year-old doesn't become this uncanny mix of adult and child from growing up in a healthy environment. Nothing has been explicitly stated so far, but there's a lot of little one-off lines that indicate that something in his former home life forced him to grow up way too early, and whatever happened, it was neither fun nor cute. There's a tragic undercurrent to every laugh, whether it's due to Kotaro or the hot messes that are the other adult tenants in his building, that keeps it from becoming cloying or too-sentimental. If anything, it's a bit too real of a reminder that children are denied their childhoods every day.       James Beckett  Rating:                I turned 30 this year, and the older I get, the happier I am to see domestic anime that focus on more “adult” issues. Despite the very peculiar and almost fantastical nature of its premise, Kotaro Lives Alone is right up my alley. Shin Karino is exactly the kind of protagonist that I'm interested in seeing more of these days: a real human person who deals with real everyday struggles. He's trying to rekindle his creative spark and salvage his career as a manga artist; he's got to deal with his colorful and bizarre neighbors; he even throws out his back just getting up from the table (it happens to the best of us, my man, don't sweat it). The only “weird” angle to Shin's life is that he's suddenly found himself involved in the day-to-day adventures of an incredibly precocious and eccentric four-year-old that apparently lives on his own.    This is the angle of the plot that I was unsure of, since unrealistically independent and intelligent tots are such a cliché for anime in general, but I like the way that Kotaro Lives Alone characterizes its titular tyke. The very childlike issues he goes through—figuring out how bathhouses work, successfully bandaging skinned knees, procuring a TV to watch his favorite cartoon—all contrast nicely with the jaded adults around him. Mizuki clearly has some drama in her personal life and work as a hostess, and even the outlandish Tamaru feels more grounded once you learn that he's having a hard time keeping his own family together. The jokey bits where Kotaro's “feudal lord” act clashes with his inherent immaturity could have come across as tacky or try-hard, but the show always manages to get the viewer to empathize with the boy's trials and tribulations as much as the grown-ups. Who among us hasn't also marched into a complete stranger's home just so they could tell you that you did a good job?    I only have one major complaint about Kotaro, but it's kind of a doozy: the show is pretty ugly. The art style is apparently going for this strange kind of abstraction that isn't quite Crayon Shin-chan, but all of the faces and bodies are just oddly proportioned and stretchy enough to look off-putting. It's a look that might appeal to some folks, but I just couldn't warm up to it no matter how hard I tried. Still, Kotaro Lives Alone was a very pleasant surprise, and if you can get past its rough presentation, you might come to love the kid just as much as his neighbors do.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Watching this episode, I couldn't decide whether I wanted to laugh or cry—and I suspect that's exactly what the creators were aiming for. After all, it's got a setup that is either inherently comedic or inherently tragic depending on the tone of the work. And let's be clear here, Kotaro Lives Alone works hard to walk the line right between them.    First, the comedic side of things. We have a four-year-old kid doing all the things a person living alone for the first time needs to do. 90% of the time, he does it just as well as any adult, which leads us to assume that this is his norm. The humor, therefore, comes from the unpredictable moments when he acts like the child he actually is, betraying our expectations in an obvious way. (This is exact same joke framework used for Stewie and Brian in Family Guy). It's an easy way to get a laugh, especially if you care for the character.    Then there's the tragic side of things. We have a kid, ostensibly with no parents, living alone in a rundown apartment building and surrounded by unscrupulous adults. Worse yet, he has a streetwise mindset that no child his age should have—such as knowing how to bring down the swelling from crying too much—which has some heartbreaking implications. Moreover, he clearly still wants to be loved: to have his hair washed by an adult and be praised for doing something on his own for the first time.    But the real hook of the show is that everyone in that apartment building is just as alone as Kotaro is. We have a manga artist who is struggling to live up to his breakout hit; a hostess who escapes her financially abusive boyfriend by getting drunk; and a low-level mobster who isn't allowed to meet his son anymore. Despite their circumstances, this group of broken people has a chance to become something by stepping up and becoming the family Kotaro so desperately needs. It's a show that plays with your emotions in the best way—and one I will most certainly be watching to the end.      Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                Is it weird to say the thing this premiere most reminded me of was Garfield fancomics? Not like, the body-horror ones that go viral on Twitter every once in a while, but the more grounded and dramatic ones that try to apply a sense of emotional realism to the static, archetypal characters of the eternal comic strip. Because the premise of this one – an eccentric kid named Kotaro Lives Alone in a low-rent apartment block and gets into low stakes adventures with his adult neighbors – feels like something you could find running for 20 years in a newspaper comic. That is, until it starts slipping in darker punchlines with much more serious implications.    It's an odd balance to strike, and not one this first episode totally manages to keep. There are long stretches of this episode that are just a couple of jokes being repeated and iterated upon without much escalation or change.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Kotaro Lives Alone   Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Kotaro Lives Alone (ONA) ?                     Community score: 4.2              What is this?   The story centers on a 4-year-old boy named Kotarō Satо̄, who moves next door to Shin Karino, an unsuccessful manga artist. Kotarō has no parents and lives alone. Not only does he seem to earn a living, he actually seems more put together than his own strange neighbors.    Kotaro Lives Alone is based on Mami Tsumura's manga and streams on Netflix.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Because of my day job, I have a love-hate relationship with anime that feature young children. Write them well, and I'll gush over how the series really gets them; write them poorly or overly-precocious and it's difficult for me to suspend belief long enough to really get into the story. I'd heard good things about Kotaro Lives Alone, but I couldn't feel anything beyond the most cautious of optimism as I started up the first episode. I know four-year-olds, and it was hard to imagine a story where I could both believe a child is four and is capable of surviving on his own.    Somehow, miraculously, the first episode manages to strike that balance, painting a tragicomic picture of a young child who has been forced to grow up way too fast. Part of the reason it works is because of the way Kotaro wears certain affectations, such as copying the extremely formal and old-fashioned language from a samurai cartoon he likes, like a suit of armor as he imitates adult behavior. Moments like the brief shot of him reading a newspaper on the toilet – and Japanese newspapers have a lot of difficult kanji in them, at an age where a child is barely expected to read hiragana – with his little legs dangling speak volumes.    What Kotaro Lives Alone understands is that a four-year-old doesn't become this uncanny mix of adult and child from growing up in a healthy environment. Nothing has been explicitly stated so far, but there's a lot of little one-off lines that indicate that something in his former home life forced him to grow up way too early, and whatever happened, it was neither fun nor cute. There's a tragic undercurrent to every laugh, whether it's due to Kotaro or the hot messes that are the other adult tenants in his building, that keeps it from becoming cloying or too-sentimental. If anything, it's a bit too real of a reminder that children are denied their childhoods every day.       James Beckett  Rating:                I turned 30 this year, and the older I get, the happier I am to see domestic anime that focus on more “adult” issues. Despite the very peculiar and almost fantastical nature of its premise, Kotaro Lives Alone is right up my alley. Shin Karino is exactly the kind of protagonist that I'm interested in seeing more of these days: a real human person who deals with real everyday struggles. He's trying to rekindle his creative spark and salvage his career as a manga artist; he's got to deal with his colorful and bizarre neighbors; he even throws out his back just getting up from the table (it happens to the best of us, my man, don't sweat it). The only “weird” angle to Shin's life is that he's suddenly found himself involved in the day-to-day adventures of an incredibly precocious and eccentric four-year-old that apparently lives on his own.    This is the angle of the plot that I was unsure of, since unrealistically independent and intelligent tots are such a cliché for anime in general, but I like the way that Kotaro Lives Alone characterizes its titular tyke. The very childlike issues he goes through—figuring out how bathhouses work, successfully bandaging skinned knees, procuring a TV to watch his favorite cartoon—all contrast nicely with the jaded adults around him. Mizuki clearly has some drama in her personal life and work as a hostess, and even the outlandish Tamaru feels more grounded once you learn that he's having a hard time keeping his own family together. The jokey bits where Kotaro's “feudal lord” act clashes with his inherent immaturity could have come across as tacky or try-hard, but the show always manages to get the viewer to empathize with the boy's trials and tribulations as much as the grown-ups. Who among us hasn't also marched into a complete stranger's home just so they could tell you that you did a good job?    I only have one major complaint about Kotaro, but it's kind of a doozy: the show is pretty ugly. The art style is apparently going for this strange kind of abstraction that isn't quite Crayon Shin-chan, but all of the faces and bodies are just oddly proportioned and stretchy enough to look off-putting. It's a look that might appeal to some folks, but I just couldn't warm up to it no matter how hard I tried. Still, Kotaro Lives Alone was a very pleasant surprise, and if you can get past its rough presentation, you might come to love the kid just as much as his neighbors do.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Watching this episode, I couldn't decide whether I wanted to laugh or cry—and I suspect that's exactly what the creators were aiming for. After all, it's got a setup that is either inherently comedic or inherently tragic depending on the tone of the work. And let's be clear here, Kotaro Lives Alone works hard to walk the line right between them.    First, the comedic side of things. We have a four-year-old kid doing all the things a person living alone for the first time needs to do. 90% of the time, he does it just as well as any adult, which leads us to assume that this is his norm. The humor, therefore, comes from the unpredictable moments when he acts like the child he actually is, betraying our expectations in an obvious way. (This is exact same joke framework used for Stewie and Brian in Family Guy). It's an easy way to get a laugh, especially if you care for the character.    Then there's the tragic side of things. We have a kid, ostensibly with no parents, living alone in a rundown apartment building and surrounded by unscrupulous adults. Worse yet, he has a streetwise mindset that no child his age should have—such as knowing how to bring down the swelling from crying too much—which has some heartbreaking implications. Moreover, he clearly still wants to be loved: to have his hair washed by an adult and be praised for doing something on his own for the first time.    But the real hook of the show is that everyone in that apartment building is just as alone as Kotaro is. We have a manga artist who is struggling to live up to his breakout hit; a hostess who escapes her financially abusive boyfriend by getting drunk; and a low-level mobster who isn't allowed to meet his son anymore. Despite their circumstances, this group of broken people has a chance to become something by stepping up and becoming the family Kotaro so desperately needs. It's a show that plays with your emotions in the best way—and one I will most certainly be watching to the end.      Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                Is it weird to say the thing this premiere most reminded me of was Garfield fancomics? Not like, the body-horror ones that go viral on Twitter every once in a while, but the more grounded and dramatic ones that try to apply a sense of emotional realism to the static, archetypal characters of the eternal comic strip. Because the premise of this one – an eccentric kid named Kotaro Lives Alone in a low-rent apartment block and gets into low stakes adventures with his adult neighbors – feels like something you could find running for 20 years in a newspaper comic. That is, until it starts slipping in darker punchlines with much more serious implications.    It's an odd balance to strike, and not one this first episode totally manages to keep. There are long stretches of this episode that are just a couple of jokes being repeated and iterated upon without much escalation or change. Likewise, the initial shock of the implications about Kotaro's life before he wound up a Pre-K lease-holder wears off fairly quickly, and once those hints keep piling up it becomes decidedly harder to chuckle at him strutting around town with his plastic samurai sword. There's definitely a version of this setup that can work – be great even – but as of this premiere it doesn't feel like they've figured out the right formula.    Like sure, there are a handful of moments that are funny, or charming, or bittersweet, but they stand as isolated incidents that don't coalesce quite right. And since they don't properly gel, it winds up feeling like each fraction of what this show's going for is struggling for attention. Are you enjoying this silly segment of Kotaro being pestered by a bird? Well that's over so we can have him learn about his neighbor's failed marriage and struggle for visitation rights with his young son. Are you feeling compelled by Kotaro slowly letting his neighbor in, and perhaps accidentally admitting to his own loneliness? Try to hold onto that feeling while he and Kotaro walk around the supermarket and the guy freaks out over the thought of having an unknown baby of his own.    The upside is the entire series is already up on Netflix, so it's not much of a wait to see if things start to mesh better moving forward. And there is something genuinely engaging to this material – if nothing else Kotaro's striking eyes and bizarre speech patterns kept my attention through the entire first episode. So hopefully this can congeal into the best form of itself, because there's definitely potential here.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

There are long stretches of this episode that are just a couple of jokes being repeated and iterated upon without much escalation or change. Likewise, the initial shock of the implications about Kotaro's life before he wound up a Pre-K lease-holder wears off fairly quickly, and once those hints keep piling up it becomes decidedly harder to chuckle at him strutting around town with his plastic samurai sword. There's definitely a version of this setup that can work – be great even – but as of this premiere it doesn't feel like they've figured out the right formula.    Like sure, there are a handful of moments that are funny, or charming, or bittersweet, but they stand as isolated incidents that don't coalesce quite right. And since they don't properly gel, it winds up feeling like each fraction of what this show's going for is struggling for attention. Are you enjoying this silly segment of Kotaro being pestered by a bird? Well that's over so we can have him learn about his neighbor's failed marriage and struggle for visitation rights with his young son. Are you feeling compelled by Kotaro slowly letting his neighbor in, and perhaps accidentally admitting to his own loneliness? Try to hold onto that feeling while he and Kotaro walk around the supermarket and the guy freaks out over the thought of having an unknown baby of his own.    The upside is the entire series is already up on Netflix, so it's not much of a wait to see if things start to mesh better moving forward. And there is something genuinely engaging to this material – if nothing else Kotaro's striking eyes and bizarre speech patterns kept my attention through the entire first episode. So hopefully this can congeal into the best form of itself, because there's definitely potential here.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 4.2              What is this?   The story centers on a 4-year-old boy named Kotarō Satо̄, who moves next door to Shin Karino, an unsuccessful manga artist. Kotarō has no parents and lives alone. Not only does he seem to earn a living, he actually seems more put together than his own strange neighbors.    Kotaro Lives Alone is based on Mami Tsumura's manga and streams on Netflix.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Because of my day job, I have a love-hate relationship with anime that feature young children. Write them well, and I'll gush over how the series really gets them; write them poorly or overly-precocious and it's difficult for me to suspend belief long enough to really get into the story. I'd heard good things about Kotaro Lives Alone, but I couldn't feel anything beyond the most cautious of optimism as I started up the first episode. I know four-year-olds, and it was hard to imagine a story where I could both believe a child is four and is capable of surviving on his own.    Somehow, miraculously, the first episode manages to strike that balance, painting a tragicomic picture of a young child who has been forced to grow up way too fast. Part of the reason it works is because of the way Kotaro wears certain affectations, such as copying the extremely formal and old-fashioned language from a samurai cartoon he likes, like a suit of armor as he imitates adult behavior. Moments like the brief shot of him reading a newspaper on the toilet – and Japanese newspapers have a lot of difficult kanji in them, at an age where a child is barely expected to read hiragana – with his little legs dangling speak volumes.    What Kotaro Lives Alone understands is that a four-year-old doesn't become this uncanny mix of adult and child from growing up in a healthy environment. Nothing has been explicitly stated so far, but there's a lot of little one-off lines that indicate that something in his former home life forced him to grow up way too early, and whatever happened, it was neither fun nor cute. There's a tragic undercurrent to every laugh, whether it's due to Kotaro or the hot messes that are the other adult tenants in his building, that keeps it from becoming cloying or too-sentimental. If anything, it's a bit too real of a reminder that children are denied their childhoods every day.       James Beckett  Rating:                I turned 30 this year, and the older I get, the happier I am to see domestic anime that focus on more “adult” issues. Despite the very peculiar and almost fantastical nature of its premise, Kotaro Lives Alone is right up my alley. Shin Karino is exactly the kind of protagonist that I'm interested in seeing more of these days: a real human person who deals with real everyday struggles. He's trying to rekindle his creative spark and salvage his career as a manga artist; he's got to deal with his colorful and bizarre neighbors; he even throws out his back just getting up from the table (it happens to the best of us, my man, don't sweat it). The only “weird” angle to Shin's life is that he's suddenly found himself involved in the day-to-day adventures of an incredibly precocious and eccentric four-year-old that apparently lives on his own.    This is the angle of the plot that I was unsure of, since unrealistically independent and intelligent tots are such a cliché for anime in general, but I like the way that Kotaro Lives Alone characterizes its titular tyke. The very childlike issues he goes through—figuring out how bathhouses work, successfully bandaging skinned knees, procuring a TV to watch his favorite cartoon—all contrast nicely with the jaded adults around him. Mizuki clearly has some drama in her personal life and work as a hostess, and even the outlandish Tamaru feels more grounded once you learn that he's having a hard time keeping his own family together. The jokey bits where Kotaro's “feudal lord” act clashes with his inherent immaturity could have come across as tacky or try-hard, but the show always manages to get the viewer to empathize with the boy's trials and tribulations as much as the grown-ups. Who among us hasn't also marched into a complete stranger's home just so they could tell you that you did a good job?    I only have one major complaint about Kotaro, but it's kind of a doozy: the show is pretty ugly. The art style is apparently going for this strange kind of abstraction that isn't quite Crayon Shin-chan, but all of the faces and bodies are just oddly proportioned and stretchy enough to look off-putting. It's a look that might appeal to some folks, but I just couldn't warm up to it no matter how hard I tried. Still, Kotaro Lives Alone was a very pleasant surprise, and if you can get past its rough presentation, you might come to love the kid just as much as his neighbors do.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Watching this episode, I couldn't decide whether I wanted to laugh or cry—and I suspect that's exactly what the creators were aiming for. After all, it's got a setup that is either inherently comedic or inherently tragic depending on the tone of the work. And let's be clear here, Kotaro Lives Alone works hard to walk the line right between them.    First, the comedic side of things. We have a four-year-old kid doing all the things a person living alone for the first time needs to do. 90% of the time, he does it just as well as any adult, which leads us to assume that this is his norm. The humor, therefore, comes from the unpredictable moments when he acts like the child he actually is, betraying our expectations in an obvious way. (This is exact same joke framework used for Stewie and Brian in Family Guy). It's an easy way to get a laugh, especially if you care for the character.    Then there's the tragic side of things. We have a kid, ostensibly with no parents, living alone in a rundown apartment building and surrounded by unscrupulous adults. Worse yet, he has a streetwise mindset that no child his age should have—such as knowing how to bring down the swelling from crying too much—which has some heartbreaking implications. Moreover, he clearly still wants to be loved: to have his hair washed by an adult and be praised for doing something on his own for the first time.    But the real hook of the show is that everyone in that apartment building is just as alone as Kotaro is. We have a manga artist who is struggling to live up to his breakout hit; a hostess who escapes her financially abusive boyfriend by getting drunk; and a low-level mobster who isn't allowed to meet his son anymore. Despite their circumstances, this group of broken people has a chance to become something by stepping up and becoming the family Kotaro so desperately needs. It's a show that plays with your emotions in the best way—and one I will most certainly be watching to the end.      Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                Is it weird to say the thing this premiere most reminded me of was Garfield fancomics? Not like, the body-horror ones that go viral on Twitter every once in a while, but the more grounded and dramatic ones that try to apply a sense of emotional realism to the static, archetypal characters of the eternal comic strip.

Community score: 4.2              What is this?   The story centers on a 4-year-old boy named Kotarō Satо̄, who moves next door to Shin Karino, an unsuccessful manga artist. Kotarō has no parents and lives alone. Not only does he seem to earn a living, he actually seems more put together than his own strange neighbors.    Kotaro Lives Alone is based on Mami Tsumura's manga and streams on Netflix.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Because of my day job, I have a love-hate relationship with anime that feature young children. Write them well, and I'll gush over how the series really gets them; write them poorly or overly-precocious and it's difficult for me to suspend belief long enough to really get into the story. I'd heard good things about Kotaro Lives Alone, but I couldn't feel anything beyond the most cautious of optimism as I started up the first episode. I know four-year-olds, and it was hard to imagine a story where I could both believe a child is four and is capable of surviving on his own.    Somehow, miraculously, the first episode manages to strike that balance, painting a tragicomic picture of a young child who has been forced to grow up way too fast. Part of the reason it works is because of the way Kotaro wears certain affectations, such as copying the extremely formal and old-fashioned language from a samurai cartoon he likes, like a suit of armor as he imitates adult behavior. Moments like the brief shot of him reading a newspaper on the toilet – and Japanese newspapers have a lot of difficult kanji in them, at an age where a child is barely expected to read hiragana – with his little legs dangling speak volumes.    What Kotaro Lives Alone understands is that a four-year-old doesn't become this uncanny mix of adult and child from growing up in a healthy environment. Nothing has been explicitly stated so far, but there's a lot of little one-off lines that indicate that something in his former home life forced him to grow up way too early, and whatever happened, it was neither fun nor cute. There's a tragic undercurrent to every laugh, whether it's due to Kotaro or the hot messes that are the other adult tenants in his building, that keeps it from becoming cloying or too-sentimental. If anything, it's a bit too real of a reminder that children are denied their childhoods every day.       James Beckett  Rating:                I turned 30 this year, and the older I get, the happier I am to see domestic anime that focus on more “adult” issues. Despite the very peculiar and almost fantastical nature of its premise, Kotaro Lives Alone is right up my alley. Shin Karino is exactly the kind of protagonist that I'm interested in seeing more of these days: a real human person who deals with real everyday struggles. He's trying to rekindle his creative spark and salvage his career as a manga artist; he's got to deal with his colorful and bizarre neighbors; he even throws out his back just getting up from the table (it happens to the best of us, my man, don't sweat it). The only “weird” angle to Shin's life is that he's suddenly found himself involved in the day-to-day adventures of an incredibly precocious and eccentric four-year-old that apparently lives on his own.    This is the angle of the plot that I was unsure of, since unrealistically independent and intelligent tots are such a cliché for anime in general, but I like the way that Kotaro Lives Alone characterizes its titular tyke. The very childlike issues he goes through—figuring out how bathhouses work, successfully bandaging skinned knees, procuring a TV to watch his favorite cartoon—all contrast nicely with the jaded adults around him. Mizuki clearly has some drama in her personal life and work as a hostess, and even the outlandish Tamaru feels more grounded once you learn that he's having a hard time keeping his own family together. The jokey bits where Kotaro's “feudal lord” act clashes with his inherent immaturity could have come across as tacky or try-hard, but the show always manages to get the viewer to empathize with the boy's trials and tribulations as much as the grown-ups. Who among us hasn't also marched into a complete stranger's home just so they could tell you that you did a good job?    I only have one major complaint about Kotaro, but it's kind of a doozy: the show is pretty ugly. The art style is apparently going for this strange kind of abstraction that isn't quite Crayon Shin-chan, but all of the faces and bodies are just oddly proportioned and stretchy enough to look off-putting. It's a look that might appeal to some folks, but I just couldn't warm up to it no matter how hard I tried. Still, Kotaro Lives Alone was a very pleasant surprise, and if you can get past its rough presentation, you might come to love the kid just as much as his neighbors do.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Watching this episode, I couldn't decide whether I wanted to laugh or cry—and I suspect that's exactly what the creators were aiming for. After all, it's got a setup that is either inherently comedic or inherently tragic depending on the tone of the work. And let's be clear here, Kotaro Lives Alone works hard to walk the line right between them.    First, the comedic side of things. We have a four-year-old kid doing all the things a person living alone for the first time needs to do. 90% of the time, he does it just as well as any adult, which leads us to assume that this is his norm. The humor, therefore, comes from the unpredictable moments when he acts like the child he actually is, betraying our expectations in an obvious way. (This is exact same joke framework used for Stewie and Brian in Family Guy). It's an easy way to get a laugh, especially if you care for the character.    Then there's the tragic side of things. We have a kid, ostensibly with no parents, living alone in a rundown apartment building and surrounded by unscrupulous adults. Worse yet, he has a streetwise mindset that no child his age should have—such as knowing how to bring down the swelling from crying too much—which has some heartbreaking implications. Moreover, he clearly still wants to be loved: to have his hair washed by an adult and be praised for doing something on his own for the first time.    But the real hook of the show is that everyone in that apartment building is just as alone as Kotaro is. We have a manga artist who is struggling to live up to his breakout hit; a hostess who escapes her financially abusive boyfriend by getting drunk; and a low-level mobster who isn't allowed to meet his son anymore. Despite their circumstances, this group of broken people has a chance to become something by stepping up and becoming the family Kotaro so desperately needs. It's a show that plays with your emotions in the best way—and one I will most certainly be watching to the end.      Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                Is it weird to say the thing this premiere most reminded me of was Garfield fancomics? Not like, the body-horror ones that go viral on Twitter every once in a while, but the more grounded and dramatic ones that try to apply a sense of emotional realism to the static, archetypal characters of the eternal comic strip. Because the premise of this one – an eccentric kid named Kotaro Lives Alone in a low-rent apartment block and gets into low stakes adventures with his adult neighbors – feels like something you could find running for 20 years in a newspaper comic. That is, until it starts slipping in darker punchlines with much more serious implications.    It's an odd balance to strike, and not one this first episode totally manages to keep. There are long stretches of this episode that are just a couple of jokes being repeated and iterated upon without much escalation or change. Likewise, the initial shock of the implications about Kotaro's life before he wound up a Pre-K lease-holder wears off fairly quickly, and once those hints keep piling up it becomes decidedly harder to chuckle at him strutting around town with his plastic samurai sword. There's definitely a version of this setup that can work – be great even – but as of this premiere it doesn't feel like they've figured out the right formula.    Like sure, there are a handful of moments that are funny, or charming, or bittersweet, but they stand as isolated incidents that don't coalesce quite right. And since they don't properly gel, it winds up feeling like each fraction of what this show's going for is struggling for attention. Are you enjoying this silly segment of Kotaro being pestered by a bird? Well that's over so we can have him learn about his neighbor's failed marriage and struggle for visitation rights with his young son. Are you feeling compelled by Kotaro slowly letting his neighbor in, and perhaps accidentally admitting to his own loneliness? Try to hold onto that feeling while he and Kotaro walk around the supermarket and the guy freaks out over the thought of having an unknown baby of his own.

Edward doesn't look like a teen anymore especially with that height while Armstrong and Scar obviously can't keep the same built kinda like how Liu Kang's actor had to wear a shirt in the second Mortal Kombat movie. At least, the two versions of Ling Yao seem to wear proper clothing and keep a fitting hair. Still, are they trimming the entire manga in only three movies?

Other than that, I'm feeling iffy about Scar's looks -- he looks definitely younger unlike in the anime. And I'm definitely excited watching the action scenes of Wrath here in this movie!

Similarly, Kenshin's actor, Satoh, managed to do all of his actors in the five films but reached his limits in the Final and Beginning as a result of his age. Since Ling Yao's character is quite younger there is potential for Watanabe to stand out. Scar being played by Mackenyu helps a lot since such actor played Enishi in Final and was probably the closest actor to his prime during recording. Meanwhile, Father and Van Hohenheim are gonna need help from the special effects due to their technques.

Because they removed it from their service  Also, I know that for a possible English dub Edward's voice actor will have to be replaced, here in Latin America a similar thing will happen with Roy's voice actor, Luis Daniel Ramirez, since he was fired from various studios for harassment charges. I'd say in Latin American Spanish Roy should be voiced by the actor who originally voiced him in FMA and FMAB in Venezuela (the live-action was dubbed in Mexico) or the actor who voiced him in the FMAB redub which was made in Mexico last year      Back to top                  penguintruth    Joined: 08 Dec 2004 		    Posts: 8219 		    Location: Penguinopolis 		        Posted: Wed Apr 13, 2022 6:09 pm              Silver Kirin wrote:    Also, I know that for a possible English dub Edward's voice actor will have to be replaced            They should just get Landon McDonald to play him, like they did with Rohan Kishibe.

Meanwhile, Father and Van Hohenheim are gonna need help from the special effects due to their technques.            Definitely made a point right there! Now I'm curious on how the battle between Father and Hohenheim will look like. There's going to be a lot of transmutation. Based from the trailer, it does need a bit more help.    P.S. I just realized how May is very mature here.  She ain't the small girl!

Edward doesn't look like a teen anymore especially with that height while Armstrong and Scar obviously can't keep the same built kinda like how Liu Kang's actor had to wear a shirt in the second Mortal Kombat movie. At least, the two versions of Ling Yao seem to wear proper clothing and keep a fitting hair. Still, are they trimming the entire manga in only three movies?

Other than that, I'm feeling iffy about Scar's looks -- he looks definitely younger unlike in the anime. And I'm definitely excited watching the action scenes of Wrath here in this movie!

Similarly, Kenshin's actor, Satoh, managed to do all of his actors in the five films but reached his limits in the Final and Beginning as a result of his age. Since Ling Yao's character is quite younger there is potential for Watanabe to stand out. Scar being played by Mackenyu helps a lot since such actor played Enishi in Final and was probably the closest actor to his prime during recording. Meanwhile, Father and Van Hohenheim are gonna need help from the special effects due to their technques.

Because they removed it from their service  Also, I know that for a possible English dub Edward's voice actor will have to be replaced, here in Latin America a similar thing will happen with Roy's voice actor, Luis Daniel Ramirez, since he was fired from various studios for harassment charges. I'd say in Latin American Spanish Roy should be voiced by the actor who originally voiced him in FMA and FMAB in Venezuela (the live-action was dubbed in Mexico) or the actor who voiced him in the FMAB redub which was made in Mexico last year      Back to top                  penguintruth    Joined: 08 Dec 2004 		    Posts: 8219 		    Location: Penguinopolis 		        Posted: Wed Apr 13, 2022 6:09 pm              Silver Kirin wrote:    Also, I know that for a possible English dub Edward's voice actor will have to be replaced            They should just get Landon McDonald to play him, like they did with Rohan Kishibe.

Now I'm curious on how the battle between Father and Hohenheim will look like. There's going to be a lot of transmutation. Based from the trailer, it does need a bit more help.    P.S. I just realized how May is very mature here.  She ain't the small girl!

Similarly, Kenshin's actor, Satoh, managed to do all of his actors in the five films but reached his limits in the Final and Beginning as a result of his age. Since Ling Yao's character is quite younger there is potential for Watanabe to stand out. Scar being played by Mackenyu helps a lot since such actor played Enishi in Final and was probably the closest actor to his prime during recording. Meanwhile, Father and Van Hohenheim are gonna need help from the special effects due to their technques.

I'd say in Latin American Spanish Roy should be voiced by the actor who originally voiced him in FMA and FMAB in Venezuela (the live-action was dubbed in Mexico) or the actor who voiced him in the FMAB redub which was made in Mexico last year      Back to top                  penguintruth    Joined: 08 Dec 2004 		    Posts: 8219 		    Location: Penguinopolis 		        Posted: Wed Apr 13, 2022 6:09 pm              Silver Kirin wrote:    Also, I know that for a possible English dub Edward's voice actor will have to be replaced            They should just get Landon McDonald to play him, like they did with Rohan Kishibe.

Now I'm curious on how the battle between Father and Hohenheim will look like. There's going to be a lot of transmutation. Based from the trailer, it does need a bit more help.    P.S.

Similarly, Kenshin's actor, Satoh, managed to do all of his actors in the five films but reached his limits in the Final and Beginning as a result of his age. Since Ling Yao's character is quite younger there is potential for Watanabe to stand out.

I'd say in Latin American Spanish Roy should be voiced by the actor who originally voiced him in FMA and FMAB in Venezuela (the live-action was dubbed in Mexico) or the actor who voiced him in the FMAB redub which was made in Mexico last year      Back to top                  penguintruth    Joined: 08 Dec 2004 		    Posts: 8219 		    Location: Penguinopolis 		        Posted: Wed Apr 13, 2022 6:09 pm              Silver Kirin wrote:    Also, I know that for a possible English dub Edward's voice actor will have to be replaced            They should just get Landon McDonald to play him, like they did with Rohan Kishibe.

Now I'm curious on how the battle between Father and Hohenheim will look like. There's going to be a lot of transmutation. Based from the trailer, it does need a bit more help.    P.S. I just realized how May is very mature here.  She ain't the small girl!

Similarly, Kenshin's actor, Satoh, managed to do all of his actors in the five films but reached his limits in the Final and Beginning as a result of his age. Since Ling Yao's character is quite younger there is potential for Watanabe to stand out. Scar being played by Mackenyu helps a lot since such actor played Enishi in Final and was probably the closest actor to his prime during recording. Meanwhile, Father and Van Hohenheim are gonna need help from the special effects due to their technques.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Dawn of the Witch   Apr  8th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Dawn of the Witch ?                     Community score: 3.5              What is this?   The world is now at peace after having endured a conflict between the church and witches for 500 years. However, embers of war still burn in some regions of the world. Cervil is a hopeless student at the Kingdom of Wenias' College of Magic. Cervil has somehow lost all memory of his time before attending the college. The school's headmaster Albus sends him for special training to the southern part of the continent, where persecution against witches runs strong.    The Dawn of the Witch is based on Kakeru Kobashiri's light novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Dawn of the Witch did not make the best first impression on me. We're deep into premiere season, it's late, I'm tired, etc, and I'm out of patience for shows that introduces its female characters either thighs/crotch first or tits first. I have zero familiarity with Grimoire of Zero, and while this is a standalone spinoff, I definitely got the nagging feeling I was supposed to be familiar with at least a few of these faces.    Once I was ready to forgive the show its trespasses, I did actually find a lot to draw me in. The story starts at a magic academy in a region where magic is accepted, thanks to the end of a war several centuries ago. However, since there are still places where mages are treated as other, the academy's best student, worst student, and a 300-year-old witch with the body of a ten-year-old and garter-clad thighs are going on what boils down to a humanitarian mission to build a safe home for them. Oh, and Saybil, the worst student, needs this mission to be successful, or else he'll lose what memories he's accumulated since developing amnesia three years ago.    It's a decent sentiment with a good heart, and I was surprised by a clunky-but-well-intentioned moment when Saybil called his travel companion out on her microaggressions against their beastfallen classmate. And yet, it just doesn't quite gel. Not because the fan service was particularly obtrusive—other than those crotch-first and boob-first intros, it was actually quite low-key—but because there's just no chemistry between the characters. There was a lot of walking and talking, camping and talking, and so on, and I just wasn't having fun watching them banter. There wasn't much sense of a connection and any playfulness felt forced.    Maybe someone who already knows and likes Grimoire of Zero will get more out of Dawn of the Witch. For me, it feels like wasted potential.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                While I've never felt the need to go back and rewatch the Grimoire of Zero, I do have fond memories of the little witch and her giant teddy bear of a mercenary. So returning to this world, with or without Zero in the drivers seat, is a lot of fun. There are a lot of familiar faces (it's great to see Albus all grown up) and it's interesting to see how everything has progressed since the last time we were here.    As fun as all the connections are, the basic story is perfectly understandable even if you've never seen Grimoire of Zero. Our viewpoint character, Saybil, is an amnesic magic student (though, in a twist on the trope, the memory loss happened three years previously). His personal conflict is simple: he's the school's worst mage and if he can't improve he'll be kicked out of the academy. If this happens, his knowledge of magic will be erased from his mind—basically reverting him right back to his post-amnesia state.    Then we have the titular Dawn Witch herself, a 300-year-old with the body of a little girl. While I could do without the constant panty shots, she is an intriguing character. Though egotistical and entitled, she seems to have the wisdom to match. Her connection to her staff is likewise interesting—as is everyone's reactions to how she uses a witch-killing weapon for everyday menial tasks.    The only issue I had with the show is that it really needs to lay out some of its proper nouns and a bit more of its history. While terms like “mage” and “witch” are thrown about, we don't get any clear answer on the difference between them (if any exists). And while we know there was a war between witches and the church, a bit more of the specifics would help us understand the trouble our heroes have already found themselves in with the Witch Hunters. But, all in all, this episode lays some solid ground work and makes me want to see not only what is to come for Sable and Loux but how Zero is connected to everything as well.      James Beckett  Rating:                I feel a little embarrassed, because it wasn't more than a week ago that I suddenly found myself thinking, “Man, remember Grimoire of Zero?” I hadn't thought about the show in years, not since I reviewed it, but for some reason I found myself feeling ever so slightly nostalgic for the flawed but fun fantasy adventure. “I wonder whatever happened to that big ol' cat-man and his tiny witch girlfriend?” And yet, I was completely unaware going into Dawn of the Witch that this was actually a sequel to Grimoire of Zero, and it took me a minute to even realize it. I must have zoned out a little during the OP, since Zero and Mercenary make very clear and obvious appearances in it, but it was right around the part where a wolf-man named Holdem was yelling about a woman named Albus that I started to connect the dots.    Dawn of the Witch is a really direct sequel, as it turns out, despite jumping ahead a number of years in the timeline, not to mention the major shakeup in visual style on account of the new production team. I had to go back to watch the end of GoZ to refresh my memory, but that series does indeed end with young Albus starting up a brand-new magic academy in Wenias, and promising to build a world where witches and humans can live in peace. At the start of Dawn of the Witch, it seems like she's making headway on that goal, too, though there's still a long way to go. This is what gets our four main characters started on their journey, and it's also where my issues with Dawn of the Witch really take hold.    While it was surprisingly fun to catch up with this universe and see what's become of some of the characters since Grimoire ended, this premiere just doesn't do a great job of getting me to give a damn about its own story and cast. Saybil is a total nothing of a protagonist, and Loux is the grating and unlikable inverse of Zero. It doesn't help that the camera goes out of its way to zoom in on her crotch with absolutely no shame, or even a sense of proper framing. Holt and Kudo are barely developed outside of the fact that Holt is very busty and flirtatious with Saybil, which is odd considering that Saybil has no discernable personality whatsoever. Kudo is…a lizard. That's about it.    Nobody will ever mistake Grimoire of Zero for great television, and it says something that I went nearly five years before remembering that I spent a whole season watching and reviewing the show, but it was a decent fantasy anime all things considered. Dawn of the Witch hasn't elicited any reaction from me whatsoever, which is a very poor place for a series premiere to find itself in. Maybe the show will pick up once the new cast finds its footing, or if Zero and Mercenary return to liven up the proceedings. If that isn't the case, though, then Dawn of the Witch seems destined to be overshadowed by its older sibling, and it isn't like GoZ cast all that large of a shadow in the first place.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                If you weren't aware, The Dawn of the Witch is set in the same world as Grimoire of Zero, although I don't think that's any impediment to just jumping in here. There are probably some world-building elements that work better if you're familiar with Grimoire of Zero, and that particular book does get a mention in this episode, but it's otherwise a pretty standard sword-and-sorcery setup, with beastpeople (known as beastfallen), magic users, witch hunters, and a vaguely Medieval sensibility. Well, and there's the headmaster of a magic school named Albus, but maybe we won't dwell on that.    This episode suffers most from two things: being very much about setting the stage for the more interesting things to come and Loux being kind of annoying. Loux could be Beatrice's cousin from Re: Zero in some ways, and I do think the choice to use the archaic informal second person (thee/thou/thy) largely works for her attitude of superiority. She's absolutely the kind of person who would deliberately speak informally to everyone just to show that she considers herself above them, something that Hort and Saybil notice when she leaves them behind to go chase witch hunters. But she's the sort of character who could wear with length of use, which could be an issue if she's got too much time in the spotlight.    The fact that Loux is also used for the bottom half of the fanservice may also rub some people the wrong way. We get plenty of shots of her crotch as she sits with her legs splayed, which is mostly noticeable because of how ridiculous her skirt's design is. Hort takes over the top half of the fanservice with her shirt that's patterned so that her breasts look like a wrapped present, and it is kind of amusing how obviously the art is trying to have it all by the way Hort is always shown boobs-first while Loux is shown thighs-first. Mostly the issue is that Loux, despite being 300 years old, looks pretty darn prepubescent, because really, she can sit however is most comfortable for her. Not that Saybil notices any of this, being about as blank a slate as you can get and having no discernable personality whatsoever. It's frankly the least believable part of the episode that Hort likes him so much.    Mostly this episode just sort of exists. There are some hints that the story could improve once the tedious set up is finished, so this probably isn't one to just write off immediately. But on the other hand, Goodreads assures me that I've read the first volume of the manga version and I can't remember a darn thing about it. Make of that what you will.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               This show exists in a weird bit of adaptation limbo. It's based on a series of light novels that are themselves a sequel to the Grimoire of Zero novel series. I'm one of the 10 people who watched and still vaguely remember the 2017 Grimoire anime, but that show only covered the first couple volumes of a much longer story. So while I recognize some returning characters and understand the basic makeup of this particular fantasy world, I could not tell you how we got from the adventures of Tony the Tiger and his pint-sized witch gremlin to this new status quo. The good news is this is largely a new story, and anything immediately important is explained pretty quickly in this episode, so newcomers and non-LN readers alike should be able to follow along. The bad news is that doesn't make this episode any more interesting or entertaining.    The big issue with this new series is that it's centered on, by far, its least engaging character. Saybil's amnesia and mysterious past are supposed to entice you to learn more about him, but in practice he's a dead-eyed cipher who intakes exposition and outputs nothing of interest. Nearly any other character introduced here would be more engaging to follow as a protagonist, with the possible exception of the titular Witch of the Dawn, Loux. On top of being a 300-year-old little girl who can't stop flashing her panties to the camera, she's just an annoying presence who's only tolerable when she's acting her age instead of playing up her miniscule appearance. So the thought of watching her mentor our deadweight lead is deathly unappealing. That stands in stark contrast to Mercenary and Zero's dynamic in the first series, and it makes me question why these two are our leads when there's some perfectly engaging characters right next to them.    Maybe that's just because we barely get any time with Holt or Kudo so they don't have a chance to disappoint us, but just on the surface they both strike me as way more active, layered characters to build your story around. Holt is a star magic pupil who seemingly comes from a harsh background where she learned to put on a kind smile to avoid confrontation, which raises questions about her past that actually make her more interesting, unlike Saybil. Kudo, meanwhile, is a rough-mannered beast-man who nonetheless has a strong sense of justice and acts selflessly in his own way. Hell, just in this episode it's brought up that witches used to sacrifice beast-people, so the idea of one studying magic to become a witch is a rock-solid concept that all but begs for further exploration. Why, then, is his entire story this episode offscreen? Is has to be more interesting than watching our amnesiac sadboi hero vomit on a cart ride.    That's what really makes this premiere frustrating, on its own and as a follow-up to Grimoire of Zero. I know there's an interesting fantasy world behind all this, with a rich history just waiting to be explored, and presumably even more new things that have happened since the first anime wrapped up. If this were just some generic isekai world I could write it off as a dull waste of time and be done, but there's so much potential here that is just being left to rot. I might stick around for another episode or two, just to see if the elements I liked get some actual focus, but I can't give this much of a recommendation right now.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          3 comments       Jujutsu Kaisen Stage Play's Video Introduces Cast in Costume   Apr 15, 07:02 3 comments                 live-action    Ryūji Satō, Ryosuke Miura star in July-August play ― A press conference for the stage play of Gege Akutami's Jujutsu Kaisen manga introduced the production's promotional video, main cast, and other details on Wednesday.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Dawn of the Witch   Apr  8th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Dawn of the Witch ?                     Community score: 3.5              What is this?   The world is now at peace after having endured a conflict between the church and witches for 500 years. However, embers of war still burn in some regions of the world. Cervil is a hopeless student at the Kingdom of Wenias' College of Magic. Cervil has somehow lost all memory of his time before attending the college. The school's headmaster Albus sends him for special training to the southern part of the continent, where persecution against witches runs strong.    The Dawn of the Witch is based on Kakeru Kobashiri's light novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Dawn of the Witch did not make the best first impression on me. We're deep into premiere season, it's late, I'm tired, etc, and I'm out of patience for shows that introduces its female characters either thighs/crotch first or tits first. I have zero familiarity with Grimoire of Zero, and while this is a standalone spinoff, I definitely got the nagging feeling I was supposed to be familiar with at least a few of these faces.    Once I was ready to forgive the show its trespasses, I did actually find a lot to draw me in. The story starts at a magic academy in a region where magic is accepted, thanks to the end of a war several centuries ago. However, since there are still places where mages are treated as other, the academy's best student, worst student, and a 300-year-old witch with the body of a ten-year-old and garter-clad thighs are going on what boils down to a humanitarian mission to build a safe home for them. Oh, and Saybil, the worst student, needs this mission to be successful, or else he'll lose what memories he's accumulated since developing amnesia three years ago.    It's a decent sentiment with a good heart, and I was surprised by a clunky-but-well-intentioned moment when Saybil called his travel companion out on her microaggressions against their beastfallen classmate. And yet, it just doesn't quite gel. Not because the fan service was particularly obtrusive—other than those crotch-first and boob-first intros, it was actually quite low-key—but because there's just no chemistry between the characters. There was a lot of walking and talking, camping and talking, and so on, and I just wasn't having fun watching them banter. There wasn't much sense of a connection and any playfulness felt forced.    Maybe someone who already knows and likes Grimoire of Zero will get more out of Dawn of the Witch. For me, it feels like wasted potential.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                While I've never felt the need to go back and rewatch the Grimoire of Zero, I do have fond memories of the little witch and her giant teddy bear of a mercenary. So returning to this world, with or without Zero in the drivers seat, is a lot of fun. There are a lot of familiar faces (it's great to see Albus all grown up) and it's interesting to see how everything has progressed since the last time we were here.    As fun as all the connections are, the basic story is perfectly understandable even if you've never seen Grimoire of Zero. Our viewpoint character, Saybil, is an amnesic magic student (though, in a twist on the trope, the memory loss happened three years previously). His personal conflict is simple: he's the school's worst mage and if he can't improve he'll be kicked out of the academy. If this happens, his knowledge of magic will be erased from his mind—basically reverting him right back to his post-amnesia state.    Then we have the titular Dawn Witch herself, a 300-year-old with the body of a little girl. While I could do without the constant panty shots, she is an intriguing character. Though egotistical and entitled, she seems to have the wisdom to match. Her connection to her staff is likewise interesting—as is everyone's reactions to how she uses a witch-killing weapon for everyday menial tasks.    The only issue I had with the show is that it really needs to lay out some of its proper nouns and a bit more of its history. While terms like “mage” and “witch” are thrown about, we don't get any clear answer on the difference between them (if any exists). And while we know there was a war between witches and the church, a bit more of the specifics would help us understand the trouble our heroes have already found themselves in with the Witch Hunters. But, all in all, this episode lays some solid ground work and makes me want to see not only what is to come for Sable and Loux but how Zero is connected to everything as well.      James Beckett  Rating:                I feel a little embarrassed, because it wasn't more than a week ago that I suddenly found myself thinking, “Man, remember Grimoire of Zero?” I hadn't thought about the show in years, not since I reviewed it, but for some reason I found myself feeling ever so slightly nostalgic for the flawed but fun fantasy adventure. “I wonder whatever happened to that big ol' cat-man and his tiny witch girlfriend?” And yet, I was completely unaware going into Dawn of the Witch that this was actually a sequel to Grimoire of Zero, and it took me a minute to even realize it. I must have zoned out a little during the OP, since Zero and Mercenary make very clear and obvious appearances in it, but it was right around the part where a wolf-man named Holdem was yelling about a woman named Albus that I started to connect the dots.    Dawn of the Witch is a really direct sequel, as it turns out, despite jumping ahead a number of years in the timeline, not to mention the major shakeup in visual style on account of the new production team. I had to go back to watch the end of GoZ to refresh my memory, but that series does indeed end with young Albus starting up a brand-new magic academy in Wenias, and promising to build a world where witches and humans can live in peace. At the start of Dawn of the Witch, it seems like she's making headway on that goal, too, though there's still a long way to go. This is what gets our four main characters started on their journey, and it's also where my issues with Dawn of the Witch really take hold.    While it was surprisingly fun to catch up with this universe and see what's become of some of the characters since Grimoire ended, this premiere just doesn't do a great job of getting me to give a damn about its own story and cast. Saybil is a total nothing of a protagonist, and Loux is the grating and unlikable inverse of Zero. It doesn't help that the camera goes out of its way to zoom in on her crotch with absolutely no shame, or even a sense of proper framing. Holt and Kudo are barely developed outside of the fact that Holt is very busty and flirtatious with Saybil, which is odd considering that Saybil has no discernable personality whatsoever. Kudo is…a lizard. That's about it.    Nobody will ever mistake Grimoire of Zero for great television, and it says something that I went nearly five years before remembering that I spent a whole season watching and reviewing the show, but it was a decent fantasy anime all things considered. Dawn of the Witch hasn't elicited any reaction from me whatsoever, which is a very poor place for a series premiere to find itself in. Maybe the show will pick up once the new cast finds its footing, or if Zero and Mercenary return to liven up the proceedings. If that isn't the case, though, then Dawn of the Witch seems destined to be overshadowed by its older sibling, and it isn't like GoZ cast all that large of a shadow in the first place.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                If you weren't aware, The Dawn of the Witch is set in the same world as Grimoire of Zero, although I don't think that's any impediment to just jumping in here. There are probably some world-building elements that work better if you're familiar with Grimoire of Zero, and that particular book does get a mention in this episode, but it's otherwise a pretty standard sword-and-sorcery setup, with beastpeople (known as beastfallen), magic users, witch hunters, and a vaguely Medieval sensibility. Well, and there's the headmaster of a magic school named Albus, but maybe we won't dwell on that.    This episode suffers most from two things: being very much about setting the stage for the more interesting things to come and Loux being kind of annoying. Loux could be Beatrice's cousin from Re: Zero in some ways, and I do think the choice to use the archaic informal second person (thee/thou/thy) largely works for her attitude of superiority. She's absolutely the kind of person who would deliberately speak informally to everyone just to show that she considers herself above them, something that Hort and Saybil notice when she leaves them behind to go chase witch hunters. But she's the sort of character who could wear with length of use, which could be an issue if she's got too much time in the spotlight.    The fact that Loux is also used for the bottom half of the fanservice may also rub some people the wrong way. We get plenty of shots of her crotch as she sits with her legs splayed, which is mostly noticeable because of how ridiculous her skirt's design is. Hort takes over the top half of the fanservice with her shirt that's patterned so that her breasts look like a wrapped present, and it is kind of amusing how obviously the art is trying to have it all by the way Hort is always shown boobs-first while Loux is shown thighs-first. Mostly the issue is that Loux, despite being 300 years old, looks pretty darn prepubescent, because really, she can sit however is most comfortable for her. Not that Saybil notices any of this, being about as blank a slate as you can get and having no discernable personality whatsoever. It's frankly the least believable part of the episode that Hort likes him so much.    Mostly this episode just sort of exists. There are some hints that the story could improve once the tedious set up is finished, so this probably isn't one to just write off immediately. But on the other hand, Goodreads assures me that I've read the first volume of the manga version and I can't remember a darn thing about it. Make of that what you will.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               This show exists in a weird bit of adaptation limbo. It's based on a series of light novels that are themselves a sequel to the Grimoire of Zero novel series. I'm one of the 10 people who watched and still vaguely remember the 2017 Grimoire anime, but that show only covered the first couple volumes of a much longer story. So while I recognize some returning characters and understand the basic makeup of this particular fantasy world, I could not tell you how we got from the adventures of Tony the Tiger and his pint-sized witch gremlin to this new status quo. The good news is this is largely a new story, and anything immediately important is explained pretty quickly in this episode, so newcomers and non-LN readers alike should be able to follow along. The bad news is that doesn't make this episode any more interesting or entertaining.    The big issue with this new series is that it's centered on, by far, its least engaging character. Saybil's amnesia and mysterious past are supposed to entice you to learn more about him, but in practice he's a dead-eyed cipher who intakes exposition and outputs nothing of interest. Nearly any other character introduced here would be more engaging to follow as a protagonist, with the possible exception of the titular Witch of the Dawn, Loux. On top of being a 300-year-old little girl who can't stop flashing her panties to the camera, she's just an annoying presence who's only tolerable when she's acting her age instead of playing up her miniscule appearance. So the thought of watching her mentor our deadweight lead is deathly unappealing. That stands in stark contrast to Mercenary and Zero's dynamic in the first series, and it makes me question why these two are our leads when there's some perfectly engaging characters right next to them.    Maybe that's just because we barely get any time with Holt or Kudo so they don't have a chance to disappoint us, but just on the surface they both strike me as way more active, layered characters to build your story around. Holt is a star magic pupil who seemingly comes from a harsh background where she learned to put on a kind smile to avoid confrontation, which raises questions about her past that actually make her more interesting, unlike Saybil. Kudo, meanwhile, is a rough-mannered beast-man who nonetheless has a strong sense of justice and acts selflessly in his own way. Hell, just in this episode it's brought up that witches used to sacrifice beast-people, so the idea of one studying magic to become a witch is a rock-solid concept that all but begs for further exploration. Why, then, is his entire story this episode offscreen? Is has to be more interesting than watching our amnesiac sadboi hero vomit on a cart ride.    That's what really makes this premiere frustrating, on its own and as a follow-up to Grimoire of Zero. I know there's an interesting fantasy world behind all this, with a rich history just waiting to be explored, and presumably even more new things that have happened since the first anime wrapped up. If this were just some generic isekai world I could write it off as a dull waste of time and be done, but there's so much potential here that is just being left to rot. I might stick around for another episode or two, just to see if the elements I liked get some actual focus, but I can't give this much of a recommendation right now.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          3 comments       Jujutsu Kaisen Stage Play's Video Introduces Cast in Costume   Apr 15, 07:02 3 comments                 live-action    Ryūji Satō, Ryosuke Miura star in July-August play ― A press conference for the stage play of Gege Akutami's Jujutsu Kaisen manga introduced the production's promotional video, main cast, and other details on Wednesday.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Dawn of the Witch   Apr  8th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Dawn of the Witch ?                     Community score: 3.5              What is this?   The world is now at peace after having endured a conflict between the church and witches for 500 years. However, embers of war still burn in some regions of the world. Cervil is a hopeless student at the Kingdom of Wenias' College of Magic. Cervil has somehow lost all memory of his time before attending the college. The school's headmaster Albus sends him for special training to the southern part of the continent, where persecution against witches runs strong.    The Dawn of the Witch is based on Kakeru Kobashiri's light novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Dawn of the Witch did not make the best first impression on me. We're deep into premiere season, it's late, I'm tired, etc, and I'm out of patience for shows that introduces its female characters either thighs/crotch first or tits first. I have zero familiarity with Grimoire of Zero, and while this is a standalone spinoff, I definitely got the nagging feeling I was supposed to be familiar with at least a few of these faces.    Once I was ready to forgive the show its trespasses, I did actually find a lot to draw me in. The story starts at a magic academy in a region where magic is accepted, thanks to the end of a war several centuries ago. However, since there are still places where mages are treated as other, the academy's best student, worst student, and a 300-year-old witch with the body of a ten-year-old and garter-clad thighs are going on what boils down to a humanitarian mission to build a safe home for them. Oh, and Saybil, the worst student, needs this mission to be successful, or else he'll lose what memories he's accumulated since developing amnesia three years ago.    It's a decent sentiment with a good heart, and I was surprised by a clunky-but-well-intentioned moment when Saybil called his travel companion out on her microaggressions against their beastfallen classmate. And yet, it just doesn't quite gel. Not because the fan service was particularly obtrusive—other than those crotch-first and boob-first intros, it was actually quite low-key—but because there's just no chemistry between the characters. There was a lot of walking and talking, camping and talking, and so on, and I just wasn't having fun watching them banter. There wasn't much sense of a connection and any playfulness felt forced.    Maybe someone who already knows and likes Grimoire of Zero will get more out of Dawn of the Witch. For me, it feels like wasted potential.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                While I've never felt the need to go back and rewatch the Grimoire of Zero, I do have fond memories of the little witch and her giant teddy bear of a mercenary. So returning to this world, with or without Zero in the drivers seat, is a lot of fun. There are a lot of familiar faces (it's great to see Albus all grown up) and it's interesting to see how everything has progressed since the last time we were here.    As fun as all the connections are, the basic story is perfectly understandable even if you've never seen Grimoire of Zero. Our viewpoint character, Saybil, is an amnesic magic student (though, in a twist on the trope, the memory loss happened three years previously). His personal conflict is simple: he's the school's worst mage and if he can't improve he'll be kicked out of the academy. If this happens, his knowledge of magic will be erased from his mind—basically reverting him right back to his post-amnesia state.    Then we have the titular Dawn Witch herself, a 300-year-old with the body of a little girl. While I could do without the constant panty shots, she is an intriguing character. Though egotistical and entitled, she seems to have the wisdom to match. Her connection to her staff is likewise interesting—as is everyone's reactions to how she uses a witch-killing weapon for everyday menial tasks.    The only issue I had with the show is that it really needs to lay out some of its proper nouns and a bit more of its history. While terms like “mage” and “witch” are thrown about, we don't get any clear answer on the difference between them (if any exists). And while we know there was a war between witches and the church, a bit more of the specifics would help us understand the trouble our heroes have already found themselves in with the Witch Hunters. But, all in all, this episode lays some solid ground work and makes me want to see not only what is to come for Sable and Loux but how Zero is connected to everything as well.      James Beckett  Rating:                I feel a little embarrassed, because it wasn't more than a week ago that I suddenly found myself thinking, “Man, remember Grimoire of Zero?” I hadn't thought about the show in years, not since I reviewed it, but for some reason I found myself feeling ever so slightly nostalgic for the flawed but fun fantasy adventure. “I wonder whatever happened to that big ol' cat-man and his tiny witch girlfriend?” And yet, I was completely unaware going into Dawn of the Witch that this was actually a sequel to Grimoire of Zero, and it took me a minute to even realize it. I must have zoned out a little during the OP, since Zero and Mercenary make very clear and obvious appearances in it, but it was right around the part where a wolf-man named Holdem was yelling about a woman named Albus that I started to connect the dots.    Dawn of the Witch is a really direct sequel, as it turns out, despite jumping ahead a number of years in the timeline, not to mention the major shakeup in visual style on account of the new production team. I had to go back to watch the end of GoZ to refresh my memory, but that series does indeed end with young Albus starting up a brand-new magic academy in Wenias, and promising to build a world where witches and humans can live in peace. At the start of Dawn of the Witch, it seems like she's making headway on that goal, too, though there's still a long way to go. This is what gets our four main characters started on their journey, and it's also where my issues with Dawn of the Witch really take hold.    While it was surprisingly fun to catch up with this universe and see what's become of some of the characters since Grimoire ended, this premiere just doesn't do a great job of getting me to give a damn about its own story and cast. Saybil is a total nothing of a protagonist, and Loux is the grating and unlikable inverse of Zero. It doesn't help that the camera goes out of its way to zoom in on her crotch with absolutely no shame, or even a sense of proper framing. Holt and Kudo are barely developed outside of the fact that Holt is very busty and flirtatious with Saybil, which is odd considering that Saybil has no discernable personality whatsoever. Kudo is…a lizard. That's about it.    Nobody will ever mistake Grimoire of Zero for great television, and it says something that I went nearly five years before remembering that I spent a whole season watching and reviewing the show, but it was a decent fantasy anime all things considered. Dawn of the Witch hasn't elicited any reaction from me whatsoever, which is a very poor place for a series premiere to find itself in. Maybe the show will pick up once the new cast finds its footing, or if Zero and Mercenary return to liven up the proceedings. If that isn't the case, though, then Dawn of the Witch seems destined to be overshadowed by its older sibling, and it isn't like GoZ cast all that large of a shadow in the first place.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                If you weren't aware, The Dawn of the Witch is set in the same world as Grimoire of Zero, although I don't think that's any impediment to just jumping in here. There are probably some world-building elements that work better if you're familiar with Grimoire of Zero, and that particular book does get a mention in this episode, but it's otherwise a pretty standard sword-and-sorcery setup, with beastpeople (known as beastfallen), magic users, witch hunters, and a vaguely Medieval sensibility. Well, and there's the headmaster of a magic school named Albus, but maybe we won't dwell on that.    This episode suffers most from two things: being very much about setting the stage for the more interesting things to come and Loux being kind of annoying. Loux could be Beatrice's cousin from Re: Zero in some ways, and I do think the choice to use the archaic informal second person (thee/thou/thy) largely works for her attitude of superiority. She's absolutely the kind of person who would deliberately speak informally to everyone just to show that she considers herself above them, something that Hort and Saybil notice when she leaves them behind to go chase witch hunters. But she's the sort of character who could wear with length of use, which could be an issue if she's got too much time in the spotlight.    The fact that Loux is also used for the bottom half of the fanservice may also rub some people the wrong way. We get plenty of shots of her crotch as she sits with her legs splayed, which is mostly noticeable because of how ridiculous her skirt's design is. Hort takes over the top half of the fanservice with her shirt that's patterned so that her breasts look like a wrapped present, and it is kind of amusing how obviously the art is trying to have it all by the way Hort is always shown boobs-first while Loux is shown thighs-first. Mostly the issue is that Loux, despite being 300 years old, looks pretty darn prepubescent, because really, she can sit however is most comfortable for her. Not that Saybil notices any of this, being about as blank a slate as you can get and having no discernable personality whatsoever. It's frankly the least believable part of the episode that Hort likes him so much.    Mostly this episode just sort of exists. There are some hints that the story could improve once the tedious set up is finished, so this probably isn't one to just write off immediately. But on the other hand, Goodreads assures me that I've read the first volume of the manga version and I can't remember a darn thing about it. Make of that what you will.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               This show exists in a weird bit of adaptation limbo. It's based on a series of light novels that are themselves a sequel to the Grimoire of Zero novel series. I'm one of the 10 people who watched and still vaguely remember the 2017 Grimoire anime, but that show only covered the first couple volumes of a much longer story. So while I recognize some returning characters and understand the basic makeup of this particular fantasy world, I could not tell you how we got from the adventures of Tony the Tiger and his pint-sized witch gremlin to this new status quo. The good news is this is largely a new story, and anything immediately important is explained pretty quickly in this episode, so newcomers and non-LN readers alike should be able to follow along. The bad news is that doesn't make this episode any more interesting or entertaining.    The big issue with this new series is that it's centered on, by far, its least engaging character. Saybil's amnesia and mysterious past are supposed to entice you to learn more about him, but in practice he's a dead-eyed cipher who intakes exposition and outputs nothing of interest. Nearly any other character introduced here would be more engaging to follow as a protagonist, with the possible exception of the titular Witch of the Dawn, Loux. On top of being a 300-year-old little girl who can't stop flashing her panties to the camera, she's just an annoying presence who's only tolerable when she's acting her age instead of playing up her miniscule appearance. So the thought of watching her mentor our deadweight lead is deathly unappealing. That stands in stark contrast to Mercenary and Zero's dynamic in the first series, and it makes me question why these two are our leads when there's some perfectly engaging characters right next to them.    Maybe that's just because we barely get any time with Holt or Kudo so they don't have a chance to disappoint us, but just on the surface they both strike me as way more active, layered characters to build your story around. Holt is a star magic pupil who seemingly comes from a harsh background where she learned to put on a kind smile to avoid confrontation, which raises questions about her past that actually make her more interesting, unlike Saybil. Kudo, meanwhile, is a rough-mannered beast-man who nonetheless has a strong sense of justice and acts selflessly in his own way. Hell, just in this episode it's brought up that witches used to sacrifice beast-people, so the idea of one studying magic to become a witch is a rock-solid concept that all but begs for further exploration. Why, then, is his entire story this episode offscreen? Is has to be more interesting than watching our amnesiac sadboi hero vomit on a cart ride.    That's what really makes this premiere frustrating, on its own and as a follow-up to Grimoire of Zero. I know there's an interesting fantasy world behind all this, with a rich history just waiting to be explored, and presumably even more new things that have happened since the first anime wrapped up. If this were just some generic isekai world I could write it off as a dull waste of time and be done, but there's so much potential here that is just being left to rot. I might stick around for another episode or two, just to see if the elements I liked get some actual focus, but I can't give this much of a recommendation right now.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          3 comments       Jujutsu Kaisen Stage Play's Video Introduces Cast in Costume   Apr 15, 07:02 3 comments                 live-action    Ryūji Satō, Ryosuke Miura star in July-August play ― A press conference for the stage play of Gege Akutami's Jujutsu Kaisen manga introduced the production's promotional video, main cast, and other details on Wednesday.

There was a lot of walking and talking, camping and talking, and so on, and I just wasn't having fun watching them banter. There wasn't much sense of a connection and any playfulness felt forced.    Maybe someone who already knows and likes Grimoire of Zero will get more out of Dawn of the Witch. For me, it feels like wasted potential.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                While I've never felt the need to go back and rewatch the Grimoire of Zero, I do have fond memories of the little witch and her giant teddy bear of a mercenary. So returning to this world, with or without Zero in the drivers seat, is a lot of fun. There are a lot of familiar faces (it's great to see Albus all grown up) and it's interesting to see how everything has progressed since the last time we were here.    As fun as all the connections are, the basic story is perfectly understandable even if you've never seen Grimoire of Zero. Our viewpoint character, Saybil, is an amnesic magic student (though, in a twist on the trope, the memory loss happened three years previously). His personal conflict is simple: he's the school's worst mage and if he can't improve he'll be kicked out of the academy. If this happens, his knowledge of magic will be erased from his mind—basically reverting him right back to his post-amnesia state.    Then we have the titular Dawn Witch herself, a 300-year-old with the body of a little girl. While I could do without the constant panty shots, she is an intriguing character. Though egotistical and entitled, she seems to have the wisdom to match. Her connection to her staff is likewise interesting—as is everyone's reactions to how she uses a witch-killing weapon for everyday menial tasks.    The only issue I had with the show is that it really needs to lay out some of its proper nouns and a bit more of its history. While terms like “mage” and “witch” are thrown about, we don't get any clear answer on the difference between them (if any exists). And while we know there was a war between witches and the church, a bit more of the specifics would help us understand the trouble our heroes have already found themselves in with the Witch Hunters. But, all in all, this episode lays some solid ground work and makes me want to see not only what is to come for Sable and Loux but how Zero is connected to everything as well.      James Beckett  Rating:                I feel a little embarrassed, because it wasn't more than a week ago that I suddenly found myself thinking, “Man, remember Grimoire of Zero?” I hadn't thought about the show in years, not since I reviewed it, but for some reason I found myself feeling ever so slightly nostalgic for the flawed but fun fantasy adventure. “I wonder whatever happened to that big ol' cat-man and his tiny witch girlfriend?” And yet, I was completely unaware going into Dawn of the Witch that this was actually a sequel to Grimoire of Zero, and it took me a minute to even realize it. I must have zoned out a little during the OP, since Zero and Mercenary make very clear and obvious appearances in it, but it was right around the part where a wolf-man named Holdem was yelling about a woman named Albus that I started to connect the dots.    Dawn of the Witch is a really direct sequel, as it turns out, despite jumping ahead a number of years in the timeline, not to mention the major shakeup in visual style on account of the new production team. I had to go back to watch the end of GoZ to refresh my memory, but that series does indeed end with young Albus starting up a brand-new magic academy in Wenias, and promising to build a world where witches and humans can live in peace. At the start of Dawn of the Witch, it seems like she's making headway on that goal, too, though there's still a long way to go. This is what gets our four main characters started on their journey, and it's also where my issues with Dawn of the Witch really take hold.    While it was surprisingly fun to catch up with this universe and see what's become of some of the characters since Grimoire ended, this premiere just doesn't do a great job of getting me to give a damn about its own story and cast. Saybil is a total nothing of a protagonist, and Loux is the grating and unlikable inverse of Zero. It doesn't help that the camera goes out of its way to zoom in on her crotch with absolutely no shame, or even a sense of proper framing. Holt and Kudo are barely developed outside of the fact that Holt is very busty and flirtatious with Saybil, which is odd considering that Saybil has no discernable personality whatsoever. Kudo is…a lizard. That's about it.    Nobody will ever mistake Grimoire of Zero for great television, and it says something that I went nearly five years before remembering that I spent a whole season watching and reviewing the show, but it was a decent fantasy anime all things considered. Dawn of the Witch hasn't elicited any reaction from me whatsoever, which is a very poor place for a series premiere to find itself in. Maybe the show will pick up once the new cast finds its footing, or if Zero and Mercenary return to liven up the proceedings. If that isn't the case, though, then Dawn of the Witch seems destined to be overshadowed by its older sibling, and it isn't like GoZ cast all that large of a shadow in the first place.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                If you weren't aware, The Dawn of the Witch is set in the same world as Grimoire of Zero, although I don't think that's any impediment to just jumping in here. There are probably some world-building elements that work better if you're familiar with Grimoire of Zero, and that particular book does get a mention in this episode, but it's otherwise a pretty standard sword-and-sorcery setup, with beastpeople (known as beastfallen), magic users, witch hunters, and a vaguely Medieval sensibility. Well, and there's the headmaster of a magic school named Albus, but maybe we won't dwell on that.    This episode suffers most from two things: being very much about setting the stage for the more interesting things to come and Loux being kind of annoying. Loux could be Beatrice's cousin from Re: Zero in some ways, and I do think the choice to use the archaic informal second person (thee/thou/thy) largely works for her attitude of superiority. She's absolutely the kind of person who would deliberately speak informally to everyone just to show that she considers herself above them, something that Hort and Saybil notice when she leaves them behind to go chase witch hunters. But she's the sort of character who could wear with length of use, which could be an issue if she's got too much time in the spotlight.    The fact that Loux is also used for the bottom half of the fanservice may also rub some people the wrong way. We get plenty of shots of her crotch as she sits with her legs splayed, which is mostly noticeable because of how ridiculous her skirt's design is. Hort takes over the top half of the fanservice with her shirt that's patterned so that her breasts look like a wrapped present, and it is kind of amusing how obviously the art is trying to have it all by the way Hort is always shown boobs-first while Loux is shown thighs-first. Mostly the issue is that Loux, despite being 300 years old, looks pretty darn prepubescent, because really, she can sit however is most comfortable for her. Not that Saybil notices any of this, being about as blank a slate as you can get and having no discernable personality whatsoever. It's frankly the least believable part of the episode that Hort likes him so much.    Mostly this episode just sort of exists. There are some hints that the story could improve once the tedious set up is finished, so this probably isn't one to just write off immediately. But on the other hand, Goodreads assures me that I've read the first volume of the manga version and I can't remember a darn thing about it. Make of that what you will.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               This show exists in a weird bit of adaptation limbo. It's based on a series of light novels that are themselves a sequel to the Grimoire of Zero novel series. I'm one of the 10 people who watched and still vaguely remember the 2017 Grimoire anime, but that show only covered the first couple volumes of a much longer story. So while I recognize some returning characters and understand the basic makeup of this particular fantasy world, I could not tell you how we got from the adventures of Tony the Tiger and his pint-sized witch gremlin to this new status quo. The good news is this is largely a new story, and anything immediately important is explained pretty quickly in this episode, so newcomers and non-LN readers alike should be able to follow along. The bad news is that doesn't make this episode any more interesting or entertaining.    The big issue with this new series is that it's centered on, by far, its least engaging character. Saybil's amnesia and mysterious past are supposed to entice you to learn more about him, but in practice he's a dead-eyed cipher who intakes exposition and outputs nothing of interest. Nearly any other character introduced here would be more engaging to follow as a protagonist, with the possible exception of the titular Witch of the Dawn, Loux. On top of being a 300-year-old little girl who can't stop flashing her panties to the camera, she's just an annoying presence who's only tolerable when she's acting her age instead of playing up her miniscule appearance. So the thought of watching her mentor our deadweight lead is deathly unappealing. That stands in stark contrast to Mercenary and Zero's dynamic in the first series, and it makes me question why these two are our leads when there's some perfectly engaging characters right next to them.    Maybe that's just because we barely get any time with Holt or Kudo so they don't have a chance to disappoint us, but just on the surface they both strike me as way more active, layered characters to build your story around. Holt is a star magic pupil who seemingly comes from a harsh background where she learned to put on a kind smile to avoid confrontation, which raises questions about her past that actually make her more interesting, unlike Saybil. Kudo, meanwhile, is a rough-mannered beast-man who nonetheless has a strong sense of justice and acts selflessly in his own way. Hell, just in this episode it's brought up that witches used to sacrifice beast-people, so the idea of one studying magic to become a witch is a rock-solid concept that all but begs for further exploration. Why, then, is his entire story this episode offscreen? Is has to be more interesting than watching our amnesiac sadboi hero vomit on a cart ride.    That's what really makes this premiere frustrating, on its own and as a follow-up to Grimoire of Zero. I know there's an interesting fantasy world behind all this, with a rich history just waiting to be explored, and presumably even more new things that have happened since the first anime wrapped up. If this were just some generic isekai world I could write it off as a dull waste of time and be done, but there's so much potential here that is just being left to rot. I might stick around for another episode or two, just to see if the elements I liked get some actual focus, but I can't give this much of a recommendation right now.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          3 comments       Jujutsu Kaisen Stage Play's Video Introduces Cast in Costume   Apr 15, 07:02 3 comments                 live-action    Ryūji Satō, Ryosuke Miura star in July-August play ― A press conference for the stage play of Gege Akutami's Jujutsu Kaisen manga introduced the production's promotional video, main cast, and other details on Wednesday.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Dawn of the Witch   Apr  8th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Dawn of the Witch ?                     Community score: 3.5              What is this?   The world is now at peace after having endured a conflict between the church and witches for 500 years. However, embers of war still burn in some regions of the world. Cervil is a hopeless student at the Kingdom of Wenias' College of Magic. Cervil has somehow lost all memory of his time before attending the college. The school's headmaster Albus sends him for special training to the southern part of the continent, where persecution against witches runs strong.    The Dawn of the Witch is based on Kakeru Kobashiri's light novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Dawn of the Witch did not make the best first impression on me. We're deep into premiere season, it's late, I'm tired, etc, and I'm out of patience for shows that introduces its female characters either thighs/crotch first or tits first. I have zero familiarity with Grimoire of Zero, and while this is a standalone spinoff, I definitely got the nagging feeling I was supposed to be familiar with at least a few of these faces.    Once I was ready to forgive the show its trespasses, I did actually find a lot to draw me in. The story starts at a magic academy in a region where magic is accepted, thanks to the end of a war several centuries ago. However, since there are still places where mages are treated as other, the academy's best student, worst student, and a 300-year-old witch with the body of a ten-year-old and garter-clad thighs are going on what boils down to a humanitarian mission to build a safe home for them. Oh, and Saybil, the worst student, needs this mission to be successful, or else he'll lose what memories he's accumulated since developing amnesia three years ago.    It's a decent sentiment with a good heart, and I was surprised by a clunky-but-well-intentioned moment when Saybil called his travel companion out on her microaggressions against their beastfallen classmate. And yet, it just doesn't quite gel. Not because the fan service was particularly obtrusive—other than those crotch-first and boob-first intros, it was actually quite low-key—but because there's just no chemistry between the characters. There was a lot of walking and talking, camping and talking, and so on, and I just wasn't having fun watching them banter. There wasn't much sense of a connection and any playfulness felt forced.    Maybe someone who already knows and likes Grimoire of Zero will get more out of Dawn of the Witch. For me, it feels like wasted potential.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                While I've never felt the need to go back and rewatch the Grimoire of Zero, I do have fond memories of the little witch and her giant teddy bear of a mercenary. So returning to this world, with or without Zero in the drivers seat, is a lot of fun. There are a lot of familiar faces (it's great to see Albus all grown up) and it's interesting to see how everything has progressed since the last time we were here.    As fun as all the connections are, the basic story is perfectly understandable even if you've never seen Grimoire of Zero.

Though egotistical and entitled, she seems to have the wisdom to match. Her connection to her staff is likewise interesting—as is everyone's reactions to how she uses a witch-killing weapon for everyday menial tasks.

It's frankly the least believable part of the episode that Hort likes him so much.    Mostly this episode just sort of exists. There are some hints that the story could improve once the tedious set up is finished, so this probably isn't one to just write off immediately. But on the other hand, Goodreads assures me that I've read the first volume of the manga version and I can't remember a darn thing about it. Make of that what you will.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               This show exists in a weird bit of adaptation limbo. It's based on a series of light novels that are themselves a sequel to the Grimoire of Zero novel series. I'm one of the 10 people who watched and still vaguely remember the 2017 Grimoire anime, but that show only covered the first couple volumes of a much longer story. So while I recognize some returning characters and understand the basic makeup of this particular fantasy world, I could not tell you how we got from the adventures of Tony the Tiger and his pint-sized witch gremlin to this new status quo. The good news is this is largely a new story, and anything immediately important is explained pretty quickly in this episode, so newcomers and non-LN readers alike should be able to follow along. The bad news is that doesn't make this episode any more interesting or entertaining.    The big issue with this new series is that it's centered on, by far, its least engaging character. Saybil's amnesia and mysterious past are supposed to entice you to learn more about him, but in practice he's a dead-eyed cipher who intakes exposition and outputs nothing of interest. Nearly any other character introduced here would be more engaging to follow as a protagonist, with the possible exception of the titular Witch of the Dawn, Loux. On top of being a 300-year-old little girl who can't stop flashing her panties to the camera, she's just an annoying presence who's only tolerable when she's acting her age instead of playing up her miniscule appearance. So the thought of watching her mentor our deadweight lead is deathly unappealing. That stands in stark contrast to Mercenary and Zero's dynamic in the first series, and it makes me question why these two are our leads when there's some perfectly engaging characters right next to them.    Maybe that's just because we barely get any time with Holt or Kudo so they don't have a chance to disappoint us, but just on the surface they both strike me as way more active, layered characters to build your story around. Holt is a star magic pupil who seemingly comes from a harsh background where she learned to put on a kind smile to avoid confrontation, which raises questions about her past that actually make her more interesting, unlike Saybil. Kudo, meanwhile, is a rough-mannered beast-man who nonetheless has a strong sense of justice and acts selflessly in his own way. Hell, just in this episode it's brought up that witches used to sacrifice beast-people, so the idea of one studying magic to become a witch is a rock-solid concept that all but begs for further exploration. Why, then, is his entire story this episode offscreen? Is has to be more interesting than watching our amnesiac sadboi hero vomit on a cart ride.    That's what really makes this premiere frustrating, on its own and as a follow-up to Grimoire of Zero. I know there's an interesting fantasy world behind all this, with a rich history just waiting to be explored, and presumably even more new things that have happened since the first anime wrapped up. If this were just some generic isekai world I could write it off as a dull waste of time and be done, but there's so much potential here that is just being left to rot. I might stick around for another episode or two, just to see if the elements I liked get some actual focus, but I can't give this much of a recommendation right now.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Dawn of the Witch   Apr  8th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Dawn of the Witch ?                     Community score: 3.5              What is this?   The world is now at peace after having endured a conflict between the church and witches for 500 years. However, embers of war still burn in some regions of the world. Cervil is a hopeless student at the Kingdom of Wenias' College of Magic. Cervil has somehow lost all memory of his time before attending the college. The school's headmaster Albus sends him for special training to the southern part of the continent, where persecution against witches runs strong.    The Dawn of the Witch is based on Kakeru Kobashiri's light novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Dawn of the Witch did not make the best first impression on me. We're deep into premiere season, it's late, I'm tired, etc, and I'm out of patience for shows that introduces its female characters either thighs/crotch first or tits first. I have zero familiarity with Grimoire of Zero, and while this is a standalone spinoff, I definitely got the nagging feeling I was supposed to be familiar with at least a few of these faces.    Once I was ready to forgive the show its trespasses, I did actually find a lot to draw me in. The story starts at a magic academy in a region where magic is accepted, thanks to the end of a war several centuries ago. However, since there are still places where mages are treated as other, the academy's best student, worst student, and a 300-year-old witch with the body of a ten-year-old and garter-clad thighs are going on what boils down to a humanitarian mission to build a safe home for them. Oh, and Saybil, the worst student, needs this mission to be successful, or else he'll lose what memories he's accumulated since developing amnesia three years ago.    It's a decent sentiment with a good heart, and I was surprised by a clunky-but-well-intentioned moment when Saybil called his travel companion out on her microaggressions against their beastfallen classmate. And yet, it just doesn't quite gel. Not because the fan service was particularly obtrusive—other than those crotch-first and boob-first intros, it was actually quite low-key—but because there's just no chemistry between the characters. There was a lot of walking and talking, camping and talking, and so on, and I just wasn't having fun watching them banter. There wasn't much sense of a connection and any playfulness felt forced.    Maybe someone who already knows and likes Grimoire of Zero will get more out of Dawn of the Witch. For me, it feels like wasted potential.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                While I've never felt the need to go back and rewatch the Grimoire of Zero, I do have fond memories of the little witch and her giant teddy bear of a mercenary. So returning to this world, with or without Zero in the drivers seat, is a lot of fun. There are a lot of familiar faces (it's great to see Albus all grown up) and it's interesting to see how everything has progressed since the last time we were here.    As fun as all the connections are, the basic story is perfectly understandable even if you've never seen Grimoire of Zero. Our viewpoint character, Saybil, is an amnesic magic student (though, in a twist on the trope, the memory loss happened three years previously). His personal conflict is simple: he's the school's worst mage and if he can't improve he'll be kicked out of the academy. If this happens, his knowledge of magic will be erased from his mind—basically reverting him right back to his post-amnesia state.    Then we have the titular Dawn Witch herself, a 300-year-old with the body of a little girl. While I could do without the constant panty shots, she is an intriguing character. Though egotistical and entitled, she seems to have the wisdom to match. Her connection to her staff is likewise interesting—as is everyone's reactions to how she uses a witch-killing weapon for everyday menial tasks.    The only issue I had with the show is that it really needs to lay out some of its proper nouns and a bit more of its history. While terms like “mage” and “witch” are thrown about, we don't get any clear answer on the difference between them (if any exists). And while we know there was a war between witches and the church, a bit more of the specifics would help us understand the trouble our heroes have already found themselves in with the Witch Hunters. But, all in all, this episode lays some solid ground work and makes me want to see not only what is to come for Sable and Loux but how Zero is connected to everything as well.      James Beckett  Rating:                I feel a little embarrassed, because it wasn't more than a week ago that I suddenly found myself thinking, “Man, remember Grimoire of Zero?” I hadn't thought about the show in years, not since I reviewed it, but for some reason I found myself feeling ever so slightly nostalgic for the flawed but fun fantasy adventure. “I wonder whatever happened to that big ol' cat-man and his tiny witch girlfriend?” And yet, I was completely unaware going into Dawn of the Witch that this was actually a sequel to Grimoire of Zero, and it took me a minute to even realize it. I must have zoned out a little during the OP, since Zero and Mercenary make very clear and obvious appearances in it, but it was right around the part where a wolf-man named Holdem was yelling about a woman named Albus that I started to connect the dots.    Dawn of the Witch is a really direct sequel, as it turns out, despite jumping ahead a number of years in the timeline, not to mention the major shakeup in visual style on account of the new production team. I had to go back to watch the end of GoZ to refresh my memory, but that series does indeed end with young Albus starting up a brand-new magic academy in Wenias, and promising to build a world where witches and humans can live in peace. At the start of Dawn of the Witch, it seems like she's making headway on that goal, too, though there's still a long way to go. This is what gets our four main characters started on their journey, and it's also where my issues with Dawn of the Witch really take hold.    While it was surprisingly fun to catch up with this universe and see what's become of some of the characters since Grimoire ended, this premiere just doesn't do a great job of getting me to give a damn about its own story and cast. Saybil is a total nothing of a protagonist, and Loux is the grating and unlikable inverse of Zero. It doesn't help that the camera goes out of its way to zoom in on her crotch with absolutely no shame, or even a sense of proper framing. Holt and Kudo are barely developed outside of the fact that Holt is very busty and flirtatious with Saybil, which is odd considering that Saybil has no discernable personality whatsoever. Kudo is…a lizard. That's about it.    Nobody will ever mistake Grimoire of Zero for great television, and it says something that I went nearly five years before remembering that I spent a whole season watching and reviewing the show, but it was a decent fantasy anime all things considered. Dawn of the Witch hasn't elicited any reaction from me whatsoever, which is a very poor place for a series premiere to find itself in. Maybe the show will pick up once the new cast finds its footing, or if Zero and Mercenary return to liven up the proceedings. If that isn't the case, though, then Dawn of the Witch seems destined to be overshadowed by its older sibling, and it isn't like GoZ cast all that large of a shadow in the first place.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                If you weren't aware, The Dawn of the Witch is set in the same world as Grimoire of Zero, although I don't think that's any impediment to just jumping in here. There are probably some world-building elements that work better if you're familiar with Grimoire of Zero, and that particular book does get a mention in this episode, but it's otherwise a pretty standard sword-and-sorcery setup, with beastpeople (known as beastfallen), magic users, witch hunters, and a vaguely Medieval sensibility. Well, and there's the headmaster of a magic school named Albus, but maybe we won't dwell on that.    This episode suffers most from two things: being very much about setting the stage for the more interesting things to come and Loux being kind of annoying. Loux could be Beatrice's cousin from Re: Zero in some ways, and I do think the choice to use the archaic informal second person (thee/thou/thy) largely works for her attitude of superiority. She's absolutely the kind of person who would deliberately speak informally to everyone just to show that she considers herself above them, something that Hort and Saybil notice when she leaves them behind to go chase witch hunters. But she's the sort of character who could wear with length of use, which could be an issue if she's got too much time in the spotlight.    The fact that Loux is also used for the bottom half of the fanservice may also rub some people the wrong way. We get plenty of shots of her crotch as she sits with her legs splayed, which is mostly noticeable because of how ridiculous her skirt's design is. Hort takes over the top half of the fanservice with her shirt that's patterned so that her breasts look like a wrapped present, and it is kind of amusing how obviously the art is trying to have it all by the way Hort is always shown boobs-first while Loux is shown thighs-first. Mostly the issue is that Loux, despite being 300 years old, looks pretty darn prepubescent, because really, she can sit however is most comfortable for her. Not that Saybil notices any of this, being about as blank a slate as you can get and having no discernable personality whatsoever.

Maybe that's just because we barely get any time with Holt or Kudo so they don't have a chance to disappoint us, but just on the surface they both strike me as way more active, layered characters to build your story around. Holt is a star magic pupil who seemingly comes from a harsh background where she learned to put on a kind smile to avoid confrontation, which raises questions about her past that actually make her more interesting, unlike Saybil. Kudo, meanwhile, is a rough-mannered beast-man who nonetheless has a strong sense of justice and acts selflessly in his own way. Hell, just in this episode it's brought up that witches used to sacrifice beast-people, so the idea of one studying magic to become a witch is a rock-solid concept that all but begs for further exploration. Why, then, is his entire story this episode offscreen? Is has to be more interesting than watching our amnesiac sadboi hero vomit on a cart ride.    That's what really makes this premiere frustrating, on its own and as a follow-up to Grimoire of Zero. I know there's an interesting fantasy world behind all this, with a rich history just waiting to be explored, and presumably even more new things that have happened since the first anime wrapped up. If this were just some generic isekai world I could write it off as a dull waste of time and be done, but there's so much potential here that is just being left to rot. I might stick around for another episode or two, just to see if the elements I liked get some actual focus, but I can't give this much of a recommendation right now.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 3.5              What is this?   The world is now at peace after having endured a conflict between the church and witches for 500 years. However, embers of war still burn in some regions of the world. Cervil is a hopeless student at the Kingdom of Wenias' College of Magic. Cervil has somehow lost all memory of his time before attending the college. The school's headmaster Albus sends him for special training to the southern part of the continent, where persecution against witches runs strong.    The Dawn of the Witch is based on Kakeru Kobashiri's light novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Dawn of the Witch did not make the best first impression on me. We're deep into premiere season, it's late, I'm tired, etc, and I'm out of patience for shows that introduces its female characters either thighs/crotch first or tits first. I have zero familiarity with Grimoire of Zero, and while this is a standalone spinoff, I definitely got the nagging feeling I was supposed to be familiar with at least a few of these faces.    Once I was ready to forgive the show its trespasses, I did actually find a lot to draw me in. The story starts at a magic academy in a region where magic is accepted, thanks to the end of a war several centuries ago. However, since there are still places where mages are treated as other, the academy's best student, worst student, and a 300-year-old witch with the body of a ten-year-old and garter-clad thighs are going on what boils down to a humanitarian mission to build a safe home for them. Oh, and Saybil, the worst student, needs this mission to be successful, or else he'll lose what memories he's accumulated since developing amnesia three years ago.    It's a decent sentiment with a good heart, and I was surprised by a clunky-but-well-intentioned moment when Saybil called his travel companion out on her microaggressions against their beastfallen classmate. And yet, it just doesn't quite gel. Not because the fan service was particularly obtrusive—other than those crotch-first and boob-first intros, it was actually quite low-key—but because there's just no chemistry between the characters. There was a lot of walking and talking, camping and talking, and so on, and I just wasn't having fun watching them banter. There wasn't much sense of a connection and any playfulness felt forced.    Maybe someone who already knows and likes Grimoire of Zero will get more out of Dawn of the Witch. For me, it feels like wasted potential.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                While I've never felt the need to go back and rewatch the Grimoire of Zero, I do have fond memories of the little witch and her giant teddy bear of a mercenary. So returning to this world, with or without Zero in the drivers seat, is a lot of fun. There are a lot of familiar faces (it's great to see Albus all grown up) and it's interesting to see how everything has progressed since the last time we were here.    As fun as all the connections are, the basic story is perfectly understandable even if you've never seen Grimoire of Zero. Our viewpoint character, Saybil, is an amnesic magic student (though, in a twist on the trope, the memory loss happened three years previously). His personal conflict is simple: he's the school's worst mage and if he can't improve he'll be kicked out of the academy. If this happens, his knowledge of magic will be erased from his mind—basically reverting him right back to his post-amnesia state.    Then we have the titular Dawn Witch herself, a 300-year-old with the body of a little girl. While I could do without the constant panty shots, she is an intriguing character. Though egotistical and entitled, she seems to have the wisdom to match. Her connection to her staff is likewise interesting—as is everyone's reactions to how she uses a witch-killing weapon for everyday menial tasks.    The only issue I had with the show is that it really needs to lay out some of its proper nouns and a bit more of its history. While terms like “mage” and “witch” are thrown about, we don't get any clear answer on the difference between them (if any exists). And while we know there was a war between witches and the church, a bit more of the specifics would help us understand the trouble our heroes have already found themselves in with the Witch Hunters. But, all in all, this episode lays some solid ground work and makes me want to see not only what is to come for Sable and Loux but how Zero is connected to everything as well.      James Beckett  Rating:                I feel a little embarrassed, because it wasn't more than a week ago that I suddenly found myself thinking, “Man, remember Grimoire of Zero?” I hadn't thought about the show in years, not since I reviewed it, but for some reason I found myself feeling ever so slightly nostalgic for the flawed but fun fantasy adventure. “I wonder whatever happened to that big ol' cat-man and his tiny witch girlfriend?” And yet, I was completely unaware going into Dawn of the Witch that this was actually a sequel to Grimoire of Zero, and it took me a minute to even realize it. I must have zoned out a little during the OP, since Zero and Mercenary make very clear and obvious appearances in it, but it was right around the part where a wolf-man named Holdem was yelling about a woman named Albus that I started to connect the dots.    Dawn of the Witch is a really direct sequel, as it turns out, despite jumping ahead a number of years in the timeline, not to mention the major shakeup in visual style on account of the new production team. I had to go back to watch the end of GoZ to refresh my memory, but that series does indeed end with young Albus starting up a brand-new magic academy in Wenias, and promising to build a world where witches and humans can live in peace. At the start of Dawn of the Witch, it seems like she's making headway on that goal, too, though there's still a long way to go. This is what gets our four main characters started on their journey, and it's also where my issues with Dawn of the Witch really take hold.    While it was surprisingly fun to catch up with this universe and see what's become of some of the characters since Grimoire ended, this premiere just doesn't do a great job of getting me to give a damn about its own story and cast. Saybil is a total nothing of a protagonist, and Loux is the grating and unlikable inverse of Zero. It doesn't help that the camera goes out of its way to zoom in on her crotch with absolutely no shame, or even a sense of proper framing. Holt and Kudo are barely developed outside of the fact that Holt is very busty and flirtatious with Saybil, which is odd considering that Saybil has no discernable personality whatsoever. Kudo is…a lizard. That's about it.    Nobody will ever mistake Grimoire of Zero for great television, and it says something that I went nearly five years before remembering that I spent a whole season watching and reviewing the show, but it was a decent fantasy anime all things considered. Dawn of the Witch hasn't elicited any reaction from me whatsoever, which is a very poor place for a series premiere to find itself in. Maybe the show will pick up once the new cast finds its footing, or if Zero and Mercenary return to liven up the proceedings. If that isn't the case, though, then Dawn of the Witch seems destined to be overshadowed by its older sibling, and it isn't like GoZ cast all that large of a shadow in the first place.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                If you weren't aware, The Dawn of the Witch is set in the same world as Grimoire of Zero, although I don't think that's any impediment to just jumping in here. There are probably some world-building elements that work better if you're familiar with Grimoire of Zero, and that particular book does get a mention in this episode, but it's otherwise a pretty standard sword-and-sorcery setup, with beastpeople (known as beastfallen), magic users, witch hunters, and a vaguely Medieval sensibility. Well, and there's the headmaster of a magic school named Albus, but maybe we won't dwell on that.    This episode suffers most from two things: being very much about setting the stage for the more interesting things to come and Loux being kind of annoying. Loux could be Beatrice's cousin from Re: Zero in some ways, and I do think the choice to use the archaic informal second person (thee/thou/thy) largely works for her attitude of superiority. She's absolutely the kind of person who would deliberately speak informally to everyone just to show that she considers herself above them, something that Hort and Saybil notice when she leaves them behind to go chase witch hunters. But she's the sort of character who could wear with length of use, which could be an issue if she's got too much time in the spotlight.    The fact that Loux is also used for the bottom half of the fanservice may also rub some people the wrong way. We get plenty of shots of her crotch as she sits with her legs splayed, which is mostly noticeable because of how ridiculous her skirt's design is. Hort takes over the top half of the fanservice with her shirt that's patterned so that her breasts look like a wrapped present, and it is kind of amusing how obviously the art is trying to have it all by the way Hort is always shown boobs-first while Loux is shown thighs-first. Mostly the issue is that Loux, despite being 300 years old, looks pretty darn prepubescent, because really, she can sit however is most comfortable for her. Not that Saybil notices any of this, being about as blank a slate as you can get and having no discernable personality whatsoever. It's frankly the least believable part of the episode that Hort likes him so much.    Mostly this episode just sort of exists. There are some hints that the story could improve once the tedious set up is finished, so this probably isn't one to just write off immediately. But on the other hand, Goodreads assures me that I've read the first volume of the manga version and I can't remember a darn thing about it. Make of that what you will.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               This show exists in a weird bit of adaptation limbo. It's based on a series of light novels that are themselves a sequel to the Grimoire of Zero novel series. I'm one of the 10 people who watched and still vaguely remember the 2017 Grimoire anime, but that show only covered the first couple volumes of a much longer story. So while I recognize some returning characters and understand the basic makeup of this particular fantasy world, I could not tell you how we got from the adventures of Tony the Tiger and his pint-sized witch gremlin to this new status quo. The good news is this is largely a new story, and anything immediately important is explained pretty quickly in this episode, so newcomers and non-LN readers alike should be able to follow along. The bad news is that doesn't make this episode any more interesting or entertaining.    The big issue with this new series is that it's centered on, by far, its least engaging character. Saybil's amnesia and mysterious past are supposed to entice you to learn more about him, but in practice he's a dead-eyed cipher who intakes exposition and outputs nothing of interest. Nearly any other character introduced here would be more engaging to follow as a protagonist, with the possible exception of the titular Witch of the Dawn, Loux. On top of being a 300-year-old little girl who can't stop flashing her panties to the camera, she's just an annoying presence who's only tolerable when she's acting her age instead of playing up her miniscule appearance. So the thought of watching her mentor our deadweight lead is deathly unappealing. That stands in stark contrast to Mercenary and Zero's dynamic in the first series, and it makes me question why these two are our leads when there's some perfectly engaging characters right next to them.

The Dawn of the Witch is based on Kakeru Kobashiri's light novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Dawn of the Witch did not make the best first impression on me. We're deep into premiere season, it's late, I'm tired, etc, and I'm out of patience for shows that introduces its female characters either thighs/crotch first or tits first. I have zero familiarity with Grimoire of Zero, and while this is a standalone spinoff, I definitely got the nagging feeling I was supposed to be familiar with at least a few of these faces.    Once I was ready to forgive the show its trespasses, I did actually find a lot to draw me in. The story starts at a magic academy in a region where magic is accepted, thanks to the end of a war several centuries ago. However, since there are still places where mages are treated as other, the academy's best student, worst student, and a 300-year-old witch with the body of a ten-year-old and garter-clad thighs are going on what boils down to a humanitarian mission to build a safe home for them. Oh, and Saybil, the worst student, needs this mission to be successful, or else he'll lose what memories he's accumulated since developing amnesia three years ago.    It's a decent sentiment with a good heart, and I was surprised by a clunky-but-well-intentioned moment when Saybil called his travel companion out on her microaggressions against their beastfallen classmate. And yet, it just doesn't quite gel. Not because the fan service was particularly obtrusive—other than those crotch-first and boob-first intros, it was actually quite low-key—but because there's just no chemistry between the characters. There was a lot of walking and talking, camping and talking, and so on, and I just wasn't having fun watching them banter. There wasn't much sense of a connection and any playfulness felt forced.    Maybe someone who already knows and likes Grimoire of Zero will get more out of Dawn of the Witch. For me, it feels like wasted potential.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                While I've never felt the need to go back and rewatch the Grimoire of Zero, I do have fond memories of the little witch and her giant teddy bear of a mercenary. So returning to this world, with or without Zero in the drivers seat, is a lot of fun. There are a lot of familiar faces (it's great to see Albus all grown up) and it's interesting to see how everything has progressed since the last time we were here.    As fun as all the connections are, the basic story is perfectly understandable even if you've never seen Grimoire of Zero. Our viewpoint character, Saybil, is an amnesic magic student (though, in a twist on the trope, the memory loss happened three years previously). His personal conflict is simple: he's the school's worst mage and if he can't improve he'll be kicked out of the academy. If this happens, his knowledge of magic will be erased from his mind—basically reverting him right back to his post-amnesia state.    Then we have the titular Dawn Witch herself, a 300-year-old with the body of a little girl. While I could do without the constant panty shots, she is an intriguing character. Though egotistical and entitled, she seems to have the wisdom to match. Her connection to her staff is likewise interesting—as is everyone's reactions to how she uses a witch-killing weapon for everyday menial tasks.    The only issue I had with the show is that it really needs to lay out some of its proper nouns and a bit more of its history. While terms like “mage” and “witch” are thrown about, we don't get any clear answer on the difference between them (if any exists). And while we know there was a war between witches and the church, a bit more of the specifics would help us understand the trouble our heroes have already found themselves in with the Witch Hunters. But, all in all, this episode lays some solid ground work and makes me want to see not only what is to come for Sable and Loux but how Zero is connected to everything as well.      James Beckett  Rating:                I feel a little embarrassed, because it wasn't more than a week ago that I suddenly found myself thinking, “Man, remember Grimoire of Zero?” I hadn't thought about the show in years, not since I reviewed it, but for some reason I found myself feeling ever so slightly nostalgic for the flawed but fun fantasy adventure. “I wonder whatever happened to that big ol' cat-man and his tiny witch girlfriend?” And yet, I was completely unaware going into Dawn of the Witch that this was actually a sequel to Grimoire of Zero, and it took me a minute to even realize it. I must have zoned out a little during the OP, since Zero and Mercenary make very clear and obvious appearances in it, but it was right around the part where a wolf-man named Holdem was yelling about a woman named Albus that I started to connect the dots.    Dawn of the Witch is a really direct sequel, as it turns out, despite jumping ahead a number of years in the timeline, not to mention the major shakeup in visual style on account of the new production team. I had to go back to watch the end of GoZ to refresh my memory, but that series does indeed end with young Albus starting up a brand-new magic academy in Wenias, and promising to build a world where witches and humans can live in peace. At the start of Dawn of the Witch, it seems like she's making headway on that goal, too, though there's still a long way to go. This is what gets our four main characters started on their journey, and it's also where my issues with Dawn of the Witch really take hold.    While it was surprisingly fun to catch up with this universe and see what's become of some of the characters since Grimoire ended, this premiere just doesn't do a great job of getting me to give a damn about its own story and cast. Saybil is a total nothing of a protagonist, and Loux is the grating and unlikable inverse of Zero. It doesn't help that the camera goes out of its way to zoom in on her crotch with absolutely no shame, or even a sense of proper framing. Holt and Kudo are barely developed outside of the fact that Holt is very busty and flirtatious with Saybil, which is odd considering that Saybil has no discernable personality whatsoever. Kudo is…a lizard. That's about it.    Nobody will ever mistake Grimoire of Zero for great television, and it says something that I went nearly five years before remembering that I spent a whole season watching and reviewing the show, but it was a decent fantasy anime all things considered. Dawn of the Witch hasn't elicited any reaction from me whatsoever, which is a very poor place for a series premiere to find itself in. Maybe the show will pick up once the new cast finds its footing, or if Zero and Mercenary return to liven up the proceedings. If that isn't the case, though, then Dawn of the Witch seems destined to be overshadowed by its older sibling, and it isn't like GoZ cast all that large of a shadow in the first place.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                If you weren't aware, The Dawn of the Witch is set in the same world as Grimoire of Zero, although I don't think that's any impediment to just jumping in here. There are probably some world-building elements that work better if you're familiar with Grimoire of Zero, and that particular book does get a mention in this episode, but it's otherwise a pretty standard sword-and-sorcery setup, with beastpeople (known as beastfallen), magic users, witch hunters, and a vaguely Medieval sensibility. Well, and there's the headmaster of a magic school named Albus, but maybe we won't dwell on that.    This episode suffers most from two things: being very much about setting the stage for the more interesting things to come and Loux being kind of annoying. Loux could be Beatrice's cousin from Re: Zero in some ways, and I do think the choice to use the archaic informal second person (thee/thou/thy) largely works for her attitude of superiority. She's absolutely the kind of person who would deliberately speak informally to everyone just to show that she considers herself above them, something that Hort and Saybil notice when she leaves them behind to go chase witch hunters. But she's the sort of character who could wear with length of use, which could be an issue if she's got too much time in the spotlight.    The fact that Loux is also used for the bottom half of the fanservice may also rub some people the wrong way. We get plenty of shots of her crotch as she sits with her legs splayed, which is mostly noticeable because of how ridiculous her skirt's design is. Hort takes over the top half of the fanservice with her shirt that's patterned so that her breasts look like a wrapped present, and it is kind of amusing how obviously the art is trying to have it all by the way Hort is always shown boobs-first while Loux is shown thighs-first. Mostly the issue is that Loux, despite being 300 years old, looks pretty darn prepubescent, because really, she can sit however is most comfortable for her. Not that Saybil notices any of this, being about as blank a slate as you can get and having no discernable personality whatsoever. It's frankly the least believable part of the episode that Hort likes him so much.    Mostly this episode just sort of exists. There are some hints that the story could improve once the tedious set up is finished, so this probably isn't one to just write off immediately. But on the other hand, Goodreads assures me that I've read the first volume of the manga version and I can't remember a darn thing about it. Make of that what you will.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               This show exists in a weird bit of adaptation limbo. It's based on a series of light novels that are themselves a sequel to the Grimoire of Zero novel series. I'm one of the 10 people who watched and still vaguely remember the 2017 Grimoire anime, but that show only covered the first couple volumes of a much longer story. So while I recognize some returning characters and understand the basic makeup of this particular fantasy world, I could not tell you how we got from the adventures of Tony the Tiger and his pint-sized witch gremlin to this new status quo. The good news is this is largely a new story, and anything immediately important is explained pretty quickly in this episode, so newcomers and non-LN readers alike should be able to follow along. The bad news is that doesn't make this episode any more interesting or entertaining.    The big issue with this new series is that it's centered on, by far, its least engaging character. Saybil's amnesia and mysterious past are supposed to entice you to learn more about him, but in practice he's a dead-eyed cipher who intakes exposition and outputs nothing of interest. Nearly any other character introduced here would be more engaging to follow as a protagonist, with the possible exception of the titular Witch of the Dawn, Loux. On top of being a 300-year-old little girl who can't stop flashing her panties to the camera, she's just an annoying presence who's only tolerable when she's acting her age instead of playing up her miniscule appearance. So the thought of watching her mentor our deadweight lead is deathly unappealing. That stands in stark contrast to Mercenary and Zero's dynamic in the first series, and it makes me question why these two are our leads when there's some perfectly engaging characters right next to them.    Maybe that's just because we barely get any time with Holt or Kudo so they don't have a chance to disappoint us, but just on the surface they both strike me as way more active, layered characters to build your story around. Holt is a star magic pupil who seemingly comes from a harsh background where she learned to put on a kind smile to avoid confrontation, which raises questions about her past that actually make her more interesting, unlike Saybil. Kudo, meanwhile, is a rough-mannered beast-man who nonetheless has a strong sense of justice and acts selflessly in his own way. Hell, just in this episode it's brought up that witches used to sacrifice beast-people, so the idea of one studying magic to become a witch is a rock-solid concept that all but begs for further exploration. Why, then, is his entire story this episode offscreen? Is has to be more interesting than watching our amnesiac sadboi hero vomit on a cart ride.    That's what really makes this premiere frustrating, on its own and as a follow-up to Grimoire of Zero. I know there's an interesting fantasy world behind all this, with a rich history just waiting to be explored, and presumably even more new things that have happened since the first anime wrapped up. If this were just some generic isekai world I could write it off as a dull waste of time and be done, but there's so much potential here that is just being left to rot. I might stick around for another episode or two, just to see if the elements I liked get some actual focus, but I can't give this much of a recommendation right now.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives   ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

But, all in all, this episode lays some solid ground work and makes me want to see not only what is to come for Sable and Loux but how Zero is connected to everything as well.      James Beckett  Rating:                I feel a little embarrassed, because it wasn't more than a week ago that I suddenly found myself thinking, “Man, remember Grimoire of Zero?” I hadn't thought about the show in years, not since I reviewed it, but for some reason I found myself feeling ever so slightly nostalgic for the flawed but fun fantasy adventure. “I wonder whatever happened to that big ol' cat-man and his tiny witch girlfriend?” And yet, I was completely unaware going into Dawn of the Witch that this was actually a sequel to Grimoire of Zero, and it took me a minute to even realize it. I must have zoned out a little during the OP, since Zero and Mercenary make very clear and obvious appearances in it, but it was right around the part where a wolf-man named Holdem was yelling about a woman named Albus that I started to connect the dots.    Dawn of the Witch is a really direct sequel, as it turns out, despite jumping ahead a number of years in the timeline, not to mention the major shakeup in visual style on account of the new production team. I had to go back to watch the end of GoZ to refresh my memory, but that series does indeed end with young Albus starting up a brand-new magic academy in Wenias, and promising to build a world where witches and humans can live in peace. At the start of Dawn of the Witch, it seems like she's making headway on that goal, too, though there's still a long way to go. This is what gets our four main characters started on their journey, and it's also where my issues with Dawn of the Witch really take hold.    While it was surprisingly fun to catch up with this universe and see what's become of some of the characters since Grimoire ended, this premiere just doesn't do a great job of getting me to give a damn about its own story and cast. Saybil is a total nothing of a protagonist, and Loux is the grating and unlikable inverse of Zero. It doesn't help that the camera goes out of its way to zoom in on her crotch with absolutely no shame, or even a sense of proper framing. Holt and Kudo are barely developed outside of the fact that Holt is very busty and flirtatious with Saybil, which is odd considering that Saybil has no discernable personality whatsoever. Kudo is…a lizard. That's about it.    Nobody will ever mistake Grimoire of Zero for great television, and it says something that I went nearly five years before remembering that I spent a whole season watching and reviewing the show, but it was a decent fantasy anime all things considered. Dawn of the Witch hasn't elicited any reaction from me whatsoever, which is a very poor place for a series premiere to find itself in. Maybe the show will pick up once the new cast finds its footing, or if Zero and Mercenary return to liven up the proceedings. If that isn't the case, though, then Dawn of the Witch seems destined to be overshadowed by its older sibling, and it isn't like GoZ cast all that large of a shadow in the first place.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                If you weren't aware, The Dawn of the Witch is set in the same world as Grimoire of Zero, although I don't think that's any impediment to just jumping in here. There are probably some world-building elements that work better if you're familiar with Grimoire of Zero, and that particular book does get a mention in this episode, but it's otherwise a pretty standard sword-and-sorcery setup, with beastpeople (known as beastfallen), magic users, witch hunters, and a vaguely Medieval sensibility. Well, and there's the headmaster of a magic school named Albus, but maybe we won't dwell on that.    This episode suffers most from two things: being very much about setting the stage for the more interesting things to come and Loux being kind of annoying. Loux could be Beatrice's cousin from Re: Zero in some ways, and I do think the choice to use the archaic informal second person (thee/thou/thy) largely works for her attitude of superiority. She's absolutely the kind of person who would deliberately speak informally to everyone just to show that she considers herself above them, something that Hort and Saybil notice when she leaves them behind to go chase witch hunters. But she's the sort of character who could wear with length of use, which could be an issue if she's got too much time in the spotlight.    The fact that Loux is also used for the bottom half of the fanservice may also rub some people the wrong way. We get plenty of shots of her crotch as she sits with her legs splayed, which is mostly noticeable because of how ridiculous her skirt's design is. Hort takes over the top half of the fanservice with her shirt that's patterned so that her breasts look like a wrapped present, and it is kind of amusing how obviously the art is trying to have it all by the way Hort is always shown boobs-first while Loux is shown thighs-first. Mostly the issue is that Loux, despite being 300 years old, looks pretty darn prepubescent, because really, she can sit however is most comfortable for her. Not that Saybil notices any of this, being about as blank a slate as you can get and having no discernable personality whatsoever. It's frankly the least believable part of the episode that Hort likes him so much.    Mostly this episode just sort of exists. There are some hints that the story could improve once the tedious set up is finished, so this probably isn't one to just write off immediately. But on the other hand, Goodreads assures me that I've read the first volume of the manga version and I can't remember a darn thing about it. Make of that what you will.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               This show exists in a weird bit of adaptation limbo. It's based on a series of light novels that are themselves a sequel to the Grimoire of Zero novel series. I'm one of the 10 people who watched and still vaguely remember the 2017 Grimoire anime, but that show only covered the first couple volumes of a much longer story. So while I recognize some returning characters and understand the basic makeup of this particular fantasy world, I could not tell you how we got from the adventures of Tony the Tiger and his pint-sized witch gremlin to this new status quo. The good news is this is largely a new story, and anything immediately important is explained pretty quickly in this episode, so newcomers and non-LN readers alike should be able to follow along. The bad news is that doesn't make this episode any more interesting or entertaining.    The big issue with this new series is that it's centered on, by far, its least engaging character. Saybil's amnesia and mysterious past are supposed to entice you to learn more about him, but in practice he's a dead-eyed cipher who intakes exposition and outputs nothing of interest. Nearly any other character introduced here would be more engaging to follow as a protagonist, with the possible exception of the titular Witch of the Dawn, Loux. On top of being a 300-year-old little girl who can't stop flashing her panties to the camera, she's just an annoying presence who's only tolerable when she's acting her age instead of playing up her miniscule appearance. So the thought of watching her mentor our deadweight lead is deathly unappealing. That stands in stark contrast to Mercenary and Zero's dynamic in the first series, and it makes me question why these two are our leads when there's some perfectly engaging characters right next to them.    Maybe that's just because we barely get any time with Holt or Kudo so they don't have a chance to disappoint us, but just on the surface they both strike me as way more active, layered characters to build your story around. Holt is a star magic pupil who seemingly comes from a harsh background where she learned to put on a kind smile to avoid confrontation, which raises questions about her past that actually make her more interesting, unlike Saybil. Kudo, meanwhile, is a rough-mannered beast-man who nonetheless has a strong sense of justice and acts selflessly in his own way. Hell, just in this episode it's brought up that witches used to sacrifice beast-people, so the idea of one studying magic to become a witch is a rock-solid concept that all but begs for further exploration. Why, then, is his entire story this episode offscreen? Is has to be more interesting than watching our amnesiac sadboi hero vomit on a cart ride.    That's what really makes this premiere frustrating, on its own and as a follow-up to Grimoire of Zero. I know there's an interesting fantasy world behind all this, with a rich history just waiting to be explored, and presumably even more new things that have happened since the first anime wrapped up. If this were just some generic isekai world I could write it off as a dull waste of time and be done, but there's so much potential here that is just being left to rot. I might stick around for another episode or two, just to see if the elements I liked get some actual focus, but I can't give this much of a recommendation right now.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Black Rock Shooter: Dawn Fall   Apr  4th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Black Rock Shooter: Dawn Fall ?                     Community score: 3.8              What is this?   It is the year 2062, two decades after the failure of a massive workforce automation project. However, Artemis, the artificial intelligence at the core of that project, had decided to attack humanity, and the resulting war laid waste to Earth. A lone girl, Empress, wakes up in an underground laboratory at a base. She is one of three surviving guardians of humanity. However, she has no memories of what came before. All she knows is what a colonel of the peace-building force tells her. Artemis is constructing a space elevator to link the Moon and Earth, and Empress is ordered to destroy the space elevator before its completion. If the elevator is completed, the hordes of giant mechanized forces being mass-produced on the Moon will descend upon Earth.    Black Rock Shooter: Dawn Fall is the latest entry in the Black Rock Shooter franchise and streams on Disney+ in Japan on Sundays.    Note: The series still isn't available for streaming worldwide. Richard Eisenbeis lives in Japan and was able to watch the first episode there, albeit without subtitles.     How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Black Rock Shooter is one of those intellectual properties that I know the name of but little else. Luckily, since Dawn Fall is a reboot set in a completely new universe, that doesn't seem to matter. The setting is one we've all seen before: There's been a robot apocalypse of sorts and now humanity is on its last legs. However, there are a few AI who continue to fight for the human race—including our titular heroine, Black Rock Shooter.    This anime starts with the classic go-to for creating an audience POV character: amnesia. Not only does it allow Black Rock Shooter to ask all the dumb questions that any person living in the fictional world would already know the answers to, it also allows her to be super powerful without any explanation. Of course, the big drawback here is that, without memories, Black Rock Shooter has very little in the way of personality. All she knows is that she has to reach “lighthouse no. 8” and that she's not willing to abandon those in her care regardless of the tactical situation. It's a solid enough starting point, but for the moment she's not much of a character.    Unfortunately, neither are the other three main characters of this episode. We have the stereotypical protective big brother/sick little sister duo and a hardass military commander. Honestly, there's nothing more to them than that—which leaves the action to carry the show.    More than anything else, this first episode is a series of fight scenes. All of them are decently choreographed and show off the above average CG animation used in the show, further bolstered by a surprisingly rocking soundtrack. However, the black, brown, and grey color pallet can make it hard to see what is happening at times—especially during the fights that occur at night.    All in all, I'm not sure what to think of Dawn Fall. So far, it's little more than a pile of clichés—in both setting and characters. Maybe it will turn into something special down the line but this premiere is largely unimpressive.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          3 comments       Jujutsu Kaisen Stage Play's Video Introduces Cast in Costume   Apr 15, 07:02 3 comments                 live-action    Ryūji Satō, Ryosuke Miura star in July-August play ― A press conference for the stage play of Gege Akutami's Jujutsu Kaisen manga introduced the production's promotional video, main cast, and other details on Wednesday.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Black Rock Shooter: Dawn Fall   Apr  4th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Black Rock Shooter: Dawn Fall ?                     Community score: 3.8              What is this?   It is the year 2062, two decades after the failure of a massive workforce automation project. However, Artemis, the artificial intelligence at the core of that project, had decided to attack humanity, and the resulting war laid waste to Earth. A lone girl, Empress, wakes up in an underground laboratory at a base. She is one of three surviving guardians of humanity. However, she has no memories of what came before. All she knows is what a colonel of the peace-building force tells her. Artemis is constructing a space elevator to link the Moon and Earth, and Empress is ordered to destroy the space elevator before its completion. If the elevator is completed, the hordes of giant mechanized forces being mass-produced on the Moon will descend upon Earth.    Black Rock Shooter: Dawn Fall is the latest entry in the Black Rock Shooter franchise and streams on Disney+ in Japan on Sundays.    Note: The series still isn't available for streaming worldwide. Richard Eisenbeis lives in Japan and was able to watch the first episode there, albeit without subtitles.     How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Black Rock Shooter is one of those intellectual properties that I know the name of but little else. Luckily, since Dawn Fall is a reboot set in a completely new universe, that doesn't seem to matter. The setting is one we've all seen before: There's been a robot apocalypse of sorts and now humanity is on its last legs. However, there are a few AI who continue to fight for the human race—including our titular heroine, Black Rock Shooter.    This anime starts with the classic go-to for creating an audience POV character: amnesia. Not only does it allow Black Rock Shooter to ask all the dumb questions that any person living in the fictional world would already know the answers to, it also allows her to be super powerful without any explanation. Of course, the big drawback here is that, without memories, Black Rock Shooter has very little in the way of personality. All she knows is that she has to reach “lighthouse no. 8” and that she's not willing to abandon those in her care regardless of the tactical situation. It's a solid enough starting point, but for the moment she's not much of a character.    Unfortunately, neither are the other three main characters of this episode. We have the stereotypical protective big brother/sick little sister duo and a hardass military commander. Honestly, there's nothing more to them than that—which leaves the action to carry the show.    More than anything else, this first episode is a series of fight scenes. All of them are decently choreographed and show off the above average CG animation used in the show, further bolstered by a surprisingly rocking soundtrack. However, the black, brown, and grey color pallet can make it hard to see what is happening at times—especially during the fights that occur at night.    All in all, I'm not sure what to think of Dawn Fall. So far, it's little more than a pile of clichés—in both setting and characters. Maybe it will turn into something special down the line but this premiere is largely unimpressive.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          3 comments       Jujutsu Kaisen Stage Play's Video Introduces Cast in Costume   Apr 15, 07:02 3 comments                 live-action    Ryūji Satō, Ryosuke Miura star in July-August play ― A press conference for the stage play of Gege Akutami's Jujutsu Kaisen manga introduced the production's promotional video, main cast, and other details on Wednesday.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Black Rock Shooter: Dawn Fall   Apr  4th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Black Rock Shooter: Dawn Fall ?                     Community score: 3.8              What is this?   It is the year 2062, two decades after the failure of a massive workforce automation project. However, Artemis, the artificial intelligence at the core of that project, had decided to attack humanity, and the resulting war laid waste to Earth. A lone girl, Empress, wakes up in an underground laboratory at a base. She is one of three surviving guardians of humanity. However, she has no memories of what came before. All she knows is what a colonel of the peace-building force tells her. Artemis is constructing a space elevator to link the Moon and Earth, and Empress is ordered to destroy the space elevator before its completion. If the elevator is completed, the hordes of giant mechanized forces being mass-produced on the Moon will descend upon Earth.    Black Rock Shooter: Dawn Fall is the latest entry in the Black Rock Shooter franchise and streams on Disney+ in Japan on Sundays.    Note: The series still isn't available for streaming worldwide. Richard Eisenbeis lives in Japan and was able to watch the first episode there, albeit without subtitles.     How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Black Rock Shooter is one of those intellectual properties that I know the name of but little else. Luckily, since Dawn Fall is a reboot set in a completely new universe, that doesn't seem to matter. The setting is one we've all seen before: There's been a robot apocalypse of sorts and now humanity is on its last legs. However, there are a few AI who continue to fight for the human race—including our titular heroine, Black Rock Shooter.    This anime starts with the classic go-to for creating an audience POV character: amnesia. Not only does it allow Black Rock Shooter to ask all the dumb questions that any person living in the fictional world would already know the answers to, it also allows her to be super powerful without any explanation. Of course, the big drawback here is that, without memories, Black Rock Shooter has very little in the way of personality. All she knows is that she has to reach “lighthouse no. 8” and that she's not willing to abandon those in her care regardless of the tactical situation. It's a solid enough starting point, but for the moment she's not much of a character.    Unfortunately, neither are the other three main characters of this episode. We have the stereotypical protective big brother/sick little sister duo and a hardass military commander. Honestly, there's nothing more to them than that—which leaves the action to carry the show.    More than anything else, this first episode is a series of fight scenes. All of them are decently choreographed and show off the above average CG animation used in the show, further bolstered by a surprisingly rocking soundtrack. However, the black, brown, and grey color pallet can make it hard to see what is happening at times—especially during the fights that occur at night.    All in all, I'm not sure what to think of Dawn Fall. So far, it's little more than a pile of clichés—in both setting and characters. Maybe it will turn into something special down the line but this premiere is largely unimpressive.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          3 comments       Jujutsu Kaisen Stage Play's Video Introduces Cast in Costume   Apr 15, 07:02 3 comments                 live-action    Ryūji Satō, Ryosuke Miura star in July-August play ― A press conference for the stage play of Gege Akutami's Jujutsu Kaisen manga introduced the production's promotional video, main cast, and other details on Wednesday.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Black Rock Shooter: Dawn Fall   Apr  4th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Black Rock Shooter: Dawn Fall ?                     Community score: 3.8              What is this?   It is the year 2062, two decades after the failure of a massive workforce automation project. However, Artemis, the artificial intelligence at the core of that project, had decided to attack humanity, and the resulting war laid waste to Earth. A lone girl, Empress, wakes up in an underground laboratory at a base. She is one of three surviving guardians of humanity. However, she has no memories of what came before. All she knows is what a colonel of the peace-building force tells her. Artemis is constructing a space elevator to link the Moon and Earth, and Empress is ordered to destroy the space elevator before its completion. If the elevator is completed, the hordes of giant mechanized forces being mass-produced on the Moon will descend upon Earth.    Black Rock Shooter: Dawn Fall is the latest entry in the Black Rock Shooter franchise and streams on Disney+ in Japan on Sundays.    Note: The series still isn't available for streaming worldwide. Richard Eisenbeis lives in Japan and was able to watch the first episode there, albeit without subtitles.     How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Black Rock Shooter is one of those intellectual properties that I know the name of but little else. Luckily, since Dawn Fall is a reboot set in a completely new universe, that doesn't seem to matter. The setting is one we've all seen before: There's been a robot apocalypse of sorts and now humanity is on its last legs. However, there are a few AI who continue to fight for the human race—including our titular heroine, Black Rock Shooter.    This anime starts with the classic go-to for creating an audience POV character: amnesia. Not only does it allow Black Rock Shooter to ask all the dumb questions that any person living in the fictional world would already know the answers to, it also allows her to be super powerful without any explanation. Of course, the big drawback here is that, without memories, Black Rock Shooter has very little in the way of personality. All she knows is that she has to reach “lighthouse no. 8” and that she's not willing to abandon those in her care regardless of the tactical situation. It's a solid enough starting point, but for the moment she's not much of a character.    Unfortunately, neither are the other three main characters of this episode. We have the stereotypical protective big brother/sick little sister duo and a hardass military commander. Honestly, there's nothing more to them than that—which leaves the action to carry the show.    More than anything else, this first episode is a series of fight scenes. All of them are decently choreographed and show off the above average CG animation used in the show, further bolstered by a surprisingly rocking soundtrack. However, the black, brown, and grey color pallet can make it hard to see what is happening at times—especially during the fights that occur at night.    All in all, I'm not sure what to think of Dawn Fall. So far, it's little more than a pile of clichés—in both setting and characters. Maybe it will turn into something special down the line but this premiere is largely unimpressive.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

All she knows is that she has to reach “lighthouse no. 8” and that she's not willing to abandon those in her care regardless of the tactical situation. It's a solid enough starting point, but for the moment she's not much of a character.    Unfortunately, neither are the other three main characters of this episode. We have the stereotypical protective big brother/sick little sister duo and a hardass military commander. Honestly, there's nothing more to them than that—which leaves the action to carry the show.    More than anything else, this first episode is a series of fight scenes. All of them are decently choreographed and show off the above average CG animation used in the show, further bolstered by a surprisingly rocking soundtrack. However, the black, brown, and grey color pallet can make it hard to see what is happening at times—especially during the fights that occur at night.    All in all, I'm not sure what to think of Dawn Fall. So far, it's little more than a pile of clichés—in both setting and characters. Maybe it will turn into something special down the line but this premiere is largely unimpressive.

Community score: 3.8              What is this?   It is the year 2062, two decades after the failure of a massive workforce automation project. However, Artemis, the artificial intelligence at the core of that project, had decided to attack humanity, and the resulting war laid waste to Earth. A lone girl, Empress, wakes up in an underground laboratory at a base. She is one of three surviving guardians of humanity. However, she has no memories of what came before. All she knows is what a colonel of the peace-building force tells her. Artemis is constructing a space elevator to link the Moon and Earth, and Empress is ordered to destroy the space elevator before its completion. If the elevator is completed, the hordes of giant mechanized forces being mass-produced on the Moon will descend upon Earth.    Black Rock Shooter: Dawn Fall is the latest entry in the Black Rock Shooter franchise and streams on Disney+ in Japan on Sundays.    Note: The series still isn't available for streaming worldwide. Richard Eisenbeis lives in Japan and was able to watch the first episode there, albeit without subtitles.     How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Black Rock Shooter is one of those intellectual properties that I know the name of but little else. Luckily, since Dawn Fall is a reboot set in a completely new universe, that doesn't seem to matter. The setting is one we've all seen before: There's been a robot apocalypse of sorts and now humanity is on its last legs. However, there are a few AI who continue to fight for the human race—including our titular heroine, Black Rock Shooter.    This anime starts with the classic go-to for creating an audience POV character: amnesia. Not only does it allow Black Rock Shooter to ask all the dumb questions that any person living in the fictional world would already know the answers to, it also allows her to be super powerful without any explanation. Of course, the big drawback here is that, without memories, Black Rock Shooter has very little in the way of personality. All she knows is that she has to reach “lighthouse no. 8” and that she's not willing to abandon those in her care regardless of the tactical situation. It's a solid enough starting point, but for the moment she's not much of a character.    Unfortunately, neither are the other three main characters of this episode.

Interest A Couple of Cuckoos Launches Heroine Popularity Contest Ahead of Anime's Debut   posted on 2022-04-14 21:45 UTC-8 by Kim Morrissy         Wedding ceremony illustrations also revealed    Miki Yoshikawa's A Couple of Cuckoos (Kakkō no Iinazuke) manga launched its first heroine popularity contest in Kodansha's Weekly Shōnen Magazine on Wednesday, ahead of the television anime's April 23 debut. The winning girl will get a ""solo photo collection""; publication details will be announced with the results of the contest.       In addition, the magazine revealed wedding ceremony illustrations of the four heroines Erika Amano, Hiro Segawa, and Sachi Umino, and Ai Mochizuki (pictured above).    Miki Yoshikawa  (Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches, Yankee-kun to Megane-chan) launched the A Couple of Cuckoos (Kakkō no Iinazuke) manga in Kodansha's Weekly Shōnen Magazine in January 2020. Kodansha Comics publishes the manga in English, and it describes the romantic comedy:    16-year-old super-studier Nagi Umino, second-year student at the Megurogawa Academy high school, was switched at birth. On his way to a dinner to meet his birth parents, he accidentally meets the brash, outspoken, Erika Amano, who is determined to make Nagi her fake boyfriend as she never wants to actually marry. But once Nagi makes it to dinner, he finds his parents have decided to resolve the hospital switch by conveniently having him marry the daughter his birth parents raised...who turns out to be none other than Erika herself!   The anime will premiere in the NUMAnimation programming block on TV Asahi and its affiliates on April 23. Crunchyroll will stream the anime outside Japan. The anime will run for two cours (quarters of the year) with no breaks in between. The spinoff mini anime Kakkō no Iikagen will premiere on Kadokawa Anime's YouTube channel on April 28.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Tiger & Bunny 2   Apr  9th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Tiger & Bunny 2 ?                     Community score: 4.2              What is this?   Sternbild City is home to people called ""Next,"" who use their special abilities to protect the people as superheroes. These heroes solve cases and save lives so they can wear sponsor logos or acquire ""hero points."" Their activities are documented on the popular program ""Hero TV,"" which picks the ""King of Heroes"" in a yearly ranking. The veteran hero Wild Tiger has always preferred to work alone, but now he's been assigned the rookie Barnaby Brooks Jr., who has a different perspective on being a superhero.    Tiger & Bunny 2 is a sequel to the Tiger & Bunny original anime and streams on Netflix.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Put on your ponchos everyone, because I am here to gush like a broken water main. Tiger & Bunny has always had two core audiences: adult men and fujoshi. Now that my colleague Richard has so kindly provided the perspective of the former, I am here to provide the latter, because nothing makes me devolve into a pile of heart-eyed mush like Kotetsu, Barnaby, and the absolutely canonical love they share. I've joked about my obsession with anime dads before – how do you think that started? It sure as hell wasn't Gendo Ikari.    Yes, my love for Tiger & Bunny runs deep and true, and I've been on tenterhooks waiting for the new season since they announced it. Would justice be served, or would they do my boys dirty? By the end of the second movie, I was starting to get exhausted by Kotetsu's seemingly endless cycle of retiring and/or getting fired and then getting back to work, and wanted to see him move on. Until the trailer came out I was half-convinced it would be fully 3DCG. Luckily, none of my dooming and glooming turned out to be correct, and the boys truly are back in town.    At this point I could say, “It's like they never left,” because really they've never left my heart, not even for a second, but that wouldn't be strictly accurate. An unspecified but significant amount of time has passed. New heroes have joined the network. Some of the characters have visibly aged, especially Kaede, who looks to have entered her teenage years full throttle. The episode draws deliberate parallels to the first series' premiere, but in smart ways that draw attention both to how much is the same, but also how much has changed. Kotetsu and Barnaby have come so far! Instead of going home and drinking himself into a stupor, Kotetsu is calling his daughter and doing yoga. Instead of obsessing over Ouroboros, Barnaby has found a new passion in growing potted plants, replacing the cold sterility of his old setup with leafy green vitality. It's reassuring that these two aren't just repeating old patterns, and are genuinely developing as people. My heart is full.    But the more things change, the more they stay the same, and the two of them also spend most of the episode bickering over petty disagreements only to make up in the end when it matters most. Because they're married and you cannot convince me otherwise so don't even try. The episode also hints at the cyclical nature of life – Dragon Kid, once the baby of the group, has a protégé, and an arrogant young hero calls Barnaby “old man.”    Tiger & Bunny 2 is not newbie-friendly. The action in the first episode as depicted is mediocre, with no big set pieces and mostly a way to do a roll-call of the heroes. Instead, it's wall-to-wall character beats meant to help us remember where we started, and show us how far we've come.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               In the aftermath of Tiger & Bunny The Movie -The Rising-, faith in the superhero industry has continued to fall even as the number of heroes has grown worldwide. To combat this, Hero TV has instituted a buddy system for their superheroes—allowing for newcomers and experienced heroes alike to learn better teamwork as they compete for a shared trophy. Of course, there is no pair more experienced than Tiger & Barnaby. Yet, while some things change, others stay very much the same.    This first episode is all about setting up the new status quo, beginning with a prolonged chase scene that introduces us to all the principal players—including a few new ones—as well as their powers. We also see that Kotetsu's own powers are continuing to fade, forcing him to rely ever more on his power suit—effectively holding Barnaby back from scoring points.    But what's important to note is that while Kotetsu and Barnaby fight for most of this episode, it isn't because of anything related to their professional lives. Barnaby is not mad that Kotetsu's powers are fading nor that he didn't show up to stop the armored truck because he got distracted helping a kid get his balloon back—they simply are very different people who get on each others' nerves despite their time working together, constantly bickering with each other to a childish degree.    Yet, the climax shows us that, when it comes to being heroes, they are far more in-sync than any other pair. Before Kotetsu even removes his helmet, Barnaby is already flanking the villain, ready to take advantage of the distraction he knows is coming. And when it comes, he acts, taking down the villain in an instant. It's solid visual storytelling. It lets us know why the pair are the core of NC's superhero community.    Then we have the bonus of the villain of the week who has the power to remove kinetic energy from an object—effectively stopping anything he comes into contact with. He basically serves as the episode's mini-mystery: “How do you defeat a person you can't touch or shoot.” The answer is a clever one: he has to know an attack is coming to stop it. Therefore, he can't stop an object outside of his line of sight—especially not if it's moving at the speed of a hundred-power kick. There's no time to react. Fun stuff.    In the end, while it's far from the best episode of Tiger & Bunny, the season premiere does its job well by laying the groundwork for all that's to come while still showing that our heroic duo has grown—even if they themselves may not know it.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          3 comments       Jujutsu Kaisen Stage Play's Video Introduces Cast in Costume   Apr 15, 07:02 3 comments                 live-action    Ryūji Satō, Ryosuke Miura star in July-August play ― A press conference for the stage play of Gege Akutami's Jujutsu Kaisen manga introduced the production's promotional video, main cast, and other details on Wednesday.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Tiger & Bunny 2   Apr  9th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Tiger & Bunny 2 ?                     Community score: 4.2              What is this?   Sternbild City is home to people called ""Next,"" who use their special abilities to protect the people as superheroes. These heroes solve cases and save lives so they can wear sponsor logos or acquire ""hero points."" Their activities are documented on the popular program ""Hero TV,"" which picks the ""King of Heroes"" in a yearly ranking. The veteran hero Wild Tiger has always preferred to work alone, but now he's been assigned the rookie Barnaby Brooks Jr., who has a different perspective on being a superhero.    Tiger & Bunny 2 is a sequel to the Tiger & Bunny original anime and streams on Netflix.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Put on your ponchos everyone, because I am here to gush like a broken water main. Tiger & Bunny has always had two core audiences: adult men and fujoshi. Now that my colleague Richard has so kindly provided the perspective of the former, I am here to provide the latter, because nothing makes me devolve into a pile of heart-eyed mush like Kotetsu, Barnaby, and the absolutely canonical love they share. I've joked about my obsession with anime dads before – how do you think that started? It sure as hell wasn't Gendo Ikari.    Yes, my love for Tiger & Bunny runs deep and true, and I've been on tenterhooks waiting for the new season since they announced it. Would justice be served, or would they do my boys dirty? By the end of the second movie, I was starting to get exhausted by Kotetsu's seemingly endless cycle of retiring and/or getting fired and then getting back to work, and wanted to see him move on. Until the trailer came out I was half-convinced it would be fully 3DCG. Luckily, none of my dooming and glooming turned out to be correct, and the boys truly are back in town.    At this point I could say, “It's like they never left,” because really they've never left my heart, not even for a second, but that wouldn't be strictly accurate. An unspecified but significant amount of time has passed. New heroes have joined the network. Some of the characters have visibly aged, especially Kaede, who looks to have entered her teenage years full throttle. The episode draws deliberate parallels to the first series' premiere, but in smart ways that draw attention both to how much is the same, but also how much has changed. Kotetsu and Barnaby have come so far! Instead of going home and drinking himself into a stupor, Kotetsu is calling his daughter and doing yoga. Instead of obsessing over Ouroboros, Barnaby has found a new passion in growing potted plants, replacing the cold sterility of his old setup with leafy green vitality. It's reassuring that these two aren't just repeating old patterns, and are genuinely developing as people. My heart is full.    But the more things change, the more they stay the same, and the two of them also spend most of the episode bickering over petty disagreements only to make up in the end when it matters most. Because they're married and you cannot convince me otherwise so don't even try. The episode also hints at the cyclical nature of life – Dragon Kid, once the baby of the group, has a protégé, and an arrogant young hero calls Barnaby “old man.”    Tiger & Bunny 2 is not newbie-friendly. The action in the first episode as depicted is mediocre, with no big set pieces and mostly a way to do a roll-call of the heroes. Instead, it's wall-to-wall character beats meant to help us remember where we started, and show us how far we've come.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               In the aftermath of Tiger & Bunny The Movie -The Rising-, faith in the superhero industry has continued to fall even as the number of heroes has grown worldwide. To combat this, Hero TV has instituted a buddy system for their superheroes—allowing for newcomers and experienced heroes alike to learn better teamwork as they compete for a shared trophy. Of course, there is no pair more experienced than Tiger & Barnaby. Yet, while some things change, others stay very much the same.    This first episode is all about setting up the new status quo, beginning with a prolonged chase scene that introduces us to all the principal players—including a few new ones—as well as their powers. We also see that Kotetsu's own powers are continuing to fade, forcing him to rely ever more on his power suit—effectively holding Barnaby back from scoring points.    But what's important to note is that while Kotetsu and Barnaby fight for most of this episode, it isn't because of anything related to their professional lives. Barnaby is not mad that Kotetsu's powers are fading nor that he didn't show up to stop the armored truck because he got distracted helping a kid get his balloon back—they simply are very different people who get on each others' nerves despite their time working together, constantly bickering with each other to a childish degree.    Yet, the climax shows us that, when it comes to being heroes, they are far more in-sync than any other pair. Before Kotetsu even removes his helmet, Barnaby is already flanking the villain, ready to take advantage of the distraction he knows is coming. And when it comes, he acts, taking down the villain in an instant. It's solid visual storytelling. It lets us know why the pair are the core of NC's superhero community.    Then we have the bonus of the villain of the week who has the power to remove kinetic energy from an object—effectively stopping anything he comes into contact with. He basically serves as the episode's mini-mystery: “How do you defeat a person you can't touch or shoot.” The answer is a clever one: he has to know an attack is coming to stop it. Therefore, he can't stop an object outside of his line of sight—especially not if it's moving at the speed of a hundred-power kick. There's no time to react. Fun stuff.    In the end, while it's far from the best episode of Tiger & Bunny, the season premiere does its job well by laying the groundwork for all that's to come while still showing that our heroic duo has grown—even if they themselves may not know it.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          3 comments       Jujutsu Kaisen Stage Play's Video Introduces Cast in Costume   Apr 15, 07:02 3 comments                 live-action    Ryūji Satō, Ryosuke Miura star in July-August play ― A press conference for the stage play of Gege Akutami's Jujutsu Kaisen manga introduced the production's promotional video, main cast, and other details on Wednesday.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Tiger & Bunny 2   Apr  9th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Tiger & Bunny 2 ?                     Community score: 4.2              What is this?   Sternbild City is home to people called ""Next,"" who use their special abilities to protect the people as superheroes. These heroes solve cases and save lives so they can wear sponsor logos or acquire ""hero points."" Their activities are documented on the popular program ""Hero TV,"" which picks the ""King of Heroes"" in a yearly ranking. The veteran hero Wild Tiger has always preferred to work alone, but now he's been assigned the rookie Barnaby Brooks Jr., who has a different perspective on being a superhero.    Tiger & Bunny 2 is a sequel to the Tiger & Bunny original anime and streams on Netflix.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Put on your ponchos everyone, because I am here to gush like a broken water main. Tiger & Bunny has always had two core audiences: adult men and fujoshi. Now that my colleague Richard has so kindly provided the perspective of the former, I am here to provide the latter, because nothing makes me devolve into a pile of heart-eyed mush like Kotetsu, Barnaby, and the absolutely canonical love they share. I've joked about my obsession with anime dads before – how do you think that started? It sure as hell wasn't Gendo Ikari.    Yes, my love for Tiger & Bunny runs deep and true, and I've been on tenterhooks waiting for the new season since they announced it. Would justice be served, or would they do my boys dirty? By the end of the second movie, I was starting to get exhausted by Kotetsu's seemingly endless cycle of retiring and/or getting fired and then getting back to work, and wanted to see him move on. Until the trailer came out I was half-convinced it would be fully 3DCG. Luckily, none of my dooming and glooming turned out to be correct, and the boys truly are back in town.    At this point I could say, “It's like they never left,” because really they've never left my heart, not even for a second, but that wouldn't be strictly accurate. An unspecified but significant amount of time has passed. New heroes have joined the network. Some of the characters have visibly aged, especially Kaede, who looks to have entered her teenage years full throttle. The episode draws deliberate parallels to the first series' premiere, but in smart ways that draw attention both to how much is the same, but also how much has changed. Kotetsu and Barnaby have come so far! Instead of going home and drinking himself into a stupor, Kotetsu is calling his daughter and doing yoga. Instead of obsessing over Ouroboros, Barnaby has found a new passion in growing potted plants, replacing the cold sterility of his old setup with leafy green vitality. It's reassuring that these two aren't just repeating old patterns, and are genuinely developing as people. My heart is full.    But the more things change, the more they stay the same, and the two of them also spend most of the episode bickering over petty disagreements only to make up in the end when it matters most. Because they're married and you cannot convince me otherwise so don't even try. The episode also hints at the cyclical nature of life – Dragon Kid, once the baby of the group, has a protégé, and an arrogant young hero calls Barnaby “old man.”    Tiger & Bunny 2 is not newbie-friendly. The action in the first episode as depicted is mediocre, with no big set pieces and mostly a way to do a roll-call of the heroes. Instead, it's wall-to-wall character beats meant to help us remember where we started, and show us how far we've come.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               In the aftermath of Tiger & Bunny The Movie -The Rising-, faith in the superhero industry has continued to fall even as the number of heroes has grown worldwide. To combat this, Hero TV has instituted a buddy system for their superheroes—allowing for newcomers and experienced heroes alike to learn better teamwork as they compete for a shared trophy. Of course, there is no pair more experienced than Tiger & Barnaby. Yet, while some things change, others stay very much the same.    This first episode is all about setting up the new status quo, beginning with a prolonged chase scene that introduces us to all the principal players—including a few new ones—as well as their powers. We also see that Kotetsu's own powers are continuing to fade, forcing him to rely ever more on his power suit—effectively holding Barnaby back from scoring points.    But what's important to note is that while Kotetsu and Barnaby fight for most of this episode, it isn't because of anything related to their professional lives. Barnaby is not mad that Kotetsu's powers are fading nor that he didn't show up to stop the armored truck because he got distracted helping a kid get his balloon back—they simply are very different people who get on each others' nerves despite their time working together, constantly bickering with each other to a childish degree.    Yet, the climax shows us that, when it comes to being heroes, they are far more in-sync than any other pair. Before Kotetsu even removes his helmet, Barnaby is already flanking the villain, ready to take advantage of the distraction he knows is coming. And when it comes, he acts, taking down the villain in an instant. It's solid visual storytelling. It lets us know why the pair are the core of NC's superhero community.    Then we have the bonus of the villain of the week who has the power to remove kinetic energy from an object—effectively stopping anything he comes into contact with. He basically serves as the episode's mini-mystery: “How do you defeat a person you can't touch or shoot.” The answer is a clever one: he has to know an attack is coming to stop it. Therefore, he can't stop an object outside of his line of sight—especially not if it's moving at the speed of a hundred-power kick. There's no time to react. Fun stuff.    In the end, while it's far from the best episode of Tiger & Bunny, the season premiere does its job well by laying the groundwork for all that's to come while still showing that our heroic duo has grown—even if they themselves may not know it.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          3 comments       Jujutsu Kaisen Stage Play's Video Introduces Cast in Costume   Apr 15, 07:02 3 comments                 live-action    Ryūji Satō, Ryosuke Miura star in July-August play ― A press conference for the stage play of Gege Akutami's Jujutsu Kaisen manga introduced the production's promotional video, main cast, and other details on Wednesday.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Tiger & Bunny 2   Apr  9th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Tiger & Bunny 2 ?                     Community score: 4.2              What is this?   Sternbild City is home to people called ""Next,"" who use their special abilities to protect the people as superheroes. These heroes solve cases and save lives so they can wear sponsor logos or acquire ""hero points."" Their activities are documented on the popular program ""Hero TV,"" which picks the ""King of Heroes"" in a yearly ranking. The veteran hero Wild Tiger has always preferred to work alone, but now he's been assigned the rookie Barnaby Brooks Jr., who has a different perspective on being a superhero.    Tiger & Bunny 2 is a sequel to the Tiger & Bunny original anime and streams on Netflix.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Put on your ponchos everyone, because I am here to gush like a broken water main. Tiger & Bunny has always had two core audiences: adult men and fujoshi. Now that my colleague Richard has so kindly provided the perspective of the former, I am here to provide the latter, because nothing makes me devolve into a pile of heart-eyed mush like Kotetsu, Barnaby, and the absolutely canonical love they share. I've joked about my obsession with anime dads before – how do you think that started? It sure as hell wasn't Gendo Ikari.    Yes, my love for Tiger & Bunny runs deep and true, and I've been on tenterhooks waiting for the new season since they announced it. Would justice be served, or would they do my boys dirty? By the end of the second movie, I was starting to get exhausted by Kotetsu's seemingly endless cycle of retiring and/or getting fired and then getting back to work, and wanted to see him move on. Until the trailer came out I was half-convinced it would be fully 3DCG. Luckily, none of my dooming and glooming turned out to be correct, and the boys truly are back in town.    At this point I could say, “It's like they never left,” because really they've never left my heart, not even for a second, but that wouldn't be strictly accurate. An unspecified but significant amount of time has passed. New heroes have joined the network. Some of the characters have visibly aged, especially Kaede, who looks to have entered her teenage years full throttle. The episode draws deliberate parallels to the first series' premiere, but in smart ways that draw attention both to how much is the same, but also how much has changed. Kotetsu and Barnaby have come so far! Instead of going home and drinking himself into a stupor, Kotetsu is calling his daughter and doing yoga. Instead of obsessing over Ouroboros, Barnaby has found a new passion in growing potted plants, replacing the cold sterility of his old setup with leafy green vitality. It's reassuring that these two aren't just repeating old patterns, and are genuinely developing as people. My heart is full.    But the more things change, the more they stay the same, and the two of them also spend most of the episode bickering over petty disagreements only to make up in the end when it matters most. Because they're married and you cannot convince me otherwise so don't even try. The episode also hints at the cyclical nature of life – Dragon Kid, once the baby of the group, has a protégé, and an arrogant young hero calls Barnaby “old man.”    Tiger & Bunny 2 is not newbie-friendly. The action in the first episode as depicted is mediocre, with no big set pieces and mostly a way to do a roll-call of the heroes. Instead, it's wall-to-wall character beats meant to help us remember where we started, and show us how far we've come.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               In the aftermath of Tiger & Bunny The Movie -The Rising-, faith in the superhero industry has continued to fall even as the number of heroes has grown worldwide. To combat this, Hero TV has instituted a buddy system for their superheroes—allowing for newcomers and experienced heroes alike to learn better teamwork as they compete for a shared trophy. Of course, there is no pair more experienced than Tiger & Barnaby. Yet, while some things change, others stay very much the same.    This first episode is all about setting up the new status quo, beginning with a prolonged chase scene that introduces us to all the principal players—including a few new ones—as well as their powers. We also see that Kotetsu's own powers are continuing to fade, forcing him to rely ever more on his power suit—effectively holding Barnaby back from scoring points.    But what's important to note is that while Kotetsu and Barnaby fight for most of this episode, it isn't because of anything related to their professional lives. Barnaby is not mad that Kotetsu's powers are fading nor that he didn't show up to stop the armored truck because he got distracted helping a kid get his balloon back—they simply are very different people who get on each others' nerves despite their time working together, constantly bickering with each other to a childish degree.    Yet, the climax shows us that, when it comes to being heroes, they are far more in-sync than any other pair. Before Kotetsu even removes his helmet, Barnaby is already flanking the villain, ready to take advantage of the distraction he knows is coming. And when it comes, he acts, taking down the villain in an instant. It's solid visual storytelling. It lets us know why the pair are the core of NC's superhero community.    Then we have the bonus of the villain of the week who has the power to remove kinetic energy from an object—effectively stopping anything he comes into contact with. He basically serves as the episode's mini-mystery: “How do you defeat a person you can't touch or shoot.” The answer is a clever one: he has to know an attack is coming to stop it. Therefore, he can't stop an object outside of his line of sight—especially not if it's moving at the speed of a hundred-power kick. There's no time to react. Fun stuff.    In the end, while it's far from the best episode of Tiger & Bunny, the season premiere does its job well by laying the groundwork for all that's to come while still showing that our heroic duo has grown—even if they themselves may not know it.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Before Kotetsu even removes his helmet, Barnaby is already flanking the villain, ready to take advantage of the distraction he knows is coming. And when it comes, he acts, taking down the villain in an instant. It's solid visual storytelling. It lets us know why the pair are the core of NC's superhero community.    Then we have the bonus of the villain of the week who has the power to remove kinetic energy from an object—effectively stopping anything he comes into contact with. He basically serves as the episode's mini-mystery: “How do you defeat a person you can't touch or shoot.” The answer is a clever one: he has to know an attack is coming to stop it. Therefore, he can't stop an object outside of his line of sight—especially not if it's moving at the speed of a hundred-power kick. There's no time to react. Fun stuff.    In the end, while it's far from the best episode of Tiger & Bunny, the season premiere does its job well by laying the groundwork for all that's to come while still showing that our heroic duo has grown—even if they themselves may not know it.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 4.2              What is this?   Sternbild City is home to people called ""Next,"" who use their special abilities to protect the people as superheroes. These heroes solve cases and save lives so they can wear sponsor logos or acquire ""hero points."" Their activities are documented on the popular program ""Hero TV,"" which picks the ""King of Heroes"" in a yearly ranking. The veteran hero Wild Tiger has always preferred to work alone, but now he's been assigned the rookie Barnaby Brooks Jr., who has a different perspective on being a superhero.    Tiger & Bunny 2 is a sequel to the Tiger & Bunny original anime and streams on Netflix.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Put on your ponchos everyone, because I am here to gush like a broken water main. Tiger & Bunny has always had two core audiences: adult men and fujoshi. Now that my colleague Richard has so kindly provided the perspective of the former, I am here to provide the latter, because nothing makes me devolve into a pile of heart-eyed mush like Kotetsu, Barnaby, and the absolutely canonical love they share. I've joked about my obsession with anime dads before – how do you think that started? It sure as hell wasn't Gendo Ikari.    Yes, my love for Tiger & Bunny runs deep and true, and I've been on tenterhooks waiting for the new season since they announced it. Would justice be served, or would they do my boys dirty? By the end of the second movie, I was starting to get exhausted by Kotetsu's seemingly endless cycle of retiring and/or getting fired and then getting back to work, and wanted to see him move on. Until the trailer came out I was half-convinced it would be fully 3DCG. Luckily, none of my dooming and glooming turned out to be correct, and the boys truly are back in town.    At this point I could say, “It's like they never left,” because really they've never left my heart, not even for a second, but that wouldn't be strictly accurate. An unspecified but significant amount of time has passed. New heroes have joined the network. Some of the characters have visibly aged, especially Kaede, who looks to have entered her teenage years full throttle. The episode draws deliberate parallels to the first series' premiere, but in smart ways that draw attention both to how much is the same, but also how much has changed. Kotetsu and Barnaby have come so far! Instead of going home and drinking himself into a stupor, Kotetsu is calling his daughter and doing yoga. Instead of obsessing over Ouroboros, Barnaby has found a new passion in growing potted plants, replacing the cold sterility of his old setup with leafy green vitality. It's reassuring that these two aren't just repeating old patterns, and are genuinely developing as people. My heart is full.    But the more things change, the more they stay the same, and the two of them also spend most of the episode bickering over petty disagreements only to make up in the end when it matters most. Because they're married and you cannot convince me otherwise so don't even try. The episode also hints at the cyclical nature of life – Dragon Kid, once the baby of the group, has a protégé, and an arrogant young hero calls Barnaby “old man.”    Tiger & Bunny 2 is not newbie-friendly. The action in the first episode as depicted is mediocre, with no big set pieces and mostly a way to do a roll-call of the heroes. Instead, it's wall-to-wall character beats meant to help us remember where we started, and show us how far we've come.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               In the aftermath of Tiger & Bunny The Movie -The Rising-, faith in the superhero industry has continued to fall even as the number of heroes has grown worldwide. To combat this, Hero TV has instituted a buddy system for their superheroes—allowing for newcomers and experienced heroes alike to learn better teamwork as they compete for a shared trophy. Of course, there is no pair more experienced than Tiger & Barnaby. Yet, while some things change, others stay very much the same.    This first episode is all about setting up the new status quo, beginning with a prolonged chase scene that introduces us to all the principal players—including a few new ones—as well as their powers. We also see that Kotetsu's own powers are continuing to fade, forcing him to rely ever more on his power suit—effectively holding Barnaby back from scoring points.    But what's important to note is that while Kotetsu and Barnaby fight for most of this episode, it isn't because of anything related to their professional lives. Barnaby is not mad that Kotetsu's powers are fading nor that he didn't show up to stop the armored truck because he got distracted helping a kid get his balloon back—they simply are very different people who get on each others' nerves despite their time working together, constantly bickering with each other to a childish degree.

Yes, my love for Tiger & Bunny runs deep and true, and I've been on tenterhooks waiting for the new season since they announced it. Would justice be served, or would they do my boys dirty? By the end of the second movie, I was starting to get exhausted by Kotetsu's seemingly endless cycle of retiring and/or getting fired and then getting back to work, and wanted to see him move on. Until the trailer came out I was half-convinced it would be fully 3DCG. Luckily, none of my dooming and glooming turned out to be correct, and the boys truly are back in town.    At this point I could say, “It's like they never left,” because really they've never left my heart, not even for a second, but that wouldn't be strictly accurate. An unspecified but significant amount of time has passed. New heroes have joined the network. Some of the characters have visibly aged, especially Kaede, who looks to have entered her teenage years full throttle. The episode draws deliberate parallels to the first series' premiere, but in smart ways that draw attention both to how much is the same, but also how much has changed. Kotetsu and Barnaby have come so far! Instead of going home and drinking himself into a stupor, Kotetsu is calling his daughter and doing yoga. Instead of obsessing over Ouroboros, Barnaby has found a new passion in growing potted plants, replacing the cold sterility of his old setup with leafy green vitality. It's reassuring that these two aren't just repeating old patterns, and are genuinely developing as people. My heart is full.    But the more things change, the more they stay the same, and the two of them also spend most of the episode bickering over petty disagreements only to make up in the end when it matters most. Because they're married and you cannot convince me otherwise so don't even try. The episode also hints at the cyclical nature of life – Dragon Kid, once the baby of the group, has a protégé, and an arrogant young hero calls Barnaby “old man.”    Tiger & Bunny 2 is not newbie-friendly. The action in the first episode as depicted is mediocre, with no big set pieces and mostly a way to do a roll-call of the heroes. Instead, it's wall-to-wall character beats meant to help us remember where we started, and show us how far we've come.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               In the aftermath of Tiger & Bunny The Movie -The Rising-, faith in the superhero industry has continued to fall even as the number of heroes has grown worldwide. To combat this, Hero TV has instituted a buddy system for their superheroes—allowing for newcomers and experienced heroes alike to learn better teamwork as they compete for a shared trophy. Of course, there is no pair more experienced than Tiger & Barnaby. Yet, while some things change, others stay very much the same.    This first episode is all about setting up the new status quo, beginning with a prolonged chase scene that introduces us to all the principal players—including a few new ones—as well as their powers. We also see that Kotetsu's own powers are continuing to fade, forcing him to rely ever more on his power suit—effectively holding Barnaby back from scoring points.    But what's important to note is that while Kotetsu and Barnaby fight for most of this episode, it isn't because of anything related to their professional lives. Barnaby is not mad that Kotetsu's powers are fading nor that he didn't show up to stop the armored truck because he got distracted helping a kid get his balloon back—they simply are very different people who get on each others' nerves despite their time working together, constantly bickering with each other to a childish degree.    Yet, the climax shows us that, when it comes to being heroes, they are far more in-sync than any other pair. Before Kotetsu even removes his helmet, Barnaby is already flanking the villain, ready to take advantage of the distraction he knows is coming. And when it comes, he acts, taking down the villain in an instant. It's solid visual storytelling. It lets us know why the pair are the core of NC's superhero community.    Then we have the bonus of the villain of the week who has the power to remove kinetic energy from an object—effectively stopping anything he comes into contact with. He basically serves as the episode's mini-mystery: “How do you defeat a person you can't touch or shoot.” The answer is a clever one: he has to know an attack is coming to stop it. Therefore, he can't stop an object outside of his line of sight—especially not if it's moving at the speed of a hundred-power kick. There's no time to react. Fun stuff.    In the end, while it's far from the best episode of Tiger & Bunny, the season premiere does its job well by laying the groundwork for all that's to come while still showing that our heroic duo has grown—even if they themselves may not know it.
