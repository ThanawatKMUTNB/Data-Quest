Interest Help Bojji & Kage Escape the Underworld In Ranking of Kings Escape Room   posted on 2022-04-13 01:45 UTC-8 by Kim Morrissy         Game will run in North Shinjuku's Dramatic Hole from April 29 to May 29    The Ranking of Kings anime is getting a ""dramatic"" escape room, which will run in North Shinjuku's Dramatic Hole from April 29 to May 29. Participants will aid Bojji and Kage as they attempt to break free from the Underworld dungeon, which is rumored to be a place where nobody can escape from.     Yodaka no Record, the game's organizer, describes the ""Escape from the Still-as-death Underworld Dungeon"" game concept as a ""dramatic"" escape room because players will experience events ""far removed from daily life"" as they progress in the dramatic story. The game will feature voices by Minami Hinata (Bojji), Ayumu Murase (Kage), Rina Satou (Hilling), and Takahiro Sakurai (Despa).    Sōsuke Tōka's Ranking of Kings (Ōsama Ranking) manga centers around Bojji, a deaf, powerless prince who cannot even wield a children's sword. He is able to make his first-ever friend, ""Kage"" (shadow) — a literal shadow on the ground who somehow understands Bojji well. The story follows Bojji's coming-of-age as he meets various people in his life, starting with his fateful encounter with Kage.    The manga inspired a television anime that premiered on October 14, and ran for two continuous cours (quarters of the year). Funimation streamed the anime as it aired in Japan, and it is also streaming an English dub.

Interest Help Bojji & Kage Escape the Underworld In Ranking of Kings Escape Room   posted on 2022-04-13 01:45 UTC-8 by Kim Morrissy         Game will run in North Shinjuku's Dramatic Hole from April 29 to May 29    The Ranking of Kings anime is getting a ""dramatic"" escape room, which will run in North Shinjuku's Dramatic Hole from April 29 to May 29. Participants will aid Bojji and Kage as they attempt to break free from the Underworld dungeon, which is rumored to be a place where nobody can escape from.     Yodaka no Record, the game's organizer, describes the ""Escape from the Still-as-death Underworld Dungeon"" game concept as a ""dramatic"" escape room because players will experience events ""far removed from daily life"" as they progress in the dramatic story. The game will feature voices by Minami Hinata (Bojji), Ayumu Murase (Kage), Rina Satou (Hilling), and Takahiro Sakurai (Despa).    Sōsuke Tōka's Ranking of Kings (Ōsama Ranking) manga centers around Bojji, a deaf, powerless prince who cannot even wield a children's sword. He is able to make his first-ever friend, ""Kage"" (shadow) — a literal shadow on the ground who somehow understands Bojji well. The story follows Bojji's coming-of-age as he meets various people in his life, starting with his fateful encounter with Kage.    The manga inspired a television anime that premiered on October 14, and ran for two continuous cours (quarters of the year). Funimation streamed the anime as it aired in Japan, and it is also streaming an English dub.

Interest Help Bojji & Kage Escape the Underworld In Ranking of Kings Escape Room   posted on 2022-04-13 01:45 UTC-8 by Kim Morrissy         Game will run in North Shinjuku's Dramatic Hole from April 29 to May 29    The Ranking of Kings anime is getting a ""dramatic"" escape room, which will run in North Shinjuku's Dramatic Hole from April 29 to May 29. Participants will aid Bojji and Kage as they attempt to break free from the Underworld dungeon, which is rumored to be a place where nobody can escape from.     Yodaka no Record, the game's organizer, describes the ""Escape from the Still-as-death Underworld Dungeon"" game concept as a ""dramatic"" escape room because players will experience events ""far removed from daily life"" as they progress in the dramatic story. The game will feature voices by Minami Hinata (Bojji), Ayumu Murase (Kage), Rina Satou (Hilling), and Takahiro Sakurai (Despa).    Sōsuke Tōka's Ranking of Kings (Ōsama Ranking) manga centers around Bojji, a deaf, powerless prince who cannot even wield a children's sword. He is able to make his first-ever friend, ""Kage"" (shadow) — a literal shadow on the ground who somehow understands Bojji well. The story follows Bojji's coming-of-age as he meets various people in his life, starting with his fateful encounter with Kage.    The manga inspired a television anime that premiered on October 14, and ran for two continuous cours (quarters of the year). Funimation streamed the anime as it aired in Japan, and it is also streaming an English dub.

GN   Jan 26, 01:00 1 comment                 manga    The Girl I Want Is So Handsome! maintains a sense of light playfulness throughout, and it doesn't dip too hard into melodrama for most of the run. ― Like its title suggests, The Girl I Want is So Handsome! is a very basic and straightforward manga. When I was given a chance to review this series, all I wanted was a sweet, gay romance between a shy and bubbly high school student and her cool athletic ...                    review          9 comments       Vampire Dies in No Time 1-12 Streaming   Jan 25, 01:00 9 comments                 anime    The Vampire Dies in No Time is precisely what you'd expect from a series that ends with a dance-off. It's silly, features an inexplicably furry armadillo, and involves vampiric veggies that are scarier to cook than live lobster ― If there's one thing you can say about The Vampire Dies in No Time, it's that it absolutely doesn't lie: within the first few minutes Draluc, the main but by no means only v...                    review          2 comments       Frieren: Beyond Journey's End GN 2   Jan 24, 01:00 2 comments                 manga    All in all, this volume of Frieren: Beyond Journey's End turns out to be just as good—if not better—than the first. ― In general, Frieren: Beyond Journey's End is a manga that utilizes both serialized and standalone storytelling. Sometimes, events may flow naturally from one chapter to the next. Other times, we get a chapter that is unrelated to any overarching narrative. And there are also one-shots...                    review          11 comments       Sing a Bit of Harmony   Jan 23, 01:00 11 comments                 anime    Ahead of its opening in North American theaters, find out why Kim Morrissy calls the new film by Time of Eve director Yasuhiro Yoshiura a ""breezy family-friendly film that's easy to recommend to pretty much anyone."" ― In a year with both Mamoru Hosoda's BELLE and WIT Studio's Vivy -Fluorite Eye's Song-, a story about a singing AI robot doesn't seem like much of a novelty.

I was surprised at how much love, wholesomeness, and affection could be squeezed out from such a dreary and at times lewd premise. ― Despite the rather dark implications of the overall premise, I thought it was just another entry in the growing list of anime that are now making up this “teasing genre.” Than...                    review          2 comments       Came the Mirror & Other Tales GN   Jan 19, 01:00 2 comments                 manga    Even with limited character designs and plots that don't quite hit as hard as they need to in the end, it's hard to fault Rumiko Takahashi's shorter work. ― Even with limited character designs and plots that don't quite hit as hard as they need to in the end, it's hard to fault Rumiko Takahashi's shorter work.

But what exactly are the decisions that got us here? ― Unlike animation, video games are in large part a disposable medium. Games once hailed as era-defining breakthrough titles upon their release often become antiquated and awkward within a little less than a decade. And so we see a plethora of remakes and ...                    review          8 comments       Selection Project   Jan 17, 01:00 8 comments                 anime    When it's not bogging itself down with tonal filler, Selection Project is filling the central character conflict of its reality-show story with some of the wildest plot twists I've encountered in a series like this recently. ― A crowded field like idol anime means a series needs to have its own particular identity to stand out, and Selection Project's approach seems to be to pitch itself as at least ...                    review          3 comments       Shikizakura Episodes 1-12   Jan 16, 01:00 3 comments                 anime    As far as what it's playing with in terms of influence and genre stylings, Shikizakura is tokusatsu as all heck. ― Tokusatsu has enjoyed a run of increased availability and visibility among English-speaking audiences, particularly those adjacent to anime fan circles, for a good several years now.

Pretty Cure at times felt like it was actively distancing itself from its predecessor. But lest we ...                    review          6 comments       Backflip!!

That may be the number on this latest flagship entry, but this is a vast and complicated series with many, many...                    review          5 comments       The Lines that Define Me GN 1   Feb 22, 01:00 5 comments                 manga    One young man's foray into classic Japanese art might just be his path to healing. ― Although The Lines that Define Me is about suiboku-ga, or traditional Japanese ink painting, that's really only the vehicle through which the characters express themselves. Aoyama, the protagonist, is clearly not doing well from the moment we meet him setting up for an art exhibit – he's worryingly lightheaded as he ...                    review          10 comments       The Two Lions GN   Feb 21, 01:00 10 comments                 manga    One of Furuya's strengths as a storyteller is the ability to carefully and quietly capture real emotions of the sort that we typically hide inside ourselves; the insecurities that grow unchecked and cause people to misunderstand us. ― The Two Lions is Nagisa Furuya's third English language release – Renta brought over S & N and Kodansha released My Summer of You – and if there's one thing all three t...                    game review          25 comments       REVIEW: Pokémon Legends: Arceus   Feb 20, 01:00 25 comments                 games    While the plot left much to be desired, Pokémon Legends: Arceus brings new energy and possibilities to the franchise. ― For years, it seems the big ask of Pokémon fans has been that the franchise innovate itself in a meaningful way.

It's a 'Man Versus Wild' situation if said Wild also had goblins in it. ― Alright, another new isekai, what's the deal with this one?

But what exactly are the decisions that got us here? ― Unlike animation, video games are in large part a disposable medium. Games once hailed as era-defining breakthrough titles upon their release often become antiquated and awkward within a little less than a decade.
