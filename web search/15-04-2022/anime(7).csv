The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Tomodachi Game   Apr  6th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Tomodachi Game ?                     Community score: 2.9              What is this?   Yūichi Katagiri, a young man with a perfect student life who has four friends with difficult lives. His peaceful daily life comes to an end when 2 million yen (about US$20,000) in school trip fees goes missing. Riddles unfold as Yūichi gets caught up in a mysterious game for money and must decide whether friendship or money matters more.    Tomodachi Game is based on Yuki Sato's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                Any time a survival game anime pops up during Preview Guide, I get a little anxious. Not because I dislike the genre or anything—Danganronpa is one of my favorite franchises, as it so happens. The problem is that, for every smash hit like Danganronpa, it feels like there are a dozen would-be imitators that keep trying (and failing) to find new and fresh ways to mess with murder/betrayal/escape-room formula. To put it bluntly, a lot of survival game anime kind of suck. Tomodachi Game doesn't exactly suck, and there are even elements of this premiere that I find fairly interesting, but the overall package is just so wrapped up in tired clichés and mediocre presentation that it's hard to muster up enough energy to care one way or the other.    I'll give it this, though: It's nice that Yuichi and all of the other contestants of this weird game were all friends first. There's no amnesia, no cadre of bizarrely coifed and cartoonishly rendered strangers who all have to monologue about their backstories one after the other. The angle that Tomodachi Game is exploring is a tried and true one, but it's effective nonetheless. It asks, “How well do you really know your best friends? And how much pressure would it take, financial or otherwise, before the masks come off and even the closest of companions turn on each other?”    It's just a shame the game being used to exploit this premise is so ludicrously overcomplicated, not to mention heavy-handed as all hell. You know what makes an interesting thriller premise like the one above a lot less interesting? When a cast of vaguely defined characters are forced to participate in an inane game-show that is designed to have every single element of their experience literally scream, over and over, “CAN YOU TRUST YOUR FRIENDS? HUH? I BETCHA CAN'T!!” It kind of ruins the experience.    Don't get me started on the knockoff Monokuma, either. I get that all of these survival game anime feel obligated to include a “wacky"" mascot character, but they really shouldn't try so goddamned hard just because Danganronpa and Assassination Classroom made bank on the concept. And no, I don't even care that Manabu-kun is actually voiced by the actress who played actual Danganronpa protagonist Hajime Hinata. I hate the little creep. He's goofy-looking and obnoxious, and the show does a terrible job of blending the interactions of the CG character model with his 2D counterparts. Every time Manabu was onscreen, I wanted to see someone toss him straight out of a window and into oncoming traffic.    Worst of all, I feel like I'm going to see most of the “shocking"" and “edgy"" twists of this story coming well in advance, so, unless something positively wild and unheard of is yet to come in this story, I'm happy to give Tomodachi Game a pass. There have been other, better riffs on this formula over the years, and I'd rather revisit those than stick it out with a mediocre-seeming also-ran like this one. I'm going to call it right now, though, with absolutely no prior knowledge of the series or anything: It was the meek girl that got all of the friends roped into the game. I bet she's also secretly a psycho yandere. Hit me up in a few weeks if it turns out that I'm right.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               In general, I enjoy anime that focus on high-stakes, psychological games—be they death games or more gambling-focused ones. However, Tomodachi Game didn't excite me at all. When watching an anime set in a well-established genre, there is one question always at the back of my mind: What sets this show apart?  In the case of Tomodachi Game, the answer is ""nothing."" It's totally bland.    The characters, at this point, are surface layer clichés. We have the uptight beauty, the cute girl, the serious one, and the frivolous playboy. Even the main character is little more than ""the poor kid."" The result is Kakegurui without a Yumeko—a show with drama but no one for the audience to care about on a personal level.    Yet, even that drama is lackluster. Not only does the show reveal the masterminds behind the curtain way too easily, but their lackluster commentary in no way replaces the tension that comes from having no idea what is going on behind the scenes. Then there are the constant blink-and-you'll-miss-it text dumps on screen that require you to pause to read. This effectively hamstrings the show's pacing. But even worse, it obliterates the audience's sense of immersion. You can't just sit back and lose yourself in the world Tomodachi Game is trying to create: you've got to be ready to hit pause and read exposition at a moment's notice or miss out on vital information—like the literal rules of the game they are playing!    All that and the episode doesn't even manage to stick the landing. While the game itself is easy enough to understand, the lack of resolution within the first episode is a hindrance. After all, a cliffhanger only works if you care enough about the characters or story to want to come back next week. I don't.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Ah, emotional manipulation. Such a charming premise for any show, so why not make it even more lovely by throwing in a couple of random evil high school girls running a death game for groups of, specifically, five friends? Bonus points if it turns out that the entire thing was set up to point out the shoddy, self-serving nature of friendship, but it's the girls running the game who learn a little something about true friendship along the way instead!    Despite that opening paragraph, my main issue with Tomodachi Game really isn't its premise. Survival games have been a staple of fiction since at LEAST The Most Dangerous Game, and very likely before then if I could be bothered to remember any. Likewise the idea of how trustworthy your so-called friends are is one of the founding principles of certain YA subgenres, so the show is on fairly solid ground with its group of five pals who are tased into a strange white space that turns out to be someone's twisted playground. Starting things off with stolen money for a field trip also works decently well, even if one of the group was the one who's most likely to suffer for the loss and two others are among those most likely to have taken it in the first place. (In reality, I suspect that the girls running the game are responsible.) Where things falter is in the execution of the story, which seems to be a bit of a theme for today's episodes. The main problem is that we barely know these kids and no effort is expended to remedy that situation. In fact, a card with their names and their basic stereotypes is displayed at one point, letting us know precisely which genre trope everyone fits into. (That I then spent the rest of the episode being disturbed that baby-voiced, utterly helpless Kokorogi was labeled “the sexy one” is an entirely different issue.) This makes the matter of who survives and who dies not all that compelling of an issue, because not only do we not like any of them, we don't KNOW any of them. At this point I'm voting for Tenoji to go first because his hair looks like someone took a bite out of it and that annoys me unreasonably.    The survival game genre isn't impossible to do well. It's perhaps not even particularly difficult to do well. But Tomodachi Game seems hellbent on getting in its own way as much as possible with its paltry introductions, explanations that go between “too much” and “not enough,” and some very lackluster visuals. Unless you love the genre and will consume all forms of it, maybe give this a pass.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               I give isekai shows a lot of guff for being simultaneously ubiquitous and dull, but if there's one genre that can eclipse even that otherworldly monolith in pure tedium, it's death games. One of my biggest worries is the massive success of Squid Game bringing this already over-saturated story idea to the big stage. And while this show isn't strictly a death game – all that's currently at stake is money – it's just as much of a slog to get through as every other hackney edgelord parade that tries to come up with a new spin on the prisoner's dilemma.    The biggest reason for that is just how undercooked the “Tomodachi” part of its title is. This is meant to be a dark and gritty look at how five dear and loving friends can be pushed to betray each other for money, but the central friendships of the group are basically nonexistent. We get all of one scene of the five characters talking before they're thrown into this low-rent Kakegurui ripoff, so watching their tenuous friendship fall apart while they play the most obviously rigged game on the planet just isn't dramatic. These are people we've gotten to know mainly through a single screen of text explaining their personalities to us, and none of them have strong enough personalities to overcome that and make this whole ordeal interesting. When they start betraying each other it doesn't mean anything because none of them are real characters, so the entire tension of this game falls flat.    I'm also just so, so tired of every one of these having to bark up the same tree. Every single one of these things thinks they need their own Monokuma, but once you've seen a couple creepy-cute mascot characters who are secretly ~evil~ it loses its impact. As such, all the CG anime mascot character amounts to is a squeaky-voiced exposition machine with zero impact. Add in the random overseer girls who have to comment on everything from their surveillance room, smugly laughing about how their totally devious mind games will ruin another friendship and you have a story that's so insufferably impressed with its cut-rate edginess that finishing the episode is a feat of endurance.    The one and only bright spot of this premiere is in the very final moments, where it seems like our hapless protagonist has come up with some kind of plan to outsmart the Kokkuri-san game that his friends have all purposefully bought into. That, at least, could be a novel twist to this whole setup – our hero having to 4D-Chess his way into making his friends all play fair so they can clear their debts together, forcing a happy ending in the face of obvious psychological manipulation. I have very little faith that's where the show will actually go, but it would at least be a spin on this scenario that I haven't seen done a million times. It's still not enough to make watch more of this charmless bore, but it's something, I guess.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          3 comments       Jujutsu Kaisen Stage Play's Video Introduces Cast in Costume   Apr 15, 07:02 3 comments                 live-action    Ryūji Satō, Ryosuke Miura star in July-August play ― A press conference for the stage play of Gege Akutami's Jujutsu Kaisen manga introduced the production's promotional video, main cast, and other details on Wednesday.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Tomodachi Game   Apr  6th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Tomodachi Game ?                     Community score: 2.9              What is this?   Yūichi Katagiri, a young man with a perfect student life who has four friends with difficult lives. His peaceful daily life comes to an end when 2 million yen (about US$20,000) in school trip fees goes missing. Riddles unfold as Yūichi gets caught up in a mysterious game for money and must decide whether friendship or money matters more.    Tomodachi Game is based on Yuki Sato's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                Any time a survival game anime pops up during Preview Guide, I get a little anxious. Not because I dislike the genre or anything—Danganronpa is one of my favorite franchises, as it so happens. The problem is that, for every smash hit like Danganronpa, it feels like there are a dozen would-be imitators that keep trying (and failing) to find new and fresh ways to mess with murder/betrayal/escape-room formula. To put it bluntly, a lot of survival game anime kind of suck. Tomodachi Game doesn't exactly suck, and there are even elements of this premiere that I find fairly interesting, but the overall package is just so wrapped up in tired clichés and mediocre presentation that it's hard to muster up enough energy to care one way or the other.    I'll give it this, though: It's nice that Yuichi and all of the other contestants of this weird game were all friends first. There's no amnesia, no cadre of bizarrely coifed and cartoonishly rendered strangers who all have to monologue about their backstories one after the other. The angle that Tomodachi Game is exploring is a tried and true one, but it's effective nonetheless. It asks, “How well do you really know your best friends? And how much pressure would it take, financial or otherwise, before the masks come off and even the closest of companions turn on each other?”    It's just a shame the game being used to exploit this premise is so ludicrously overcomplicated, not to mention heavy-handed as all hell. You know what makes an interesting thriller premise like the one above a lot less interesting? When a cast of vaguely defined characters are forced to participate in an inane game-show that is designed to have every single element of their experience literally scream, over and over, “CAN YOU TRUST YOUR FRIENDS? HUH? I BETCHA CAN'T!!” It kind of ruins the experience.    Don't get me started on the knockoff Monokuma, either. I get that all of these survival game anime feel obligated to include a “wacky"" mascot character, but they really shouldn't try so goddamned hard just because Danganronpa and Assassination Classroom made bank on the concept. And no, I don't even care that Manabu-kun is actually voiced by the actress who played actual Danganronpa protagonist Hajime Hinata. I hate the little creep. He's goofy-looking and obnoxious, and the show does a terrible job of blending the interactions of the CG character model with his 2D counterparts. Every time Manabu was onscreen, I wanted to see someone toss him straight out of a window and into oncoming traffic.    Worst of all, I feel like I'm going to see most of the “shocking"" and “edgy"" twists of this story coming well in advance, so, unless something positively wild and unheard of is yet to come in this story, I'm happy to give Tomodachi Game a pass. There have been other, better riffs on this formula over the years, and I'd rather revisit those than stick it out with a mediocre-seeming also-ran like this one. I'm going to call it right now, though, with absolutely no prior knowledge of the series or anything: It was the meek girl that got all of the friends roped into the game. I bet she's also secretly a psycho yandere. Hit me up in a few weeks if it turns out that I'm right.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               In general, I enjoy anime that focus on high-stakes, psychological games—be they death games or more gambling-focused ones. However, Tomodachi Game didn't excite me at all. When watching an anime set in a well-established genre, there is one question always at the back of my mind: What sets this show apart?  In the case of Tomodachi Game, the answer is ""nothing."" It's totally bland.    The characters, at this point, are surface layer clichés. We have the uptight beauty, the cute girl, the serious one, and the frivolous playboy. Even the main character is little more than ""the poor kid."" The result is Kakegurui without a Yumeko—a show with drama but no one for the audience to care about on a personal level.    Yet, even that drama is lackluster. Not only does the show reveal the masterminds behind the curtain way too easily, but their lackluster commentary in no way replaces the tension that comes from having no idea what is going on behind the scenes. Then there are the constant blink-and-you'll-miss-it text dumps on screen that require you to pause to read. This effectively hamstrings the show's pacing. But even worse, it obliterates the audience's sense of immersion. You can't just sit back and lose yourself in the world Tomodachi Game is trying to create: you've got to be ready to hit pause and read exposition at a moment's notice or miss out on vital information—like the literal rules of the game they are playing!    All that and the episode doesn't even manage to stick the landing. While the game itself is easy enough to understand, the lack of resolution within the first episode is a hindrance. After all, a cliffhanger only works if you care enough about the characters or story to want to come back next week. I don't.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Ah, emotional manipulation. Such a charming premise for any show, so why not make it even more lovely by throwing in a couple of random evil high school girls running a death game for groups of, specifically, five friends? Bonus points if it turns out that the entire thing was set up to point out the shoddy, self-serving nature of friendship, but it's the girls running the game who learn a little something about true friendship along the way instead!    Despite that opening paragraph, my main issue with Tomodachi Game really isn't its premise. Survival games have been a staple of fiction since at LEAST The Most Dangerous Game, and very likely before then if I could be bothered to remember any. Likewise the idea of how trustworthy your so-called friends are is one of the founding principles of certain YA subgenres, so the show is on fairly solid ground with its group of five pals who are tased into a strange white space that turns out to be someone's twisted playground. Starting things off with stolen money for a field trip also works decently well, even if one of the group was the one who's most likely to suffer for the loss and two others are among those most likely to have taken it in the first place. (In reality, I suspect that the girls running the game are responsible.) Where things falter is in the execution of the story, which seems to be a bit of a theme for today's episodes. The main problem is that we barely know these kids and no effort is expended to remedy that situation. In fact, a card with their names and their basic stereotypes is displayed at one point, letting us know precisely which genre trope everyone fits into. (That I then spent the rest of the episode being disturbed that baby-voiced, utterly helpless Kokorogi was labeled “the sexy one” is an entirely different issue.) This makes the matter of who survives and who dies not all that compelling of an issue, because not only do we not like any of them, we don't KNOW any of them. At this point I'm voting for Tenoji to go first because his hair looks like someone took a bite out of it and that annoys me unreasonably.    The survival game genre isn't impossible to do well. It's perhaps not even particularly difficult to do well. But Tomodachi Game seems hellbent on getting in its own way as much as possible with its paltry introductions, explanations that go between “too much” and “not enough,” and some very lackluster visuals. Unless you love the genre and will consume all forms of it, maybe give this a pass.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               I give isekai shows a lot of guff for being simultaneously ubiquitous and dull, but if there's one genre that can eclipse even that otherworldly monolith in pure tedium, it's death games. One of my biggest worries is the massive success of Squid Game bringing this already over-saturated story idea to the big stage. And while this show isn't strictly a death game – all that's currently at stake is money – it's just as much of a slog to get through as every other hackney edgelord parade that tries to come up with a new spin on the prisoner's dilemma.    The biggest reason for that is just how undercooked the “Tomodachi” part of its title is. This is meant to be a dark and gritty look at how five dear and loving friends can be pushed to betray each other for money, but the central friendships of the group are basically nonexistent. We get all of one scene of the five characters talking before they're thrown into this low-rent Kakegurui ripoff, so watching their tenuous friendship fall apart while they play the most obviously rigged game on the planet just isn't dramatic. These are people we've gotten to know mainly through a single screen of text explaining their personalities to us, and none of them have strong enough personalities to overcome that and make this whole ordeal interesting. When they start betraying each other it doesn't mean anything because none of them are real characters, so the entire tension of this game falls flat.    I'm also just so, so tired of every one of these having to bark up the same tree. Every single one of these things thinks they need their own Monokuma, but once you've seen a couple creepy-cute mascot characters who are secretly ~evil~ it loses its impact. As such, all the CG anime mascot character amounts to is a squeaky-voiced exposition machine with zero impact. Add in the random overseer girls who have to comment on everything from their surveillance room, smugly laughing about how their totally devious mind games will ruin another friendship and you have a story that's so insufferably impressed with its cut-rate edginess that finishing the episode is a feat of endurance.    The one and only bright spot of this premiere is in the very final moments, where it seems like our hapless protagonist has come up with some kind of plan to outsmart the Kokkuri-san game that his friends have all purposefully bought into. That, at least, could be a novel twist to this whole setup – our hero having to 4D-Chess his way into making his friends all play fair so they can clear their debts together, forcing a happy ending in the face of obvious psychological manipulation. I have very little faith that's where the show will actually go, but it would at least be a spin on this scenario that I haven't seen done a million times. It's still not enough to make watch more of this charmless bore, but it's something, I guess.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          3 comments       Jujutsu Kaisen Stage Play's Video Introduces Cast in Costume   Apr 15, 07:02 3 comments                 live-action    Ryūji Satō, Ryosuke Miura star in July-August play ― A press conference for the stage play of Gege Akutami's Jujutsu Kaisen manga introduced the production's promotional video, main cast, and other details on Wednesday.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Tomodachi Game   Apr  6th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Tomodachi Game ?                     Community score: 2.9              What is this?   Yūichi Katagiri, a young man with a perfect student life who has four friends with difficult lives. His peaceful daily life comes to an end when 2 million yen (about US$20,000) in school trip fees goes missing. Riddles unfold as Yūichi gets caught up in a mysterious game for money and must decide whether friendship or money matters more.    Tomodachi Game is based on Yuki Sato's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                Any time a survival game anime pops up during Preview Guide, I get a little anxious. Not because I dislike the genre or anything—Danganronpa is one of my favorite franchises, as it so happens. The problem is that, for every smash hit like Danganronpa, it feels like there are a dozen would-be imitators that keep trying (and failing) to find new and fresh ways to mess with murder/betrayal/escape-room formula. To put it bluntly, a lot of survival game anime kind of suck. Tomodachi Game doesn't exactly suck, and there are even elements of this premiere that I find fairly interesting, but the overall package is just so wrapped up in tired clichés and mediocre presentation that it's hard to muster up enough energy to care one way or the other.    I'll give it this, though: It's nice that Yuichi and all of the other contestants of this weird game were all friends first. There's no amnesia, no cadre of bizarrely coifed and cartoonishly rendered strangers who all have to monologue about their backstories one after the other. The angle that Tomodachi Game is exploring is a tried and true one, but it's effective nonetheless. It asks, “How well do you really know your best friends? And how much pressure would it take, financial or otherwise, before the masks come off and even the closest of companions turn on each other?”    It's just a shame the game being used to exploit this premise is so ludicrously overcomplicated, not to mention heavy-handed as all hell. You know what makes an interesting thriller premise like the one above a lot less interesting? When a cast of vaguely defined characters are forced to participate in an inane game-show that is designed to have every single element of their experience literally scream, over and over, “CAN YOU TRUST YOUR FRIENDS? HUH? I BETCHA CAN'T!!” It kind of ruins the experience.    Don't get me started on the knockoff Monokuma, either. I get that all of these survival game anime feel obligated to include a “wacky"" mascot character, but they really shouldn't try so goddamned hard just because Danganronpa and Assassination Classroom made bank on the concept. And no, I don't even care that Manabu-kun is actually voiced by the actress who played actual Danganronpa protagonist Hajime Hinata. I hate the little creep. He's goofy-looking and obnoxious, and the show does a terrible job of blending the interactions of the CG character model with his 2D counterparts. Every time Manabu was onscreen, I wanted to see someone toss him straight out of a window and into oncoming traffic.    Worst of all, I feel like I'm going to see most of the “shocking"" and “edgy"" twists of this story coming well in advance, so, unless something positively wild and unheard of is yet to come in this story, I'm happy to give Tomodachi Game a pass. There have been other, better riffs on this formula over the years, and I'd rather revisit those than stick it out with a mediocre-seeming also-ran like this one. I'm going to call it right now, though, with absolutely no prior knowledge of the series or anything: It was the meek girl that got all of the friends roped into the game. I bet she's also secretly a psycho yandere. Hit me up in a few weeks if it turns out that I'm right.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               In general, I enjoy anime that focus on high-stakes, psychological games—be they death games or more gambling-focused ones. However, Tomodachi Game didn't excite me at all. When watching an anime set in a well-established genre, there is one question always at the back of my mind: What sets this show apart?  In the case of Tomodachi Game, the answer is ""nothing."" It's totally bland.    The characters, at this point, are surface layer clichés. We have the uptight beauty, the cute girl, the serious one, and the frivolous playboy. Even the main character is little more than ""the poor kid."" The result is Kakegurui without a Yumeko—a show with drama but no one for the audience to care about on a personal level.    Yet, even that drama is lackluster. Not only does the show reveal the masterminds behind the curtain way too easily, but their lackluster commentary in no way replaces the tension that comes from having no idea what is going on behind the scenes. Then there are the constant blink-and-you'll-miss-it text dumps on screen that require you to pause to read. This effectively hamstrings the show's pacing. But even worse, it obliterates the audience's sense of immersion. You can't just sit back and lose yourself in the world Tomodachi Game is trying to create: you've got to be ready to hit pause and read exposition at a moment's notice or miss out on vital information—like the literal rules of the game they are playing!    All that and the episode doesn't even manage to stick the landing. While the game itself is easy enough to understand, the lack of resolution within the first episode is a hindrance. After all, a cliffhanger only works if you care enough about the characters or story to want to come back next week. I don't.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Ah, emotional manipulation. Such a charming premise for any show, so why not make it even more lovely by throwing in a couple of random evil high school girls running a death game for groups of, specifically, five friends? Bonus points if it turns out that the entire thing was set up to point out the shoddy, self-serving nature of friendship, but it's the girls running the game who learn a little something about true friendship along the way instead!    Despite that opening paragraph, my main issue with Tomodachi Game really isn't its premise. Survival games have been a staple of fiction since at LEAST The Most Dangerous Game, and very likely before then if I could be bothered to remember any. Likewise the idea of how trustworthy your so-called friends are is one of the founding principles of certain YA subgenres, so the show is on fairly solid ground with its group of five pals who are tased into a strange white space that turns out to be someone's twisted playground. Starting things off with stolen money for a field trip also works decently well, even if one of the group was the one who's most likely to suffer for the loss and two others are among those most likely to have taken it in the first place. (In reality, I suspect that the girls running the game are responsible.) Where things falter is in the execution of the story, which seems to be a bit of a theme for today's episodes. The main problem is that we barely know these kids and no effort is expended to remedy that situation. In fact, a card with their names and their basic stereotypes is displayed at one point, letting us know precisely which genre trope everyone fits into. (That I then spent the rest of the episode being disturbed that baby-voiced, utterly helpless Kokorogi was labeled “the sexy one” is an entirely different issue.) This makes the matter of who survives and who dies not all that compelling of an issue, because not only do we not like any of them, we don't KNOW any of them. At this point I'm voting for Tenoji to go first because his hair looks like someone took a bite out of it and that annoys me unreasonably.    The survival game genre isn't impossible to do well. It's perhaps not even particularly difficult to do well. But Tomodachi Game seems hellbent on getting in its own way as much as possible with its paltry introductions, explanations that go between “too much” and “not enough,” and some very lackluster visuals. Unless you love the genre and will consume all forms of it, maybe give this a pass.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               I give isekai shows a lot of guff for being simultaneously ubiquitous and dull, but if there's one genre that can eclipse even that otherworldly monolith in pure tedium, it's death games. One of my biggest worries is the massive success of Squid Game bringing this already over-saturated story idea to the big stage. And while this show isn't strictly a death game – all that's currently at stake is money – it's just as much of a slog to get through as every other hackney edgelord parade that tries to come up with a new spin on the prisoner's dilemma.    The biggest reason for that is just how undercooked the “Tomodachi” part of its title is. This is meant to be a dark and gritty look at how five dear and loving friends can be pushed to betray each other for money, but the central friendships of the group are basically nonexistent. We get all of one scene of the five characters talking before they're thrown into this low-rent Kakegurui ripoff, so watching their tenuous friendship fall apart while they play the most obviously rigged game on the planet just isn't dramatic. These are people we've gotten to know mainly through a single screen of text explaining their personalities to us, and none of them have strong enough personalities to overcome that and make this whole ordeal interesting. When they start betraying each other it doesn't mean anything because none of them are real characters, so the entire tension of this game falls flat.    I'm also just so, so tired of every one of these having to bark up the same tree. Every single one of these things thinks they need their own Monokuma, but once you've seen a couple creepy-cute mascot characters who are secretly ~evil~ it loses its impact. As such, all the CG anime mascot character amounts to is a squeaky-voiced exposition machine with zero impact. Add in the random overseer girls who have to comment on everything from their surveillance room, smugly laughing about how their totally devious mind games will ruin another friendship and you have a story that's so insufferably impressed with its cut-rate edginess that finishing the episode is a feat of endurance.    The one and only bright spot of this premiere is in the very final moments, where it seems like our hapless protagonist has come up with some kind of plan to outsmart the Kokkuri-san game that his friends have all purposefully bought into. That, at least, could be a novel twist to this whole setup – our hero having to 4D-Chess his way into making his friends all play fair so they can clear their debts together, forcing a happy ending in the face of obvious psychological manipulation. I have very little faith that's where the show will actually go, but it would at least be a spin on this scenario that I haven't seen done a million times. It's still not enough to make watch more of this charmless bore, but it's something, I guess.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          3 comments       Jujutsu Kaisen Stage Play's Video Introduces Cast in Costume   Apr 15, 07:02 3 comments                 live-action    Ryūji Satō, Ryosuke Miura star in July-August play ― A press conference for the stage play of Gege Akutami's Jujutsu Kaisen manga introduced the production's promotional video, main cast, and other details on Wednesday.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Tomodachi Game   Apr  6th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Tomodachi Game ?                     Community score: 2.9              What is this?   Yūichi Katagiri, a young man with a perfect student life who has four friends with difficult lives. His peaceful daily life comes to an end when 2 million yen (about US$20,000) in school trip fees goes missing. Riddles unfold as Yūichi gets caught up in a mysterious game for money and must decide whether friendship or money matters more.    Tomodachi Game is based on Yuki Sato's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                Any time a survival game anime pops up during Preview Guide, I get a little anxious. Not because I dislike the genre or anything—Danganronpa is one of my favorite franchises, as it so happens. The problem is that, for every smash hit like Danganronpa, it feels like there are a dozen would-be imitators that keep trying (and failing) to find new and fresh ways to mess with murder/betrayal/escape-room formula. To put it bluntly, a lot of survival game anime kind of suck. Tomodachi Game doesn't exactly suck, and there are even elements of this premiere that I find fairly interesting, but the overall package is just so wrapped up in tired clichés and mediocre presentation that it's hard to muster up enough energy to care one way or the other.    I'll give it this, though: It's nice that Yuichi and all of the other contestants of this weird game were all friends first. There's no amnesia, no cadre of bizarrely coifed and cartoonishly rendered strangers who all have to monologue about their backstories one after the other. The angle that Tomodachi Game is exploring is a tried and true one, but it's effective nonetheless. It asks, “How well do you really know your best friends? And how much pressure would it take, financial or otherwise, before the masks come off and even the closest of companions turn on each other?”    It's just a shame the game being used to exploit this premise is so ludicrously overcomplicated, not to mention heavy-handed as all hell. You know what makes an interesting thriller premise like the one above a lot less interesting? When a cast of vaguely defined characters are forced to participate in an inane game-show that is designed to have every single element of their experience literally scream, over and over, “CAN YOU TRUST YOUR FRIENDS? HUH? I BETCHA CAN'T!!” It kind of ruins the experience.    Don't get me started on the knockoff Monokuma, either. I get that all of these survival game anime feel obligated to include a “wacky"" mascot character, but they really shouldn't try so goddamned hard just because Danganronpa and Assassination Classroom made bank on the concept. And no, I don't even care that Manabu-kun is actually voiced by the actress who played actual Danganronpa protagonist Hajime Hinata. I hate the little creep. He's goofy-looking and obnoxious, and the show does a terrible job of blending the interactions of the CG character model with his 2D counterparts. Every time Manabu was onscreen, I wanted to see someone toss him straight out of a window and into oncoming traffic.    Worst of all, I feel like I'm going to see most of the “shocking"" and “edgy"" twists of this story coming well in advance, so, unless something positively wild and unheard of is yet to come in this story, I'm happy to give Tomodachi Game a pass. There have been other, better riffs on this formula over the years, and I'd rather revisit those than stick it out with a mediocre-seeming also-ran like this one. I'm going to call it right now, though, with absolutely no prior knowledge of the series or anything: It was the meek girl that got all of the friends roped into the game. I bet she's also secretly a psycho yandere. Hit me up in a few weeks if it turns out that I'm right.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               In general, I enjoy anime that focus on high-stakes, psychological games—be they death games or more gambling-focused ones. However, Tomodachi Game didn't excite me at all. When watching an anime set in a well-established genre, there is one question always at the back of my mind: What sets this show apart?  In the case of Tomodachi Game, the answer is ""nothing."" It's totally bland.    The characters, at this point, are surface layer clichés. We have the uptight beauty, the cute girl, the serious one, and the frivolous playboy. Even the main character is little more than ""the poor kid."" The result is Kakegurui without a Yumeko—a show with drama but no one for the audience to care about on a personal level.    Yet, even that drama is lackluster. Not only does the show reveal the masterminds behind the curtain way too easily, but their lackluster commentary in no way replaces the tension that comes from having no idea what is going on behind the scenes. Then there are the constant blink-and-you'll-miss-it text dumps on screen that require you to pause to read. This effectively hamstrings the show's pacing. But even worse, it obliterates the audience's sense of immersion. You can't just sit back and lose yourself in the world Tomodachi Game is trying to create: you've got to be ready to hit pause and read exposition at a moment's notice or miss out on vital information—like the literal rules of the game they are playing!    All that and the episode doesn't even manage to stick the landing. While the game itself is easy enough to understand, the lack of resolution within the first episode is a hindrance. After all, a cliffhanger only works if you care enough about the characters or story to want to come back next week. I don't.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Ah, emotional manipulation. Such a charming premise for any show, so why not make it even more lovely by throwing in a couple of random evil high school girls running a death game for groups of, specifically, five friends? Bonus points if it turns out that the entire thing was set up to point out the shoddy, self-serving nature of friendship, but it's the girls running the game who learn a little something about true friendship along the way instead!    Despite that opening paragraph, my main issue with Tomodachi Game really isn't its premise. Survival games have been a staple of fiction since at LEAST The Most Dangerous Game, and very likely before then if I could be bothered to remember any. Likewise the idea of how trustworthy your so-called friends are is one of the founding principles of certain YA subgenres, so the show is on fairly solid ground with its group of five pals who are tased into a strange white space that turns out to be someone's twisted playground. Starting things off with stolen money for a field trip also works decently well, even if one of the group was the one who's most likely to suffer for the loss and two others are among those most likely to have taken it in the first place. (In reality, I suspect that the girls running the game are responsible.) Where things falter is in the execution of the story, which seems to be a bit of a theme for today's episodes. The main problem is that we barely know these kids and no effort is expended to remedy that situation. In fact, a card with their names and their basic stereotypes is displayed at one point, letting us know precisely which genre trope everyone fits into. (That I then spent the rest of the episode being disturbed that baby-voiced, utterly helpless Kokorogi was labeled “the sexy one” is an entirely different issue.) This makes the matter of who survives and who dies not all that compelling of an issue, because not only do we not like any of them, we don't KNOW any of them. At this point I'm voting for Tenoji to go first because his hair looks like someone took a bite out of it and that annoys me unreasonably.    The survival game genre isn't impossible to do well. It's perhaps not even particularly difficult to do well.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Tomodachi Game   Apr  6th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Tomodachi Game ?                     Community score: 2.9              What is this?   Yūichi Katagiri, a young man with a perfect student life who has four friends with difficult lives. His peaceful daily life comes to an end when 2 million yen (about US$20,000) in school trip fees goes missing. Riddles unfold as Yūichi gets caught up in a mysterious game for money and must decide whether friendship or money matters more.    Tomodachi Game is based on Yuki Sato's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                Any time a survival game anime pops up during Preview Guide, I get a little anxious. Not because I dislike the genre or anything—Danganronpa is one of my favorite franchises, as it so happens. The problem is that, for every smash hit like Danganronpa, it feels like there are a dozen would-be imitators that keep trying (and failing) to find new and fresh ways to mess with murder/betrayal/escape-room formula. To put it bluntly, a lot of survival game anime kind of suck. Tomodachi Game doesn't exactly suck, and there are even elements of this premiere that I find fairly interesting, but the overall package is just so wrapped up in tired clichés and mediocre presentation that it's hard to muster up enough energy to care one way or the other.    I'll give it this, though: It's nice that Yuichi and all of the other contestants of this weird game were all friends first. There's no amnesia, no cadre of bizarrely coifed and cartoonishly rendered strangers who all have to monologue about their backstories one after the other. The angle that Tomodachi Game is exploring is a tried and true one, but it's effective nonetheless. It asks, “How well do you really know your best friends? And how much pressure would it take, financial or otherwise, before the masks come off and even the closest of companions turn on each other?”    It's just a shame the game being used to exploit this premise is so ludicrously overcomplicated, not to mention heavy-handed as all hell. You know what makes an interesting thriller premise like the one above a lot less interesting? When a cast of vaguely defined characters are forced to participate in an inane game-show that is designed to have every single element of their experience literally scream, over and over, “CAN YOU TRUST YOUR FRIENDS? HUH? I BETCHA CAN'T!!” It kind of ruins the experience.    Don't get me started on the knockoff Monokuma, either. I get that all of these survival game anime feel obligated to include a “wacky"" mascot character, but they really shouldn't try so goddamned hard just because Danganronpa and Assassination Classroom made bank on the concept. And no, I don't even care that Manabu-kun is actually voiced by the actress who played actual Danganronpa protagonist Hajime Hinata. I hate the little creep. He's goofy-looking and obnoxious, and the show does a terrible job of blending the interactions of the CG character model with his 2D counterparts. Every time Manabu was onscreen, I wanted to see someone toss him straight out of a window and into oncoming traffic.    Worst of all, I feel like I'm going to see most of the “shocking"" and “edgy"" twists of this story coming well in advance, so, unless something positively wild and unheard of is yet to come in this story, I'm happy to give Tomodachi Game a pass. There have been other, better riffs on this formula over the years, and I'd rather revisit those than stick it out with a mediocre-seeming also-ran like this one. I'm going to call it right now, though, with absolutely no prior knowledge of the series or anything: It was the meek girl that got all of the friends roped into the game. I bet she's also secretly a psycho yandere. Hit me up in a few weeks if it turns out that I'm right.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               In general, I enjoy anime that focus on high-stakes, psychological games—be they death games or more gambling-focused ones. However, Tomodachi Game didn't excite me at all. When watching an anime set in a well-established genre, there is one question always at the back of my mind: What sets this show apart?  In the case of Tomodachi Game, the answer is ""nothing."" It's totally bland.    The characters, at this point, are surface layer clichés. We have the uptight beauty, the cute girl, the serious one, and the frivolous playboy. Even the main character is little more than ""the poor kid."" The result is Kakegurui without a Yumeko—a show with drama but no one for the audience to care about on a personal level.    Yet, even that drama is lackluster. Not only does the show reveal the masterminds behind the curtain way too easily, but their lackluster commentary in no way replaces the tension that comes from having no idea what is going on behind the scenes. Then there are the constant blink-and-you'll-miss-it text dumps on screen that require you to pause to read. This effectively hamstrings the show's pacing. But even worse, it obliterates the audience's sense of immersion. You can't just sit back and lose yourself in the world Tomodachi Game is trying to create: you've got to be ready to hit pause and read exposition at a moment's notice or miss out on vital information—like the literal rules of the game they are playing!    All that and the episode doesn't even manage to stick the landing. While the game itself is easy enough to understand, the lack of resolution within the first episode is a hindrance. After all, a cliffhanger only works if you care enough about the characters or story to want to come back next week. I don't.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Ah, emotional manipulation. Such a charming premise for any show, so why not make it even more lovely by throwing in a couple of random evil high school girls running a death game for groups of, specifically, five friends? Bonus points if it turns out that the entire thing was set up to point out the shoddy, self-serving nature of friendship, but it's the girls running the game who learn a little something about true friendship along the way instead!    Despite that opening paragraph, my main issue with Tomodachi Game really isn't its premise. Survival games have been a staple of fiction since at LEAST The Most Dangerous Game, and very likely before then if I could be bothered to remember any. Likewise the idea of how trustworthy your so-called friends are is one of the founding principles of certain YA subgenres, so the show is on fairly solid ground with its group of five pals who are tased into a strange white space that turns out to be someone's twisted playground. Starting things off with stolen money for a field trip also works decently well, even if one of the group was the one who's most likely to suffer for the loss and two others are among those most likely to have taken it in the first place. (In reality, I suspect that the girls running the game are responsible.) Where things falter is in the execution of the story, which seems to be a bit of a theme for today's episodes. The main problem is that we barely know these kids and no effort is expended to remedy that situation. In fact, a card with their names and their basic stereotypes is displayed at one point, letting us know precisely which genre trope everyone fits into. (That I then spent the rest of the episode being disturbed that baby-voiced, utterly helpless Kokorogi was labeled “the sexy one” is an entirely different issue.) This makes the matter of who survives and who dies not all that compelling of an issue, because not only do we not like any of them, we don't KNOW any of them. At this point I'm voting for Tenoji to go first because his hair looks like someone took a bite out of it and that annoys me unreasonably.    The survival game genre isn't impossible to do well. It's perhaps not even particularly difficult to do well. But Tomodachi Game seems hellbent on getting in its own way as much as possible with its paltry introductions, explanations that go between “too much” and “not enough,” and some very lackluster visuals. Unless you love the genre and will consume all forms of it, maybe give this a pass.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               I give isekai shows a lot of guff for being simultaneously ubiquitous and dull, but if there's one genre that can eclipse even that otherworldly monolith in pure tedium, it's death games. One of my biggest worries is the massive success of Squid Game bringing this already over-saturated story idea to the big stage. And while this show isn't strictly a death game – all that's currently at stake is money – it's just as much of a slog to get through as every other hackney edgelord parade that tries to come up with a new spin on the prisoner's dilemma.    The biggest reason for that is just how undercooked the “Tomodachi” part of its title is. This is meant to be a dark and gritty look at how five dear and loving friends can be pushed to betray each other for money, but the central friendships of the group are basically nonexistent. We get all of one scene of the five characters talking before they're thrown into this low-rent Kakegurui ripoff, so watching their tenuous friendship fall apart while they play the most obviously rigged game on the planet just isn't dramatic. These are people we've gotten to know mainly through a single screen of text explaining their personalities to us, and none of them have strong enough personalities to overcome that and make this whole ordeal interesting. When they start betraying each other it doesn't mean anything because none of them are real characters, so the entire tension of this game falls flat.    I'm also just so, so tired of every one of these having to bark up the same tree. Every single one of these things thinks they need their own Monokuma, but once you've seen a couple creepy-cute mascot characters who are secretly ~evil~ it loses its impact. As such, all the CG anime mascot character amounts to is a squeaky-voiced exposition machine with zero impact. Add in the random overseer girls who have to comment on everything from their surveillance room, smugly laughing about how their totally devious mind games will ruin another friendship and you have a story that's so insufferably impressed with its cut-rate edginess that finishing the episode is a feat of endurance.    The one and only bright spot of this premiere is in the very final moments, where it seems like our hapless protagonist has come up with some kind of plan to outsmart the Kokkuri-san game that his friends have all purposefully bought into. That, at least, could be a novel twist to this whole setup – our hero having to 4D-Chess his way into making his friends all play fair so they can clear their debts together, forcing a happy ending in the face of obvious psychological manipulation. I have very little faith that's where the show will actually go, but it would at least be a spin on this scenario that I haven't seen done a million times. It's still not enough to make watch more of this charmless bore, but it's something, I guess.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 2.9              What is this?   Yūichi Katagiri, a young man with a perfect student life who has four friends with difficult lives. His peaceful daily life comes to an end when 2 million yen (about US$20,000) in school trip fees goes missing. Riddles unfold as Yūichi gets caught up in a mysterious game for money and must decide whether friendship or money matters more.    Tomodachi Game is based on Yuki Sato's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                Any time a survival game anime pops up during Preview Guide, I get a little anxious. Not because I dislike the genre or anything—Danganronpa is one of my favorite franchises, as it so happens. The problem is that, for every smash hit like Danganronpa, it feels like there are a dozen would-be imitators that keep trying (and failing) to find new and fresh ways to mess with murder/betrayal/escape-room formula. To put it bluntly, a lot of survival game anime kind of suck. Tomodachi Game doesn't exactly suck, and there are even elements of this premiere that I find fairly interesting, but the overall package is just so wrapped up in tired clichés and mediocre presentation that it's hard to muster up enough energy to care one way or the other.    I'll give it this, though: It's nice that Yuichi and all of the other contestants of this weird game were all friends first. There's no amnesia, no cadre of bizarrely coifed and cartoonishly rendered strangers who all have to monologue about their backstories one after the other. The angle that Tomodachi Game is exploring is a tried and true one, but it's effective nonetheless. It asks, “How well do you really know your best friends? And how much pressure would it take, financial or otherwise, before the masks come off and even the closest of companions turn on each other?”    It's just a shame the game being used to exploit this premise is so ludicrously overcomplicated, not to mention heavy-handed as all hell. You know what makes an interesting thriller premise like the one above a lot less interesting? When a cast of vaguely defined characters are forced to participate in an inane game-show that is designed to have every single element of their experience literally scream, over and over, “CAN YOU TRUST YOUR FRIENDS? HUH? I BETCHA CAN'T!!” It kind of ruins the experience.    Don't get me started on the knockoff Monokuma, either. I get that all of these survival game anime feel obligated to include a “wacky"" mascot character, but they really shouldn't try so goddamned hard just because Danganronpa and Assassination Classroom made bank on the concept. And no, I don't even care that Manabu-kun is actually voiced by the actress who played actual Danganronpa protagonist Hajime Hinata. I hate the little creep. He's goofy-looking and obnoxious, and the show does a terrible job of blending the interactions of the CG character model with his 2D counterparts. Every time Manabu was onscreen, I wanted to see someone toss him straight out of a window and into oncoming traffic.    Worst of all, I feel like I'm going to see most of the “shocking"" and “edgy"" twists of this story coming well in advance, so, unless something positively wild and unheard of is yet to come in this story, I'm happy to give Tomodachi Game a pass. There have been other, better riffs on this formula over the years, and I'd rather revisit those than stick it out with a mediocre-seeming also-ran like this one. I'm going to call it right now, though, with absolutely no prior knowledge of the series or anything: It was the meek girl that got all of the friends roped into the game. I bet she's also secretly a psycho yandere. Hit me up in a few weeks if it turns out that I'm right.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               In general, I enjoy anime that focus on high-stakes, psychological games—be they death games or more gambling-focused ones. However, Tomodachi Game didn't excite me at all. When watching an anime set in a well-established genre, there is one question always at the back of my mind: What sets this show apart?  In the case of Tomodachi Game, the answer is ""nothing."" It's totally bland.    The characters, at this point, are surface layer clichés. We have the uptight beauty, the cute girl, the serious one, and the frivolous playboy. Even the main character is little more than ""the poor kid."" The result is Kakegurui without a Yumeko—a show with drama but no one for the audience to care about on a personal level.    Yet, even that drama is lackluster. Not only does the show reveal the masterminds behind the curtain way too easily, but their lackluster commentary in no way replaces the tension that comes from having no idea what is going on behind the scenes. Then there are the constant blink-and-you'll-miss-it text dumps on screen that require you to pause to read. This effectively hamstrings the show's pacing. But even worse, it obliterates the audience's sense of immersion. You can't just sit back and lose yourself in the world Tomodachi Game is trying to create: you've got to be ready to hit pause and read exposition at a moment's notice or miss out on vital information—like the literal rules of the game they are playing!    All that and the episode doesn't even manage to stick the landing. While the game itself is easy enough to understand, the lack of resolution within the first episode is a hindrance. After all, a cliffhanger only works if you care enough about the characters or story to want to come back next week. I don't.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Ah, emotional manipulation. Such a charming premise for any show, so why not make it even more lovely by throwing in a couple of random evil high school girls running a death game for groups of, specifically, five friends? Bonus points if it turns out that the entire thing was set up to point out the shoddy, self-serving nature of friendship, but it's the girls running the game who learn a little something about true friendship along the way instead!    Despite that opening paragraph, my main issue with Tomodachi Game really isn't its premise. Survival games have been a staple of fiction since at LEAST The Most Dangerous Game, and very likely before then if I could be bothered to remember any. Likewise the idea of how trustworthy your so-called friends are is one of the founding principles of certain YA subgenres, so the show is on fairly solid ground with its group of five pals who are tased into a strange white space that turns out to be someone's twisted playground. Starting things off with stolen money for a field trip also works decently well, even if one of the group was the one who's most likely to suffer for the loss and two others are among those most likely to have taken it in the first place. (In reality, I suspect that the girls running the game are responsible.) Where things falter is in the execution of the story, which seems to be a bit of a theme for today's episodes. The main problem is that we barely know these kids and no effort is expended to remedy that situation. In fact, a card with their names and their basic stereotypes is displayed at one point, letting us know precisely which genre trope everyone fits into. (That I then spent the rest of the episode being disturbed that baby-voiced, utterly helpless Kokorogi was labeled “the sexy one” is an entirely different issue.) This makes the matter of who survives and who dies not all that compelling of an issue, because not only do we not like any of them, we don't KNOW any of them. At this point I'm voting for Tenoji to go first because his hair looks like someone took a bite out of it and that annoys me unreasonably.    The survival game genre isn't impossible to do well. It's perhaps not even particularly difficult to do well. But Tomodachi Game seems hellbent on getting in its own way as much as possible with its paltry introductions, explanations that go between “too much” and “not enough,” and some very lackluster visuals. Unless you love the genre and will consume all forms of it, maybe give this a pass.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               I give isekai shows a lot of guff for being simultaneously ubiquitous and dull, but if there's one genre that can eclipse even that otherworldly monolith in pure tedium, it's death games. One of my biggest worries is the massive success of Squid Game bringing this already over-saturated story idea to the big stage. And while this show isn't strictly a death game – all that's currently at stake is money – it's just as much of a slog to get through as every other hackney edgelord parade that tries to come up with a new spin on the prisoner's dilemma.    The biggest reason for that is just how undercooked the “Tomodachi” part of its title is. This is meant to be a dark and gritty look at how five dear and loving friends can be pushed to betray each other for money, but the central friendships of the group are basically nonexistent. We get all of one scene of the five characters talking before they're thrown into this low-rent Kakegurui ripoff, so watching their tenuous friendship fall apart while they play the most obviously rigged game on the planet just isn't dramatic. These are people we've gotten to know mainly through a single screen of text explaining their personalities to us, and none of them have strong enough personalities to overcome that and make this whole ordeal interesting. When they start betraying each other it doesn't mean anything because none of them are real characters, so the entire tension of this game falls flat.    I'm also just so, so tired of every one of these having to bark up the same tree. Every single one of these things thinks they need their own Monokuma, but once you've seen a couple creepy-cute mascot characters who are secretly ~evil~ it loses its impact. As such, all the CG anime mascot character amounts to is a squeaky-voiced exposition machine with zero impact. Add in the random overseer girls who have to comment on everything from their surveillance room, smugly laughing about how their totally devious mind games will ruin another friendship and you have a story that's so insufferably impressed with its cut-rate edginess that finishing the episode is a feat of endurance.    The one and only bright spot of this premiere is in the very final moments, where it seems like our hapless protagonist has come up with some kind of plan to outsmart the Kokkuri-san game that his friends have all purposefully bought into. That, at least, could be a novel twist to this whole setup – our hero having to 4D-Chess his way into making his friends all play fair so they can clear their debts together, forcing a happy ending in the face of obvious psychological manipulation. I have very little faith that's where the show will actually go, but it would at least be a spin on this scenario that I haven't seen done a million times.

(That I then spent the rest of the episode being disturbed that baby-voiced, utterly helpless Kokorogi was labeled “the sexy one” is an entirely different issue.) This makes the matter of who survives and who dies not all that compelling of an issue, because not only do we not like any of them, we don't KNOW any of them. At this point I'm voting for Tenoji to go first because his hair looks like someone took a bite out of it and that annoys me unreasonably.    The survival game genre isn't impossible to do well. It's perhaps not even particularly difficult to do well. But Tomodachi Game seems hellbent on getting in its own way as much as possible with its paltry introductions, explanations that go between “too much” and “not enough,” and some very lackluster visuals. Unless you love the genre and will consume all forms of it, maybe give this a pass.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               I give isekai shows a lot of guff for being simultaneously ubiquitous and dull, but if there's one genre that can eclipse even that otherworldly monolith in pure tedium, it's death games. One of my biggest worries is the massive success of Squid Game bringing this already over-saturated story idea to the big stage. And while this show isn't strictly a death game – all that's currently at stake is money – it's just as much of a slog to get through as every other hackney edgelord parade that tries to come up with a new spin on the prisoner's dilemma.    The biggest reason for that is just how undercooked the “Tomodachi” part of its title is. This is meant to be a dark and gritty look at how five dear and loving friends can be pushed to betray each other for money, but the central friendships of the group are basically nonexistent. We get all of one scene of the five characters talking before they're thrown into this low-rent Kakegurui ripoff, so watching their tenuous friendship fall apart while they play the most obviously rigged game on the planet just isn't dramatic. These are people we've gotten to know mainly through a single screen of text explaining their personalities to us, and none of them have strong enough personalities to overcome that and make this whole ordeal interesting. When they start betraying each other it doesn't mean anything because none of them are real characters, so the entire tension of this game falls flat.    I'm also just so, so tired of every one of these having to bark up the same tree. Every single one of these things thinks they need their own Monokuma, but once you've seen a couple creepy-cute mascot characters who are secretly ~evil~ it loses its impact. As such, all the CG anime mascot character amounts to is a squeaky-voiced exposition machine with zero impact. Add in the random overseer girls who have to comment on everything from their surveillance room, smugly laughing about how their totally devious mind games will ruin another friendship and you have a story that's so insufferably impressed with its cut-rate edginess that finishing the episode is a feat of endurance.    The one and only bright spot of this premiere is in the very final moments, where it seems like our hapless protagonist has come up with some kind of plan to outsmart the Kokkuri-san game that his friends have all purposefully bought into. That, at least, could be a novel twist to this whole setup – our hero having to 4D-Chess his way into making his friends all play fair so they can clear their debts together, forcing a happy ending in the face of obvious psychological manipulation. I have very little faith that's where the show will actually go, but it would at least be a spin on this scenario that I haven't seen done a million times.

Community score: 2.9              What is this?   Yūichi Katagiri, a young man with a perfect student life who has four friends with difficult lives. His peaceful daily life comes to an end when 2 million yen (about US$20,000) in school trip fees goes missing. Riddles unfold as Yūichi gets caught up in a mysterious game for money and must decide whether friendship or money matters more.    Tomodachi Game is based on Yuki Sato's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                Any time a survival game anime pops up during Preview Guide, I get a little anxious. Not because I dislike the genre or anything—Danganronpa is one of my favorite franchises, as it so happens. The problem is that, for every smash hit like Danganronpa, it feels like there are a dozen would-be imitators that keep trying (and failing) to find new and fresh ways to mess with murder/betrayal/escape-room formula. To put it bluntly, a lot of survival game anime kind of suck. Tomodachi Game doesn't exactly suck, and there are even elements of this premiere that I find fairly interesting, but the overall package is just so wrapped up in tired clichés and mediocre presentation that it's hard to muster up enough energy to care one way or the other.    I'll give it this, though: It's nice that Yuichi and all of the other contestants of this weird game were all friends first. There's no amnesia, no cadre of bizarrely coifed and cartoonishly rendered strangers who all have to monologue about their backstories one after the other. The angle that Tomodachi Game is exploring is a tried and true one, but it's effective nonetheless. It asks, “How well do you really know your best friends? And how much pressure would it take, financial or otherwise, before the masks come off and even the closest of companions turn on each other?”    It's just a shame the game being used to exploit this premise is so ludicrously overcomplicated, not to mention heavy-handed as all hell. You know what makes an interesting thriller premise like the one above a lot less interesting? When a cast of vaguely defined characters are forced to participate in an inane game-show that is designed to have every single element of their experience literally scream, over and over, “CAN YOU TRUST YOUR FRIENDS? HUH? I BETCHA CAN'T!!” It kind of ruins the experience.    Don't get me started on the knockoff Monokuma, either. I get that all of these survival game anime feel obligated to include a “wacky"" mascot character, but they really shouldn't try so goddamned hard just because Danganronpa and Assassination Classroom made bank on the concept. And no, I don't even care that Manabu-kun is actually voiced by the actress who played actual Danganronpa protagonist Hajime Hinata. I hate the little creep. He's goofy-looking and obnoxious, and the show does a terrible job of blending the interactions of the CG character model with his 2D counterparts. Every time Manabu was onscreen, I wanted to see someone toss him straight out of a window and into oncoming traffic.    Worst of all, I feel like I'm going to see most of the “shocking"" and “edgy"" twists of this story coming well in advance, so, unless something positively wild and unheard of is yet to come in this story, I'm happy to give Tomodachi Game a pass. There have been other, better riffs on this formula over the years, and I'd rather revisit those than stick it out with a mediocre-seeming also-ran like this one. I'm going to call it right now, though, with absolutely no prior knowledge of the series or anything: It was the meek girl that got all of the friends roped into the game. I bet she's also secretly a psycho yandere. Hit me up in a few weeks if it turns out that I'm right.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               In general, I enjoy anime that focus on high-stakes, psychological games—be they death games or more gambling-focused ones. However, Tomodachi Game didn't excite me at all. When watching an anime set in a well-established genre, there is one question always at the back of my mind: What sets this show apart?  In the case of Tomodachi Game, the answer is ""nothing."" It's totally bland.    The characters, at this point, are surface layer clichés. We have the uptight beauty, the cute girl, the serious one, and the frivolous playboy. Even the main character is little more than ""the poor kid."" The result is Kakegurui without a Yumeko—a show with drama but no one for the audience to care about on a personal level.    Yet, even that drama is lackluster. Not only does the show reveal the masterminds behind the curtain way too easily, but their lackluster commentary in no way replaces the tension that comes from having no idea what is going on behind the scenes. Then there are the constant blink-and-you'll-miss-it text dumps on screen that require you to pause to read. This effectively hamstrings the show's pacing. But even worse, it obliterates the audience's sense of immersion. You can't just sit back and lose yourself in the world Tomodachi Game is trying to create: you've got to be ready to hit pause and read exposition at a moment's notice or miss out on vital information—like the literal rules of the game they are playing!    All that and the episode doesn't even manage to stick the landing. While the game itself is easy enough to understand, the lack of resolution within the first episode is a hindrance. After all, a cliffhanger only works if you care enough about the characters or story to want to come back next week. I don't.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Ah, emotional manipulation. Such a charming premise for any show, so why not make it even more lovely by throwing in a couple of random evil high school girls running a death game for groups of, specifically, five friends? Bonus points if it turns out that the entire thing was set up to point out the shoddy, self-serving nature of friendship, but it's the girls running the game who learn a little something about true friendship along the way instead!    Despite that opening paragraph, my main issue with Tomodachi Game really isn't its premise. Survival games have been a staple of fiction since at LEAST The Most Dangerous Game, and very likely before then if I could be bothered to remember any.

I'm going to call it right now, though, with absolutely no prior knowledge of the series or anything: It was the meek girl that got all of the friends roped into the game. I bet she's also secretly a psycho yandere. Hit me up in a few weeks if it turns out that I'm right.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               In general, I enjoy anime that focus on high-stakes, psychological games—be they death games or more gambling-focused ones. However, Tomodachi Game didn't excite me at all. When watching an anime set in a well-established genre, there is one question always at the back of my mind: What sets this show apart?  In the case of Tomodachi Game, the answer is ""nothing."" It's totally bland.    The characters, at this point, are surface layer clichés. We have the uptight beauty, the cute girl, the serious one, and the frivolous playboy. Even the main character is little more than ""the poor kid."" The result is Kakegurui without a Yumeko—a show with drama but no one for the audience to care about on a personal level.    Yet, even that drama is lackluster. Not only does the show reveal the masterminds behind the curtain way too easily, but their lackluster commentary in no way replaces the tension that comes from having no idea what is going on behind the scenes. Then there are the constant blink-and-you'll-miss-it text dumps on screen that require you to pause to read. This effectively hamstrings the show's pacing. But even worse, it obliterates the audience's sense of immersion. You can't just sit back and lose yourself in the world Tomodachi Game is trying to create: you've got to be ready to hit pause and read exposition at a moment's notice or miss out on vital information—like the literal rules of the game they are playing!    All that and the episode doesn't even manage to stick the landing. While the game itself is easy enough to understand, the lack of resolution within the first episode is a hindrance. After all, a cliffhanger only works if you care enough about the characters or story to want to come back next week. I don't.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Ah, emotional manipulation. Such a charming premise for any show, so why not make it even more lovely by throwing in a couple of random evil high school girls running a death game for groups of, specifically, five friends? Bonus points if it turns out that the entire thing was set up to point out the shoddy, self-serving nature of friendship, but it's the girls running the game who learn a little something about true friendship along the way instead!    Despite that opening paragraph, my main issue with Tomodachi Game really isn't its premise. Survival games have been a staple of fiction since at LEAST The Most Dangerous Game, and very likely before then if I could be bothered to remember any. Likewise the idea of how trustworthy your so-called friends are is one of the founding principles of certain YA subgenres, so the show is on fairly solid ground with its group of five pals who are tased into a strange white space that turns out to be someone's twisted playground. Starting things off with stolen money for a field trip also works decently well, even if one of the group was the one who's most likely to suffer for the loss and two others are among those most likely to have taken it in the first place. (In reality, I suspect that the girls running the game are responsible.) Where things falter is in the execution of the story, which seems to be a bit of a theme for today's episodes. The main problem is that we barely know these kids and no effort is expended to remedy that situation. In fact, a card with their names and their basic stereotypes is displayed at one point, letting us know precisely which genre trope everyone fits into. (That I then spent the rest of the episode being disturbed that baby-voiced, utterly helpless Kokorogi was labeled “the sexy one” is an entirely different issue.) This makes the matter of who survives and who dies not all that compelling of an issue, because not only do we not like any of them, we don't KNOW any of them. At this point I'm voting for Tenoji to go first because his hair looks like someone took a bite out of it and that annoys me unreasonably.    The survival game genre isn't impossible to do well. It's perhaps not even particularly difficult to do well. But Tomodachi Game seems hellbent on getting in its own way as much as possible with its paltry introductions, explanations that go between “too much” and “not enough,” and some very lackluster visuals. Unless you love the genre and will consume all forms of it, maybe give this a pass.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               I give isekai shows a lot of guff for being simultaneously ubiquitous and dull, but if there's one genre that can eclipse even that otherworldly monolith in pure tedium, it's death games. One of my biggest worries is the massive success of Squid Game bringing this already over-saturated story idea to the big stage. And while this show isn't strictly a death game – all that's currently at stake is money – it's just as much of a slog to get through as every other hackney edgelord parade that tries to come up with a new spin on the prisoner's dilemma.    The biggest reason for that is just how undercooked the “Tomodachi” part of its title is. This is meant to be a dark and gritty look at how five dear and loving friends can be pushed to betray each other for money, but the central friendships of the group are basically nonexistent. We get all of one scene of the five characters talking before they're thrown into this low-rent Kakegurui ripoff, so watching their tenuous friendship fall apart while they play the most obviously rigged game on the planet just isn't dramatic. These are people we've gotten to know mainly through a single screen of text explaining their personalities to us, and none of them have strong enough personalities to overcome that and make this whole ordeal interesting. When they start betraying each other it doesn't mean anything because none of them are real characters, so the entire tension of this game falls flat.    I'm also just so, so tired of every one of these having to bark up the same tree. Every single one of these things thinks they need their own Monokuma, but once you've seen a couple creepy-cute mascot characters who are secretly ~evil~ it loses its impact. As such, all the CG anime mascot character amounts to is a squeaky-voiced exposition machine with zero impact. Add in the random overseer girls who have to comment on everything from their surveillance room, smugly laughing about how their totally devious mind games will ruin another friendship and you have a story that's so insufferably impressed with its cut-rate edginess that finishing the episode is a feat of endurance.    The one and only bright spot of this premiere is in the very final moments, where it seems like our hapless protagonist has come up with some kind of plan to outsmart the Kokkuri-san game that his friends have all purposefully bought into. That, at least, could be a novel twist to this whole setup – our hero having to 4D-Chess his way into making his friends all play fair so they can clear their debts together, forcing a happy ending in the face of obvious psychological manipulation. I have very little faith that's where the show will actually go, but it would at least be a spin on this scenario that I haven't seen done a million times. It's still not enough to make watch more of this charmless bore, but it's something, I guess.

Pile of Shame FINAL: Chie the Brat The Pile of Shame recedes into the mists of history with one final installment, on Isao Takahata's criminally underseen Chie the Brat.  « »     Pile of Shame        — Archives —                  Filters          All Southeast Asia  •  Anime Manga Novels Games Music Merch Events Industry People Live-Action COVID-19           Text-only Compact View             Text-only List View             Text-only Grid View             List View with Images             Grid View with Images                               column          39 comments       Pile of Shame - Colorful   2014 Nov 12, 01:00 39 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look at an understated art house drama anime from a few years ago, and finds a lot to admire. ―  COLORFUL To paraphrase Hideaki Anno, people don't commit suicide because they're depressed, people commit suicide because they can no longer imagine happiness. That thought occurred to me again and again while I was watching Colorful, the remarkable feature film produced by Sunrise in 2010,...                    column          16 comments       Pile of Shame - SOS!

Tokyo Metro Explorers: The Next Anime fans who were around back in 2007 might remember a company briefly appearing on the scene known as Bandai Visual USA. If they do remember, it's usually not a fond memory: BVUSA was the first attempt by a major Japanese anime producer to insert themselves into th...                           column          17 comments       Pile of Shame - Dead Heat & 3D Anime   2014 Oct 15, 00:00 17 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look at the first (and one of the only) 3D anime ever made, for an obscure videodisc system only sold in Japan. ―  Dead Heat Sometimes the reasons behind an anime getting made are more interesting than the show itself. That's definitely the case with Dead Heat, an obscure 1987 OAV from Sunrise that runs only a half hour. Back in the wild days of the nascent 80s home video market, there...                    column          49 comments       Pile of Shame - Special Duty Combat Unit Shinesman   2014 Oct  1, 00:06 49 comments                 anime    Justin revisits what was once considered the finest sentai parody in the land. Does it still hold up? ―  Special Duty Combat Unit Shinesman It's always a terrifying thing, going back to old shows you loved when you were younger and revisiting them. Many of them, comedies in particular, tend to age very poorly. They connect with us at the time, but humor is just so particular and fickle -- what made y...                    column          31 comments       Pile of Shame - Bite Me! Chameleon   2014 Sep 17, 00:00 31 comments                 anime    This little-seen delinquent comedy, an early ADV release, made Justin want to hurt himself. ―  Bite Me! Chameleon There are at least four genres of anime that, no matter what anybody does, always seem to completely fall on their face when released in the West: sports, realistic military, yakuza and yankee (juvenile delinquent) shows. These were discovered through a lot of trial and error in the early...                    column          18 comments       Pile of Shame - The Tibetan Dog   2014 Sep  3, 00:21 18 comments                 anime    An underappreciated Madhouse feature from 2011 featuring a boy and his dog in the harsh terrain of Tibet. ―  The Tibetan Dog Japanese/Chinese co-productions don't happen very often. The last one I can think of would be 1997's anime adaptation of Tsui Hark's Chinese Ghost Story, which was charming in appearance but kind of a plodding, pointless affair. In 2007 another one started production, after ani...                    column          10 comments       Pile of Shame - The Enemy's The Pirates!   2014 Aug 20, 00:00 10 comments                 anime    Justin tries to return to an old 90s favorite that has become more famous for its obscure, awful dub. ―  The Enemy's The Pirates! ~The Cat's Banquet~ There's a Japanese tradition of stand-up comedy duos known as ""manzai (漫才)."" Manzai routines are high-speed, rapid-fire conversations between one person, who's an idiot or a weirdo of some kind (boke), and a straight man (tsukkomi), who's constantly mut...                    column          32 comments       Pile of Shame - MARCO: 3,000 Leagues in Search of Mother   2014 Aug  6, 02:40 32 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look at a remake of Takahata's World Masterpiece Theater classic. Does it hold up? Ehh... ―  MARCO: 3,000 Leagues in Search of Mother We need to declare a new genre of anime, right here and now. There needs to be a separate category for the metric ton of overwrought family fare Japan makes, that aims to be Studio Ghibli in quality, but ends up succumbing to its maudlin sentimentality a...                    column          6 comments       Pile of Shame - Eiji   2014 Jul 22, 22:59 6 comments                 anime    Hisashi Eguchi's boxing manga got a short movie treatment back in 1990, but does it hold up? ―  Eiji Hisashi Eguchi is probably a guy that's better known among Japanese creatives than among American otaku. As an illustrator and manga artist, he's designed characters for such anime as Roujin Z and Spriggan, heavily influenced the look of Satoshi Kon's characters (Perfect Blue's final look was based on...                    column          33 comments       Pile of Shame - Mermaid's Scar   2014 Jul  9, 01:15 33 comments                 anime    Rumiko Takahashi's macabre OAV still holds up, and is still creepy, but the dub is really weird sounding. ―  Mermaid's Scar Mermaid's Scar is one of those early stocked-at-every-Blockbuster-Video-in-the-country hits of the VHS era that almost every fan that came of age in the mid-90s saw at one time or another. Colorful, violent, and hypnotic in its own way, it made a big impression on 13-year-old Ju...                    column          10 comments       Pile of Shame - ESPer Mami: Hoshizora no Dancing Doll   2014 Jun 25, 00:00 10 comments                 anime    Justin discovers a once-loved series by the creator of Doraemon, and finds it to be pretty dull. ―  ESPer Mami: Hoshizora no Dancing Doll Even though it's never been particularly popular among anime fans in the West, most people at least have heard of Doraemon, Fujiko F. Fujio's famous magical large blue cat character who's the star of over 2500 episodes of TV anime and 35 movies (not including short...                    column          18 comments       Pile of Shame - Guyver: Out of Control   2014 Jun 11, 03:43 18 comments                 anime    A mildly entertaining, but super-dated OAV incarnation of everyone's favorite superhero/grotesque monster/schoolboy. ―  Guyver: Out of Control Guyver: Out of Control was one of the earliest anime VHS releases in the US, and being an alternate retelling of the same story that the same company, US Renditions, would later release in dubbed form, was one of the first titles to confuse the hell out of peo...                    column          45 comments       Pile of Shame - Full Moon O Sagashite   2014 May 28, 00:00 45 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look back at the oddball Magical-Idol-Singer-With-Cancer Show from the early '00s. Because every little girl loves stories about dying tragically. ―  Full Moon o Sagashite I often joke that I love shows about children suffering. I usually mean that as a joke: anime usually involves young protagonists, but too often their concerns are superficial: being the best at a game, or a sport, o...                    column          34 comments       Pile of Shame - 3x3 Eyes   2014 May 14, 02:26 34 comments                 anime    Once a mainstay of anime club video rooms, 3x3 Eyes isn't brought up very often today. Does it stand up? Justin finds out. ―  3x3 EYES Yuzo Takada was never really a big name among American otaku, but back in the 90s his stuff ranked as some of the most popular anime of its day, including Blue Seed, Cat Girl Nuku Nuku, and this -- 3x3 EYES, a dark and gory adventure OAV that once adorned a good numbe...                    column          20 comments       Pile of Shame - Legend of the Dragon Kings   2014 Apr 30, 00:00 20 comments                 anime    A highly mediocre adaptation of a best-selling book series that was illustrated by Yoshitaka Amano and CLAMP. The anime looks nothing like that, of course. ―  Legend of the Dragon Kings(A.K.A. Sohryuden, Legend of the Four Kings) When a much-loved book or manga series gets a TV anime adaptation, fans of the original work hold their breath. Some adaptations improve on the original work. Others take it...                    column          8 comments       Pile of Shame - Nitaboh   2014 Apr 16, 00:00 8 comments                 anime    One of the few anime biographies, Nitaboh is surprisingly formulaic for being a true story. ―  Nitaboh, The Shamisen Master Last year, an old friend of mine asked me to help a non-profit group of radio producers come up with a Kickstarter video for a public radio project called ""Heavenly Sight,"" a multi-part audio documentary and web resource on blind African American blues and jazz musicians. It was...                    column          18 comments       Pile of Shame - Dark Warrior (Makyu Senjo)   2014 Apr  2, 00:00 18 comments                 anime    A non-hentai show from hentai producers that somehow nobody remembers, despite getting two dubs. There's a reason. ―  Dark Warrior (Makyu Senjo) It's pretty rare that an anime gets released in both the US and the UK, and with English dubs no less, and yet hardly anyone even remembers the show exists. Dark Warrior (AKA Makyu Senjo) is one of those, seemingly having made zero impact on fans upon its re...                    column          20 comments       Pile of Shame - Goddamn!!   2014 Mar 19, 06:39 20 comments                 anime    A rally car racing OAV that, aside from the provocative name, doesn't make much of an impact. ―  Goddamn!! Kaoru Shintani has never had much of an American fanbase. His most famous work, the fighter pilot drama series Area 88, landed in the US with a resounding thud in both of its anime adaptations as well as Viz's repeated attempts to publish the manga in English. I lay blame for that mostly in his ...                    column          23 comments       Pile of Shame - Adventures of Hols, Prince of the Sun   2014 Mar  5, 02:24 23 comments                 anime    Isao Takahata's troubled first feature is easily the best anime of the 1960s. ―  Adventures of Hols, Prince of the Sun It's the iron age, somewhere in Scandinavia, and a young boy warrior named Hols is just coming back home from a fierce battle with a pack of wolves. His father, on his deathbed, bids him to return to the Northern village they fled years ago, when an evil sorcerer named Grunwald devas...                    column          8 comments       Pile of Shame - Ai City   2014 Feb 19, 01:00 8 comments                 anime    A sleeper sci-fi film from Koichi Mashimo that might break your brain, but will definitely dazzle your eyes while doing so. ―  Ai City In the opening scenes of Ai City, we are dropped into the middle of a car chase in what is possibly New York City. In the back seat is a former cop, who was fired and is now a private investigator. He doesn't know why he's there, and neither do we. In the front seat a...                    column          14 comments       Pile of Shame - Natsuki Crisis   2014 Feb  5, 01:00 14 comments                 anime    A fun two-part girls-fighting-in-high-school OAV that doesn't take itself too seriously... until it does. ―  Natsuki Crisis When we first meet Kitsumi Natsuki, she's in her school dojo, gleefully trying to find a sparring partner. The rest of the team is all guys, but they don't stand a chance against the tomboy, and politely bow out. In addition to being fearfullly strong, Natsuki is also the protog...                    column          13 comments       Pile of Shame - Seven Cities Story   2014 Jan 22, 01:00 13 comments                 anime    A two-part OAV that tries to transplant Legend of Galactic Heroes onto a sideways-rotated Earth, and succeeds only in being dull and confusing. ―  Seven Cities Story One day, with no warning, the Earth's polar axis shifts 90 degrees, shaking up human civilization like an Etch-A-Sketch and killing everybody. Luckily by this time, humanity had a pretty decent settlement going on the moon, and once thin...                    column          23 comments       Pile of Shame - After School Tinker Bell   2014 Jan  8, 01:00 23 comments                 anime    This week, an OAV based on a light novel series about a romantic couple that solves mysteries around their school. ―  After School Tinker Bell In the last few years there have been a ton of anime adapted from light novels: those small, pulpy, simply written and easy-to-read populist books that lie somewhere between young adult novels and manga. But light novels have been around for a very long time, ...                    column          12 comments       Pile of Shame - Handsome Girl   2013 Dec 25, 01:00 12 comments                 anime    Justin revisits an old one-shot OAV by the creator of Marmalade Boy... and is a little underwhelmed. ―  Handsome Girl When I was in high school, I loved the show Marmalade Boy. A lot. In fact, I wrote an article about it! A perfectly addictive confectionary of chaste teenaged yearning and romance, and undiluted raw crippling angst, I lost many an evening to the adventures of the lovelorn protagonists...                    column          11 comments       Pile of Shame - The Sensualist   2013 Dec 11, 02:10 11 comments                 anime    This week, a unique erotic historical fiction film that has completely slipped through the cracks. ―  The Sensualist (A.K.A. The Life of an Amorous Man) I first saw The Sensualist as a fuzzy VHS tape when I was a teenager. While it's ostensibly an adult work, it never seemed lurid or arousing to me. Rather, it held this strange transcendent beauty. It felt like a piece of another person's life, so fo...                    column          16 comments       Pile of Shame - Emblem Take 2   2013 Nov 27, 02:02 16 comments                 anime    This week, a rare yakuza time travel comedy. Perhaps the ONLY yakuza time travel comedy. ―  Emblem Take 2 Yakuza aren't a pleasant topic. Japan's fully-entrenched organized crime families and organizations, and their connections with everything from banking to entertainment to politics show us Japan at its most corrupt and embarrassing. Unless you go looking for trouble in Tokyo, it's unlikely that a...                    column          17 comments       Pile of Shame: Ai Monogatari: 9 Love Stories   2013 Nov 13, 01:13 17 comments                 anime    Trying to watch this OAV like biting into a large wad of wet cotton: it's not offensive or unpleasant, but you want to end the experience as fast as humanly possible. ―  Ai Monogatari: 9 Love Stories If there's anything that anime lacks, it's real, adult love stories. We have enough yearning, angsty teen romance to sink a battleship, but realistic love stories about people whose frontal lobes are fir...                    column          23 comments       Pile of Shame - Wanna-Be's   2013 Oct 30, 00:01 23 comments     Did anyone say ""I want more women's wrestling anime?"" .... No? Didn't think so. ―  Wanna-Be's Lately there's been a lot of chatter about the girls' wrestling TV series, Wanna Be The Strongest In The World. Given that virtually none of the chatter is positive, I'm not really making plans to check out the show for myself. But hearing about a mediocre girls' wresting anime did jog my memory about anothe...                    column          5 comments       Pile of Shame - Grandeek: The Alternative   2013 Sep 18, 00:56 5 comments                 anime    An early digipaint OAV that has a lot of potential, but is so awkwardly made that the storytelling really suffers. ―  Grandeek: The Alternative When visiting Japan, one of my favorite things to do is explore the DVD sections of every Book Off location I can find. Usually I can identify and easily dismiss pretty much everything on the shelf, but every once in a while I happen upon something that I hav...                    column          17 comments       Pile of Shame - Butt Attack Punisher Girl Gautaman   2013 Sep  4, 00:00 17 comments                 anime                manga    It could've been offensive, bawdy, witty and hilarious. Instead, it's just sort of lazy and crappy. ―  Butt Attack Punisher Girl Gautaman One thing you can say about Butt Attack Girl Punisher Gautaman (and its sequel OAV, Butt Attack Punisher Girl Gautaman R), you know pretty much exactly what you're getting: a cut-rate early-90s dirty comedy OAV about a girl that beats dudes down with her butt. It o...                    column          43 comments       Pile of Shame - Yagami-kun's Family Affairs   2013 Aug 21, 00:08 43 comments                 anime    This week, a slapstick comedy OAV from 1990 that's all about incest. ―  Yagami-kun's Family Affairs Remember when incest was shocking? I mean that honestly. There was a time not long ago, even in otaku circles, when the idea of incest was odd and outré enough to elicit giggles from the less mature parts of ourselves, and maybe even an ""oh god."" You can tell what we used to be like by going up to your...                    column          28 comments       Pile of Shame - Moshidora   2013 Aug  7, 02:32 28 comments                 anime    Only Japan would attempt to take a business management textbook and turn it into a high school sports story. ―  Moshidora When I first heard the premise behind Moshidora, which is short for a ridiculously long title that translates to, ""What If the Girl Manager of a High School Baseball Team Read Drucker's 'Management?'"" I believe I laughed and said, ""Oh, Japan."" Because really, what other response i...                    column          22 comments       Pile of Shame - Kenya Boy   2013 Jul 24, 01:00 22 comments                 anime    Adjectives fail Justin has he tries to describe the absolute insanity contained in a 1984 feature film retelling of a popular 1950s manga series. ― One of the benefits to writing a column on obscure anime for so long is that occasionally friends hand you things that they think would inspire a good column.

Pile of Shame FINAL: Chie the Brat The Pile of Shame recedes into the mists of history with one final installment, on Isao Takahata's criminally underseen Chie the Brat.  « »     Pile of Shame        — Archives —                  Filters          All Southeast Asia  •  Anime Manga Novels Games Music Merch Events Industry People Live-Action COVID-19           Text-only Compact View             Text-only List View             Text-only Grid View             List View with Images             Grid View with Images                               column          39 comments       Pile of Shame - Colorful   2014 Nov 12, 01:00 39 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look at an understated art house drama anime from a few years ago, and finds a lot to admire. ―  COLORFUL To paraphrase Hideaki Anno, people don't commit suicide because they're depressed, people commit suicide because they can no longer imagine happiness. That thought occurred to me again and again while I was watching Colorful, the remarkable feature film produced by Sunrise in 2010,...                    column          16 comments       Pile of Shame - SOS!

Tokyo Metro Explorers: The Next Anime fans who were around back in 2007 might remember a company briefly appearing on the scene known as Bandai Visual USA. If they do remember, it's usually not a fond memory: BVUSA was the first attempt by a major Japanese anime producer to insert themselves into th...                           column          17 comments       Pile of Shame - Dead Heat & 3D Anime   2014 Oct 15, 00:00 17 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look at the first (and one of the only) 3D anime ever made, for an obscure videodisc system only sold in Japan. ―  Dead Heat Sometimes the reasons behind an anime getting made are more interesting than the show itself. That's definitely the case with Dead Heat, an obscure 1987 OAV from Sunrise that runs only a half hour. Back in the wild days of the nascent 80s home video market, there...                    column          49 comments       Pile of Shame - Special Duty Combat Unit Shinesman   2014 Oct  1, 00:06 49 comments                 anime    Justin revisits what was once considered the finest sentai parody in the land. Does it still hold up? ―  Special Duty Combat Unit Shinesman It's always a terrifying thing, going back to old shows you loved when you were younger and revisiting them. Many of them, comedies in particular, tend to age very poorly. They connect with us at the time, but humor is just so particular and fickle -- what made y...                    column          31 comments       Pile of Shame - Bite Me! Chameleon   2014 Sep 17, 00:00 31 comments                 anime    This little-seen delinquent comedy, an early ADV release, made Justin want to hurt himself. ―  Bite Me! Chameleon There are at least four genres of anime that, no matter what anybody does, always seem to completely fall on their face when released in the West: sports, realistic military, yakuza and yankee (juvenile delinquent) shows. These were discovered through a lot of trial and error in the early...                    column          18 comments       Pile of Shame - The Tibetan Dog   2014 Sep  3, 00:21 18 comments                 anime    An underappreciated Madhouse feature from 2011 featuring a boy and his dog in the harsh terrain of Tibet. ―  The Tibetan Dog Japanese/Chinese co-productions don't happen very often. The last one I can think of would be 1997's anime adaptation of Tsui Hark's Chinese Ghost Story, which was charming in appearance but kind of a plodding, pointless affair. In 2007 another one started production, after ani...                    column          10 comments       Pile of Shame - The Enemy's The Pirates!   2014 Aug 20, 00:00 10 comments                 anime    Justin tries to return to an old 90s favorite that has become more famous for its obscure, awful dub. ―  The Enemy's The Pirates! ~The Cat's Banquet~ There's a Japanese tradition of stand-up comedy duos known as ""manzai (漫才)."" Manzai routines are high-speed, rapid-fire conversations between one person, who's an idiot or a weirdo of some kind (boke), and a straight man (tsukkomi), who's constantly mut...                    column          32 comments       Pile of Shame - MARCO: 3,000 Leagues in Search of Mother   2014 Aug  6, 02:40 32 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look at a remake of Takahata's World Masterpiece Theater classic. Does it hold up? Ehh... ―  MARCO: 3,000 Leagues in Search of Mother We need to declare a new genre of anime, right here and now. There needs to be a separate category for the metric ton of overwrought family fare Japan makes, that aims to be Studio Ghibli in quality, but ends up succumbing to its maudlin sentimentality a...                    column          6 comments       Pile of Shame - Eiji   2014 Jul 22, 22:59 6 comments                 anime    Hisashi Eguchi's boxing manga got a short movie treatment back in 1990, but does it hold up? ―  Eiji Hisashi Eguchi is probably a guy that's better known among Japanese creatives than among American otaku. As an illustrator and manga artist, he's designed characters for such anime as Roujin Z and Spriggan, heavily influenced the look of Satoshi Kon's characters (Perfect Blue's final look was based on...                    column          33 comments       Pile of Shame - Mermaid's Scar   2014 Jul  9, 01:15 33 comments                 anime    Rumiko Takahashi's macabre OAV still holds up, and is still creepy, but the dub is really weird sounding. ―  Mermaid's Scar Mermaid's Scar is one of those early stocked-at-every-Blockbuster-Video-in-the-country hits of the VHS era that almost every fan that came of age in the mid-90s saw at one time or another. Colorful, violent, and hypnotic in its own way, it made a big impression on 13-year-old Ju...                    column          10 comments       Pile of Shame - ESPer Mami: Hoshizora no Dancing Doll   2014 Jun 25, 00:00 10 comments                 anime    Justin discovers a once-loved series by the creator of Doraemon, and finds it to be pretty dull. ―  ESPer Mami: Hoshizora no Dancing Doll Even though it's never been particularly popular among anime fans in the West, most people at least have heard of Doraemon, Fujiko F. Fujio's famous magical large blue cat character who's the star of over 2500 episodes of TV anime and 35 movies (not including short...                    column          18 comments       Pile of Shame - Guyver: Out of Control   2014 Jun 11, 03:43 18 comments                 anime    A mildly entertaining, but super-dated OAV incarnation of everyone's favorite superhero/grotesque monster/schoolboy. ―  Guyver: Out of Control Guyver: Out of Control was one of the earliest anime VHS releases in the US, and being an alternate retelling of the same story that the same company, US Renditions, would later release in dubbed form, was one of the first titles to confuse the hell out of peo...                    column          45 comments       Pile of Shame - Full Moon O Sagashite   2014 May 28, 00:00 45 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look back at the oddball Magical-Idol-Singer-With-Cancer Show from the early '00s. Because every little girl loves stories about dying tragically. ―  Full Moon o Sagashite I often joke that I love shows about children suffering. I usually mean that as a joke: anime usually involves young protagonists, but too often their concerns are superficial: being the best at a game, or a sport, o...                    column          34 comments       Pile of Shame - 3x3 Eyes   2014 May 14, 02:26 34 comments                 anime    Once a mainstay of anime club video rooms, 3x3 Eyes isn't brought up very often today. Does it stand up? Justin finds out. ―  3x3 EYES Yuzo Takada was never really a big name among American otaku, but back in the 90s his stuff ranked as some of the most popular anime of its day, including Blue Seed, Cat Girl Nuku Nuku, and this -- 3x3 EYES, a dark and gory adventure OAV that once adorned a good numbe...                    column          20 comments       Pile of Shame - Legend of the Dragon Kings   2014 Apr 30, 00:00 20 comments                 anime    A highly mediocre adaptation of a best-selling book series that was illustrated by Yoshitaka Amano and CLAMP. The anime looks nothing like that, of course. ―  Legend of the Dragon Kings(A.K.A. Sohryuden, Legend of the Four Kings) When a much-loved book or manga series gets a TV anime adaptation, fans of the original work hold their breath. Some adaptations improve on the original work. Others take it...                    column          8 comments       Pile of Shame - Nitaboh   2014 Apr 16, 00:00 8 comments                 anime    One of the few anime biographies, Nitaboh is surprisingly formulaic for being a true story. ―  Nitaboh, The Shamisen Master Last year, an old friend of mine asked me to help a non-profit group of radio producers come up with a Kickstarter video for a public radio project called ""Heavenly Sight,"" a multi-part audio documentary and web resource on blind African American blues and jazz musicians. It was...                    column          18 comments       Pile of Shame - Dark Warrior (Makyu Senjo)   2014 Apr  2, 00:00 18 comments                 anime    A non-hentai show from hentai producers that somehow nobody remembers, despite getting two dubs. There's a reason. ―  Dark Warrior (Makyu Senjo) It's pretty rare that an anime gets released in both the US and the UK, and with English dubs no less, and yet hardly anyone even remembers the show exists. Dark Warrior (AKA Makyu Senjo) is one of those, seemingly having made zero impact on fans upon its re...                    column          20 comments       Pile of Shame - Goddamn!!   2014 Mar 19, 06:39 20 comments                 anime    A rally car racing OAV that, aside from the provocative name, doesn't make much of an impact. ―  Goddamn!! Kaoru Shintani has never had much of an American fanbase. His most famous work, the fighter pilot drama series Area 88, landed in the US with a resounding thud in both of its anime adaptations as well as Viz's repeated attempts to publish the manga in English. I lay blame for that mostly in his ...                    column          23 comments       Pile of Shame - Adventures of Hols, Prince of the Sun   2014 Mar  5, 02:24 23 comments                 anime    Isao Takahata's troubled first feature is easily the best anime of the 1960s. ―  Adventures of Hols, Prince of the Sun It's the iron age, somewhere in Scandinavia, and a young boy warrior named Hols is just coming back home from a fierce battle with a pack of wolves. His father, on his deathbed, bids him to return to the Northern village they fled years ago, when an evil sorcerer named Grunwald devas...                    column          8 comments       Pile of Shame - Ai City   2014 Feb 19, 01:00 8 comments                 anime    A sleeper sci-fi film from Koichi Mashimo that might break your brain, but will definitely dazzle your eyes while doing so. ―  Ai City In the opening scenes of Ai City, we are dropped into the middle of a car chase in what is possibly New York City. In the back seat is a former cop, who was fired and is now a private investigator. He doesn't know why he's there, and neither do we. In the front seat a...                    column          14 comments       Pile of Shame - Natsuki Crisis   2014 Feb  5, 01:00 14 comments                 anime    A fun two-part girls-fighting-in-high-school OAV that doesn't take itself too seriously... until it does. ―  Natsuki Crisis When we first meet Kitsumi Natsuki, she's in her school dojo, gleefully trying to find a sparring partner. The rest of the team is all guys, but they don't stand a chance against the tomboy, and politely bow out. In addition to being fearfullly strong, Natsuki is also the protog...                    column          13 comments       Pile of Shame - Seven Cities Story   2014 Jan 22, 01:00 13 comments                 anime    A two-part OAV that tries to transplant Legend of Galactic Heroes onto a sideways-rotated Earth, and succeeds only in being dull and confusing. ―  Seven Cities Story One day, with no warning, the Earth's polar axis shifts 90 degrees, shaking up human civilization like an Etch-A-Sketch and killing everybody. Luckily by this time, humanity had a pretty decent settlement going on the moon, and once thin...                    column          23 comments       Pile of Shame - After School Tinker Bell   2014 Jan  8, 01:00 23 comments                 anime    This week, an OAV based on a light novel series about a romantic couple that solves mysteries around their school. ―  After School Tinker Bell In the last few years there have been a ton of anime adapted from light novels: those small, pulpy, simply written and easy-to-read populist books that lie somewhere between young adult novels and manga. But light novels have been around for a very long time, ...                    column          12 comments       Pile of Shame - Handsome Girl   2013 Dec 25, 01:00 12 comments                 anime    Justin revisits an old one-shot OAV by the creator of Marmalade Boy... and is a little underwhelmed. ―  Handsome Girl When I was in high school, I loved the show Marmalade Boy. A lot. In fact, I wrote an article about it! A perfectly addictive confectionary of chaste teenaged yearning and romance, and undiluted raw crippling angst, I lost many an evening to the adventures of the lovelorn protagonists...                    column          11 comments       Pile of Shame - The Sensualist   2013 Dec 11, 02:10 11 comments                 anime    This week, a unique erotic historical fiction film that has completely slipped through the cracks. ―  The Sensualist (A.K.A. The Life of an Amorous Man) I first saw The Sensualist as a fuzzy VHS tape when I was a teenager. While it's ostensibly an adult work, it never seemed lurid or arousing to me. Rather, it held this strange transcendent beauty. It felt like a piece of another person's life, so fo...                    column          16 comments       Pile of Shame - Emblem Take 2   2013 Nov 27, 02:02 16 comments                 anime    This week, a rare yakuza time travel comedy. Perhaps the ONLY yakuza time travel comedy. ―  Emblem Take 2 Yakuza aren't a pleasant topic. Japan's fully-entrenched organized crime families and organizations, and their connections with everything from banking to entertainment to politics show us Japan at its most corrupt and embarrassing.

No? Didn't think so. ―  Wanna-Be's Lately there's been a lot of chatter about the girls' wrestling TV series, Wanna Be The Strongest In The World. Given that virtually none of the chatter is positive, I'm not really making plans to check out the show for myself.

Instead, it's just sort of lazy and crappy. ―  Butt Attack Punisher Girl Gautaman One thing you can say about Butt Attack Girl Punisher Gautaman (and its sequel OAV, Butt Attack Punisher Girl Gautaman R), you know pretty much exactly what you're getting: a cut-rate early-90s dirty comedy OAV about a girl that beats dudes down with her butt.

I mean that honestly. There was a time not long ago, even in otaku circles, when the idea of incest was odd and outré enough to elicit giggles from the less mature parts of ourselves, and maybe even an ""oh god.""

That thought occurred to me again and again while I was watching Colorful, the remarkable feature film produced by Sunrise in 2010,...                    column          16 comments       Pile of Shame - SOS!

Tokyo Metro Explorers: The Next Anime fans who were around back in 2007 might remember a company briefly appearing on the scene known as Bandai Visual USA. If they do remember, it's usually not a fond memory: BVUSA was the first attempt by a major Japanese anime producer to insert themselves into th...                           column          17 comments       Pile of Shame - Dead Heat & 3D Anime   2014 Oct 15, 00:00 17 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look at the first (and one of the only) 3D anime ever made, for an obscure videodisc system only sold in Japan. ―  Dead Heat Sometimes the reasons behind an anime getting made are more interesting than the show itself. That's definitely the case with Dead Heat, an obscure 1987 OAV from Sunrise that runs only a half hour. Back in the wild days of the nascent 80s home video market, there...                    column          49 comments       Pile of Shame - Special Duty Combat Unit Shinesman   2014 Oct  1, 00:06 49 comments                 anime    Justin revisits what was once considered the finest sentai parody in the land. Does it still hold up? ―  Special Duty Combat Unit Shinesman It's always a terrifying thing, going back to old shows you loved when you were younger and revisiting them. Many of them, comedies in particular, tend to age very poorly. They connect with us at the time, but humor is just so particular and fickle -- what made y...                    column          31 comments       Pile of Shame - Bite Me!

Chameleon There are at least four genres of anime that, no matter what anybody does, always seem to completely fall on their face when released in the West: sports, realistic military, yakuza and yankee (juvenile delinquent) shows. These were discovered through a lot of trial and error in the early...                    column          18 comments       Pile of Shame - The Tibetan Dog   2014 Sep  3, 00:21 18 comments                 anime    An underappreciated Madhouse feature from 2011 featuring a boy and his dog in the harsh terrain of Tibet. ―  The Tibetan Dog Japanese/Chinese co-productions don't happen very often. The last one I can think of would be 1997's anime adaptation of Tsui Hark's Chinese Ghost Story, which was charming in appearance but kind of a plodding, pointless affair. In 2007 another one started production, after ani...                    column          10 comments       Pile of Shame - The Enemy's The Pirates!   2014 Aug 20, 00:00 10 comments                 anime    Justin tries to return to an old 90s favorite that has become more famous for its obscure, awful dub. ―  The Enemy's The Pirates! ~The Cat's Banquet~ There's a Japanese tradition of stand-up comedy duos known as ""manzai (漫才)."" Manzai routines are high-speed, rapid-fire conversations between one person, who's an idiot or a weirdo of some kind (boke), and a straight man (tsukkomi), who's constantly mut...                    column          32 comments       Pile of Shame - MARCO: 3,000 Leagues in Search of Mother   2014 Aug  6, 02:40 32 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look at a remake of Takahata's World Masterpiece Theater classic. Does it hold up? Ehh... ―  MARCO: 3,000 Leagues in Search of Mother We need to declare a new genre of anime, right here and now. There needs to be a separate category for the metric ton of overwrought family fare Japan makes, that aims to be Studio Ghibli in quality, but ends up succumbing to its maudlin sentimentality a...                    column          6 comments       Pile of Shame - Eiji   2014 Jul 22, 22:59 6 comments                 anime    Hisashi Eguchi's boxing manga got a short movie treatment back in 1990, but does it hold up? ―  Eiji Hisashi Eguchi is probably a guy that's better known among Japanese creatives than among American otaku. As an illustrator and manga artist, he's designed characters for such anime as Roujin Z and Spriggan, heavily influenced the look of Satoshi Kon's characters (Perfect Blue's final look was based on...                    column          33 comments       Pile of Shame - Mermaid's Scar   2014 Jul  9, 01:15 33 comments                 anime    Rumiko Takahashi's macabre OAV still holds up, and is still creepy, but the dub is really weird sounding. ―  Mermaid's Scar Mermaid's Scar is one of those early stocked-at-every-Blockbuster-Video-in-the-country hits of the VHS era that almost every fan that came of age in the mid-90s saw at one time or another. Colorful, violent, and hypnotic in its own way, it made a big impression on 13-year-old Ju...                    column          10 comments       Pile of Shame - ESPer Mami: Hoshizora no Dancing Doll   2014 Jun 25, 00:00 10 comments                 anime    Justin discovers a once-loved series by the creator of Doraemon, and finds it to be pretty dull. ―  ESPer Mami: Hoshizora no Dancing Doll Even though it's never been particularly popular among anime fans in the West, most people at least have heard of Doraemon, Fujiko F. Fujio's famous magical large blue cat character who's the star of over 2500 episodes of TV anime and 35 movies (not including short...                    column          18 comments       Pile of Shame - Guyver: Out of Control   2014 Jun 11, 03:43 18 comments                 anime    A mildly entertaining, but super-dated OAV incarnation of everyone's favorite superhero/grotesque monster/schoolboy. ―  Guyver: Out of Control Guyver: Out of Control was one of the earliest anime VHS releases in the US, and being an alternate retelling of the same story that the same company, US Renditions, would later release in dubbed form, was one of the first titles to confuse the hell out of peo...                    column          45 comments       Pile of Shame - Full Moon O Sagashite   2014 May 28, 00:00 45 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look back at the oddball Magical-Idol-Singer-With-Cancer Show from the early '00s. Because every little girl loves stories about dying tragically. ―  Full Moon o Sagashite I often joke that I love shows about children suffering. I usually mean that as a joke: anime usually involves young protagonists, but too often their concerns are superficial: being the best at a game, or a sport, o...                    column          34 comments       Pile of Shame - 3x3 Eyes   2014 May 14, 02:26 34 comments                 anime    Once a mainstay of anime club video rooms, 3x3 Eyes isn't brought up very often today. Does it stand up? Justin finds out. ―  3x3 EYES Yuzo Takada was never really a big name among American otaku, but back in the 90s his stuff ranked as some of the most popular anime of its day, including Blue Seed, Cat Girl Nuku Nuku, and this -- 3x3 EYES, a dark and gory adventure OAV that once adorned a good numbe...                    column          20 comments       Pile of Shame - Legend of the Dragon Kings   2014 Apr 30, 00:00 20 comments                 anime    A highly mediocre adaptation of a best-selling book series that was illustrated by Yoshitaka Amano and CLAMP. The anime looks nothing like that, of course. ―  Legend of the Dragon Kings(A.K.A. Sohryuden, Legend of the Four Kings) When a much-loved book or manga series gets a TV anime adaptation, fans of the original work hold their breath. Some adaptations improve on the original work.

There's a reason. ―  Dark Warrior (Makyu Senjo) It's pretty rare that an anime gets released in both the US and the UK, and with English dubs no less, and yet hardly anyone even remembers the show exists. Dark Warrior (AKA Makyu Senjo) is one of those, seemingly having made zero impact on fans upon its re...                    column          20 comments       Pile of Shame - Goddamn!!   2014 Mar 19, 06:39 20 comments                 anime    A rally car racing OAV that, aside from the provocative name, doesn't make much of an impact. ―  Goddamn!! Kaoru Shintani has never had much of an American fanbase. His most famous work, the fighter pilot drama series Area 88, landed in the US with a resounding thud in both of its anime adaptations as well as Viz's repeated attempts to publish the manga in English.

Perhaps the ONLY yakuza time travel comedy. ―  Emblem Take 2 Yakuza aren't a pleasant topic. Japan's fully-entrenched organized crime families and organizations, and their connections with everything from banking to entertainment to politics show us Japan at its most corrupt and embarrassing. Unless you go looking for trouble in Tokyo, it's unlikely that a...                    column          17 comments       Pile of Shame: Ai Monogatari: 9 Love Stories   2013 Nov 13, 01:13 17 comments                 anime    Trying to watch this OAV like biting into a large wad of wet cotton: it's not offensive or unpleasant, but you want to end the experience as fast as humanly possible. ―  Ai Monogatari: 9 Love Stories If there's anything that anime lacks, it's real, adult love stories.

I mean that honestly. There was a time not long ago, even in otaku circles, when the idea of incest was odd and outré enough to elicit giggles from the less mature parts of ourselves, and maybe even an ""oh god.""

That thought occurred to me again and again while I was watching Colorful, the remarkable feature film produced by Sunrise in 2010,...                    column          16 comments       Pile of Shame - SOS!

Tokyo Metro Explorers: The Next Anime fans who were around back in 2007 might remember a company briefly appearing on the scene known as Bandai Visual USA. If they do remember, it's usually not a fond memory: BVUSA was the first attempt by a major Japanese anime producer to insert themselves into th...                           column          17 comments       Pile of Shame - Dead Heat & 3D Anime   2014 Oct 15, 00:00 17 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look at the first (and one of the only) 3D anime ever made, for an obscure videodisc system only sold in Japan. ―  Dead Heat Sometimes the reasons behind an anime getting made are more interesting than the show itself. That's definitely the case with Dead Heat, an obscure 1987 OAV from Sunrise that runs only a half hour. Back in the wild days of the nascent 80s home video market, there...                    column          49 comments       Pile of Shame - Special Duty Combat Unit Shinesman   2014 Oct  1, 00:06 49 comments                 anime    Justin revisits what was once considered the finest sentai parody in the land. Does it still hold up? ―  Special Duty Combat Unit Shinesman It's always a terrifying thing, going back to old shows you loved when you were younger and revisiting them. Many of them, comedies in particular, tend to age very poorly. They connect with us at the time, but humor is just so particular and fickle -- what made y...                    column          31 comments       Pile of Shame - Bite Me!

Chameleon There are at least four genres of anime that, no matter what anybody does, always seem to completely fall on their face when released in the West: sports, realistic military, yakuza and yankee (juvenile delinquent) shows. These were discovered through a lot of trial and error in the early...                    column          18 comments       Pile of Shame - The Tibetan Dog   2014 Sep  3, 00:21 18 comments                 anime    An underappreciated Madhouse feature from 2011 featuring a boy and his dog in the harsh terrain of Tibet. ―  The Tibetan Dog Japanese/Chinese co-productions don't happen very often. The last one I can think of would be 1997's anime adaptation of Tsui Hark's Chinese Ghost Story, which was charming in appearance but kind of a plodding, pointless affair. In 2007 another one started production, after ani...                    column          10 comments       Pile of Shame - The Enemy's The Pirates!   2014 Aug 20, 00:00 10 comments                 anime    Justin tries to return to an old 90s favorite that has become more famous for its obscure, awful dub. ―  The Enemy's The Pirates! ~The Cat's Banquet~ There's a Japanese tradition of stand-up comedy duos known as ""manzai (漫才)."" Manzai routines are high-speed, rapid-fire conversations between one person, who's an idiot or a weirdo of some kind (boke), and a straight man (tsukkomi), who's constantly mut...                    column          32 comments       Pile of Shame - MARCO: 3,000 Leagues in Search of Mother   2014 Aug  6, 02:40 32 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look at a remake of Takahata's World Masterpiece Theater classic. Does it hold up? Ehh... ―  MARCO: 3,000 Leagues in Search of Mother We need to declare a new genre of anime, right here and now. There needs to be a separate category for the metric ton of overwrought family fare Japan makes, that aims to be Studio Ghibli in quality, but ends up succumbing to its maudlin sentimentality a...                    column          6 comments       Pile of Shame - Eiji   2014 Jul 22, 22:59 6 comments                 anime    Hisashi Eguchi's boxing manga got a short movie treatment back in 1990, but does it hold up? ―  Eiji Hisashi Eguchi is probably a guy that's better known among Japanese creatives than among American otaku. As an illustrator and manga artist, he's designed characters for such anime as Roujin Z and Spriggan, heavily influenced the look of Satoshi Kon's characters (Perfect Blue's final look was based on...                    column          33 comments       Pile of Shame - Mermaid's Scar   2014 Jul  9, 01:15 33 comments                 anime    Rumiko Takahashi's macabre OAV still holds up, and is still creepy, but the dub is really weird sounding. ―  Mermaid's Scar Mermaid's Scar is one of those early stocked-at-every-Blockbuster-Video-in-the-country hits of the VHS era that almost every fan that came of age in the mid-90s saw at one time or another. Colorful, violent, and hypnotic in its own way, it made a big impression on 13-year-old Ju...                    column          10 comments       Pile of Shame - ESPer Mami: Hoshizora no Dancing Doll   2014 Jun 25, 00:00 10 comments                 anime    Justin discovers a once-loved series by the creator of Doraemon, and finds it to be pretty dull. ―  ESPer Mami: Hoshizora no Dancing Doll Even though it's never been particularly popular among anime fans in the West, most people at least have heard of Doraemon, Fujiko F.

Because every little girl loves stories about dying tragically. ―  Full Moon o Sagashite I often joke that I love shows about children suffering. I usually mean that as a joke: anime usually involves young protagonists, but too often their concerns are superficial: being the best at a game, or a sport, o...                    column          34 comments       Pile of Shame - 3x3 Eyes   2014 May 14, 02:26 34 comments                 anime    Once a mainstay of anime club video rooms, 3x3 Eyes isn't brought up very often today. Does it stand up? Justin finds out. ―  3x3 EYES Yuzo Takada was never really a big name among American otaku, but back in the 90s his stuff ranked as some of the most popular anime of its day, including Blue Seed, Cat Girl Nuku Nuku, and this -- 3x3 EYES, a dark and gory adventure OAV that once adorned a good numbe...                    column          20 comments       Pile of Shame - Legend of the Dragon Kings   2014 Apr 30, 00:00 20 comments                 anime    A highly mediocre adaptation of a best-selling book series that was illustrated by Yoshitaka Amano and CLAMP. The anime looks nothing like that, of course. ―  Legend of the Dragon Kings(A.K.A. Sohryuden, Legend of the Four Kings) When a much-loved book or manga series gets a TV anime adaptation, fans of the original work hold their breath. Some adaptations improve on the original work.

There's a reason. ―  Dark Warrior (Makyu Senjo) It's pretty rare that an anime gets released in both the US and the UK, and with English dubs no less, and yet hardly anyone even remembers the show exists. Dark Warrior (AKA Makyu Senjo) is one of those, seemingly having made zero impact on fans upon its re...                    column          20 comments       Pile of Shame - Goddamn!!   2014 Mar 19, 06:39 20 comments                 anime    A rally car racing OAV that, aside from the provocative name, doesn't make much of an impact. ―  Goddamn!! Kaoru Shintani has never had much of an American fanbase. His most famous work, the fighter pilot drama series Area 88, landed in the US with a resounding thud in both of its anime adaptations as well as Viz's repeated attempts to publish the manga in English.

Tokyo Metro Explorers: The Next Anime fans who were around back in 2007 might remember a company briefly appearing on the scene known as Bandai Visual USA.

That's definitely the case with Dead Heat, an obscure 1987 OAV from Sunrise that runs only a half hour. Back in the wild days of the nascent 80s home video market, there...                    column          49 comments       Pile of Shame - Special Duty Combat Unit Shinesman   2014 Oct  1, 00:06 49 comments                 anime    Justin revisits what was once considered the finest sentai parody in the land.

Chameleon There are at least four genres of anime that, no matter what anybody does, always seem to completely fall on their face when released in the West: sports, realistic military, yakuza and yankee (juvenile delinquent) shows. These were discovered through a lot of trial and error in the early...                    column          18 comments       Pile of Shame - The Tibetan Dog   2014 Sep  3, 00:21 18 comments                 anime    An underappreciated Madhouse feature from 2011 featuring a boy and his dog in the harsh terrain of Tibet. ―  The Tibetan Dog Japanese/Chinese co-productions don't happen very often. The last one I can think of would be 1997's anime adaptation of Tsui Hark's Chinese Ghost Story, which was charming in appearance but kind of a plodding, pointless affair.

Manzai routines are high-speed, rapid-fire conversations between one person, who's an idiot or a weirdo of some kind (boke), and a straight man (tsukkomi), who's constantly mut...                    column          32 comments       Pile of Shame - MARCO: 3,000 Leagues in Search of Mother   2014 Aug  6, 02:40 32 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look at a remake of Takahata's World Masterpiece Theater classic. Does it hold up? Ehh... ―  MARCO: 3,000 Leagues in Search of Mother We need to declare a new genre of anime, right here and now.

Because every little girl loves stories about dying tragically. ―  Full Moon o Sagashite I often joke that I love shows about children suffering.

Does it stand up? Justin finds out. ―  3x3 EYES Yuzo Takada was never really a big name among American otaku, but back in the 90s his stuff ranked as some of the most popular anime of its day, including Blue Seed, Cat Girl Nuku Nuku, and this -- 3x3 EYES, a dark and gory adventure OAV that once adorned a good numbe...                    column          20 comments       Pile of Shame - Legend of the Dragon Kings   2014 Apr 30, 00:00 20 comments                 anime    A highly mediocre adaptation of a best-selling book series that was illustrated by Yoshitaka Amano and CLAMP. The anime looks nothing like that, of course. ―  Legend of the Dragon Kings(A.K.A.

Dark Warrior (AKA Makyu Senjo) is one of those, seemingly having made zero impact on fans upon its re...                    column          20 comments       Pile of Shame - Goddamn!!   2014 Mar 19, 06:39 20 comments                 anime    A rally car racing OAV that, aside from the provocative name, doesn't make much of an impact. ―  Goddamn!! Kaoru Shintani has never had much of an American fanbase.

Chameleon There are at least four genres of anime that, no matter what anybody does, always seem to completely fall on their face when released in the West: sports, realistic military, yakuza and yankee (juvenile delinquent) shows. These were discovered through a lot of trial and error in the early...                    column          18 comments       Pile of Shame - The Tibetan Dog   2014 Sep  3, 00:21 18 comments                 anime    An underappreciated Madhouse feature from 2011 featuring a boy and his dog in the harsh terrain of Tibet. ―  The Tibetan Dog Japanese/Chinese co-productions don't happen very often. The last one I can think of would be 1997's anime adaptation of Tsui Hark's Chinese Ghost Story, which was charming in appearance but kind of a plodding, pointless affair.

Colorful, violent, and hypnotic in its own way, it made a big impression on 13-year-old Ju...                    column          10 comments       Pile of Shame - ESPer Mami: Hoshizora no Dancing Doll   2014 Jun 25, 00:00 10 comments                 anime    Justin discovers a once-loved series by the creator of Doraemon, and finds it to be pretty dull. ―  ESPer Mami: Hoshizora no Dancing Doll Even though it's never been particularly popular among anime fans in the West, most people at least have heard of Doraemon, Fujiko F.

Because every little girl loves stories about dying tragically. ―  Full Moon o Sagashite I often joke that I love shows about children suffering. I usually mean that as a joke: anime usually involves young protagonists, but too often their concerns are superficial: being the best at a game, or a sport, o...                    column          34 comments       Pile of Shame - 3x3 Eyes   2014 May 14, 02:26 34 comments                 anime    Once a mainstay of anime club video rooms, 3x3 Eyes isn't brought up very often today. Does it stand up? Justin finds out. ―  3x3 EYES Yuzo Takada was never really a big name among American otaku, but back in the 90s his stuff ranked as some of the most popular anime of its day, including Blue Seed, Cat Girl Nuku Nuku, and this -- 3x3 EYES, a dark and gory adventure OAV that once adorned a good numbe...                    column          20 comments       Pile of Shame - Legend of the Dragon Kings   2014 Apr 30, 00:00 20 comments                 anime    A highly mediocre adaptation of a best-selling book series that was illustrated by Yoshitaka Amano and CLAMP. The anime looks nothing like that, of course. ―  Legend of the Dragon Kings(A.K.A.

There's a reason. ―  Dark Warrior (Makyu Senjo) It's pretty rare that an anime gets released in both the US and the UK, and with English dubs no less, and yet hardly anyone even remembers the show exists. Dark Warrior (AKA Makyu Senjo) is one of those, seemingly having made zero impact on fans upon its re...                    column          20 comments       Pile of Shame - Goddamn!!   2014 Mar 19, 06:39 20 comments                 anime    A rally car racing OAV that, aside from the provocative name, doesn't make much of an impact. ―  Goddamn!! Kaoru Shintani has never had much of an American fanbase. His most famous work, the fighter pilot drama series Area 88, landed in the US with a resounding thud in both of its anime adaptations as well as Viz's repeated attempts to publish the manga in English.

His father, on his deathbed, bids him to return to the Northern village they fled years ago, when an evil sorcerer named Grunwald devas...                    column          8 comments       Pile of Shame - Ai City   2014 Feb 19, 01:00 8 comments                 anime    A sleeper sci-fi film from Koichi Mashimo that might break your brain, but will definitely dazzle your eyes while doing so. ―  Ai City In the opening scenes of Ai City, we are dropped into the middle of a car chase in what is possibly New York City. In the back seat is a former cop, who was fired and is now a private investigator. He doesn't know why he's there, and neither do we. In the front seat a...                    column          14 comments       Pile of Shame - Natsuki Crisis   2014 Feb  5, 01:00 14 comments                 anime    A fun two-part girls-fighting-in-high-school OAV that doesn't take itself too seriously... until it does. ―  Natsuki Crisis When we first meet Kitsumi Natsuki, she's in her school dojo, gleefully trying to find a sparring partner. The rest of the team is all guys, but they don't stand a chance against the tomboy, and politely bow out. In addition to being fearfullly strong, Natsuki is also the protog...                    column          13 comments       Pile of Shame - Seven Cities Story   2014 Jan 22, 01:00 13 comments                 anime    A two-part OAV that tries to transplant Legend of Galactic Heroes onto a sideways-rotated Earth, and succeeds only in being dull and confusing. ―  Seven Cities Story One day, with no warning, the Earth's polar axis shifts 90 degrees, shaking up human civilization like an Etch-A-Sketch and killing everybody. Luckily by this time, humanity had a pretty decent settlement going on the moon, and once thin...                    column          23 comments       Pile of Shame - After School Tinker Bell   2014 Jan  8, 01:00 23 comments                 anime    This week, an OAV based on a light novel series about a romantic couple that solves mysteries around their school. ―  After School Tinker Bell In the last few years there have been a ton of anime adapted from light novels: those small, pulpy, simply written and easy-to-read populist books that lie somewhere between young adult novels and manga. But light novels have been around for a very long time, ...                    column          12 comments       Pile of Shame - Handsome Girl   2013 Dec 25, 01:00 12 comments                 anime    Justin revisits an old one-shot OAV by the creator of Marmalade Boy... and is a little underwhelmed. ―  Handsome Girl When I was in high school, I loved the show Marmalade Boy. A lot. In fact, I wrote an article about it! A perfectly addictive confectionary of chaste teenaged yearning and romance, and undiluted raw crippling angst, I lost many an evening to the adventures of the lovelorn protagonists...                    column          11 comments       Pile of Shame - The Sensualist   2013 Dec 11, 02:10 11 comments                 anime    This week, a unique erotic historical fiction film that has completely slipped through the cracks. ―  The Sensualist (A.K.A. The Life of an Amorous Man) I first saw The Sensualist as a fuzzy VHS tape when I was a teenager. While it's ostensibly an adult work, it never seemed lurid or arousing to me. Rather, it held this strange transcendent beauty. It felt like a piece of another person's life, so fo...                    column          16 comments       Pile of Shame - Emblem Take 2   2013 Nov 27, 02:02 16 comments                 anime    This week, a rare yakuza time travel comedy. Perhaps the ONLY yakuza time travel comedy. ―  Emblem Take 2 Yakuza aren't a pleasant topic. Japan's fully-entrenched organized crime families and organizations, and their connections with everything from banking to entertainment to politics show us Japan at its most corrupt and embarrassing. Unless you go looking for trouble in Tokyo, it's unlikely that a...                    column          17 comments       Pile of Shame: Ai Monogatari: 9 Love Stories   2013 Nov 13, 01:13 17 comments                 anime    Trying to watch this OAV like biting into a large wad of wet cotton: it's not offensive or unpleasant, but you want to end the experience as fast as humanly possible. ―  Ai Monogatari: 9 Love Stories If there's anything that anime lacks, it's real, adult love stories. We have enough yearning, angsty teen romance to sink a battleship, but realistic love stories about people whose frontal lobes are fir...                    column          23 comments       Pile of Shame - Wanna-Be's   2013 Oct 30, 00:01 23 comments     Did anyone say ""I want more women's wrestling anime?"" .... No? Didn't think so. ―  Wanna-Be's Lately there's been a lot of chatter about the girls' wrestling TV series, Wanna Be The Strongest In The World. Given that virtually none of the chatter is positive, I'm not really making plans to check out the show for myself. But hearing about a mediocre girls' wresting anime did jog my memory about anothe...                    column          5 comments       Pile of Shame - Grandeek: The Alternative   2013 Sep 18, 00:56 5 comments                 anime    An early digipaint OAV that has a lot of potential, but is so awkwardly made that the storytelling really suffers. ―  Grandeek: The Alternative When visiting Japan, one of my favorite things to do is explore the DVD sections of every Book Off location I can find. Usually I can identify and easily dismiss pretty much everything on the shelf, but every once in a while I happen upon something that I hav...                    column          17 comments       Pile of Shame - Butt Attack Punisher Girl Gautaman   2013 Sep  4, 00:00 17 comments                 anime                manga    It could've been offensive, bawdy, witty and hilarious.

I mean that honestly. There was a time not long ago, even in otaku circles, when the idea of incest was odd and outré enough to elicit giggles from the less mature parts of ourselves, and maybe even an ""oh god.""

I mean that honestly.

New Single 'Changes' From Japanese Srtist Vicke Blanka Features in Sequel to Hit French Movie 'The Shiny Shrimps'   Apr 14th 2022         Worldwide single release accompanied by beautiful music video themed on change  Vicke Blanka's new single ‘Changes’ was released globally today, Wednesday, April 13.  Download and streaming links:  https://vickeblanka.lnk.to/Changes  ‘Changes’ is the ending song to ‘La Revanche des Crevettes Pailletées’ (‘Revenge of The Shiny Shrimps’), the sequel to hit French movie ‘The Shiny Shrimps’. The new film was released in France today, and the ending song will also be included when the film is released globally. ‘Changes’ was written especially for the movie; Vicke Blanka delivers lyrics with a message about embracing change, singing a characteristic melody line in his beautiful falsetto voice. In the cover photo, Vicke Blanka has cut his trademark shoulder-length hair short as he touchingly sheds a tear.  Vicke Blanka said of the new single, “It's a song about change. I wrote the lyrics while reflecting on how all of us want to change, how I want to change, how some things need to change, and how some things need to be changed. I'm honored to be involved in such an important movie.”  During the production process, Vicke Blanka exchanged emails in English with the film's French directors, Cédric Le Gallo and Maxime Govare, to discuss the details.  Of the directors, Vicke Blanka said, “I feel grateful for their clear opinions. The communication went very smoothly – which is probably to be expected, because all of us wanted to make the film as good as it could possibly be.”  The directors also praised Vicke Blanka. “Vicke Blanka always put the needs of the film first, and he truly understood the emotions the film required,” said Le Gallo. Govare added, “Following our communication with Vicke Blanka, he provided the perfect song to close the film's two hours of intense emotion. The song will find many dedicated fans in France!”  On the same day, the music video for ‘Changes’ was also released.  Vicke Blanka – ‘Changes’ music video:  https://youtu.be/AvLPpmQkCSs  As indicated by the word “changes”, the video features magnificent and beautiful imagery that expresses how a change can provide the catalyst to resolve a situation that had previously held us back.  Not only does this release act as a bridge between France and Japan, but it also marks a moment of “change” in the career of Vicke Blanka, whose work through music and now film will continue to send a message of encouragement to listeners all over the world.  ‘La Revanche des Crevettes Pailletées’ is the sequel to ‘The Shiny Shrimps’, which was released in March 2019 and was a No.1 hit in France, as recorded by IMDb's Box Office Mojo. The series depicts the real-world gay water polo team from France, the Shiny Shrimps. The sequel will be released in Japan on Friday, October 28, 2022.  The new film follows the uniquely quirky members of the Shiny Shrimps as they travel to Japan to participate in the latest edition of the Gay Games, the world's largest LGBTQ+ sports and culture festival. It is an exciting road movie filled with hilarity and drama.  In addition, Vicke Blanka will hold a national tour in Japan, titled THE TOUR ‘Vicke Blanka’. It will be the artist's largest tour to date, taking in seven cities around Japan from August 27 through October 30. It will be exciting to witness the stage performance of Vicke Blanka as he celebrates the fifth anniversary of his major-label debut.  * Film poster copyright credit:  © 2022 LES IMPRODUCTIBLES - KALY PRODUCTIONS - FLAG - MIRAI PICTURES - LE GALLO FILMS  ★ Release information  ● Vicke Blanka – ‘Changes’  Digital release date: April 13, 2022   Download and streaming links: https://vickeblanka.lnk.to/Changes  Ending song to the motion picture ‘La Revanche des Crevettes Pailletées’  ● ‘La Revanche des Crevettes Pailletées’  Release date: April 13, 2022 in France (October 28, 2022 in Japan)  Directors: Cédric Le Gallo, Maxime Govare  Cast: Nicolas Gob, Alban Lenoir, Michaël Abiteboul, David Baïot, Romain Lancry, Roland Menou, Geoffrey Couët, Romain Brau, Félix Martinez, Briana Gigante  Ending song: Vicke Blanka – ‘Changes’  Film Distribution in Japan : flag Co., Ltd.

New Single 'Changes' From Japanese Srtist Vicke Blanka Features in Sequel to Hit French Movie 'The Shiny Shrimps'   Apr 14th 2022         Worldwide single release accompanied by beautiful music video themed on change  Vicke Blanka's new single ‘Changes’ was released globally today, Wednesday, April 13.  Download and streaming links:  https://vickeblanka.lnk.to/Changes  ‘Changes’ is the ending song to ‘La Revanche des Crevettes Pailletées’ (‘Revenge of The Shiny Shrimps’), the sequel to hit French movie ‘The Shiny Shrimps’. The new film was released in France today, and the ending song will also be included when the film is released globally. ‘Changes’ was written especially for the movie; Vicke Blanka delivers lyrics with a message about embracing change, singing a characteristic melody line in his beautiful falsetto voice. In the cover photo, Vicke Blanka has cut his trademark shoulder-length hair short as he touchingly sheds a tear.  Vicke Blanka said of the new single, “It's a song about change. I wrote the lyrics while reflecting on how all of us want to change, how I want to change, how some things need to change, and how some things need to be changed. I'm honored to be involved in such an important movie.”  During the production process, Vicke Blanka exchanged emails in English with the film's French directors, Cédric Le Gallo and Maxime Govare, to discuss the details.  Of the directors, Vicke Blanka said, “I feel grateful for their clear opinions. The communication went very smoothly – which is probably to be expected, because all of us wanted to make the film as good as it could possibly be.”  The directors also praised Vicke Blanka. “Vicke Blanka always put the needs of the film first, and he truly understood the emotions the film required,” said Le Gallo. Govare added, “Following our communication with Vicke Blanka, he provided the perfect song to close the film's two hours of intense emotion. The song will find many dedicated fans in France!”  On the same day, the music video for ‘Changes’ was also released.  Vicke Blanka – ‘Changes’ music video:  https://youtu.be/AvLPpmQkCSs  As indicated by the word “changes”, the video features magnificent and beautiful imagery that expresses how a change can provide the catalyst to resolve a situation that had previously held us back.  Not only does this release act as a bridge between France and Japan, but it also marks a moment of “change” in the career of Vicke Blanka, whose work through music and now film will continue to send a message of encouragement to listeners all over the world.  ‘La Revanche des Crevettes Pailletées’ is the sequel to ‘The Shiny Shrimps’, which was released in March 2019 and was a No.1 hit in France, as recorded by IMDb's Box Office Mojo. The series depicts the real-world gay water polo team from France, the Shiny Shrimps. The sequel will be released in Japan on Friday, October 28, 2022.  The new film follows the uniquely quirky members of the Shiny Shrimps as they travel to Japan to participate in the latest edition of the Gay Games, the world's largest LGBTQ+ sports and culture festival. It is an exciting road movie filled with hilarity and drama.  In addition, Vicke Blanka will hold a national tour in Japan, titled THE TOUR ‘Vicke Blanka’. It will be the artist's largest tour to date, taking in seven cities around Japan from August 27 through October 30. It will be exciting to witness the stage performance of Vicke Blanka as he celebrates the fifth anniversary of his major-label debut.  * Film poster copyright credit:  © 2022 LES IMPRODUCTIBLES - KALY PRODUCTIONS - FLAG - MIRAI PICTURES - LE GALLO FILMS  ★ Release information  ● Vicke Blanka – ‘Changes’  Digital release date: April 13, 2022   Download and streaming links: https://vickeblanka.lnk.to/Changes  Ending song to the motion picture ‘La Revanche des Crevettes Pailletées’  ● ‘La Revanche des Crevettes Pailletées’  Release date: April 13, 2022 in France (October 28, 2022 in Japan)  Directors: Cédric Le Gallo, Maxime Govare  Cast: Nicolas Gob, Alban Lenoir, Michaël Abiteboul, David Baïot, Romain Lancry, Roland Menou, Geoffrey Couët, Romain Brau, Félix Martinez, Briana Gigante  Ending song: Vicke Blanka – ‘Changes’  Film Distribution in Japan : flag Co., Ltd.

New Single 'Changes' From Japanese Srtist Vicke Blanka Features in Sequel to Hit French Movie 'The Shiny Shrimps'   Apr 14th 2022         Worldwide single release accompanied by beautiful music video themed on change  Vicke Blanka's new single ‘Changes’ was released globally today, Wednesday, April 13.  Download and streaming links:  https://vickeblanka.lnk.to/Changes  ‘Changes’ is the ending song to ‘La Revanche des Crevettes Pailletées’ (‘Revenge of The Shiny Shrimps’), the sequel to hit French movie ‘The Shiny Shrimps’. The new film was released in France today, and the ending song will also be included when the film is released globally. ‘Changes’ was written especially for the movie; Vicke Blanka delivers lyrics with a message about embracing change, singing a characteristic melody line in his beautiful falsetto voice. In the cover photo, Vicke Blanka has cut his trademark shoulder-length hair short as he touchingly sheds a tear.  Vicke Blanka said of the new single, “It's a song about change. I wrote the lyrics while reflecting on how all of us want to change, how I want to change, how some things need to change, and how some things need to be changed. I'm honored to be involved in such an important movie.”  During the production process, Vicke Blanka exchanged emails in English with the film's French directors, Cédric Le Gallo and Maxime Govare, to discuss the details.  Of the directors, Vicke Blanka said, “I feel grateful for their clear opinions. The communication went very smoothly – which is probably to be expected, because all of us wanted to make the film as good as it could possibly be.”  The directors also praised Vicke Blanka. “Vicke Blanka always put the needs of the film first, and he truly understood the emotions the film required,” said Le Gallo. Govare added, “Following our communication with Vicke Blanka, he provided the perfect song to close the film's two hours of intense emotion. The song will find many dedicated fans in France!”  On the same day, the music video for ‘Changes’ was also released.  Vicke Blanka – ‘Changes’ music video:  https://youtu.be/AvLPpmQkCSs  As indicated by the word “changes”, the video features magnificent and beautiful imagery that expresses how a change can provide the catalyst to resolve a situation that had previously held us back.  Not only does this release act as a bridge between France and Japan, but it also marks a moment of “change” in the career of Vicke Blanka, whose work through music and now film will continue to send a message of encouragement to listeners all over the world.  ‘La Revanche des Crevettes Pailletées’ is the sequel to ‘The Shiny Shrimps’, which was released in March 2019 and was a No.1 hit in France, as recorded by IMDb's Box Office Mojo.

News Crunchyroll Streams Aharen-san wa Hakarenai Romantic Comedy Anime's English Dub on April 15   posted on 2022-04-15 01:19 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo          Ben Balmaceda, Dani Chambers star    Crunchyroll will begin streaming an English dub for the television anime of  Asato Mizu's Aharen-san wa Hakarenai (Aharen Is Indecipherable) romantic comedy manga series on Friday at 4:00 p.m. EDT.    The English cast includes:    Ben Balmaceda as Raido   Dani Chambers as Aharen   Kristen McGuire as Ooshiro   Jalitza Delgado as Raido's Sister   Tia Ballard as Miyahira    Emily Fajardo is directing the English dub. Jamal Roberson is the lead ADR engineer, and Xavier Earl and Noah Whitehead are the assistant engineers. Madeleine Morris is writing the script with Bonny Clinkenbeard as supervisor. Brandon Peters is in charge of ADR prep.    The anime premiered in the Animeism block on April 1. Crunchyroll is streaming the anime as it airs in Japan.    The teen romantic comedy follows the ""indecipherable"" daily life of short, quiet Reina Aharen and Raidō who sits next to her in class. Aharen is not so good at gauging the distance between people (or personal boundaries), and Raidō initially sensed some distance between the two of them. Then one day, when Raidō picked up the eraser that Aharen had dropped, the distance between them suddenly became uncomfortably close.    From ""way too distant"" to ""way too close"" ... Aharen is simply unpredictable.      Yasutaka Yamamoto (Servant × Service, Valkyria Chronicles) is serving as chief director, and Tomoe Makino (Woodpecker Detective's Office) is directing the anime at Felix Film. Takao Yoshioka (High School DxD, I'm Standing on 1,000,000 Lives., Sekirei, WATAMOTE) is in charge of the series scripts, and is also writing them with Ayumu Hisao and Kotsukotsu. Yūko Yahiro (Diabolik Lovers, Kaguya-sama: Love is War, Katana Maidens: Toji no Miko) is designing the characters.    Yahiro, Tomoko Iwasa, Chie Mishima, and Yūki Fukuchi are serving as the chief animation directors. Satoru Kousaki (BEASTARS, Lucky Star, Oreimo) and monaca (My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU, Servant × Service, Wagnaria!!) are composing the music. The Chinese streaming service bilibili is presenting the project.      The unit TrySail performs the opening theme song ""Hanarenai Kyori"" (Inseparable Distance), while the unit HaKoniwalily performs the ending theme song ""Kyori-Kan"" (A Sense of Distance).    Mizu launched the manga on Shonen Jump+ in January 2017, and Shueisha published the 13th compiled book volume on April 4.

News Crunchyroll Streams Aharen-san wa Hakarenai Romantic Comedy Anime's English Dub on April 15   posted on 2022-04-15 01:19 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo          Ben Balmaceda, Dani Chambers star    Crunchyroll will begin streaming an English dub for the television anime of  Asato Mizu's Aharen-san wa Hakarenai (Aharen Is Indecipherable) romantic comedy manga series on Friday at 4:00 p.m. EDT.    The English cast includes:    Ben Balmaceda as Raido   Dani Chambers as Aharen   Kristen McGuire as Ooshiro   Jalitza Delgado as Raido's Sister   Tia Ballard as Miyahira    Emily Fajardo is directing the English dub. Jamal Roberson is the lead ADR engineer, and Xavier Earl and Noah Whitehead are the assistant engineers. Madeleine Morris is writing the script with Bonny Clinkenbeard as supervisor. Brandon Peters is in charge of ADR prep.    The anime premiered in the Animeism block on April 1. Crunchyroll is streaming the anime as it airs in Japan.    The teen romantic comedy follows the ""indecipherable"" daily life of short, quiet Reina Aharen and Raidō who sits next to her in class. Aharen is not so good at gauging the distance between people (or personal boundaries), and Raidō initially sensed some distance between the two of them. Then one day, when Raidō picked up the eraser that Aharen had dropped, the distance between them suddenly became uncomfortably close.    From ""way too distant"" to ""way too close"" ... Aharen is simply unpredictable.      Yasutaka Yamamoto (Servant × Service, Valkyria Chronicles) is serving as chief director, and Tomoe Makino (Woodpecker Detective's Office) is directing the anime at Felix Film. Takao Yoshioka (High School DxD, I'm Standing on 1,000,000 Lives., Sekirei, WATAMOTE) is in charge of the series scripts, and is also writing them with Ayumu Hisao and Kotsukotsu. Yūko Yahiro (Diabolik Lovers, Kaguya-sama: Love is War, Katana Maidens: Toji no Miko) is designing the characters.    Yahiro, Tomoko Iwasa, Chie Mishima, and Yūki Fukuchi are serving as the chief animation directors. Satoru Kousaki (BEASTARS, Lucky Star, Oreimo) and monaca (My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU, Servant × Service, Wagnaria!!) are composing the music. The Chinese streaming service bilibili is presenting the project.      The unit TrySail performs the opening theme song ""Hanarenai Kyori"" (Inseparable Distance), while the unit HaKoniwalily performs the ending theme song ""Kyori-Kan"" (A Sense of Distance).    Mizu launched the manga on Shonen Jump+ in January 2017, and Shueisha published the 13th compiled book volume on April 4.

News Crunchyroll Streams Aharen-san wa Hakarenai Romantic Comedy Anime's English Dub on April 15   posted on 2022-04-15 01:19 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo          Ben Balmaceda, Dani Chambers star    Crunchyroll will begin streaming an English dub for the television anime of  Asato Mizu's Aharen-san wa Hakarenai (Aharen Is Indecipherable) romantic comedy manga series on Friday at 4:00 p.m. EDT.    The English cast includes:    Ben Balmaceda as Raido   Dani Chambers as Aharen   Kristen McGuire as Ooshiro   Jalitza Delgado as Raido's Sister   Tia Ballard as Miyahira    Emily Fajardo is directing the English dub. Jamal Roberson is the lead ADR engineer, and Xavier Earl and Noah Whitehead are the assistant engineers. Madeleine Morris is writing the script with Bonny Clinkenbeard as supervisor. Brandon Peters is in charge of ADR prep.    The anime premiered in the Animeism block on April 1. Crunchyroll is streaming the anime as it airs in Japan.    The teen romantic comedy follows the ""indecipherable"" daily life of short, quiet Reina Aharen and Raidō who sits next to her in class. Aharen is not so good at gauging the distance between people (or personal boundaries), and Raidō initially sensed some distance between the two of them. Then one day, when Raidō picked up the eraser that Aharen had dropped, the distance between them suddenly became uncomfortably close.    From ""way too distant"" to ""way too close"" ... Aharen is simply unpredictable.      Yasutaka Yamamoto (Servant × Service, Valkyria Chronicles) is serving as chief director, and Tomoe Makino (Woodpecker Detective's Office) is directing the anime at Felix Film. Takao Yoshioka (High School DxD, I'm Standing on 1,000,000 Lives., Sekirei, WATAMOTE) is in charge of the series scripts, and is also writing them with Ayumu Hisao and Kotsukotsu. Yūko Yahiro (Diabolik Lovers, Kaguya-sama: Love is War, Katana Maidens: Toji no Miko) is designing the characters.    Yahiro, Tomoko Iwasa, Chie Mishima, and Yūki Fukuchi are serving as the chief animation directors. Satoru Kousaki (BEASTARS, Lucky Star, Oreimo) and monaca (My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU, Servant × Service, Wagnaria!!) are composing the music. The Chinese streaming service bilibili is presenting the project.      The unit TrySail performs the opening theme song ""Hanarenai Kyori"" (Inseparable Distance), while the unit HaKoniwalily performs the ending theme song ""Kyori-Kan"" (A Sense of Distance).    Mizu launched the manga on Shonen Jump+ in January 2017, and Shueisha published the 13th compiled book volume on April 4.

News Crunchyroll Streams Aharen-san wa Hakarenai Romantic Comedy Anime's English Dub on April 15   posted on 2022-04-15 01:19 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo          Ben Balmaceda, Dani Chambers star    Crunchyroll will begin streaming an English dub for the television anime of  Asato Mizu's Aharen-san wa Hakarenai (Aharen Is Indecipherable) romantic comedy manga series on Friday at 4:00 p.m. EDT.    The English cast includes:    Ben Balmaceda as Raido   Dani Chambers as Aharen   Kristen McGuire as Ooshiro   Jalitza Delgado as Raido's Sister   Tia Ballard as Miyahira    Emily Fajardo is directing the English dub. Jamal Roberson is the lead ADR engineer, and Xavier Earl and Noah Whitehead are the assistant engineers. Madeleine Morris is writing the script with Bonny Clinkenbeard as supervisor. Brandon Peters is in charge of ADR prep.    The anime premiered in the Animeism block on April 1. Crunchyroll is streaming the anime as it airs in Japan.    The teen romantic comedy follows the ""indecipherable"" daily life of short, quiet Reina Aharen and Raidō who sits next to her in class. Aharen is not so good at gauging the distance between people (or personal boundaries), and Raidō initially sensed some distance between the two of them. Then one day, when Raidō picked up the eraser that Aharen had dropped, the distance between them suddenly became uncomfortably close.    From ""way too distant"" to ""way too close"" ... Aharen is simply unpredictable.      Yasutaka Yamamoto (Servant × Service, Valkyria Chronicles) is serving as chief director, and Tomoe Makino (Woodpecker Detective's Office) is directing the anime at Felix Film. Takao Yoshioka (High School DxD, I'm Standing on 1,000,000 Lives., Sekirei, WATAMOTE) is in charge of the series scripts, and is also writing them with Ayumu Hisao and Kotsukotsu. Yūko Yahiro (Diabolik Lovers, Kaguya-sama: Love is War, Katana Maidens: Toji no Miko) is designing the characters.    Yahiro, Tomoko Iwasa, Chie Mishima, and Yūki Fukuchi are serving as the chief animation directors. Satoru Kousaki (BEASTARS, Lucky Star, Oreimo) and monaca (My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU, Servant × Service, Wagnaria!!) are composing the music. The Chinese streaming service bilibili is presenting the project.      The unit TrySail performs the opening theme song ""Hanarenai Kyori"" (Inseparable Distance), while the unit HaKoniwalily performs the ending theme song ""Kyori-Kan"" (A Sense of Distance).

The English cast includes:    Ben Balmaceda as Raido   Dani Chambers as Aharen   Kristen McGuire as Ooshiro   Jalitza Delgado as Raido's Sister   Tia Ballard as Miyahira    Emily Fajardo is directing the English dub. Jamal Roberson is the lead ADR engineer, and Xavier Earl and Noah Whitehead are the assistant engineers. Madeleine Morris is writing the script with Bonny Clinkenbeard as supervisor. Brandon Peters is in charge of ADR prep.    The anime premiered in the Animeism block on April 1. Crunchyroll is streaming the anime as it airs in Japan.    The teen romantic comedy follows the ""indecipherable"" daily life of short, quiet Reina Aharen and Raidō who sits next to her in class. Aharen is not so good at gauging the distance between people (or personal boundaries), and Raidō initially sensed some distance between the two of them. Then one day, when Raidō picked up the eraser that Aharen had dropped, the distance between them suddenly became uncomfortably close.    From ""way too distant"" to ""way too close"" ... Aharen is simply unpredictable.      Yasutaka Yamamoto (Servant × Service, Valkyria Chronicles) is serving as chief director, and Tomoe Makino (Woodpecker Detective's Office) is directing the anime at Felix Film. Takao Yoshioka (High School DxD, I'm Standing on 1,000,000 Lives., Sekirei, WATAMOTE) is in charge of the series scripts, and is also writing them with Ayumu Hisao and Kotsukotsu. Yūko Yahiro (Diabolik Lovers, Kaguya-sama: Love is War, Katana Maidens: Toji no Miko) is designing the characters.    Yahiro, Tomoko Iwasa, Chie Mishima, and Yūki Fukuchi are serving as the chief animation directors. Satoru Kousaki (BEASTARS, Lucky Star, Oreimo) and monaca (My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU, Servant × Service, Wagnaria!!) are composing the music. The Chinese streaming service bilibili is presenting the project.

Review   by Rebecca Silverman, Mar 30th 2022       Lightning and Romance GN 1-2                     Synopsis:             Sumire is less than thrilled when, at the start of her second year in high school, she finds herself in a class with the resident bad “boy,” Reo. Reo's actually in his early twenties, and while no one can figure out why he's attending high school, the rumors about him are definitely not flattering. But as Sumire gets to know him, she finds out that there's a lot more to Reo than the unsavory rumors suggest. But does her romance stand a chance when he's determined to keep her out of his life?      Review:         Synopsis:        Sumire is less than thrilled when, at the start of her second year in high school, she finds herself in a class with the resident bad “boy,” Reo. Reo's actually in his early twenties, and while no one can figure out why he's attending high school, the rumors about him are definitely not flattering. But as Sumire gets to know him, she finds out that there's a lot more to Reo than the unsavory rumors suggest. But does her romance stand a chance when he's determined to keep her out of his life?     Review:            If you've been reading Rin Mikimoto's previously translated works, you may have figured out that she has a thing for the age-gap romance – all of her other translated works but Kira-kun Today fall under that heading. This time she's trying something new in the field: rather than having her heroine fall in love with a teacher (Love's Reach) or a famous, slightly older celebrity (Kiss Me at the Stroke of Midnight), the older man Sumire falls for is in her high school class, and unlike titles like A Girl and Her Guard Dog, he appears to be there strictly to learn.    There's absolutely nothing wrong with going back at a nontraditional age to finish your education, so although it's odd, it's not bad that 20-year-old Reo is sitting in a second-year high school classroom even if in real life we more often see this play out at the university level. While people are confused about Reo's presence, no one really makes any disparaging remarks about it, possibly because they're all three-quarters convinced that he's some sort of evil yakuza delinquent, a belief that the lightning bolt-shaped scar on his cheek only reinforces. Reo doesn't necessarily seem to mind that his classmates are largely afraid of him, possibly because he's very much aware that he's an adult in a room full of children, and while we don't get any real answers about why he's completing high school now, the very fact that he is doing so seems to be more important, and that, if we extrapolate from volume two, it's borne out of a desire to make up for some misspent youth.    That he also is much more fervent in his attempts to fend Sumire off than some of Mikimoto's other heroes is a bit of a saving grace as well. He knows that this is maybe not an awesome relationship to be embarking on. He does his level best to drive Sumire away, putting on a very good show in volume one of being disinterested, one which begins to crumble a bit in volume two. This is at least in part because Sumire comes from the Chutzpah School of Romance Heroines, and she's not about to let him dictate her feelings – especially not when he's kind of bad at hiding that he may like her, too (which begins to creep out in the first book and becomes solidified in the second). Despite the reciprocal nature of their feelings, however, he remains unrelenting in his commitment to not date Sumire. While we can all make a good guess that this really isn't going to last, the “we can't” approach is a nice change from the “no, really, I swear I don't like you” tactic that I feel like we see more of in the genre. That he seems to have some very good reasons beyond simply being older than her is an intriguing bit of story-building, and while it may turn out to be reasons that only Reo thinks are important, just being able to stick to his guns around the very open Sumire does a nice job of illustrating to the reader that he really is an adult to her teenager.    That Reo's family is somehow involved in all of this feels like a given by the end of volume two. We know from the outset of the series that he has a tenuous relationship with them, but the fancy party that Sumire's author father drags her to as his plus-one (he's a single dad and appears to be mostly devoted to his daughter) reveals that there may be more than run-of-the-mill estrangement going on. One of the best scenes in the these volumes comes from volume two, when Sumire stands up to Reo's grandfather for him; she doesn't have a full grasp of what's going on, but she can tell from the impressively tense undercurrent to their conversation that he's pressuring Reo to do things he's not comfortable with, and since she doesn't have a horse in their race (so to speak), she's in a better position to speak up. It also emphasizes how much younger she is emotionally than Reo; she lacks a grasp of the social nuances of the situation, or at least is young enough that she doesn't care about them. It may be only a few years, but the scene really does emphasize how big a difference there can be between your late teens and early twenties in terms of understanding – and that Sumire's actions feel like the right ones may say something about the social pressures Reo has learned to cave to.    Naturally around this time in volume two we learn that he and Sumire knew each other in the past, and that she's inadvertently behind his switch from his bad-boy ways to where he is now. Reo refuses to say more than that, hedging that it was a small nothing to Sumire that meant the world to him, and that's intriguing, but it needs development if it is to be a mitigating factor in their budding romance's inappropriateness. There's also a bit of an insta-love feel to Sumire falling for him, made more prominent by the fact that she's more than ready for romance, as we see from her conversations with her best friend Rio. That does make him feel a bit more like ""convenient love"" than ""true love,"" although his attachment to her from the past does indicate that such will not always be the case. It's a contrived situation all around, but there's still enough here to make this worth following, especially if you've enjoyed Mikimoto's work before, and her ugly-cute art style with its chibis looks much better here than in previous series. (Although we won't talk about some of the questionable outfits that appear in the party chapters.) It's an age-gap romance with a different hook, and by volume two, that hook is baited well enough that it'll be hard to resist volume three.             Grade:      Overall : B Story : B+ Art : B-  + Reo's reservations about Sumire balance out her insta-love, volume two is stronger overall. New character in volume two is fun. − Romance feels pretty abrupt, art isn't great at perspective. Very contrived starting plot.            discuss this in the forum |        bookmark/share with:                  				Add this manga to 				               Production Info:        Story & Art: Rin Mikimoto   Full encyclopedia details aboutLightning and Romance (manga)        Review homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          3 comments       Jujutsu Kaisen Stage Play's Video Introduces Cast in Costume   Apr 15, 07:02 3 comments                 live-action    Ryūji Satō, Ryosuke Miura star in July-August play ― A press conference for the stage play of Gege Akutami's Jujutsu Kaisen manga introduced the production's promotional video, main cast, and other details on Wednesday.

Reo's actually in his early twenties, and while no one can figure out why he's attending high school, the rumors about him are definitely not flattering. But as Sumire gets to know him, she finds out that there's a lot more to Reo than the unsavory rumors suggest. But does her romance stand a chance when he's determined to keep her out of his life?      Review:         Synopsis:        Sumire is less than thrilled when, at the start of her second year in high school, she finds herself in a class with the resident bad “boy,” Reo. Reo's actually in his early twenties, and while no one can figure out why he's attending high school, the rumors about him are definitely not flattering. But as Sumire gets to know him, she finds out that there's a lot more to Reo than the unsavory rumors suggest. But does her romance stand a chance when he's determined to keep her out of his life?     Review:            If you've been reading Rin Mikimoto's previously translated works, you may have figured out that she has a thing for the age-gap romance – all of her other translated works but Kira-kun Today fall under that heading. This time she's trying something new in the field: rather than having her heroine fall in love with a teacher (Love's Reach) or a famous, slightly older celebrity (Kiss Me at the Stroke of Midnight), the older man Sumire falls for is in her high school class, and unlike titles like A Girl and Her Guard Dog, he appears to be there strictly to learn.    There's absolutely nothing wrong with going back at a nontraditional age to finish your education, so although it's odd, it's not bad that 20-year-old Reo is sitting in a second-year high school classroom even if in real life we more often see this play out at the university level. While people are confused about Reo's presence, no one really makes any disparaging remarks about it, possibly because they're all three-quarters convinced that he's some sort of evil yakuza delinquent, a belief that the lightning bolt-shaped scar on his cheek only reinforces. Reo doesn't necessarily seem to mind that his classmates are largely afraid of him, possibly because he's very much aware that he's an adult in a room full of children, and while we don't get any real answers about why he's completing high school now, the very fact that he is doing so seems to be more important, and that, if we extrapolate from volume two, it's borne out of a desire to make up for some misspent youth.    That he also is much more fervent in his attempts to fend Sumire off than some of Mikimoto's other heroes is a bit of a saving grace as well. He knows that this is maybe not an awesome relationship to be embarking on. He does his level best to drive Sumire away, putting on a very good show in volume one of being disinterested, one which begins to crumble a bit in volume two. This is at least in part because Sumire comes from the Chutzpah School of Romance Heroines, and she's not about to let him dictate her feelings – especially not when he's kind of bad at hiding that he may like her, too (which begins to creep out in the first book and becomes solidified in the second). Despite the reciprocal nature of their feelings, however, he remains unrelenting in his commitment to not date Sumire. While we can all make a good guess that this really isn't going to last, the “we can't” approach is a nice change from the “no, really, I swear I don't like you” tactic that I feel like we see more of in the genre. That he seems to have some very good reasons beyond simply being older than her is an intriguing bit of story-building, and while it may turn out to be reasons that only Reo thinks are important, just being able to stick to his guns around the very open Sumire does a nice job of illustrating to the reader that he really is an adult to her teenager.    That Reo's family is somehow involved in all of this feels like a given by the end of volume two. We know from the outset of the series that he has a tenuous relationship with them, but the fancy party that Sumire's author father drags her to as his plus-one (he's a single dad and appears to be mostly devoted to his daughter) reveals that there may be more than run-of-the-mill estrangement going on. One of the best scenes in the these volumes comes from volume two, when Sumire stands up to Reo's grandfather for him; she doesn't have a full grasp of what's going on, but she can tell from the impressively tense undercurrent to their conversation that he's pressuring Reo to do things he's not comfortable with, and since she doesn't have a horse in their race (so to speak), she's in a better position to speak up. It also emphasizes how much younger she is emotionally than Reo; she lacks a grasp of the social nuances of the situation, or at least is young enough that she doesn't care about them. It may be only a few years, but the scene really does emphasize how big a difference there can be between your late teens and early twenties in terms of understanding – and that Sumire's actions feel like the right ones may say something about the social pressures Reo has learned to cave to.    Naturally around this time in volume two we learn that he and Sumire knew each other in the past, and that she's inadvertently behind his switch from his bad-boy ways to where he is now. Reo refuses to say more than that, hedging that it was a small nothing to Sumire that meant the world to him, and that's intriguing, but it needs development if it is to be a mitigating factor in their budding romance's inappropriateness. There's also a bit of an insta-love feel to Sumire falling for him, made more prominent by the fact that she's more than ready for romance, as we see from her conversations with her best friend Rio. That does make him feel a bit more like ""convenient love"" than ""true love,"" although his attachment to her from the past does indicate that such will not always be the case. It's a contrived situation all around, but there's still enough here to make this worth following, especially if you've enjoyed Mikimoto's work before, and her ugly-cute art style with its chibis looks much better here than in previous series. (Although we won't talk about some of the questionable outfits that appear in the party chapters.) It's an age-gap romance with a different hook, and by volume two, that hook is baited well enough that it'll be hard to resist volume three.             Grade:      Overall : B Story : B+ Art : B-  + Reo's reservations about Sumire balance out her insta-love, volume two is stronger overall. New character in volume two is fun. − Romance feels pretty abrupt, art isn't great at perspective.

Review   by Rebecca Silverman, Mar 30th 2022       Lightning and Romance GN 1-2                     Synopsis:             Sumire is less than thrilled when, at the start of her second year in high school, she finds herself in a class with the resident bad “boy,” Reo. Reo's actually in his early twenties, and while no one can figure out why he's attending high school, the rumors about him are definitely not flattering. But as Sumire gets to know him, she finds out that there's a lot more to Reo than the unsavory rumors suggest. But does her romance stand a chance when he's determined to keep her out of his life?      Review:         Synopsis:        Sumire is less than thrilled when, at the start of her second year in high school, she finds herself in a class with the resident bad “boy,” Reo. Reo's actually in his early twenties, and while no one can figure out why he's attending high school, the rumors about him are definitely not flattering. But as Sumire gets to know him, she finds out that there's a lot more to Reo than the unsavory rumors suggest. But does her romance stand a chance when he's determined to keep her out of his life?     Review:            If you've been reading Rin Mikimoto's previously translated works, you may have figured out that she has a thing for the age-gap romance – all of her other translated works but Kira-kun Today fall under that heading. This time she's trying something new in the field: rather than having her heroine fall in love with a teacher (Love's Reach) or a famous, slightly older celebrity (Kiss Me at the Stroke of Midnight), the older man Sumire falls for is in her high school class, and unlike titles like A Girl and Her Guard Dog, he appears to be there strictly to learn.    There's absolutely nothing wrong with going back at a nontraditional age to finish your education, so although it's odd, it's not bad that 20-year-old Reo is sitting in a second-year high school classroom even if in real life we more often see this play out at the university level. While people are confused about Reo's presence, no one really makes any disparaging remarks about it, possibly because they're all three-quarters convinced that he's some sort of evil yakuza delinquent, a belief that the lightning bolt-shaped scar on his cheek only reinforces. Reo doesn't necessarily seem to mind that his classmates are largely afraid of him, possibly because he's very much aware that he's an adult in a room full of children, and while we don't get any real answers about why he's completing high school now, the very fact that he is doing so seems to be more important, and that, if we extrapolate from volume two, it's borne out of a desire to make up for some misspent youth.    That he also is much more fervent in his attempts to fend Sumire off than some of Mikimoto's other heroes is a bit of a saving grace as well. He knows that this is maybe not an awesome relationship to be embarking on. He does his level best to drive Sumire away, putting on a very good show in volume one of being disinterested, one which begins to crumble a bit in volume two. This is at least in part because Sumire comes from the Chutzpah School of Romance Heroines, and she's not about to let him dictate her feelings – especially not when he's kind of bad at hiding that he may like her, too (which begins to creep out in the first book and becomes solidified in the second). Despite the reciprocal nature of their feelings, however, he remains unrelenting in his commitment to not date Sumire. While we can all make a good guess that this really isn't going to last, the “we can't” approach is a nice change from the “no, really, I swear I don't like you” tactic that I feel like we see more of in the genre. That he seems to have some very good reasons beyond simply being older than her is an intriguing bit of story-building, and while it may turn out to be reasons that only Reo thinks are important, just being able to stick to his guns around the very open Sumire does a nice job of illustrating to the reader that he really is an adult to her teenager.    That Reo's family is somehow involved in all of this feels like a given by the end of volume two. We know from the outset of the series that he has a tenuous relationship with them, but the fancy party that Sumire's author father drags her to as his plus-one (he's a single dad and appears to be mostly devoted to his daughter) reveals that there may be more than run-of-the-mill estrangement going on. One of the best scenes in the these volumes comes from volume two, when Sumire stands up to Reo's grandfather for him; she doesn't have a full grasp of what's going on, but she can tell from the impressively tense undercurrent to their conversation that he's pressuring Reo to do things he's not comfortable with, and since she doesn't have a horse in their race (so to speak), she's in a better position to speak up. It also emphasizes how much younger she is emotionally than Reo; she lacks a grasp of the social nuances of the situation, or at least is young enough that she doesn't care about them. It may be only a few years, but the scene really does emphasize how big a difference there can be between your late teens and early twenties in terms of understanding – and that Sumire's actions feel like the right ones may say something about the social pressures Reo has learned to cave to.    Naturally around this time in volume two we learn that he and Sumire knew each other in the past, and that she's inadvertently behind his switch from his bad-boy ways to where he is now. Reo refuses to say more than that, hedging that it was a small nothing to Sumire that meant the world to him, and that's intriguing, but it needs development if it is to be a mitigating factor in their budding romance's inappropriateness. There's also a bit of an insta-love feel to Sumire falling for him, made more prominent by the fact that she's more than ready for romance, as we see from her conversations with her best friend Rio. That does make him feel a bit more like ""convenient love"" than ""true love,"" although his attachment to her from the past does indicate that such will not always be the case. It's a contrived situation all around, but there's still enough here to make this worth following, especially if you've enjoyed Mikimoto's work before, and her ugly-cute art style with its chibis looks much better here than in previous series. (Although we won't talk about some of the questionable outfits that appear in the party chapters.) It's an age-gap romance with a different hook, and by volume two, that hook is baited well enough that it'll be hard to resist volume three.             Grade:      Overall : B Story : B+ Art : B-  + Reo's reservations about Sumire balance out her insta-love, volume two is stronger overall. New character in volume two is fun. − Romance feels pretty abrupt, art isn't great at perspective.

Review   by Rebecca Silverman, Mar 30th 2022       Lightning and Romance GN 1-2                     Synopsis:             Sumire is less than thrilled when, at the start of her second year in high school, she finds herself in a class with the resident bad “boy,” Reo. Reo's actually in his early twenties, and while no one can figure out why he's attending high school, the rumors about him are definitely not flattering. But as Sumire gets to know him, she finds out that there's a lot more to Reo than the unsavory rumors suggest. But does her romance stand a chance when he's determined to keep her out of his life?      Review:         Synopsis:        Sumire is less than thrilled when, at the start of her second year in high school, she finds herself in a class with the resident bad “boy,” Reo. Reo's actually in his early twenties, and while no one can figure out why he's attending high school, the rumors about him are definitely not flattering. But as Sumire gets to know him, she finds out that there's a lot more to Reo than the unsavory rumors suggest. But does her romance stand a chance when he's determined to keep her out of his life?     Review:            If you've been reading Rin Mikimoto's previously translated works, you may have figured out that she has a thing for the age-gap romance – all of her other translated works but Kira-kun Today fall under that heading. This time she's trying something new in the field: rather than having her heroine fall in love with a teacher (Love's Reach) or a famous, slightly older celebrity (Kiss Me at the Stroke of Midnight), the older man Sumire falls for is in her high school class, and unlike titles like A Girl and Her Guard Dog, he appears to be there strictly to learn.    There's absolutely nothing wrong with going back at a nontraditional age to finish your education, so although it's odd, it's not bad that 20-year-old Reo is sitting in a second-year high school classroom even if in real life we more often see this play out at the university level. While people are confused about Reo's presence, no one really makes any disparaging remarks about it, possibly because they're all three-quarters convinced that he's some sort of evil yakuza delinquent, a belief that the lightning bolt-shaped scar on his cheek only reinforces. Reo doesn't necessarily seem to mind that his classmates are largely afraid of him, possibly because he's very much aware that he's an adult in a room full of children, and while we don't get any real answers about why he's completing high school now, the very fact that he is doing so seems to be more important, and that, if we extrapolate from volume two, it's borne out of a desire to make up for some misspent youth.    That he also is much more fervent in his attempts to fend Sumire off than some of Mikimoto's other heroes is a bit of a saving grace as well. He knows that this is maybe not an awesome relationship to be embarking on. He does his level best to drive Sumire away, putting on a very good show in volume one of being disinterested, one which begins to crumble a bit in volume two. This is at least in part because Sumire comes from the Chutzpah School of Romance Heroines, and she's not about to let him dictate her feelings – especially not when he's kind of bad at hiding that he may like her, too (which begins to creep out in the first book and becomes solidified in the second). Despite the reciprocal nature of their feelings, however, he remains unrelenting in his commitment to not date Sumire. While we can all make a good guess that this really isn't going to last, the “we can't” approach is a nice change from the “no, really, I swear I don't like you” tactic that I feel like we see more of in the genre. That he seems to have some very good reasons beyond simply being older than her is an intriguing bit of story-building, and while it may turn out to be reasons that only Reo thinks are important, just being able to stick to his guns around the very open Sumire does a nice job of illustrating to the reader that he really is an adult to her teenager.    That Reo's family is somehow involved in all of this feels like a given by the end of volume two. We know from the outset of the series that he has a tenuous relationship with them, but the fancy party that Sumire's author father drags her to as his plus-one (he's a single dad and appears to be mostly devoted to his daughter) reveals that there may be more than run-of-the-mill estrangement going on. One of the best scenes in the these volumes comes from volume two, when Sumire stands up to Reo's grandfather for him; she doesn't have a full grasp of what's going on, but she can tell from the impressively tense undercurrent to their conversation that he's pressuring Reo to do things he's not comfortable with, and since she doesn't have a horse in their race (so to speak), she's in a better position to speak up. It also emphasizes how much younger she is emotionally than Reo; she lacks a grasp of the social nuances of the situation, or at least is young enough that she doesn't care about them. It may be only a few years, but the scene really does emphasize how big a difference there can be between your late teens and early twenties in terms of understanding – and that Sumire's actions feel like the right ones may say something about the social pressures Reo has learned to cave to.    Naturally around this time in volume two we learn that he and Sumire knew each other in the past, and that she's inadvertently behind his switch from his bad-boy ways to where he is now. Reo refuses to say more than that, hedging that it was a small nothing to Sumire that meant the world to him, and that's intriguing, but it needs development if it is to be a mitigating factor in their budding romance's inappropriateness. There's also a bit of an insta-love feel to Sumire falling for him, made more prominent by the fact that she's more than ready for romance, as we see from her conversations with her best friend Rio. That does make him feel a bit more like ""convenient love"" than ""true love,"" although his attachment to her from the past does indicate that such will not always be the case. It's a contrived situation all around, but there's still enough here to make this worth following, especially if you've enjoyed Mikimoto's work before, and her ugly-cute art style with its chibis looks much better here than in previous series. (Although we won't talk about some of the questionable outfits that appear in the party chapters.) It's an age-gap romance with a different hook, and by volume two, that hook is baited well enough that it'll be hard to resist volume three.             Grade:      Overall : B Story : B+ Art : B-  + Reo's reservations about Sumire balance out her insta-love, volume two is stronger overall. New character in volume two is fun. − Romance feels pretty abrupt, art isn't great at perspective. Very contrived starting plot.            discuss this in the forum |        bookmark/share with:                  				Add this manga to 				               Production Info:        Story & Art: Rin Mikimoto   Full encyclopedia details aboutLightning and Romance (manga)        Review homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          3 comments       Jujutsu Kaisen Stage Play's Video Introduces Cast in Costume   Apr 15, 07:02 3 comments                 live-action    Ryūji Satō, Ryosuke Miura star in July-August play ― A press conference for the stage play of Gege Akutami's Jujutsu Kaisen manga introduced the production's promotional video, main cast, and other details on Wednesday.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Rising of The Shield Hero Season 2   Apr  7th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Rising of The Shield Hero Season 2 ?                     Community score: 3.9              What is this?   No sooner has Naofumi settled into his role as the new ruler of Raphtalia's village, that they're beset by an attack from a horde of bat monsters! The timer for the Waves is mysteriously stalled, and a meeting with the other Cardinal Heroes and the Queen reveals the rising of a new threat: The 'Spirit Tortoise' is bringing potential ruin with it, and with the other Heroes opting out of doing anything about it, things naturally fall to Naofumi to take care of things. With new ally (and new slave) Rishia in tow, the Shield Hero's party heads for the Spirit Tortoise Kingdom in order to save the world once again.    The Rising of The Shield Hero Season 2 is based on Aneko Yusagi's novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Wednesdays.      How was the first episode?  Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               When last we left off, Naofumi and the others were struggling with the revelation that they were involved in a battle between worlds rather than a simple monster invasion. However, all this is put to the side as a new threat arises, the Spirit Tortoise, whose arrival mysteriously puts a stop to the Waves for the time being.    When it comes down to it, this episode is really only concerned with one thing: exposition. Though we do get two quick action scenes, the thrust of the episode is about establishing the status quo for the arc—i.e., the threat of the turtle—while reminding us of important plot points from the previous season.    Luckily, this is done largely through character building. We see that Naofumi is far from the aggrieved man he was for much of the first season. Becoming the lord of Raphtalia's hometown has tied him irrevocably to the kingdom. While the other heroes still see the fantasy world as a game, to Naofumi it has become his true life filled with things he is driven to protect.    We also spend a lot of time developing Rishia, the newest member of Naofumi's party. She's a young woman in turmoil—in love with a man who has rejected her even though she is dying to be useful to him. But in her, there is potential, though Naofumi and his friends are unsure how to bring it out and what form it will ultimately take. She is an inherently tragic character but through Naofumi's party, it looks like she will be able to become the person she was meant to be. If nothing else, her earnestness makes her easy to root for.    All in all, while this is one of the weaker episodes, it does its job setting up the next arc well enough and gives us some solid character development to boot. Hopefully, things will pick up a bit next episode.      How was the first episode?  Christopher Farris  Rating:               There's the possibility that kicking off a second season of The Rising of the Shield Hero could be a boon for the series. There's a clean break to all the consternation and baggage that fueled the original outing: most of the foundation built on Naofumi's persecution  has cleared up. However, not content with just the one demihuman slave, he now gets to be the ruler of a whole village of demihumans. The world is still besieged by regular monster attacks, which is also now subject to hero-assassination attempts from other worlds. So of course, some new issue inevitably gets foisted into the plot for Naofumi and crew.    There's definitely the sense of a plot-necessity swerve in the development of this premiere episode. The driving force of the entire story of the first season, the Waves, quite literally gets put on pause so the Queen can impart the new issue of a 'Spirit Tortoise' that we haven't heard of before but we're assured is every bit as much a major disaster. It certainly means the episode gets going quickly; we hardly have any time for the sort of reestablishing elements with Naofumi in the demihuman village before suddenly they're beset by random bat monsters brought by the ascension of the evil Turtle Pope. But it also means that parts of the story get back to too-perfunctory Business As Usual for Shield Hero. The other Cardinal Heroes, apparently having learned nothing from the climax of the previous adventure, are still acting like callous jerks to Naofumi and friends, and shrugging off needing to actually do anything about the Spirit Tortoise under the auspices that it's not their job.    So even though Naofumi has more predisposition to help with the situation, the storytelling still oddly proceeds with that sense of begrudgement we're just supposed to expect around him in this story. It's almost unintentionally hilarious, the way both the Queen and later Fitoria act like they need to convince Naofumi to take care of the Spirit Tortoise under duress, despite him immediately agreeing to do so. I know that this sort of disagreeable tone is part-and-parcel to the darker, nihilistic angle of appeal Shield Hero is trying to present in its fantasy world, but it just comes off needlessly enforced when its main character character has no reason to act like the world's against him anymore .    That said, the slack of the struggle in Shield-land is instead picked up in this premiere by Rishia, who ends up with what could be considered the emotional core of this episode. Her persecution by her former party with the Bow Hero definitely reflects Naofumi's own story, to where you can almost hear the author going ""See, I can write a woman who gets put upon and mistreated for unfair reasons too! It's equality!"" Of course the major difference is that when Naofumi was at his lowest point, he was forced to buy a slave, while as Rishia finds herself struggling she is convinced to become a slave and aaaaaawwwwww Christ.    Look, I don't need to get into the weeds on this, we had half a year of slavery discourse with the first Shield Hero season. But it must be said that it comes off as downright undermining that the show ever portrayed the slave trade as this dark, seedy element its hero could turn to out of desperation, when at this point it's mostly just an odd mechanic characters can submit themselves to for in-story power-up convenience and lip service to a fetish that isn't even portrayed half as entertainingly as in other series like How NOT to Summon a Demon Lord. That is to say, Rishia agreeing to become Naofumi's slave for a time doesn't prompt aghast reactions of offense, it simply comes off as eyeroll-worthy.    Regardless, Shield Hero's second season has at least started with plenty of momentum to it, even if some of the new story elements come off like ham-fisted hard-turns. But this is a show that worked better the more it expanded its world-building anyway, so maybe figuring out what the deal with this Spirit Tortoise actually is or seeing how Rishia's development along the way plays out will be to its benefit. The fights we get in this episode featuring our heroes slaughtering their way through Countries both Bat and Donkey Kong are decent, concentrated bursts of action (there's a little bit of shaky CGI, but you know I always love seeing Filo fight in her big, puffy, bird form), and you know Kevin Penkin's score is still pulling its weight. It's the beginning of a second season that seems to be justifying its existence, with all the caveats from however you felt about the original's existence in the first place.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          3 comments       Jujutsu Kaisen Stage Play's Video Introduces Cast in Costume   Apr 15, 07:02 3 comments                 live-action    Ryūji Satō, Ryosuke Miura star in July-August play ― A press conference for the stage play of Gege Akutami's Jujutsu Kaisen manga introduced the production's promotional video, main cast, and other details on Wednesday.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Rising of The Shield Hero Season 2   Apr  7th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Rising of The Shield Hero Season 2 ?                     Community score: 3.9              What is this?   No sooner has Naofumi settled into his role as the new ruler of Raphtalia's village, that they're beset by an attack from a horde of bat monsters! The timer for the Waves is mysteriously stalled, and a meeting with the other Cardinal Heroes and the Queen reveals the rising of a new threat: The 'Spirit Tortoise' is bringing potential ruin with it, and with the other Heroes opting out of doing anything about it, things naturally fall to Naofumi to take care of things. With new ally (and new slave) Rishia in tow, the Shield Hero's party heads for the Spirit Tortoise Kingdom in order to save the world once again.    The Rising of The Shield Hero Season 2 is based on Aneko Yusagi's novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Wednesdays.      How was the first episode?  Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               When last we left off, Naofumi and the others were struggling with the revelation that they were involved in a battle between worlds rather than a simple monster invasion. However, all this is put to the side as a new threat arises, the Spirit Tortoise, whose arrival mysteriously puts a stop to the Waves for the time being.    When it comes down to it, this episode is really only concerned with one thing: exposition. Though we do get two quick action scenes, the thrust of the episode is about establishing the status quo for the arc—i.e., the threat of the turtle—while reminding us of important plot points from the previous season.    Luckily, this is done largely through character building. We see that Naofumi is far from the aggrieved man he was for much of the first season. Becoming the lord of Raphtalia's hometown has tied him irrevocably to the kingdom. While the other heroes still see the fantasy world as a game, to Naofumi it has become his true life filled with things he is driven to protect.    We also spend a lot of time developing Rishia, the newest member of Naofumi's party. She's a young woman in turmoil—in love with a man who has rejected her even though she is dying to be useful to him. But in her, there is potential, though Naofumi and his friends are unsure how to bring it out and what form it will ultimately take. She is an inherently tragic character but through Naofumi's party, it looks like she will be able to become the person she was meant to be. If nothing else, her earnestness makes her easy to root for.    All in all, while this is one of the weaker episodes, it does its job setting up the next arc well enough and gives us some solid character development to boot. Hopefully, things will pick up a bit next episode.      How was the first episode?  Christopher Farris  Rating:               There's the possibility that kicking off a second season of The Rising of the Shield Hero could be a boon for the series. There's a clean break to all the consternation and baggage that fueled the original outing: most of the foundation built on Naofumi's persecution  has cleared up. However, not content with just the one demihuman slave, he now gets to be the ruler of a whole village of demihumans. The world is still besieged by regular monster attacks, which is also now subject to hero-assassination attempts from other worlds. So of course, some new issue inevitably gets foisted into the plot for Naofumi and crew.    There's definitely the sense of a plot-necessity swerve in the development of this premiere episode. The driving force of the entire story of the first season, the Waves, quite literally gets put on pause so the Queen can impart the new issue of a 'Spirit Tortoise' that we haven't heard of before but we're assured is every bit as much a major disaster. It certainly means the episode gets going quickly; we hardly have any time for the sort of reestablishing elements with Naofumi in the demihuman village before suddenly they're beset by random bat monsters brought by the ascension of the evil Turtle Pope. But it also means that parts of the story get back to too-perfunctory Business As Usual for Shield Hero. The other Cardinal Heroes, apparently having learned nothing from the climax of the previous adventure, are still acting like callous jerks to Naofumi and friends, and shrugging off needing to actually do anything about the Spirit Tortoise under the auspices that it's not their job.    So even though Naofumi has more predisposition to help with the situation, the storytelling still oddly proceeds with that sense of begrudgement we're just supposed to expect around him in this story. It's almost unintentionally hilarious, the way both the Queen and later Fitoria act like they need to convince Naofumi to take care of the Spirit Tortoise under duress, despite him immediately agreeing to do so. I know that this sort of disagreeable tone is part-and-parcel to the darker, nihilistic angle of appeal Shield Hero is trying to present in its fantasy world, but it just comes off needlessly enforced when its main character character has no reason to act like the world's against him anymore .    That said, the slack of the struggle in Shield-land is instead picked up in this premiere by Rishia, who ends up with what could be considered the emotional core of this episode. Her persecution by her former party with the Bow Hero definitely reflects Naofumi's own story, to where you can almost hear the author going ""See, I can write a woman who gets put upon and mistreated for unfair reasons too! It's equality!"" Of course the major difference is that when Naofumi was at his lowest point, he was forced to buy a slave, while as Rishia finds herself struggling she is convinced to become a slave and aaaaaawwwwww Christ.    Look, I don't need to get into the weeds on this, we had half a year of slavery discourse with the first Shield Hero season. But it must be said that it comes off as downright undermining that the show ever portrayed the slave trade as this dark, seedy element its hero could turn to out of desperation, when at this point it's mostly just an odd mechanic characters can submit themselves to for in-story power-up convenience and lip service to a fetish that isn't even portrayed half as entertainingly as in other series like How NOT to Summon a Demon Lord. That is to say, Rishia agreeing to become Naofumi's slave for a time doesn't prompt aghast reactions of offense, it simply comes off as eyeroll-worthy.    Regardless, Shield Hero's second season has at least started with plenty of momentum to it, even if some of the new story elements come off like ham-fisted hard-turns. But this is a show that worked better the more it expanded its world-building anyway, so maybe figuring out what the deal with this Spirit Tortoise actually is or seeing how Rishia's development along the way plays out will be to its benefit. The fights we get in this episode featuring our heroes slaughtering their way through Countries both Bat and Donkey Kong are decent, concentrated bursts of action (there's a little bit of shaky CGI, but you know I always love seeing Filo fight in her big, puffy, bird form), and you know Kevin Penkin's score is still pulling its weight. It's the beginning of a second season that seems to be justifying its existence, with all the caveats from however you felt about the original's existence in the first place.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          3 comments       Jujutsu Kaisen Stage Play's Video Introduces Cast in Costume   Apr 15, 07:02 3 comments                 live-action    Ryūji Satō, Ryosuke Miura star in July-August play ― A press conference for the stage play of Gege Akutami's Jujutsu Kaisen manga introduced the production's promotional video, main cast, and other details on Wednesday.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Rising of The Shield Hero Season 2   Apr  7th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Rising of The Shield Hero Season 2 ?                     Community score: 3.9              What is this?   No sooner has Naofumi settled into his role as the new ruler of Raphtalia's village, that they're beset by an attack from a horde of bat monsters! The timer for the Waves is mysteriously stalled, and a meeting with the other Cardinal Heroes and the Queen reveals the rising of a new threat: The 'Spirit Tortoise' is bringing potential ruin with it, and with the other Heroes opting out of doing anything about it, things naturally fall to Naofumi to take care of things. With new ally (and new slave) Rishia in tow, the Shield Hero's party heads for the Spirit Tortoise Kingdom in order to save the world once again.    The Rising of The Shield Hero Season 2 is based on Aneko Yusagi's novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Wednesdays.      How was the first episode?  Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               When last we left off, Naofumi and the others were struggling with the revelation that they were involved in a battle between worlds rather than a simple monster invasion. However, all this is put to the side as a new threat arises, the Spirit Tortoise, whose arrival mysteriously puts a stop to the Waves for the time being.    When it comes down to it, this episode is really only concerned with one thing: exposition. Though we do get two quick action scenes, the thrust of the episode is about establishing the status quo for the arc—i.e., the threat of the turtle—while reminding us of important plot points from the previous season.    Luckily, this is done largely through character building. We see that Naofumi is far from the aggrieved man he was for much of the first season. Becoming the lord of Raphtalia's hometown has tied him irrevocably to the kingdom. While the other heroes still see the fantasy world as a game, to Naofumi it has become his true life filled with things he is driven to protect.    We also spend a lot of time developing Rishia, the newest member of Naofumi's party. She's a young woman in turmoil—in love with a man who has rejected her even though she is dying to be useful to him. But in her, there is potential, though Naofumi and his friends are unsure how to bring it out and what form it will ultimately take. She is an inherently tragic character but through Naofumi's party, it looks like she will be able to become the person she was meant to be. If nothing else, her earnestness makes her easy to root for.    All in all, while this is one of the weaker episodes, it does its job setting up the next arc well enough and gives us some solid character development to boot. Hopefully, things will pick up a bit next episode.      How was the first episode?  Christopher Farris  Rating:               There's the possibility that kicking off a second season of The Rising of the Shield Hero could be a boon for the series. There's a clean break to all the consternation and baggage that fueled the original outing: most of the foundation built on Naofumi's persecution  has cleared up. However, not content with just the one demihuman slave, he now gets to be the ruler of a whole village of demihumans. The world is still besieged by regular monster attacks, which is also now subject to hero-assassination attempts from other worlds. So of course, some new issue inevitably gets foisted into the plot for Naofumi and crew.    There's definitely the sense of a plot-necessity swerve in the development of this premiere episode. The driving force of the entire story of the first season, the Waves, quite literally gets put on pause so the Queen can impart the new issue of a 'Spirit Tortoise' that we haven't heard of before but we're assured is every bit as much a major disaster. It certainly means the episode gets going quickly; we hardly have any time for the sort of reestablishing elements with Naofumi in the demihuman village before suddenly they're beset by random bat monsters brought by the ascension of the evil Turtle Pope. But it also means that parts of the story get back to too-perfunctory Business As Usual for Shield Hero. The other Cardinal Heroes, apparently having learned nothing from the climax of the previous adventure, are still acting like callous jerks to Naofumi and friends, and shrugging off needing to actually do anything about the Spirit Tortoise under the auspices that it's not their job.    So even though Naofumi has more predisposition to help with the situation, the storytelling still oddly proceeds with that sense of begrudgement we're just supposed to expect around him in this story. It's almost unintentionally hilarious, the way both the Queen and later Fitoria act like they need to convince Naofumi to take care of the Spirit Tortoise under duress, despite him immediately agreeing to do so. I know that this sort of disagreeable tone is part-and-parcel to the darker, nihilistic angle of appeal Shield Hero is trying to present in its fantasy world, but it just comes off needlessly enforced when its main character character has no reason to act like the world's against him anymore .    That said, the slack of the struggle in Shield-land is instead picked up in this premiere by Rishia, who ends up with what could be considered the emotional core of this episode. Her persecution by her former party with the Bow Hero definitely reflects Naofumi's own story, to where you can almost hear the author going ""See, I can write a woman who gets put upon and mistreated for unfair reasons too! It's equality!"" Of course the major difference is that when Naofumi was at his lowest point, he was forced to buy a slave, while as Rishia finds herself struggling she is convinced to become a slave and aaaaaawwwwww Christ.    Look, I don't need to get into the weeds on this, we had half a year of slavery discourse with the first Shield Hero season. But it must be said that it comes off as downright undermining that the show ever portrayed the slave trade as this dark, seedy element its hero could turn to out of desperation, when at this point it's mostly just an odd mechanic characters can submit themselves to for in-story power-up convenience and lip service to a fetish that isn't even portrayed half as entertainingly as in other series like How NOT to Summon a Demon Lord. That is to say, Rishia agreeing to become Naofumi's slave for a time doesn't prompt aghast reactions of offense, it simply comes off as eyeroll-worthy.    Regardless, Shield Hero's second season has at least started with plenty of momentum to it, even if some of the new story elements come off like ham-fisted hard-turns. But this is a show that worked better the more it expanded its world-building anyway, so maybe figuring out what the deal with this Spirit Tortoise actually is or seeing how Rishia's development along the way plays out will be to its benefit. The fights we get in this episode featuring our heroes slaughtering their way through Countries both Bat and Donkey Kong are decent, concentrated bursts of action (there's a little bit of shaky CGI, but you know I always love seeing Filo fight in her big, puffy, bird form), and you know Kevin Penkin's score is still pulling its weight. It's the beginning of a second season that seems to be justifying its existence, with all the caveats from however you felt about the original's existence in the first place.     discuss this in the forum (296 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          3 comments       Jujutsu Kaisen Stage Play's Video Introduces Cast in Costume   Apr 15, 07:02 3 comments                 live-action    Ryūji Satō, Ryosuke Miura star in July-August play ― A press conference for the stage play of Gege Akutami's Jujutsu Kaisen manga introduced the production's promotional video, main cast, and other details on Wednesday.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Rising of The Shield Hero Season 2   Apr  7th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Rising of The Shield Hero Season 2 ?                     Community score: 3.9              What is this?   No sooner has Naofumi settled into his role as the new ruler of Raphtalia's village, that they're beset by an attack from a horde of bat monsters! The timer for the Waves is mysteriously stalled, and a meeting with the other Cardinal Heroes and the Queen reveals the rising of a new threat: The 'Spirit Tortoise' is bringing potential ruin with it, and with the other Heroes opting out of doing anything about it, things naturally fall to Naofumi to take care of things. With new ally (and new slave) Rishia in tow, the Shield Hero's party heads for the Spirit Tortoise Kingdom in order to save the world once again.    The Rising of The Shield Hero Season 2 is based on Aneko Yusagi's novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Wednesdays.      How was the first episode?  Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               When last we left off, Naofumi and the others were struggling with the revelation that they were involved in a battle between worlds rather than a simple monster invasion. However, all this is put to the side as a new threat arises, the Spirit Tortoise, whose arrival mysteriously puts a stop to the Waves for the time being.    When it comes down to it, this episode is really only concerned with one thing: exposition. Though we do get two quick action scenes, the thrust of the episode is about establishing the status quo for the arc—i.e., the threat of the turtle—while reminding us of important plot points from the previous season.    Luckily, this is done largely through character building. We see that Naofumi is far from the aggrieved man he was for much of the first season. Becoming the lord of Raphtalia's hometown has tied him irrevocably to the kingdom. While the other heroes still see the fantasy world as a game, to Naofumi it has become his true life filled with things he is driven to protect.    We also spend a lot of time developing Rishia, the newest member of Naofumi's party. She's a young woman in turmoil—in love with a man who has rejected her even though she is dying to be useful to him. But in her, there is potential, though Naofumi and his friends are unsure how to bring it out and what form it will ultimately take. She is an inherently tragic character but through Naofumi's party, it looks like she will be able to become the person she was meant to be. If nothing else, her earnestness makes her easy to root for.    All in all, while this is one of the weaker episodes, it does its job setting up the next arc well enough and gives us some solid character development to boot. Hopefully, things will pick up a bit next episode.      How was the first episode?  Christopher Farris  Rating:               There's the possibility that kicking off a second season of The Rising of the Shield Hero could be a boon for the series. There's a clean break to all the consternation and baggage that fueled the original outing: most of the foundation built on Naofumi's persecution  has cleared up. However, not content with just the one demihuman slave, he now gets to be the ruler of a whole village of demihumans. The world is still besieged by regular monster attacks, which is also now subject to hero-assassination attempts from other worlds. So of course, some new issue inevitably gets foisted into the plot for Naofumi and crew.    There's definitely the sense of a plot-necessity swerve in the development of this premiere episode. The driving force of the entire story of the first season, the Waves, quite literally gets put on pause so the Queen can impart the new issue of a 'Spirit Tortoise' that we haven't heard of before but we're assured is every bit as much a major disaster. It certainly means the episode gets going quickly; we hardly have any time for the sort of reestablishing elements with Naofumi in the demihuman village before suddenly they're beset by random bat monsters brought by the ascension of the evil Turtle Pope. But it also means that parts of the story get back to too-perfunctory Business As Usual for Shield Hero. The other Cardinal Heroes, apparently having learned nothing from the climax of the previous adventure, are still acting like callous jerks to Naofumi and friends, and shrugging off needing to actually do anything about the Spirit Tortoise under the auspices that it's not their job.    So even though Naofumi has more predisposition to help with the situation, the storytelling still oddly proceeds with that sense of begrudgement we're just supposed to expect around him in this story. It's almost unintentionally hilarious, the way both the Queen and later Fitoria act like they need to convince Naofumi to take care of the Spirit Tortoise under duress, despite him immediately agreeing to do so. I know that this sort of disagreeable tone is part-and-parcel to the darker, nihilistic angle of appeal Shield Hero is trying to present in its fantasy world, but it just comes off needlessly enforced when its main character character has no reason to act like the world's against him anymore .    That said, the slack of the struggle in Shield-land is instead picked up in this premiere by Rishia, who ends up with what could be considered the emotional core of this episode. Her persecution by her former party with the Bow Hero definitely reflects Naofumi's own story, to where you can almost hear the author going ""See, I can write a woman who gets put upon and mistreated for unfair reasons too! It's equality!"" Of course the major difference is that when Naofumi was at his lowest point, he was forced to buy a slave, while as Rishia finds herself struggling she is convinced to become a slave and aaaaaawwwwww Christ.    Look, I don't need to get into the weeds on this, we had half a year of slavery discourse with the first Shield Hero season. But it must be said that it comes off as downright undermining that the show ever portrayed the slave trade as this dark, seedy element its hero could turn to out of desperation, when at this point it's mostly just an odd mechanic characters can submit themselves to for in-story power-up convenience and lip service to a fetish that isn't even portrayed half as entertainingly as in other series like How NOT to Summon a Demon Lord. That is to say, Rishia agreeing to become Naofumi's slave for a time doesn't prompt aghast reactions of offense, it simply comes off as eyeroll-worthy.    Regardless, Shield Hero's second season has at least started with plenty of momentum to it, even if some of the new story elements come off like ham-fisted hard-turns. But this is a show that worked better the more it expanded its world-building anyway, so maybe figuring out what the deal with this Spirit Tortoise actually is or seeing how Rishia's development along the way plays out will be to its benefit. The fights we get in this episode featuring our heroes slaughtering their way through Countries both Bat and Donkey Kong are decent, concentrated bursts of action (there's a little bit of shaky CGI, but you know I always love seeing Filo fight in her big, puffy, bird form), and you know Kevin Penkin's score is still pulling its weight.

Requiem of the Rose King Episode 13  by Rebecca Silverman, Apr 11th 2022                   How would you rate episode 13 of Requiem of the Rose King ?                     Community score: 3.4            I may have anticipated this week's use of Richard's final speech to Henry in Henry the Sixth Part Three in the episode twelve review, but the line “I am myself alone” still informs Richard's character a great deal. Its myriad interpretations speak to the turmoil in his heart, even if he believes that, in killing Henry, he is currently without a soul. What's interesting is that although Richard says more than once that he has killed his own soul in that final encounter with his love, there's not that noticeable a difference in his actions now. He still laments his body, feels conflicted about the crown, and is quietly working behind the scenes, though to what end even he may not be fully aware of. We know what Edward wants, what Elizabeth wants, what Buckingham wants. But what does Richard want? And has he ever really known?    It's fitting that this point in the story is when Aya Kanno's version of the plays brings in Jane Shore. In Shakespearean terms, Jane isn't a named character in any of the plays, although some productions do give her name to one of the random court ladies and she is mentioned as “Mistress Shore.” (She is, however, a significant character in several other versions of the Richard III story, including a 1714 play named after her.) Historically she was in fact Edward's mistress beginning in 1476 until his death in 1483, and while she wasn't a witch, Richard did accuse her of conspiring against him when he took the throne. Ultimately Jane did pretty well for a player in the Wars of the Roses saga, outliving basically everyone else to die in her 80s. Her status as a witch in Requiem of the Rose King, at least as we see it in this episode, is yet another marker of Richard's discomfort with his feminine aspects; he compares her to Joan (also not a witch), and she makes him similarly uncomfortable as she seeks to manipulate him for her own ends. In Richard's world, women are witches like Jane and Joan, betrayers like Anne and Cecily, or schemers like Isabelle, Margaret, and Elizabeth. Why would he want to accept that part of himself when he can't like it in others?    Jane's entry into the scene is also a good way to show us how much time has passed. Prince Edward died in 1471 and King Edward is still alive, so we have to be somewhere between 1476 and 1483, a time frame borne out by the ages of the new sons present in the episode – and Buckingham's impressive growth spurt. (And guess what? The new kids are also all Edwards and Richards!) The king's slide into debauchery and George's descent into wine-fueled anger are what allow Jane to slip in and begin manipulating circumstances as she pleases, but if we're honest she doesn't have to work that hard, because both of Richard's older brothers aren't exactly leading healthy lives. Richard's exclusion – which he basically does himself – is what gives him a better view of what's going on but also what may be keeping him safer than either Edward or George, because he's not out there in plain sight most of the time. Sure people wonder why he and Anne have only one child (and we all know who that adorable kid really is), but for the most part he's just quietly lurking.    That's what makes the opening scene of this cour so striking. It features an actor as Richard, performing the scene I mentioned in the beginning. Richard is playing a part, it implies, reciting his lines as he moves through the world still feeling the pain of Henry's loss and does what he believes is his part for his father's dream. Heaven may not be in the circlet of the crown, but Hell most definitely is, and Richard's been staring down into that abyss for a while now. Will he slip over the edge and embrace Shakespearean villainy? The curtain has risen on Richard III. Let's watch and find out.

Requiem of the Rose King Episode 13  by Rebecca Silverman, Apr 11th 2022                   How would you rate episode 13 of Requiem of the Rose King ?                     Community score: 3.4            I may have anticipated this week's use of Richard's final speech to Henry in Henry the Sixth Part Three in the episode twelve review, but the line “I am myself alone” still informs Richard's character a great deal. Its myriad interpretations speak to the turmoil in his heart, even if he believes that, in killing Henry, he is currently without a soul. What's interesting is that although Richard says more than once that he has killed his own soul in that final encounter with his love, there's not that noticeable a difference in his actions now. He still laments his body, feels conflicted about the crown, and is quietly working behind the scenes, though to what end even he may not be fully aware of. We know what Edward wants, what Elizabeth wants, what Buckingham wants. But what does Richard want? And has he ever really known?    It's fitting that this point in the story is when Aya Kanno's version of the plays brings in Jane Shore. In Shakespearean terms, Jane isn't a named character in any of the plays, although some productions do give her name to one of the random court ladies and she is mentioned as “Mistress Shore.” (She is, however, a significant character in several other versions of the Richard III story, including a 1714 play named after her.) Historically she was in fact Edward's mistress beginning in 1476 until his death in 1483, and while she wasn't a witch, Richard did accuse her of conspiring against him when he took the throne. Ultimately Jane did pretty well for a player in the Wars of the Roses saga, outliving basically everyone else to die in her 80s. Her status as a witch in Requiem of the Rose King, at least as we see it in this episode, is yet another marker of Richard's discomfort with his feminine aspects; he compares her to Joan (also not a witch), and she makes him similarly uncomfortable as she seeks to manipulate him for her own ends. In Richard's world, women are witches like Jane and Joan, betrayers like Anne and Cecily, or schemers like Isabelle, Margaret, and Elizabeth. Why would he want to accept that part of himself when he can't like it in others?    Jane's entry into the scene is also a good way to show us how much time has passed. Prince Edward died in 1471 and King Edward is still alive, so we have to be somewhere between 1476 and 1483, a time frame borne out by the ages of the new sons present in the episode – and Buckingham's impressive growth spurt. (And guess what? The new kids are also all Edwards and Richards!) The king's slide into debauchery and George's descent into wine-fueled anger are what allow Jane to slip in and begin manipulating circumstances as she pleases, but if we're honest she doesn't have to work that hard, because both of Richard's older brothers aren't exactly leading healthy lives. Richard's exclusion – which he basically does himself – is what gives him a better view of what's going on but also what may be keeping him safer than either Edward or George, because he's not out there in plain sight most of the time. Sure people wonder why he and Anne have only one child (and we all know who that adorable kid really is), but for the most part he's just quietly lurking.    That's what makes the opening scene of this cour so striking. It features an actor as Richard, performing the scene I mentioned in the beginning. Richard is playing a part, it implies, reciting his lines as he moves through the world still feeling the pain of Henry's loss and does what he believes is his part for his father's dream. Heaven may not be in the circlet of the crown, but Hell most definitely is, and Richard's been staring down into that abyss for a while now. Will he slip over the edge and embrace Shakespearean villainy? The curtain has risen on Richard III. Let's watch and find out.

Requiem of the Rose King Episode 13  by Rebecca Silverman, Apr 11th 2022                   How would you rate episode 13 of Requiem of the Rose King ?                     Community score: 3.4            I may have anticipated this week's use of Richard's final speech to Henry in Henry the Sixth Part Three in the episode twelve review, but the line “I am myself alone” still informs Richard's character a great deal. Its myriad interpretations speak to the turmoil in his heart, even if he believes that, in killing Henry, he is currently without a soul. What's interesting is that although Richard says more than once that he has killed his own soul in that final encounter with his love, there's not that noticeable a difference in his actions now. He still laments his body, feels conflicted about the crown, and is quietly working behind the scenes, though to what end even he may not be fully aware of. We know what Edward wants, what Elizabeth wants, what Buckingham wants. But what does Richard want? And has he ever really known?    It's fitting that this point in the story is when Aya Kanno's version of the plays brings in Jane Shore. In Shakespearean terms, Jane isn't a named character in any of the plays, although some productions do give her name to one of the random court ladies and she is mentioned as “Mistress Shore.” (She is, however, a significant character in several other versions of the Richard III story, including a 1714 play named after her.) Historically she was in fact Edward's mistress beginning in 1476 until his death in 1483, and while she wasn't a witch, Richard did accuse her of conspiring against him when he took the throne. Ultimately Jane did pretty well for a player in the Wars of the Roses saga, outliving basically everyone else to die in her 80s. Her status as a witch in Requiem of the Rose King, at least as we see it in this episode, is yet another marker of Richard's discomfort with his feminine aspects; he compares her to Joan (also not a witch), and she makes him similarly uncomfortable as she seeks to manipulate him for her own ends. In Richard's world, women are witches like Jane and Joan, betrayers like Anne and Cecily, or schemers like Isabelle, Margaret, and Elizabeth. Why would he want to accept that part of himself when he can't like it in others?    Jane's entry into the scene is also a good way to show us how much time has passed. Prince Edward died in 1471 and King Edward is still alive, so we have to be somewhere between 1476 and 1483, a time frame borne out by the ages of the new sons present in the episode – and Buckingham's impressive growth spurt. (And guess what? The new kids are also all Edwards and Richards!) The king's slide into debauchery and George's descent into wine-fueled anger are what allow Jane to slip in and begin manipulating circumstances as she pleases, but if we're honest she doesn't have to work that hard, because both of Richard's older brothers aren't exactly leading healthy lives. Richard's exclusion – which he basically does himself – is what gives him a better view of what's going on but also what may be keeping him safer than either Edward or George, because he's not out there in plain sight most of the time. Sure people wonder why he and Anne have only one child (and we all know who that adorable kid really is), but for the most part he's just quietly lurking.    That's what makes the opening scene of this cour so striking. It features an actor as Richard, performing the scene I mentioned in the beginning. Richard is playing a part, it implies, reciting his lines as he moves through the world still feeling the pain of Henry's loss and does what he believes is his part for his father's dream. Heaven may not be in the circlet of the crown, but Hell most definitely is, and Richard's been staring down into that abyss for a while now. Will he slip over the edge and embrace Shakespearean villainy? The curtain has risen on Richard III. Let's watch and find out.
