I like the story so far, but I felt like too much happened in the first two episodes, so I checked out the beginning of the source material, and it turns out the show has already covered 1 and a half manga volume. I guess it means they intend to adapt all 17 volumes in just two cours. Well, at least it means the show will have a definite ending.

The use of color and pattern is what's making me think it's deliberate.            If the terrible animation and painfully lackluster visuals in general are intentional, then it's all the worse, to be honest. If you look at the manga it has strong contrasts even on color illustrations, and all-around striking and dramatic visuals, in the good old dramatic shoujo manga way. Compared to that, the anime looks like it was made on a shoestring budget by someone who had no creative vision whatsoever, no ideas what to do with this adaptation other than adding some ""dark colors"" to the manga panels, because hey it's a dark story, and then slapping it on the screen. Which I think is actually the case.    If I had my way shoujo manga like this would never be adapted unless it was in the hands of someone who can prove they can re-create the drama and dynamics on screen.

I'm still hoping they slow down a bit once they're more into the Richard III storyline.           Honestly, I wouldn't hope for that. As someone who had been reading this manga from the day the first chapter was published in Princess, the Henry VI arc is the best part of it all, and I think the anime is doing it an unforgivable injustice. Without any spoilers I was really, really disappointed in the (frankly, unexpected) turn it did shortly after reaching Richard III territory.

I‘m not sure if I’ll stick around for the entire season. I’ll definitely read the manga at some point.    Yeah, I agree that there were some cool scenes in this episode. It’s a shame that the cool scenes can’t make up for everything else…      Back to top                  Blood-   Bargain Hunter   Joined: 07 Mar 2009 		    Posts: 21463       Posted: Tue Jan 25, 2022 1:18 pm            My biggest complaints so far are that the lead character is a tedious mope, the visual look is often quite dreamlike which has a distancing effect on my emotional engagement and the story is relentlessly joyless.

It feels like the production team doesn't really want to work on this- I'm not seeing the passion in this project. Or maybe I'm just spoiled rotten after marathoning Mob Psycho 100. It's too bad...      Back to top                  AQuin1904    Joined: 13 Nov 2021 		    Posts: 22       Posted: Tue Jan 25, 2022 3:29 pm            The biggest surprise for me was realizing just how much Shakespeare there is in Rose King. York and Margaret, in particular have a lot of their speeches intact (although some of York's lines are shifted to Warwick to make him more of an instigator, and Margaret gets lines from several other Lancastrian commanders). Henry's shepherd and sundial lines in episode 1 comes from a later scene, while the insults Richard trades with Prince Edward come from the end of 2 Henry VI. Edward has a lot of lines paraphrased in episode 3 as well. I think it's particularly interesting how his interpretation of the sun omen is undercut because he now delivers it while using brotherly bonds as cover for his affair. It's hard not to read that as a comment on his priorities.   As far as the adaptation goes, I like a lot of the more painterly backgrounds and even some of the still shots. What really bother me is all the faceless people. The blank ""extras,"" especially the CGI ones, are distracting and take away the brief moments of humanizing common soldiers that you get in the manga's battle scenes. It's even less excusable how often named characters just don't have their facial features drawn, sometimes even while they speak. Also not a fan of the CGI banners. The color pallet works well for some things, but I worry how the dark tones will work for some later sequences from the manga. They also tend to make everything a little washed out, which is disappointing because the manga makes great use of harsh contrast.     Quote:    the Neville sisters' ages appear to have been reversed. In real life, Anne was the younger sister of Isabel, but here Isabel can be heard addressing Anne as if she were the elder sibling.           Iirc, their ages are mixed up in 3 Henry VI, although Anne is correctly identified as the younger sister in Richard III. I'm guessing Kanno decided to follow the earlier play, although she depicts the Plantagenet boys' ages more accurately than Shakespeare (apart from cutting out Edmund, who Shakespeare made the youngest, and their two sisters who survived to adulthood).

That's right, I forgot that one's on Shakespeare. I was disappointed that Kanno chose to cut the Plantagenet sisters in the manga; removing Edmund makes a bit more sense in terms of her portrayal of Richard as the unloved youngest child, but I feel like she could have done some interesting things with the sisters. Oh well, at least we get Jane Shore.

So I thought I'd watch the anime and see if it inspires me to keep buying, but... Sounds like the anime is not a great adaptation and not a good thing to base my decision off of.  I already felt the first volume was a bit rushed (I had a little trouble following it but then I'm not a history buff for this era nor a Shakespeare fan), but if the anime is rushing it even more, I can only imagine how hard it is for people to follow and get invested in the series.   I guess I'll ponder on it and check out the reviews to see if the show improves at all.

I like the story so far, but I felt like too much happened in the first two episodes, so I checked out the beginning of the source material, and it turns out the show has already covered 1 and a half manga volume. I guess it means they intend to adapt all 17 volumes in just two cours. Well, at least it means the show will have a definite ending.

The use of color and pattern is what's making me think it's deliberate.            If the terrible animation and painfully lackluster visuals in general are intentional, then it's all the worse, to be honest. If you look at the manga it has strong contrasts even on color illustrations, and all-around striking and dramatic visuals, in the good old dramatic shoujo manga way. Compared to that, the anime looks like it was made on a shoestring budget by someone who had no creative vision whatsoever, no ideas what to do with this adaptation other than adding some ""dark colors"" to the manga panels, because hey it's a dark story, and then slapping it on the screen. Which I think is actually the case.    If I had my way shoujo manga like this would never be adapted unless it was in the hands of someone who can prove they can re-create the drama and dynamics on screen.

York and Margaret, in particular have a lot of their speeches intact (although some of York's lines are shifted to Warwick to make him more of an instigator, and Margaret gets lines from several other Lancastrian commanders). Henry's shepherd and sundial lines in episode 1 comes from a later scene, while the insults Richard trades with Prince Edward come from the end of 2 Henry VI. Edward has a lot of lines paraphrased in episode 3 as well. I think it's particularly interesting how his interpretation of the sun omen is undercut because he now delivers it while using brotherly bonds as cover for his affair. It's hard not to read that as a comment on his priorities.   As far as the adaptation goes, I like a lot of the more painterly backgrounds and even some of the still shots. What really bother me is all the faceless people. The blank ""extras,"" especially the CGI ones, are distracting and take away the brief moments of humanizing common soldiers that you get in the manga's battle scenes. It's even less excusable how often named characters just don't have their facial features drawn, sometimes even while they speak. Also not a fan of the CGI banners. The color pallet works well for some things, but I worry how the dark tones will work for some later sequences from the manga. They also tend to make everything a little washed out, which is disappointing because the manga makes great use of harsh contrast.     Quote:    the Neville sisters' ages appear to have been reversed. In real life, Anne was the younger sister of Isabel, but here Isabel can be heard addressing Anne as if she were the elder sibling.           Iirc, their ages are mixed up in 3 Henry VI, although Anne is correctly identified as the younger sister in Richard III. I'm guessing Kanno decided to follow the earlier play, although she depicts the Plantagenet boys' ages more accurately than Shakespeare (apart from cutting out Edmund, who Shakespeare made the youngest, and their two sisters who survived to adulthood).

That's right, I forgot that one's on Shakespeare. I was disappointed that Kanno chose to cut the Plantagenet sisters in the manga; removing Edmund makes a bit more sense in terms of her portrayal of Richard as the unloved youngest child, but I feel like she could have done some interesting things with the sisters. Oh well, at least we get Jane Shore.

So I thought I'd watch the anime and see if it inspires me to keep buying, but... Sounds like the anime is not a great adaptation and not a good thing to base my decision off of.  I already felt the first volume was a bit rushed (I had a little trouble following it but then I'm not a history buff for this era nor a Shakespeare fan), but if the anime is rushing it even more, I can only imagine how hard it is for people to follow and get invested in the series.   I guess I'll ponder on it and check out the reviews to see if the show improves at all.

The use of color and pattern is what's making me think it's deliberate.            If the terrible animation and painfully lackluster visuals in general are intentional, then it's all the worse, to be honest. If you look at the manga it has strong contrasts even on color illustrations, and all-around striking and dramatic visuals, in the good old dramatic shoujo manga way. Compared to that, the anime looks like it was made on a shoestring budget by someone who had no creative vision whatsoever, no ideas what to do with this adaptation other than adding some ""dark colors"" to the manga panels, because hey it's a dark story, and then slapping it on the screen. Which I think is actually the case.    If I had my way shoujo manga like this would never be adapted unless it was in the hands of someone who can prove they can re-create the drama and dynamics on screen.     Princess_Irene wrote:     Zhou-BR, I think that's a real possibility, given the pacing of these episodes. I'm still hoping they slow down a bit once they're more into the Richard III storyline.           Honestly, I wouldn't hope for that. As someone who had been reading this manga from the day the first chapter was published in Princess, the Henry VI arc is the best part of it all, and I think the anime is doing it an unforgivable injustice. Without any spoilers I was really, really disappointed in the (frankly, unexpected) turn it did shortly after reaching Richard III territory.

By Paige Villacin Published 22 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   Despite being such a popular genre, why do so few magical girl anime break into the mainstream of the western market?                  The Magical Girl genre has long since become one of many staples associated with anime -- so much so that it's frequently parodied not just by other anime, but by western cartoons as well. Despite this, very few magical girl series have actually broken through the mainstream. It certainly isn’t because the industry has been producing less magical girl anime, but rather, western publishers seem to be averse to localizing most of them.  This is a problem that’s perpetuated not just in anime, but the animation industry as a whole for many years. Shows with a male demographic will almost always receive preference over those targeted at girls. The few that are made with a female demographic in mind tend to go out of their way to appeal to a male audience as well, such as changing the title to give less focus on the female protagonist (ie: changing Miraculous Ladybug to The Adventures of Miraculous Ladybug and Cat Noir) or elevating a male character to a secondary protagonist position. RELATED: From Arina Tanemura to Clamp: Influential Shojo Artists of the Early 2000s                  One of the best-known anime that takes the above practice to heart is Cardcaptor Sakura. When it was first released in English in the west, its title was changed to Cardcaptors. This rename accomplished two things: it put less focus on the female protagonist, and it gave more importance to a male character. In the original series, Sakura is the only character to ever receive the title of “Cardcaptor”. In Nelvana’s English dub, it isn’t just Sakura who receives this title, but Syaoran (renamed Lee in the dub) as well. Lee is also elevated from supporting character to co-protagonist status, again to appeal to the male demographic. His romance with Sakura is completely scrapped, and any episodes that focused on the series' more slice-of-life aspects were completely removed in favor of more action-based storylines. In short, Nelvana repackaged this classic shoujo anime into a shounen series with a female lead.  Every few years, popular children’s anime geared toward boys will receive a new iteration featuring an entirely new cast. Digimon, Yu-Gi-Oh and Beyblade are some of the more popular ones that come to mind. Many of these have made their way to broadcast networks in the west -- in fact, the latest iteration of Beyblade is currently airing on Disney XD. The same treatment has been given to many popular children’s anime aimed at girls as well, ranging from magical girl anime to idol anime. However, most of these long-running franchises have never made their way to western television sets.  RELATED: Sailor Moon Knight Fan Art Is the Ultimate Lunar Hero Crossover                 It would be understandable if such programs were not successful, but many of these have proved popular enough to continue running for several decades. One prime example is Pretty Cure, a long-running magical girl anime that has been around for over 20 years. It’s one of Toei Animation’s most popular properties, rivaling even Sailor Moon in terms of cultural impact in its home country. Despite its massive success, only two of the series within this storied franchise have ever been picked up for English localization.  The original series, Futari Wa Pretty Cure, was picked up by several companies including Funimation, 4Kids and YTV. Only YTV has ever broadcast the show on television, but because it is a Canadian broadcasting channel, this means Futari Wa Pretty Cure was never shown in the US. It is, however, still available for streaming on Prime Video and Hulu. Doki Doki Pretty Cure was picked up by Hasbro and dubbed by Bang Zoom! Entertainment. It was renamed to the slightly more aggressive Glitter Force and is currently available for streaming on Netflix. Like most children’s anime from the early 2000s, the story was heavily cut and edited to remove any explicit references to Japanese culture as well as material deemed too “mature” for its target audience, such as references to death. As of this writing, this was the last Pretty Cure anime to be officially dubbed in English. While Crunchyroll has started streaming the newer entries in the franchise, no other companies have made any attempts to dub or market it to the western audience.  RELATED: Lady Gaga, Crunchyroll Team Up for New Apparel Collection                 While shoujo anime have not had as much trouble finding an audience in the west, one would be hard-pressed to find such shows airing on network television. Toonami has aired a few female-led shows in the past, but none were explicitly made with a female audience in mind. After the success of Sailor Moon, 4Kids made a few attempts to tap into the magical girl market by picking up Tokyo Mew Mew, or Mew Mew Power as it’s known in the west. It found some level of success, but not nearly to the same degree as Sailor Moon. A further attempt was made with yet another Toei Animation property, Ojamajo Doremi, which predictably received a new westernized name: Magical Doremi. It proved even less successful and suffered from consistently low ratings. 4Kids never finished airing the entire series, with the last 25 episodes going straight to the network’s website instead. 4Kids also gained the rights to Futari Wa Pretty Cure, but it never released any episodes before the series was eventually picked up by another distributor.  RELATED: A Decade After Sailor Moon Debuted, Its Director Created a Far Less Popular Sports Anime                 The failure of such anime can be attributed to a number of things -- none of which can be faulted to the shows themselves, but rather, mismanagement on the part of the companies distributing them. Magical Doremi aired at 7:30 am, too early in the morning for most kids to want to tune in on a Saturday. Cardcaptors received heavy backlash from fans of the original source material. When Pioneer gained the rights to distribute the original series on home video -- completely unedited and uncut in the original Japanese dub -- the sub-only DVDs outsold the dub-only DVDs by more than 10,000 units. Likewise, many long-time Pretty Cure fans responded negatively to Hasbro’s decisions to edit and westernize the English dub for Glitter Force -- a practice that in this day and age is no longer considered acceptable. Even the English dubs for the likes of Beyblade keep the original Japanese names and references intact.  It truly is a shame that more companies aren’t willing to put more time and interest in anime aimed at young girls. If they would simply put the same amount of effort into marketing such shows the way they do with Bakugan or Pokémon, there’s definite success to be had. There’s a plethora of magical girl and shoujo anime that will never be exported as a result. For now, magical girl aficionados will have to be content with streaming the latest iteration of Pretty Cure subbed.                  What Makes Tokyo Mew Mew So Special?
