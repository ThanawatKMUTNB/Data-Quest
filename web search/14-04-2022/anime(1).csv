14-04-2022,anime,5,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/preview-guide/2022/spring/thermae-romae-novae/.183660,Thermae Romae Novae - The Spring 2022 Preview Guide - Anime News Network:SEA,"    The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Thermae Romae Novae   Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Thermae Romae Novae (ONA) ?                     Community score: 3.1              What is this?   In Hadrian Rome, Lucius was a Roman architect whose designs often got rejected by builders. To cheer him up a friend of his invited him to relax at a thermae (public bath). Inside the bath Lucius was accidentally trapped in an underwater hole by suction; when he finally managed to emerge on the surface he found himself in a very different bath: in 20th century Japan.    Thermae Romae Novae is based on Mari Yamazaki's manga and is currently streaming on Netflix.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                One of the things that comes with having major ADHD is learning how to manage constantly shifting hyperfixations, which is to say that I can totally understand how something like Thermae Romae Novae could come into existence. I've spent a frankly embarrassing amount of hours obsessing over kaiju movies, tokusatsu shows, Gunpla models, and The Muppets (and that's just the stuff I've gotten into over the last five years or so), so I'm not all surprised to learn that there exists at least one person in the world whose love for ancient history, architecture, and public bathhouses intersected with such ferocity that an entire multi-media franchise was born.    Here's my main issue with Thermae Romae Novae: While I'm certainly always down to dig into some history and culture lessons, I myself don't particularly care about architecture, and I've never even stepped foot inside of a public bathhouse. Our main character, Lucius, has precisely two personality traits: He freaking loves architecture, and his dream in life is to—and I quote—“Build bathhouses that make everyone smile!” Even when you include the series' novel time-travel angle (which doesn't really impact the first episode of the show at all), the core of Thermae Romae Novae's appeal lies in its unapologetic obsession with bathhouse cultures past and present.    What that means is that, outside of the very specific niche appeal of the bathhouses themselves, I'm not finding much else to latch onto with this story. The historical drama isn't well-written enough to hold up on its own, and there's not much humor to be found outside of that. In short, while the material here is perfectly fine for an educational documentary, I'm not sure it makes for the kind of anime that I want to sit down and watch on a regular basis.    Heck, the anime actually comes with live-action documentary segments that close out its episodes, and I find those much more compelling than the rest of the show that they're attached to. The segments that follow author Mari Yamazaki's quest to “rediscover Japanese bathhouse culture” are genuinely interesting and feature some lovely footage of real-world bathhouse settings, and the anime's relatively drab and uninspired visuals simply don't hold up in comparison. It doesn't help that, in all of the scenes set inside the thermae themselves (of which there are many), the show slaps this hideous and cheap looking steam filter on top of the screen.    I've heard that Thermae Romae has a sizeable fan-base, so it's quite possible that future episodes of the show would give me more of a reason to stick around and get invested in the bathhouse mania of it all. As it stands, though, I don't think Thermae Romae Novae is for me; at the very least, if I ever do come back to the show, I can easily imagine skipping all of the anime parts to get to the documentary bits. That's apparently where the real bathhouse action is at.        Caitlin Moore  Rating:               The manga of Thermae Romae is a critically-acclaimed award winner. The first anime adaptation was a low-budget short that developed a cult following for its quirky humor. The new series that just premiered on Netflix, Thermae Romae Novae, has a TV run's worth of full-length episodes, complete with attempts at pathos and backstory, and has the same director as the critically-panned Africa Salaryman. It is also boring.    For a series with a concept as weird as “Roman architect time travels through a portal in a bath for inspiration,” you really don't need to put a lot of effort into building up character motivation. Yet for some reason, they felt the need to give Lucius a reason to really love baths and a tragic childhood involving a dead father and bullies. Can't he just be a dude who loves soaking in hot water and designing new ways to do it? The first episode has no jokes and just feels long, drawn-out, and pointless.    Yet somehow, that's not the most baffling decision the anime staff made. You see, the people in togas and marble buildings with columns aren't enough to make us realize this shit all happened a long time ago. We couldn't possibly manage to figure that out on our own. The distant past was all sepia-toned, right? They didn't invent bright colors until the '50s! Everything up until then was muddy and dim. Unfortunately, the half-assed color design, along with the pen-and-ink style shading, makes it look like everything has been rubbed with dirt. In a series about bathing and cleanliness. It's silly.    Maybe Thermae Romae Novae picks up after this. I hear it has Kenjiro Tsuda yelling in Latin, so that's something.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                It's funny, Thermae Romae is so mainstream here in Japan that despite never having read a page of the manga nor having seen the live-action film, I already knew the basic setup through cultural osmosis alone—which is why watching this threw me for a bit of a loop. What I was expecting was a time-traveling Roman being awed by some facet of Japanese hot spring culture over and over again. And while that may be what the series turns into, this first episode was most certainly not.    Rather, this episode gives us the backstory for our series' protagonist Lucius, showing why he became a bathhouse architect and where his philosophy on bathing came from. But more than that, this episode is about how blue-collar workers find importance and pride in their daily toil. For a mason, it's knowing that their work will record the past and inspire the future. For Lucius' father and grandfather, it's about creating a place where people can be purged of stress and be ready to face a new day. In other words, they may be cogs in Roman society, but they know that they are vital to its functioning.    It makes for a solid setup to the series, even if it's ultimately not representative of the rest of the show. It's just a shame that the animation doesn't really hold up. In wide shots there is a noticeable drop in detail and in scenes with any kind of quick movement, it looks choppy to say the least.

Community score: 3.1              What is this?   In Hadrian Rome, Lucius was a Roman architect whose designs often got rejected by builders. To cheer him up a friend of his invited him to relax at a thermae (public bath). Inside the bath Lucius was accidentally trapped in an underwater hole by suction; when he finally managed to emerge on the surface he found himself in a very different bath: in 20th century Japan.    Thermae Romae Novae is based on Mari Yamazaki's manga and is currently streaming on Netflix.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                One of the things that comes with having major ADHD is learning how to manage constantly shifting hyperfixations, which is to say that I can totally understand how something like Thermae Romae Novae could come into existence. I've spent a frankly embarrassing amount of hours obsessing over kaiju movies, tokusatsu shows, Gunpla models, and The Muppets (and that's just the stuff I've gotten into over the last five years or so), so I'm not all surprised to learn that there exists at least one person in the world whose love for ancient history, architecture, and public bathhouses intersected with such ferocity that an entire multi-media franchise was born.    Here's my main issue with Thermae Romae Novae: While I'm certainly always down to dig into some history and culture lessons, I myself don't particularly care about architecture, and I've never even stepped foot inside of a public bathhouse. Our main character, Lucius, has precisely two personality traits: He freaking loves architecture, and his dream in life is to—and I quote—“Build bathhouses that make everyone smile!” Even when you include the series' novel time-travel angle (which doesn't really impact the first episode of the show at all), the core of Thermae Romae Novae's appeal lies in its unapologetic obsession with bathhouse cultures past and present.    What that means is that, outside of the very specific niche appeal of the bathhouses themselves, I'm not finding much else to latch onto with this story. The historical drama isn't well-written enough to hold up on its own, and there's not much humor to be found outside of that. In short, while the material here is perfectly fine for an educational documentary, I'm not sure it makes for the kind of anime that I want to sit down and watch on a regular basis.    Heck, the anime actually comes with live-action documentary segments that close out its episodes, and I find those much more compelling than the rest of the show that they're attached to. The segments that follow author Mari Yamazaki's quest to “rediscover Japanese bathhouse culture” are genuinely interesting and feature some lovely footage of real-world bathhouse settings, and the anime's relatively drab and uninspired visuals simply don't hold up in comparison. It doesn't help that, in all of the scenes set inside the thermae themselves (of which there are many), the show slaps this hideous and cheap looking steam filter on top of the screen.    I've heard that Thermae Romae has a sizeable fan-base, so it's quite possible that future episodes of the show would give me more of a reason to stick around and get invested in the bathhouse mania of it all. As it stands, though, I don't think Thermae Romae Novae is for me; at the very least, if I ever do come back to the show, I can easily imagine skipping all of the anime parts to get to the documentary bits. That's apparently where the real bathhouse action is at.        Caitlin Moore  Rating:               The manga of Thermae Romae is a critically-acclaimed award winner. The first anime adaptation was a low-budget short that developed a cult following for its quirky humor. The new series that just premiered on Netflix, Thermae Romae Novae, has a TV run's worth of full-length episodes, complete with attempts at pathos and backstory, and has the same director as the critically-panned Africa Salaryman. It is also boring.    For a series with a concept as weird as “Roman architect time travels through a portal in a bath for inspiration,” you really don't need to put a lot of effort into building up character motivation. Yet for some reason, they felt the need to give Lucius a reason to really love baths and a tragic childhood involving a dead father and bullies. Can't he just be a dude who loves soaking in hot water and designing new ways to do it? The first episode has no jokes and just feels long, drawn-out, and pointless.    Yet somehow, that's not the most baffling decision the anime staff made. You see, the people in togas and marble buildings with columns aren't enough to make us realize this shit all happened a long time ago. We couldn't possibly manage to figure that out on our own. The distant past was all sepia-toned, right? They didn't invent bright colors until the '50s! Everything up until then was muddy and dim. Unfortunately, the half-assed color design, along with the pen-and-ink style shading, makes it look like everything has been rubbed with dirt. In a series about bathing and cleanliness. It's silly.    Maybe Thermae Romae Novae picks up after this. I hear it has Kenjiro Tsuda yelling in Latin, so that's something.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                It's funny, Thermae Romae is so mainstream here in Japan that despite never having read a page of the manga nor having seen the live-action film, I already knew the basic setup through cultural osmosis alone—which is why watching this threw me for a bit of a loop. What I was expecting was a time-traveling Roman being awed by some facet of Japanese hot spring culture over and over again. And while that may be what the series turns into, this first episode was most certainly not.    Rather, this episode gives us the backstory for our series' protagonist Lucius, showing why he became a bathhouse architect and where his philosophy on bathing came from. But more than that, this episode is about how blue-collar workers find importance and pride in their daily toil. For a mason, it's knowing that their work will record the past and inspire the future. For Lucius' father and grandfather, it's about creating a place where people can be purged of stress and be ready to face a new day. In other words, they may be cogs in Roman society, but they know that they are vital to its functioning.    It makes for a solid setup to the series, even if it's ultimately not representative of the rest of the show. It's just a shame that the animation doesn't really hold up. In wide shots there is a noticeable drop in detail and in scenes with any kind of quick movement, it looks choppy to say the least.

14-04-2022,anime,5,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/preview-guide/2022/spring/thermae-romae-novae/.183660,Thermae Romae Novae - The Spring 2022 Preview Guide - Anime News Network:SEA,"            How would you rate episode 1 of Thermae Romae Novae (ONA) ?                     Community score: 3.1              What is this?   In Hadrian Rome, Lucius was a Roman architect whose designs often got rejected by builders. To cheer him up a friend of his invited him to relax at a thermae (public bath). Inside the bath Lucius was accidentally trapped in an underwater hole by suction; when he finally managed to emerge on the surface he found himself in a very different bath: in 20th century Japan.    Thermae Romae Novae is based on Mari Yamazaki's manga and is currently streaming on Netflix.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                One of the things that comes with having major ADHD is learning how to manage constantly shifting hyperfixations, which is to say that I can totally understand how something like Thermae Romae Novae could come into existence. I've spent a frankly embarrassing amount of hours obsessing over kaiju movies, tokusatsu shows, Gunpla models, and The Muppets (and that's just the stuff I've gotten into over the last five years or so), so I'm not all surprised to learn that there exists at least one person in the world whose love for ancient history, architecture, and public bathhouses intersected with such ferocity that an entire multi-media franchise was born.    Here's my main issue with Thermae Romae Novae: While I'm certainly always down to dig into some history and culture lessons, I myself don't particularly care about architecture, and I've never even stepped foot inside of a public bathhouse. Our main character, Lucius, has precisely two personality traits: He freaking loves architecture, and his dream in life is to—and I quote—“Build bathhouses that make everyone smile!” Even when you include the series' novel time-travel angle (which doesn't really impact the first episode of the show at all), the core of Thermae Romae Novae's appeal lies in its unapologetic obsession with bathhouse cultures past and present.    What that means is that, outside of the very specific niche appeal of the bathhouses themselves, I'm not finding much else to latch onto with this story. The historical drama isn't well-written enough to hold up on its own, and there's not much humor to be found outside of that. In short, while the material here is perfectly fine for an educational documentary, I'm not sure it makes for the kind of anime that I want to sit down and watch on a regular basis.    Heck, the anime actually comes with live-action documentary segments that close out its episodes, and I find those much more compelling than the rest of the show that they're attached to. The segments that follow author Mari Yamazaki's quest to “rediscover Japanese bathhouse culture” are genuinely interesting and feature some lovely footage of real-world bathhouse settings, and the anime's relatively drab and uninspired visuals simply don't hold up in comparison. It doesn't help that, in all of the scenes set inside the thermae themselves (of which there are many), the show slaps this hideous and cheap looking steam filter on top of the screen.    I've heard that Thermae Romae has a sizeable fan-base, so it's quite possible that future episodes of the show would give me more of a reason to stick around and get invested in the bathhouse mania of it all. As it stands, though, I don't think Thermae Romae Novae is for me; at the very least, if I ever do come back to the show, I can easily imagine skipping all of the anime parts to get to the documentary bits. That's apparently where the real bathhouse action is at.        Caitlin Moore  Rating:               The manga of Thermae Romae is a critically-acclaimed award winner. The first anime adaptation was a low-budget short that developed a cult following for its quirky humor. The new series that just premiered on Netflix, Thermae Romae Novae, has a TV run's worth of full-length episodes, complete with attempts at pathos and backstory, and has the same director as the critically-panned Africa Salaryman. It is also boring.    For a series with a concept as weird as “Roman architect time travels through a portal in a bath for inspiration,” you really don't need to put a lot of effort into building up character motivation. Yet for some reason, they felt the need to give Lucius a reason to really love baths and a tragic childhood involving a dead father and bullies. Can't he just be a dude who loves soaking in hot water and designing new ways to do it? The first episode has no jokes and just feels long, drawn-out, and pointless.    Yet somehow, that's not the most baffling decision the anime staff made. You see, the people in togas and marble buildings with columns aren't enough to make us realize this shit all happened a long time ago. We couldn't possibly manage to figure that out on our own. The distant past was all sepia-toned, right? They didn't invent bright colors until the '50s! Everything up until then was muddy and dim. Unfortunately, the half-assed color design, along with the pen-and-ink style shading, makes it look like everything has been rubbed with dirt. In a series about bathing and cleanliness. It's silly.    Maybe Thermae Romae Novae picks up after this. I hear it has Kenjiro Tsuda yelling in Latin, so that's something.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                It's funny, Thermae Romae is so mainstream here in Japan that despite never having read a page of the manga nor having seen the live-action film, I already knew the basic setup through cultural osmosis alone—which is why watching this threw me for a bit of a loop. What I was expecting was a time-traveling Roman being awed by some facet of Japanese hot spring culture over and over again. And while that may be what the series turns into, this first episode was most certainly not.    Rather, this episode gives us the backstory for our series' protagonist Lucius, showing why he became a bathhouse architect and where his philosophy on bathing came from. But more than that, this episode is about how blue-collar workers find importance and pride in their daily toil. For a mason, it's knowing that their work will record the past and inspire the future. For Lucius' father and grandfather, it's about creating a place where people can be purged of stress and be ready to face a new day. In other words, they may be cogs in Roman society, but they know that they are vital to its functioning.    It makes for a solid setup to the series, even if it's ultimately not representative of the rest of the show. It's just a shame that the animation doesn't really hold up. In wide shots there is a noticeable drop in detail and in scenes with any kind of quick movement, it looks choppy to say the least. And the live-action ending with the author of the manga is pretty much Japanese TV in a nutshell—i.e., a person traveling around Japan talking about how cool some aspect of Japanese culture (usually food) really is.    All in all, I don't know if it's my cup of tea but it certainly wasn't bad.

I like the story so far, but I felt like too much happened in the first two episodes, so I checked out the beginning of the source material, and it turns out the show has already covered 1 and a half manga volume. I guess it means they intend to adapt all 17 volumes in just two cours. Well, at least it means the show will have a definite ending.

The use of color and pattern is what's making me think it's deliberate.            If the terrible animation and painfully lackluster visuals in general are intentional, then it's all the worse, to be honest. If you look at the manga it has strong contrasts even on color illustrations, and all-around striking and dramatic visuals, in the good old dramatic shoujo manga way. Compared to that, the anime looks like it was made on a shoestring budget by someone who had no creative vision whatsoever, no ideas what to do with this adaptation other than adding some ""dark colors"" to the manga panels, because hey it's a dark story, and then slapping it on the screen. Which I think is actually the case.    If I had my way shoujo manga like this would never be adapted unless it was in the hands of someone who can prove they can re-create the drama and dynamics on screen.

York and Margaret, in particular have a lot of their speeches intact (although some of York's lines are shifted to Warwick to make him more of an instigator, and Margaret gets lines from several other Lancastrian commanders). Henry's shepherd and sundial lines in episode 1 comes from a later scene, while the insults Richard trades with Prince Edward come from the end of 2 Henry VI. Edward has a lot of lines paraphrased in episode 3 as well. I think it's particularly interesting how his interpretation of the sun omen is undercut because he now delivers it while using brotherly bonds as cover for his affair. It's hard not to read that as a comment on his priorities.   As far as the adaptation goes, I like a lot of the more painterly backgrounds and even some of the still shots. What really bother me is all the faceless people. The blank ""extras,"" especially the CGI ones, are distracting and take away the brief moments of humanizing common soldiers that you get in the manga's battle scenes. It's even less excusable how often named characters just don't have their facial features drawn, sometimes even while they speak. Also not a fan of the CGI banners. The color pallet works well for some things, but I worry how the dark tones will work for some later sequences from the manga. They also tend to make everything a little washed out, which is disappointing because the manga makes great use of harsh contrast.     Quote:    the Neville sisters' ages appear to have been reversed. In real life, Anne was the younger sister of Isabel, but here Isabel can be heard addressing Anne as if she were the elder sibling.           Iirc, their ages are mixed up in 3 Henry VI, although Anne is correctly identified as the younger sister in Richard III. I'm guessing Kanno decided to follow the earlier play, although she depicts the Plantagenet boys' ages more accurately than Shakespeare (apart from cutting out Edmund, who Shakespeare made the youngest, and their two sisters who survived to adulthood).

That's right, I forgot that one's on Shakespeare. I was disappointed that Kanno chose to cut the Plantagenet sisters in the manga; removing Edmund makes a bit more sense in terms of her portrayal of Richard as the unloved youngest child, but I feel like she could have done some interesting things with the sisters. Oh well, at least we get Jane Shore.

So I thought I'd watch the anime and see if it inspires me to keep buying, but... Sounds like the anime is not a great adaptation and not a good thing to base my decision off of.  I already felt the first volume was a bit rushed (I had a little trouble following it but then I'm not a history buff for this era nor a Shakespeare fan), but if the anime is rushing it even more, I can only imagine how hard it is for people to follow and get invested in the series.   I guess I'll ponder on it and check out the reviews to see if the show improves at all.

That's right, I forgot that one's on Shakespeare. I was disappointed that Kanno chose to cut the Plantagenet sisters in the manga; removing Edmund makes a bit more sense in terms of her portrayal of Richard as the unloved youngest child, but I feel like she could have done some interesting things with the sisters. Oh well, at least we get Jane Shore.

So I thought I'd watch the anime and see if it inspires me to keep buying, but... Sounds like the anime is not a great adaptation and not a good thing to base my decision off of.  I already felt the first volume was a bit rushed (I had a little trouble following it but then I'm not a history buff for this era nor a Shakespeare fan), but if the anime is rushing it even more, I can only imagine how hard it is for people to follow and get invested in the series.   I guess I'll ponder on it and check out the reviews to see if the show improves at all.

The use of color and pattern is what's making me think it's deliberate.            If the terrible animation and painfully lackluster visuals in general are intentional, then it's all the worse, to be honest. If you look at the manga it has strong contrasts even on color illustrations, and all-around striking and dramatic visuals, in the good old dramatic shoujo manga way. Compared to that, the anime looks like it was made on a shoestring budget by someone who had no creative vision whatsoever, no ideas what to do with this adaptation other than adding some ""dark colors"" to the manga panels, because hey it's a dark story, and then slapping it on the screen. Which I think is actually the case.    If I had my way shoujo manga like this would never be adapted unless it was in the hands of someone who can prove they can re-create the drama and dynamics on screen.

York and Margaret, in particular have a lot of their speeches intact (although some of York's lines are shifted to Warwick to make him more of an instigator, and Margaret gets lines from several other Lancastrian commanders). Henry's shepherd and sundial lines in episode 1 comes from a later scene, while the insults Richard trades with Prince Edward come from the end of 2 Henry VI. Edward has a lot of lines paraphrased in episode 3 as well. I think it's particularly interesting how his interpretation of the sun omen is undercut because he now delivers it while using brotherly bonds as cover for his affair. It's hard not to read that as a comment on his priorities.   As far as the adaptation goes, I like a lot of the more painterly backgrounds and even some of the still shots. What really bother me is all the faceless people. The blank ""extras,"" especially the CGI ones, are distracting and take away the brief moments of humanizing common soldiers that you get in the manga's battle scenes. It's even less excusable how often named characters just don't have their facial features drawn, sometimes even while they speak. Also not a fan of the CGI banners. The color pallet works well for some things, but I worry how the dark tones will work for some later sequences from the manga. They also tend to make everything a little washed out, which is disappointing because the manga makes great use of harsh contrast.     Quote:    the Neville sisters' ages appear to have been reversed. In real life, Anne was the younger sister of Isabel, but here Isabel can be heard addressing Anne as if she were the elder sibling.

That's right, I forgot that one's on Shakespeare. I was disappointed that Kanno chose to cut the Plantagenet sisters in the manga; removing Edmund makes a bit more sense in terms of her portrayal of Richard as the unloved youngest child, but I feel like she could have done some interesting things with the sisters. Oh well, at least we get Jane Shore.

I already felt the first volume was a bit rushed (I had a little trouble following it but then I'm not a history buff for this era nor a Shakespeare fan), but if the anime is rushing it even more, I can only imagine how hard it is for people to follow and get invested in the series.   I guess I'll ponder on it and check out the reviews to see if the show improves at all.

The use of color and pattern is what's making me think it's deliberate.            If the terrible animation and painfully lackluster visuals in general are intentional, then it's all the worse, to be honest. If you look at the manga it has strong contrasts even on color illustrations, and all-around striking and dramatic visuals, in the good old dramatic shoujo manga way. Compared to that, the anime looks like it was made on a shoestring budget by someone who had no creative vision whatsoever, no ideas what to do with this adaptation other than adding some ""dark colors"" to the manga panels, because hey it's a dark story, and then slapping it on the screen. Which I think is actually the case.    If I had my way shoujo manga like this would never be adapted unless it was in the hands of someone who can prove they can re-create the drama and dynamics on screen.     Princess_Irene wrote:     Zhou-BR, I think that's a real possibility, given the pacing of these episodes. I'm still hoping they slow down a bit once they're more into the Richard III storyline.           Honestly, I wouldn't hope for that. As someone who had been reading this manga from the day the first chapter was published in Princess, the Henry VI arc is the best part of it all, and I think the anime is doing it an unforgivable injustice. Without any spoilers I was really, really disappointed in the (frankly, unexpected) turn it did shortly after reaching Richard III territory.

Since Ling Yao's character is quite younger there is potential for Watanabe to stand out. Scar being played by Mackenyu helps a lot since such actor played Enishi in Final and was probably the closest actor to his prime during recording.

Edward doesn't look like a teen anymore especially with that height while Armstrong and Scar obviously can't keep the same built kinda like how Liu Kang's actor had to wear a shirt in the second Mortal Kombat movie. At least, the two versions of Ling Yao seem to wear proper clothing and keep a fitting hair. Still, are they trimming the entire manga in only three movies?

Similarly, Kenshin's actor, Satoh, managed to do all of his actors in the five films but reached his limits in the Final and Beginning as a result of his age. Since Ling Yao's character is quite younger there is potential for Watanabe to stand out.

Founded in 1998, Anime News Network is the world's leading source of up to date news and information on the anime and manga industries. Regular readers of Anime News Network not only include hundreds of thousands of anime fans, but also all of the industry heavy weights. The past several years have witnessed an attrition of English anime news sites on the Internet; as the number of sites shrink, the remaining sites only get better. Consistently growing and improving, Anime News Network is here to stay. The key benefit in advertising on Anime News Network is that our readership fits a particular demographic; mature anime fans. The majority of visitors to Anime News Network are between the ages of 18 and 24 and, needless to say, they're all anime fans, but also have a healthy appetite for other forms of animation, video games, and many other related interests. As long as you are interested in reaching anime fans that make their own purchasing decisions, Anime News Network is the ideal place for you to advertise. Please contact us at [email protected] (advertising at animenewsnetwork.com) for more information regarding advertising opportunities. Self-Serve ANN's minimum buy is $3000, but if your budget is lower than $3000 you can now buy ads directly from our self-serve advertising system. The minimum buy is only $10.   The self serve system is also great for people who know what they want and don't want to waste time.   What are you waiting for? Buy ads right here, right now.  Want to Trade? With the exception of anime conventions and charities, ANN does not trade advertising.  Convention Trades The convention trades are back! We have two trade programs available.    Non Profit Anime and Manga Conventions under 30K attendance: We can trade you for 100% of your advertising on ANN. Provide ANN with up to $5,000 of advertising in your program guide or on site, and we will provide you an equal value on ANN.  Other Anime, manga and geek culture conventions: We provide a 50% trade with no max value. You can pay for half the value of your advertisements on ANN with advertisements in your program guide or on-site. EG: If you give us $5,000 of ads at the convention, you only have to pay us $5,000 for $10,000 worth of advertising on ANN.  For Networks We are not looking for any advertising networks at this time. Agencies and rep firms are welcome to contact us, but no networks/exchanges/rtb platforms. No Bootlegs! No Pirates! Important: Don't waste our time if you sell bootleg/pirate DVDs or host unlicensed content on your website. Not only will we not allow you to advertise with us, but we'll probably report you to the appropriate authorities, licensors and/or licensees. We do not consider gray market imports of otherwise legal goods, or doujinshi, ""bootlegs,"" although we may require potential advertisers to prove that their gray market imports are legal goods.             bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Misc Page homepage / archives      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Please contact us at [email protected] (advertising at animenewsnetwork.com) for more information regarding advertising opportunities. Self-Serve ANN's minimum buy is $3000, but if your budget is lower than $3000 you can now buy ads directly from our self-serve advertising system. The minimum buy is only $10.   The self serve system is also great for people who know what they want and don't want to waste time.   What are you waiting for? Buy ads right here, right now.  Want to Trade? With the exception of anime conventions and charities, ANN does not trade advertising.  Convention Trades The convention trades are back! We have two trade programs available.    Non Profit Anime and Manga Conventions under 30K attendance: We can trade you for 100% of your advertising on ANN. Provide ANN with up to $5,000 of advertising in your program guide or on site, and we will provide you an equal value on ANN.  Other Anime, manga and geek culture conventions: We provide a 50% trade with no max value. You can pay for half the value of your advertisements on ANN with advertisements in your program guide or on-site. EG: If you give us $5,000 of ads at the convention, you only have to pay us $5,000 for $10,000 worth of advertising on ANN.  For Networks We are not looking for any advertising networks at this time. Agencies and rep firms are welcome to contact us, but no networks/exchanges/rtb platforms. No Bootlegs! No Pirates! Important: Don't waste our time if you sell bootleg/pirate DVDs or host unlicensed content on your website.

14-04-2022,anime,29,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2022-04-01/how-an-april-fools-day-joke-revived-toonami/.184015,How an April Fools Day Joke Revived Toonami - Anime News Network:SEA,"       How an April Fools Day Joke Revived Toonami   by Kennedy, Apr  1st 2022          By 2012, April Fools Day on Adult Swim had become a fun, albeit predictable, event. The nighttime programming block had fallen into the routine of airing The Room—a legendary 2003 independent film (which has been called “the Citizen Kane of bad movies”) spearheaded by cinematic Swiss army knife Tommy Wiseau. By midnight of April 1, 2012, nobody had any reason to believe that this year would be any different. The (excruciatingly long) opening credits sequence began, and for almost 30 whole seconds everything was the way it had been in the years before—until, that is, the movie faded to black for a moment, revealing that a dark blue robot was watching the movie. “Oh hi, Adult Swim,” the robot with Steve Blum's voice said, “I got the results of the test back. I definitely have April Fools.” The robot, as many anime fans instantly recognized, was TOM: the host of a beloved anime programming block called Toonami that aired on Cartoon Network between 1997 and 2008. A brief animation played after TOM made his quip, the Toonami logo appeared on-screen, and an episode of Bleach began to play. Without any warning, Toonami was airing on television for the first time in almost four years—and anime fans across the U.S. lost their collective mind.      To understand how this happened and why it was such a big deal, we first need to rewind back to the 2000s. Originally, the anime-and-action-cartoon programming block aired on weekday afternoons, but in 2004 it got moved to Saturday nights. It's hard to understate how massive a role Toonami played in anime's burst of popularity in the West throughout the 90s by shaping tastes and making anime more accessible in its heyday. Such was its success that within a few years, even Cartoon Network started airing some anime as well (the only anime it had ever aired before the debut of Toonami was Speed Racer). Furthermore, an adult-oriented nighttime programming block on the same channel called Adult Swim started up in 2001, and an anime called Cowboy Bebop was included in its original lineup. Over the years, both Cartoon Network and Adult Swim would continue to air more anime outside of Toonami (and in fact, Adult Swim even started its own anime-centric block called Adult Swim Action in 2002, which featured some anime that had previously aired on Toonami). But even then, Toonami still felt different. It had its own host (a robot named TOM, though he reincarnated a few times), its own lore, the occasional game review, and unlike Cartoon Network and Adult Swim, anime was a foremost part of Toonami's identity—it felt lovingly tailored specifically for anime fans in a way Cartoon Network and Adult Swim never would be. Dragon Ball Z, Sailor Moon, Naruto, and Gundam Wing are only a few of the anime that found massive success airing on Toonami, and dominated Western anime fan culture for several years.    But by 2008, Toonami had become a shadow of its former self. Once four-hours-long, it spent most of the year with its time cut in half and saturated with Naruto episodes—a far cry from the gateway to discovering a variety of new anime that it once was. The kids who grew up with Toonami's biggest hits like Dragon Ball Z and Sailor Moon were now older and looking for anime that felt a little more dark or mature. And while Toonami had the extremely popular Naruto, Adult Swim had the likes of InuYasha, Bleach, Fullmetal Alchemist, and Cowboy Bebop among plenty of other immensely successful anime that fit the bill—quality and quantity. While anime was never Adult Swim's primary focus, it had nonetheless become an anime powerhouse in its own right, and seemed to take over Toonami's status as the U.S.'s largest anime tastemaker in the mid and late 2000s. Factoring in the massive recession happening on top of all this, and the only thing shocking about Cartoon Network's announcing the cancellation of Toonami at Anime Weekend Atlanta 2008 (they cited declining viewership as the reason why) was how Toonami managed to last as long as it did. The final Toonami block would air the same evening the announcement was made: September 20, 2008.    Much to the disappointment of longtime fans, Toonami didn't go out with so much as a fizzle. Its time wasn't extended, it didn't re-run any of its classic hits—nothing was out of the ordinary. It was the same two-hour block it had been for some time, half of which was spent airing Naruto (the other half was an episode of Ben 10: Alien Force, followed by an episode of Samurai Jack). If not for a clip of TOM saying goodbye at the end, then that evening's block wouldn't have felt like an ending for anything—let alone a once-great programming block that managed to stay on the air for 11 years. While saddened by it, most fans discussing the announcement online seemed to be understanding of the decision, and accepted it pretty quickly. In Memoriam-style posts and content looking back fondly on Toonami's glory days and wondering where it all went wrong (when Toonami got moved to Saturday nights probably marked the beginning of the end, many agreed) seemed to outnumber petitions to undo the cancellation and outraged posts by a landslide. Thus quietly ended Toonami.      In the years following Toonami's cancellation, any lingering conversations about it amongst fans were usually less about bringing it back, and more about being nostalgic for its late 90s/early 2000s lineups. People missed Toonami, that much was clear, but they missed a certain type of Toonami. They missed the anime-centric block that was chock-loaded with a variety of iconic hits—not the glorified Naruto block it eventually became. But with Cartoon Network airing fewer and fewer anime, the idea that Toonami would ever come back seemed less likely than ever.    Enter fellow-programming block Adult Swim in the early months of 2012.    “Usually Adult Swim has a brainstorm about what we might do for April Fools Day on any given year, where everyone throws out ideas and we see what sticks,” recalled Toonami co-creator Jason DeMarco, “Mike Lazzo tossed out “what if we just brought Toonami back for a night, just switched over and it was suddenly like you were in 1999 and watching Cartoon Network?” Everyone loved the idea immediately, and the conversation very quickly moved on to “how the heck can we pull this off?””    Considering the dilapidated state of Toonami at the time of its cancellation, it comes as little shock that—per DeMarco—there hadn't been any meaningful conversations about getting it back on the air prior to this meeting. (“Previous to the April Fools conversation we had, I swear, never ONCE talked in any serious way about bringing Toonami back. We just didn't think it was possible.”) This idea to bring Toonami back for a night must've felt as sudden and out-of-the-blue as any idea possibly could've been—but this speed bump wasn't enough to stop the April Fools Toonami revival from happening.    With only a few months to plan everything, Adult Swim's work was cut out for them. “We made a list of what we thought were the definitive Toonami shows,” said DeMarco. “Then we strategized with Kim Manning, our head of programming, how best to approach distributors to see who might be willing to give us a one time license for, like, one episode of a show. We had no idea at all if any of them would work with us on such a weird request.”    Just like the original vision for this idea, the lineup Adult Swim ultimately ended up with was one that mostly felt like it could've pulled straight out of a schedule from 1999: Bleach, Dragon Ball Z, Gundam Wing, Tenchi Muyo!, Outlaw Star, The Big O, Yu-Yu Hakusho, Blue Submarine No. 6, Trigun, Astro Boy, and ending the night with Gigantor. Bleach was a particularly interesting addition to this lineup, not only because it was the only show that came out after 2000 (with the partial exceptions of The Big O and Blue Submarine No. 6, which began in late 90s but didn't finish til after the turn of the millennium), but also because it was the only show on the lineup that was an Adult Swim show, as opposed to a Toonami show. But it was, nonetheless, part of Toonami tonight. And even though Bleach wasn't traditional Toonami fare, TOM's appearance, Steve Blum's familiar voice, and the fact that any anime was airing at all was more than enough to signal to the viewers that at least for tonight, the Toonami people missed was back.     An image that started circulating at the time  As the night went on and viewers saw how increasingly nostalgic the lineup became, the reminiscent fans couldn't help but express their excitement on social media—which, importantly, also helped to rapidly spread the word that this was happening. Searching for tweets and posts with words like “Toonami” or “Dragon Ball Z” during the night of March 31-April 1, 2012 showcases the elated thoughts of countless anime fans, intent to watch Toonami until its final moments—whatever plans they had for the upcoming morning be damned. So abundant were the tweets about it that “Toonami” (and some adjacent words/phrases like “Outlaw Star”, “Gundam Wing”, etc) quickly became one of the top trending topics on Twitter that evening. Said DeMarco about the fan reactions, “It was incredible, one of the first experiences of my life where I really saw the power of social media to create a collective experience around a particular event as it unfolds. Seeing it blow up on Twitter and watching the mentions just grow, and keep growing, was amazing. All of us were texting each other that night as the event unfolded, and we all stayed up all night having a blast reading the reactions. Just a super great experience for all of us. We came in to work the following Monday still excited and talking about how amazing the response was.”    The outpouring of love from fans was so immense that while the idea of bringing Toonami back began as a joke, it suddenly no longer felt like one to Adult Swim by that next day back at work. Thus, they tweeted that fans could let them know how badly they wanted Toonami to return permanently with the hashtag #BringBackToonami. Not only did this tweet itself garner well over 10,000 retweets (and get the hashtag trending in a matter of hours), but several voice actors and prominent entities in the anime industry even made their own posts featuring the hashtag. Fan made videos, Facebook pages, and petitions dedicated to supporting the hashtag began to appear one after the other. Nerdcore rapper Richie Branson even made a rap about it (which would later be used in an Adult Swim bumper). If it wasn't already abundantly obvious (which it was), then it was now: Now that they knew what Toonami was capable of (once again) being, and that it could air on Adult Swim rather than Cartoon Network, people wanted Toonami back for real.    After a little over a month of cheers to bring back Toonami, Adult Swim finally announced on May 16 with the hashtag  #ToonamisBackBitches that it would be back on Adult Swim (presumably indefinitely) in just a few days, the late night between May 26 and 27. The lineup, it was soon announced after a few days of speculation, would be three hours long and would then repeat itself (meaning it would be on air for a total of 6 hours) and would mostly be anime that had previously aired on Adult Swim such as Bleach and Cowboy Bebop, but also the new-to-U.S.-TV titles Casshern Sins and Deadman Wonderland (shows like Naruto and Dragon Ball Z, DeMarco tweeted, were simply too expensive).    Following the announcement, exuberant forum threads, blog posts, tweets, and videos about the hashtag's success and Toonami's confirmed revival plastered the walls of every online anime community. Richie Branson even made another rap about it to celebrate. In many ways, this marriage of Toonami and Adult Swim felt like a fitting one–they were already both on the same channel, both aired in the evening/at night, and a lot of anime fans spent their younger years in a Toonami to Adult Swim pipeline anyways. This felt perfect.     Despite all the anticipation and fanfare that led up to it, whether or not the night between May 26 and 27 was more than just moderately successful for Toonami depends on who you ask. While its revival made plenty of headlines, many fans lost interest when they saw its mostly-recycled lineup (many were hoping for a higher concentration of shows that either hadn't previously aired in the U.S. or aired in the 90s) which was largely the result of time and money constraints.    “Basically the reaction to [the April Fools] event, combined with the responses to [the Adult Swim tweet about bringing back Toonami], allowed us to come to Lazzo with a request to bring it back for real,” recalled DeMarco, “Gill and I had a plan within a week and brought him a way to do it CHEAP and FAST. And thankfully he said yes. We set a target launch date, and started sprinted towards that date immediately.""    Nonetheless, when ratings came to light a few days later, while they seemed good to many (Deadman Wonderland, for example, ranked #1 in its time slot among adults age 18-24), DeMarco would describe the Toonami revival's inaugural weekend as having gone, “OKAY. Not bad but not measurably better than the week before. We need to do better. Hopefully we will!”    Encouraged by better ratings the following week, (“We're doing well! I'm encouraged.” DeMarco tweeted about it) Toonami marched on—its impact on anime, while not as large as it once was, still tangible. A few weeks prior to its airing on Adult Swim, Deadman Wonderland was on 59,860 user's lists on MyAnimeList. A month into Toonami's revival (June 26), it went up to appearing on 66,110 lists even though it had long since finished airing in Japan (April-July 2011). Casshern Sins—which originally aired in Japan between 2008 and 2009—went from being on 26,671 user's lists on May 4, 2012, to 28,852 on June 28, 2012. These numbers neither 100% definitively prove how many people continually tuned in to this new Toonami, nor are they even particularly earth-shattering, but they do help to further illustrate the influence Toonami was having in the early days of its revival.    Despite the perilous times Adult Swim, like a lot of broadcast television, is currently trying to navigate, Toonami has remained a fixture of Adult Swim in the ten years since its revival began. It's since aired the wildly popular likes of My Hero Academia, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, One-Punch Man, The Promised Neverland, among plenty of other such anime. While it's less of the trendsetter it once was and more of a trend reaffirmer, it still feels much more like the generation-shaping Toonami people knew and loved in the 90s/early 2000s again (as opposed to the zombified state it was in throughout 2008). And Steve Blum, by the way, is still voicing TOM. Adult Swim has also since become more involved in anime than ever by way of producing a few projects (including, but not limited to, the recently announced Housing Complex C and two new seasons of FLCL).    2022 is a unique year for Toonami, as it gets to celebrate not only the 25th anniversary of its original airing, but also the 10th anniversary of its revival. “It's just amazing to me that this is the tenth year of the Adult Swim iteration of Toonami. It's very rare that a person gets to have a second chance at creative work once it's been cancelled or wrapped up by the rights holders,” reflected DeMarco, “It's something that in our case, only happened with the unique combination of fan love and network freedom that Toonami and Adult Swim have. It's been an amazing experience for all of us at Toonami, and one that never ceases to give us joy. We just hope we are giving that joy back.”    Below is the full interview that I had with DeMarco about how Toonami got brought back from the grave:    On April 1, 2012, Toonami once again aired as an April Fools Day joke, despite its 2008 cancellation. How involved were you in the process of making this happen?   Very much so. I believe it was actually Mike Lazzo's idea in one of our brainstorming meetings we had about April Fools. He brought it up as a lark, and Gill Austin and I immediately walked out of that meeting beginning to try to figure out how to pull it off with no time and no money.    What made you (and/or Adult Swim) want to bring Toonami back after its 2008 cancellation?   Well those of us who had worked on Toonami had made our peace with its cancellation. But when we were offered a small chance to bring it back we knew we had to try. It had become clear to us in the years after it was cancelled in 2008 that there were people who WANTED it back.    How (and when) did plans to bring Toonami back start?   I believe it was two and a half months before April Fools Day 2012. Usually Adult Swim has a brainstorm about what we might do for April Fools Day on any given year, where everyone throws out ideas and we see what sticks. Mike Lazzo tossed out “what if we just brought Toonami back for a night, just switched over and it was suddenly like you were in 1999 and watching Cartoon Network?” Everyone loved the idea immediately, and the conversation very quickly moved on to “how the heck can we pull this off?”    Was the plan always to bring it back via an April Fools Day joke? If not, how did that happen?   Previous to the April Fools conversation we had, I swear, never ONCE talked in any serious way about bringing Toonami back. We just didn't think it was possible.    How did the shows that aired for this get picked?   We made a list of what we thought were the definitive Toonami shows. Then we strategized with Kim Manning, our head of programming, how best to approach distributors to see who might be willing to give us a one time license for, like, one episode of a show. We had no idea at all if any of them would work with us on such a weird request.    How was the reception to the April Fools Day joke? Any particularly memorable reactions?   It was incredible, one of the first experiences of my life where I really saw the power of social media to create a collective experience around a particular event as it unfolds. Seeing it blow up on Twitter and watching the mentions just grow, and keep growing, was amazing. All of us were texting each other that night as the event unfolded, and we all stayed up all night having a blast reading the reactions. Just a super great experience for all of us. We came in to work the following Monday still excited and talking about how amazing the response was.    The call from fans to bring back Toonami after this April Fools Day joke was pretty much immediate, and the next day Adult Swim tweeted, ""Want it back? Let us know. #BringBackToonami""--did all this directly contribute to Toonami's full revival a few months later?   Very much so. Basically the reaction to the event, combined with the responses to that Tweet, allowed us to come to Lazzo with a request to bring it back for real. Gill and I had a plan within a week and brought him a way to do it CHEAP and FAST. And thankfully he said yes. We set a target launch date, and started sprinted towards that date immediately.    10 years later, and Adult Swim is more involved in anime production than ever, such as through 2 new seasons of FLCL, Housing Complex C, and Uzumaki. How important has the revival of Toonami been to all this?   It's interesting. Obviously, anime and action have been a part of Adult Swim's DNA since the network's beginning. And even without Toonami returning, it's highly likely that Adult Swim would still be airing anime. Whether or not they would air AS MUCH anime or action, and move into original productions… I don't know. I'm gonna say that would be unlikely without a weekly Toonami block.    Any other thoughts/reflections/fun facts about Toonami's 2012 April Fools Day joke?   Refection-wise, it's just amazing to me that this is the tenth year of the Adult Swim iteration of Toonami. It's very rare that a person gets to have a second chance at creative work once it's been cancelled or wrapped up by the rights holders. It's something that in our case,  only happened with the unique combination of fan love and network freedom that Toonami and Adult Swim have. It's been an amazing experience for all of us at Toonami, and one that never ceases to give us joy. We just hope we are giving that joy back.     discuss this in the forum (7 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Feature homepage / archives      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4, 'https://ew.com/article/2008/12/12/crazy-cult-room/': 1, 'https://twitter.com/adultswim/status/187004036824834049': 1, 'https://twitter.com/blumspew/status/188501360331857921': 1, 'https://twitter.com/LauraBaileyVO/status/191621438317404160': 1, 'https://twitter.com/VoiceOfOBrien/status/187017191344963585': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/funimation/posts/adult-swim-just-asked-on-twitter-tonight-adultswim-want-it-back-let-us-know-brin/378737742158052/': 1, 'https://twitter.com/WeAreAKon/status/187337710481047552': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlbbLFgiVQk': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNEsz347UBU': 1, 'https://twitter.com/adultswim/status/202866436597743616': 1, 'https://twitter.com/Clarknova1/status/204614840298385410': 1, 'https://twitter.com/Clarknova1/status/207971067497676800': 1, 'https://twitter.com/Clarknova1/status/212721465743781888': 1, 'https://web.archive.org/web/20120512015148/https://myanimelist.net/anime/6880/Deadman_Wonderland': 1, 'https://web.archive.org/web/20120626184052/https://myanimelist.net/anime/6880/Deadman_Wonderland': 1, 'https://web.archive.org/web/20120504115441/https://myanimelist.net/anime/4981/Casshern_Sins': 1, 'https://web.archive.org/web/20120628163229/https://myanimelist.net/anime/4981/Casshern_Sins': 1}"

Enter fellow-programming block Adult Swim in the early months of 2012.    “Usually Adult Swim has a brainstorm about what we might do for April Fools Day on any given year, where everyone throws out ideas and we see what sticks,” recalled Toonami co-creator Jason DeMarco, “Mike Lazzo tossed out “what if we just brought Toonami back for a night, just switched over and it was suddenly like you were in 1999 and watching Cartoon Network?” Everyone loved the idea immediately, and the conversation very quickly moved on to “how the heck can we pull this off?””    Considering the dilapidated state of Toonami at the time of its cancellation, it comes as little shock that—per DeMarco—there hadn't been any meaningful conversations about getting it back on the air prior to this meeting. (“Previous to the April Fools conversation we had, I swear, never ONCE talked in any serious way about bringing Toonami back. We just didn't think it was possible.”) This idea to bring Toonami back for a night must've felt as sudden and out-of-the-blue as any idea possibly could've been—but this speed bump wasn't enough to stop the April Fools Toonami revival from happening.    With only a few months to plan everything, Adult Swim's work was cut out for them. “We made a list of what we thought were the definitive Toonami shows,” said DeMarco. “Then we strategized with Kim Manning, our head of programming, how best to approach distributors to see who might be willing to give us a one time license for, like, one episode of a show. We had no idea at all if any of them would work with us on such a weird request.”    Just like the original vision for this idea, the lineup Adult Swim ultimately ended up with was one that mostly felt like it could've pulled straight out of a schedule from 1999: Bleach, Dragon Ball Z, Gundam Wing, Tenchi Muyo!, Outlaw Star, The Big O, Yu-Yu Hakusho, Blue Submarine No. 6, Trigun, Astro Boy, and ending the night with Gigantor. Bleach was a particularly interesting addition to this lineup, not only because it was the only show that came out after 2000 (with the partial exceptions of The Big O and Blue Submarine No. 6, which began in late 90s but didn't finish til after the turn of the millennium), but also because it was the only show on the lineup that was an Adult Swim show, as opposed to a Toonami show. But it was, nonetheless, part of Toonami tonight. And even though Bleach wasn't traditional Toonami fare, TOM's appearance, Steve Blum's familiar voice, and the fact that any anime was airing at all was more than enough to signal to the viewers that at least for tonight, the Toonami people missed was back.     An image that started circulating at the time  As the night went on and viewers saw how increasingly nostalgic the lineup became, the reminiscent fans couldn't help but express their excitement on social media—which, importantly, also helped to rapidly spread the word that this was happening. Searching for tweets and posts with words like “Toonami” or “Dragon Ball Z” during the night of March 31-April 1, 2012 showcases the elated thoughts of countless anime fans, intent to watch Toonami until its final moments—whatever plans they had for the upcoming morning be damned. So abundant were the tweets about it that “Toonami” (and some adjacent words/phrases like “Outlaw Star”, “Gundam Wing”, etc) quickly became one of the top trending topics on Twitter that evening. Said DeMarco about the fan reactions, “It was incredible, one of the first experiences of my life where I really saw the power of social media to create a collective experience around a particular event as it unfolds. Seeing it blow up on Twitter and watching the mentions just grow, and keep growing, was amazing. All of us were texting each other that night as the event unfolded, and we all stayed up all night having a blast reading the reactions. Just a super great experience for all of us. We came in to work the following Monday still excited and talking about how amazing the response was.”    The outpouring of love from fans was so immense that while the idea of bringing Toonami back began as a joke, it suddenly no longer felt like one to Adult Swim by that next day back at work. Thus, they tweeted that fans could let them know how badly they wanted Toonami to return permanently with the hashtag #BringBackToonami. Not only did this tweet itself garner well over 10,000 retweets (and get the hashtag trending in a matter of hours), but several voice actors and prominent entities in the anime industry even made their own posts featuring the hashtag. Fan made videos, Facebook pages, and petitions dedicated to supporting the hashtag began to appear one after the other. Nerdcore rapper Richie Branson even made a rap about it (which would later be used in an Adult Swim bumper). If it wasn't already abundantly obvious (which it was), then it was now: Now that they knew what Toonami was capable of (once again) being, and that it could air on Adult Swim rather than Cartoon Network, people wanted Toonami back for real.    After a little over a month of cheers to bring back Toonami, Adult Swim finally announced on May 16 with the hashtag  #ToonamisBackBitches that it would be back on Adult Swim (presumably indefinitely) in just a few days, the late night between May 26 and 27. The lineup, it was soon announced after a few days of speculation, would be three hours long and would then repeat itself (meaning it would be on air for a total of 6 hours) and would mostly be anime that had previously aired on Adult Swim such as Bleach and Cowboy Bebop, but also the new-to-U.S.-TV titles Casshern Sins and Deadman Wonderland (shows like Naruto and Dragon Ball Z, DeMarco tweeted, were simply too expensive).    Following the announcement, exuberant forum threads, blog posts, tweets, and videos about the hashtag's success and Toonami's confirmed revival plastered the walls of every online anime community. Richie Branson even made another rap about it to celebrate. In many ways, this marriage of Toonami and Adult Swim felt like a fitting one–they were already both on the same channel, both aired in the evening/at night, and a lot of anime fans spent their younger years in a Toonami to Adult Swim pipeline anyways. This felt perfect.     Despite all the anticipation and fanfare that led up to it, whether or not the night between May 26 and 27 was more than just moderately successful for Toonami depends on who you ask. While its revival made plenty of headlines, many fans lost interest when they saw its mostly-recycled lineup (many were hoping for a higher concentration of shows that either hadn't previously aired in the U.S. or aired in the 90s) which was largely the result of time and money constraints.    “Basically the reaction to [the April Fools] event, combined with the responses to [the Adult Swim tweet about bringing back Toonami], allowed us to come to Lazzo with a request to bring it back for real,” recalled DeMarco, “Gill and I had a plan within a week and brought him a way to do it CHEAP and FAST. And thankfully he said yes. We set a target launch date, and started sprinted towards that date immediately.""    Nonetheless, when ratings came to light a few days later, while they seemed good to many (Deadman Wonderland, for example, ranked #1 in its time slot among adults age 18-24), DeMarco would describe the Toonami revival's inaugural weekend as having gone, “OKAY. Not bad but not measurably better than the week before. We need to do better. Hopefully we will!”    Encouraged by better ratings the following week, (“We're doing well! I'm encouraged.” DeMarco tweeted about it) Toonami marched on—its impact on anime, while not as large as it once was, still tangible. A few weeks prior to its airing on Adult Swim, Deadman Wonderland was on 59,860 user's lists on MyAnimeList. A month into Toonami's revival (June 26), it went up to appearing on 66,110 lists even though it had long since finished airing in Japan (April-July 2011). Casshern Sins—which originally aired in Japan between 2008 and 2009—went from being on 26,671 user's lists on May 4, 2012, to 28,852 on June 28, 2012. These numbers neither 100% definitively prove how many people continually tuned in to this new Toonami, nor are they even particularly earth-shattering, but they do help to further illustrate the influence Toonami was having in the early days of its revival.    Despite the perilous times Adult Swim, like a lot of broadcast television, is currently trying to navigate, Toonami has remained a fixture of Adult Swim in the ten years since its revival began. It's since aired the wildly popular likes of My Hero Academia, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, One-Punch Man, The Promised Neverland, among plenty of other such anime. While it's less of the trendsetter it once was and more of a trend reaffirmer, it still feels much more like the generation-shaping Toonami people knew and loved in the 90s/early 2000s again (as opposed to the zombified state it was in throughout 2008). And Steve Blum, by the way, is still voicing TOM. Adult Swim has also since become more involved in anime than ever by way of producing a few projects (including, but not limited to, the recently announced Housing Complex C and two new seasons of FLCL).    2022 is a unique year for Toonami, as it gets to celebrate not only the 25th anniversary of its original airing, but also the 10th anniversary of its revival. “It's just amazing to me that this is the tenth year of the Adult Swim iteration of Toonami. It's very rare that a person gets to have a second chance at creative work once it's been cancelled or wrapped up by the rights holders,” reflected DeMarco, “It's something that in our case, only happened with the unique combination of fan love and network freedom that Toonami and Adult Swim have. It's been an amazing experience for all of us at Toonami, and one that never ceases to give us joy. We just hope we are giving that joy back.”    Below is the full interview that I had with DeMarco about how Toonami got brought back from the grave:    On April 1, 2012, Toonami once again aired as an April Fools Day joke, despite its 2008 cancellation. How involved were you in the process of making this happen?   Very much so. I believe it was actually Mike Lazzo's idea in one of our brainstorming meetings we had about April Fools. He brought it up as a lark, and Gill Austin and I immediately walked out of that meeting beginning to try to figure out how to pull it off with no time and no money.    What made you (and/or Adult Swim) want to bring Toonami back after its 2008 cancellation?   Well those of us who had worked on Toonami had made our peace with its cancellation. But when we were offered a small chance to bring it back we knew we had to try. It had become clear to us in the years after it was cancelled in 2008 that there were people who WANTED it back.    How (and when) did plans to bring Toonami back start?   I believe it was two and a half months before April Fools Day 2012. Usually Adult Swim has a brainstorm about what we might do for April Fools Day on any given year, where everyone throws out ideas and we see what sticks. Mike Lazzo tossed out “what if we just brought Toonami back for a night, just switched over and it was suddenly like you were in 1999 and watching Cartoon Network?” Everyone loved the idea immediately, and the conversation very quickly moved on to “how the heck can we pull this off?”    Was the plan always to bring it back via an April Fools Day joke? If not, how did that happen?   Previous to the April Fools conversation we had, I swear, never ONCE talked in any serious way about bringing Toonami back. We just didn't think it was possible.    How did the shows that aired for this get picked?   We made a list of what we thought were the definitive Toonami shows. Then we strategized with Kim Manning, our head of programming, how best to approach distributors to see who might be willing to give us a one time license for, like, one episode of a show. We had no idea at all if any of them would work with us on such a weird request.    How was the reception to the April Fools Day joke? Any particularly memorable reactions?   It was incredible, one of the first experiences of my life where I really saw the power of social media to create a collective experience around a particular event as it unfolds. Seeing it blow up on Twitter and watching the mentions just grow, and keep growing, was amazing. All of us were texting each other that night as the event unfolded, and we all stayed up all night having a blast reading the reactions. Just a super great experience for all of us. We came in to work the following Monday still excited and talking about how amazing the response was.    The call from fans to bring back Toonami after this April Fools Day joke was pretty much immediate, and the next day Adult Swim tweeted, ""Want it back? Let us know. #BringBackToonami""--did all this directly contribute to Toonami's full revival a few months later?   Very much so. Basically the reaction to the event, combined with the responses to that Tweet, allowed us to come to Lazzo with a request to bring it back for real. Gill and I had a plan within a week and brought him a way to do it CHEAP and FAST. And thankfully he said yes. We set a target launch date, and started sprinted towards that date immediately.    10 years later, and Adult Swim is more involved in anime production than ever, such as through 2 new seasons of FLCL, Housing Complex C, and Uzumaki. How important has the revival of Toonami been to all this?   It's interesting. Obviously, anime and action have been a part of Adult Swim's DNA since the network's beginning. And even without Toonami returning, it's highly likely that Adult Swim would still be airing anime. Whether or not they would air AS MUCH anime or action, and move into original productions… I don't know. I'm gonna say that would be unlikely without a weekly Toonami block.    Any other thoughts/reflections/fun facts about Toonami's 2012 April Fools Day joke?   Refection-wise, it's just amazing to me that this is the tenth year of the Adult Swim iteration of Toonami. It's very rare that a person gets to have a second chance at creative work once it's been cancelled or wrapped up by the rights holders. It's something that in our case,  only happened with the unique combination of fan love and network freedom that Toonami and Adult Swim have. It's been an amazing experience for all of us at Toonami, and one that never ceases to give us joy. We just hope we are giving that joy back.     discuss this in the forum (7 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Feature homepage / archives     ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4, 'https://ew.com/article/2008/12/12/crazy-cult-room/': 1, 'https://twitter.com/adultswim/status/187004036824834049': 1, 'https://twitter.com/blumspew/status/188501360331857921': 1, 'https://twitter.com/LauraBaileyVO/status/191621438317404160': 1, 'https://twitter.com/VoiceOfOBrien/status/187017191344963585': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/funimation/posts/adult-swim-just-asked-on-twitter-tonight-adultswim-want-it-back-let-us-know-brin/378737742158052/': 1, 'https://twitter.com/WeAreAKon/status/187337710481047552': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlbbLFgiVQk': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNEsz347UBU': 1, 'https://twitter.com/adultswim/status/202866436597743616': 1, 'https://twitter.com/Clarknova1/status/204614840298385410': 1, 'https://twitter.com/Clarknova1/status/207971067497676800': 1, 'https://twitter.com/Clarknova1/status/212721465743781888': 1, 'https://web.archive.org/web/20120512015148/https://myanimelist.net/anime/6880/Deadman_Wonderland': 1, 'https://web.archive.org/web/20120626184052/https://myanimelist.net/anime/6880/Deadman_Wonderland': 1, 'https://web.archive.org/web/20120504115441/https://myanimelist.net/anime/4981/Casshern_Sins': 1, 'https://web.archive.org/web/20120628163229/https://myanimelist.net/anime/4981/Casshern_Sins': 1}"

The nighttime programming block had fallen into the routine of airing The Room—a legendary 2003 independent film (which has been called “the Citizen Kane of bad movies”) spearheaded by cinematic Swiss army knife Tommy Wiseau. By midnight of April 1, 2012, nobody had any reason to believe that this year would be any different. The (excruciatingly long) opening credits sequence began, and for almost 30 whole seconds everything was the way it had been in the years before—until, that is, the movie faded to black for a moment, revealing that a dark blue robot was watching the movie. “Oh hi, Adult Swim,” the robot with Steve Blum's voice said, “I got the results of the test back. I definitely have April Fools.” The robot, as many anime fans instantly recognized, was TOM: the host of a beloved anime programming block called Toonami that aired on Cartoon Network between 1997 and 2008. A brief animation played after TOM made his quip, the Toonami logo appeared on-screen, and an episode of Bleach began to play. Without any warning, Toonami was airing on television for the first time in almost four years—and anime fans across the U.S. lost their collective mind.      To understand how this happened and why it was such a big deal, we first need to rewind back to the 2000s. Originally, the anime-and-action-cartoon programming block aired on weekday afternoons, but in 2004 it got moved to Saturday nights. It's hard to understate how massive a role Toonami played in anime's burst of popularity in the West throughout the 90s by shaping tastes and making anime more accessible in its heyday. Such was its success that within a few years, even Cartoon Network started airing some anime as well (the only anime it had ever aired before the debut of Toonami was Speed Racer). Furthermore, an adult-oriented nighttime programming block on the same channel called Adult Swim started up in 2001, and an anime called Cowboy Bebop was included in its original lineup. Over the years, both Cartoon Network and Adult Swim would continue to air more anime outside of Toonami (and in fact, Adult Swim even started its own anime-centric block called Adult Swim Action in 2002, which featured some anime that had previously aired on Toonami). But even then, Toonami still felt different. It had its own host (a robot named TOM, though he reincarnated a few times), its own lore, the occasional game review, and unlike Cartoon Network and Adult Swim, anime was a foremost part of Toonami's identity—it felt lovingly tailored specifically for anime fans in a way Cartoon Network and Adult Swim never would be. Dragon Ball Z, Sailor Moon, Naruto, and Gundam Wing are only a few of the anime that found massive success airing on Toonami, and dominated Western anime fan culture for several years.    But by 2008, Toonami had become a shadow of its former self. Once four-hours-long, it spent most of the year with its time cut in half and saturated with Naruto episodes—a far cry from the gateway to discovering a variety of new anime that it once was. The kids who grew up with Toonami's biggest hits like Dragon Ball Z and Sailor Moon were now older and looking for anime that felt a little more dark or mature. And while Toonami had the extremely popular Naruto, Adult Swim had the likes of InuYasha, Bleach, Fullmetal Alchemist, and Cowboy Bebop among plenty of other immensely successful anime that fit the bill—quality and quantity. While anime was never Adult Swim's primary focus, it had nonetheless become an anime powerhouse in its own right, and seemed to take over Toonami's status as the U.S.'s largest anime tastemaker in the mid and late 2000s. Factoring in the massive recession happening on top of all this, and the only thing shocking about Cartoon Network's announcing the cancellation of Toonami at Anime Weekend Atlanta 2008 (they cited declining viewership as the reason why) was how Toonami managed to last as long as it did. The final Toonami block would air the same evening the announcement was made: September 20, 2008.    Much to the disappointment of longtime fans, Toonami didn't go out with so much as a fizzle. Its time wasn't extended, it didn't re-run any of its classic hits—nothing was out of the ordinary. It was the same two-hour block it had been for some time, half of which was spent airing Naruto (the other half was an episode of Ben 10: Alien Force, followed by an episode of Samurai Jack). If not for a clip of TOM saying goodbye at the end, then that evening's block wouldn't have felt like an ending for anything—let alone a once-great programming block that managed to stay on the air for 11 years. While saddened by it, most fans discussing the announcement online seemed to be understanding of the decision, and accepted it pretty quickly. In Memoriam-style posts and content looking back fondly on Toonami's glory days and wondering where it all went wrong (when Toonami got moved to Saturday nights probably marked the beginning of the end, many agreed) seemed to outnumber petitions to undo the cancellation and outraged posts by a landslide. Thus quietly ended Toonami.      In the years following Toonami's cancellation, any lingering conversations about it amongst fans were usually less about bringing it back, and more about being nostalgic for its late 90s/early 2000s lineups. People missed Toonami, that much was clear, but they missed a certain type of Toonami. They missed the anime-centric block that was chock-loaded with a variety of iconic hits—not the glorified Naruto block it eventually became. But with Cartoon Network airing fewer and fewer anime, the idea that Toonami would ever come back seemed less likely than ever.    Enter fellow-programming block Adult Swim in the early months of 2012.    “Usually Adult Swim has a brainstorm about what we might do for April Fools Day on any given year, where everyone throws out ideas and we see what sticks,” recalled Toonami co-creator Jason DeMarco, “Mike Lazzo tossed out “what if we just brought Toonami back for a night, just switched over and it was suddenly like you were in 1999 and watching Cartoon Network?” Everyone loved the idea immediately, and the conversation very quickly moved on to “how the heck can we pull this off?””    Considering the dilapidated state of Toonami at the time of its cancellation, it comes as little shock that—per DeMarco—there hadn't been any meaningful conversations about getting it back on the air prior to this meeting. (“Previous to the April Fools conversation we had, I swear, never ONCE talked in any serious way about bringing Toonami back.

Bleach was a particularly interesting addition to this lineup, not only because it was the only show that came out after 2000 (with the partial exceptions of The Big O and Blue Submarine No. 6, which began in late 90s but didn't finish til after the turn of the millennium), but also because it was the only show on the lineup that was an Adult Swim show, as opposed to a Toonami show.

Adult Swim has also since become more involved in anime than ever by way of producing a few projects (including, but not limited to, the recently announced Housing Complex C and two new seasons of FLCL).    2022 is a unique year for Toonami, as it gets to celebrate not only the 25th anniversary of its original airing, but also the 10th anniversary of its revival. “It's just amazing to me that this is the tenth year of the Adult Swim iteration of Toonami. It's very rare that a person gets to have a second chance at creative work once it's been cancelled or wrapped up by the rights holders,” reflected DeMarco, “It's something that in our case, only happened with the unique combination of fan love and network freedom that Toonami and Adult Swim have. It's been an amazing experience for all of us at Toonami, and one that never ceases to give us joy. We just hope we are giving that joy back.”    Below is the full interview that I had with DeMarco about how Toonami got brought back from the grave:    On April 1, 2012, Toonami once again aired as an April Fools Day joke, despite its 2008 cancellation. How involved were you in the process of making this happen?   Very much so. I believe it was actually Mike Lazzo's idea in one of our brainstorming meetings we had about April Fools. He brought it up as a lark, and Gill Austin and I immediately walked out of that meeting beginning to try to figure out how to pull it off with no time and no money.    What made you (and/or Adult Swim) want to bring Toonami back after its 2008 cancellation?   Well those of us who had worked on Toonami had made our peace with its cancellation. But when we were offered a small chance to bring it back we knew we had to try. It had become clear to us in the years after it was cancelled in 2008 that there were people who WANTED it back.    How (and when) did plans to bring Toonami back start?   I believe it was two and a half months before April Fools Day 2012. Usually Adult Swim has a brainstorm about what we might do for April Fools Day on any given year, where everyone throws out ideas and we see what sticks. Mike Lazzo tossed out “what if we just brought Toonami back for a night, just switched over and it was suddenly like you were in 1999 and watching Cartoon Network?” Everyone loved the idea immediately, and the conversation very quickly moved on to “how the heck can we pull this off?”    Was the plan always to bring it back via an April Fools Day joke? If not, how did that happen?   Previous to the April Fools conversation we had, I swear, never ONCE talked in any serious way about bringing Toonami back. We just didn't think it was possible.    How did the shows that aired for this get picked?   We made a list of what we thought were the definitive Toonami shows. Then we strategized with Kim Manning, our head of programming, how best to approach distributors to see who might be willing to give us a one time license for, like, one episode of a show. We had no idea at all if any of them would work with us on such a weird request.    How was the reception to the April Fools Day joke? Any particularly memorable reactions?   It was incredible, one of the first experiences of my life where I really saw the power of social media to create a collective experience around a particular event as it unfolds. Seeing it blow up on Twitter and watching the mentions just grow, and keep growing, was amazing. All of us were texting each other that night as the event unfolded, and we all stayed up all night having a blast reading the reactions. Just a super great experience for all of us. We came in to work the following Monday still excited and talking about how amazing the response was.    The call from fans to bring back Toonami after this April Fools Day joke was pretty much immediate, and the next day Adult Swim tweeted, ""Want it back? Let us know. #BringBackToonami""--did all this directly contribute to Toonami's full revival a few months later?   Very much so. Basically the reaction to the event, combined with the responses to that Tweet, allowed us to come to Lazzo with a request to bring it back for real. Gill and I had a plan within a week and brought him a way to do it CHEAP and FAST. And thankfully he said yes. We set a target launch date, and started sprinted towards that date immediately.    10 years later, and Adult Swim is more involved in anime production than ever, such as through 2 new seasons of FLCL, Housing Complex C, and Uzumaki. How important has the revival of Toonami been to all this?   It's interesting. Obviously, anime and action have been a part of Adult Swim's DNA since the network's beginning. And even without Toonami returning, it's highly likely that Adult Swim would still be airing anime. Whether or not they would air AS MUCH anime or action, and move into original productions… I don't know. I'm gonna say that would be unlikely without a weekly Toonami block.    Any other thoughts/reflections/fun facts about Toonami's 2012 April Fools Day joke?   Refection-wise, it's just amazing to me that this is the tenth year of the Adult Swim iteration of Toonami. It's very rare that a person gets to have a second chance at creative work once it's been cancelled or wrapped up by the rights holders. It's something that in our case,  only happened with the unique combination of fan love and network freedom that Toonami and Adult Swim have. It's been an amazing experience for all of us at Toonami, and one that never ceases to give us joy. We just hope we are giving that joy back.     discuss this in the forum (7 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Feature homepage / archives    ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4, 'https://ew.com/article/2008/12/12/crazy-cult-room/': 1, 'https://twitter.com/adultswim/status/187004036824834049': 1, 'https://twitter.com/blumspew/status/188501360331857921': 1, 'https://twitter.com/LauraBaileyVO/status/191621438317404160': 1, 'https://twitter.com/VoiceOfOBrien/status/187017191344963585': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/funimation/posts/adult-swim-just-asked-on-twitter-tonight-adultswim-want-it-back-let-us-know-brin/378737742158052/': 1, 'https://twitter.com/WeAreAKon/status/187337710481047552': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlbbLFgiVQk': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNEsz347UBU': 1, 'https://twitter.com/adultswim/status/202866436597743616': 1, 'https://twitter.com/Clarknova1/status/204614840298385410': 1, 'https://twitter.com/Clarknova1/status/207971067497676800': 1, 'https://twitter.com/Clarknova1/status/212721465743781888': 1, 'https://web.archive.org/web/20120512015148/https://myanimelist.net/anime/6880/Deadman_Wonderland': 1, 'https://web.archive.org/web/20120626184052/https://myanimelist.net/anime/6880/Deadman_Wonderland': 1, 'https://web.archive.org/web/20120504115441/https://myanimelist.net/anime/4981/Casshern_Sins': 1, 'https://web.archive.org/web/20120628163229/https://myanimelist.net/anime/4981/Casshern_Sins': 1}"
14-04-2022,anime,29,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2022-04-01/how-an-april-fools-day-joke-revived-toonami/.184015,How an April Fools Day Joke Revived Toonami - Anime News Network:SEA,"       By 2012, April Fools Day on Adult Swim had become a fun, albeit predictable, event. The nighttime programming block had fallen into the routine of airing The Room—a legendary 2003 independent film (which has been called “the Citizen Kane of bad movies”) spearheaded by cinematic Swiss army knife Tommy Wiseau. By midnight of April 1, 2012, nobody had any reason to believe that this year would be any different. The (excruciatingly long) opening credits sequence began, and for almost 30 whole seconds everything was the way it had been in the years before—until, that is, the movie faded to black for a moment, revealing that a dark blue robot was watching the movie. “Oh hi, Adult Swim,” the robot with Steve Blum's voice said, “I got the results of the test back. I definitely have April Fools.” The robot, as many anime fans instantly recognized, was TOM: the host of a beloved anime programming block called Toonami that aired on Cartoon Network between 1997 and 2008. A brief animation played after TOM made his quip, the Toonami logo appeared on-screen, and an episode of Bleach began to play. Without any warning, Toonami was airing on television for the first time in almost four years—and anime fans across the U.S. lost their collective mind.      To understand how this happened and why it was such a big deal, we first need to rewind back to the 2000s. Originally, the anime-and-action-cartoon programming block aired on weekday afternoons, but in 2004 it got moved to Saturday nights. It's hard to understate how massive a role Toonami played in anime's burst of popularity in the West throughout the 90s by shaping tastes and making anime more accessible in its heyday. Such was its success that within a few years, even Cartoon Network started airing some anime as well (the only anime it had ever aired before the debut of Toonami was Speed Racer). Furthermore, an adult-oriented nighttime programming block on the same channel called Adult Swim started up in 2001, and an anime called Cowboy Bebop was included in its original lineup. Over the years, both Cartoon Network and Adult Swim would continue to air more anime outside of Toonami (and in fact, Adult Swim even started its own anime-centric block called Adult Swim Action in 2002, which featured some anime that had previously aired on Toonami). But even then, Toonami still felt different. It had its own host (a robot named TOM, though he reincarnated a few times), its own lore, the occasional game review, and unlike Cartoon Network and Adult Swim, anime was a foremost part of Toonami's identity—it felt lovingly tailored specifically for anime fans in a way Cartoon Network and Adult Swim never would be. Dragon Ball Z, Sailor Moon, Naruto, and Gundam Wing are only a few of the anime that found massive success airing on Toonami, and dominated Western anime fan culture for several years.    But by 2008, Toonami had become a shadow of its former self. Once four-hours-long, it spent most of the year with its time cut in half and saturated with Naruto episodes—a far cry from the gateway to discovering a variety of new anime that it once was. The kids who grew up with Toonami's biggest hits like Dragon Ball Z and Sailor Moon were now older and looking for anime that felt a little more dark or mature. And while Toonami had the extremely popular Naruto, Adult Swim had the likes of InuYasha, Bleach, Fullmetal Alchemist, and Cowboy Bebop among plenty of other immensely successful anime that fit the bill—quality and quantity. While anime was never Adult Swim's primary focus, it had nonetheless become an anime powerhouse in its own right, and seemed to take over Toonami's status as the U.S.'s largest anime tastemaker in the mid and late 2000s. Factoring in the massive recession happening on top of all this, and the only thing shocking about Cartoon Network's announcing the cancellation of Toonami at Anime Weekend Atlanta 2008 (they cited declining viewership as the reason why) was how Toonami managed to last as long as it did. The final Toonami block would air the same evening the announcement was made: September 20, 2008.    Much to the disappointment of longtime fans, Toonami didn't go out with so much as a fizzle. Its time wasn't extended, it didn't re-run any of its classic hits—nothing was out of the ordinary. It was the same two-hour block it had been for some time, half of which was spent airing Naruto (the other half was an episode of Ben 10: Alien Force, followed by an episode of Samurai Jack). If not for a clip of TOM saying goodbye at the end, then that evening's block wouldn't have felt like an ending for anything—let alone a once-great programming block that managed to stay on the air for 11 years. While saddened by it, most fans discussing the announcement online seemed to be understanding of the decision, and accepted it pretty quickly. In Memoriam-style posts and content looking back fondly on Toonami's glory days and wondering where it all went wrong (when Toonami got moved to Saturday nights probably marked the beginning of the end, many agreed) seemed to outnumber petitions to undo the cancellation and outraged posts by a landslide. Thus quietly ended Toonami.      In the years following Toonami's cancellation, any lingering conversations about it amongst fans were usually less about bringing it back, and more about being nostalgic for its late 90s/early 2000s lineups. People missed Toonami, that much was clear, but they missed a certain type of Toonami. They missed the anime-centric block that was chock-loaded with a variety of iconic hits—not the glorified Naruto block it eventually became. But with Cartoon Network airing fewer and fewer anime, the idea that Toonami would ever come back seemed less likely than ever.    Enter fellow-programming block Adult Swim in the early months of 2012.    “Usually Adult Swim has a brainstorm about what we might do for April Fools Day on any given year, where everyone throws out ideas and we see what sticks,” recalled Toonami co-creator Jason DeMarco, “Mike Lazzo tossed out “what if we just brought Toonami back for a night, just switched over and it was suddenly like you were in 1999 and watching Cartoon Network?” Everyone loved the idea immediately, and the conversation very quickly moved on to “how the heck can we pull this off?””    Considering the dilapidated state of Toonami at the time of its cancellation, it comes as little shock that—per DeMarco—there hadn't been any meaningful conversations about getting it back on the air prior to this meeting. (“Previous to the April Fools conversation we had, I swear, never ONCE talked in any serious way about bringing Toonami back. We just didn't think it was possible.”) This idea to bring Toonami back for a night must've felt as sudden and out-of-the-blue as any idea possibly could've been—but this speed bump wasn't enough to stop the April Fools Toonami revival from happening.    With only a few months to plan everything, Adult Swim's work was cut out for them. “We made a list of what we thought were the definitive Toonami shows,” said DeMarco. “Then we strategized with Kim Manning, our head of programming, how best to approach distributors to see who might be willing to give us a one time license for, like, one episode of a show. We had no idea at all if any of them would work with us on such a weird request.”    Just like the original vision for this idea, the lineup Adult Swim ultimately ended up with was one that mostly felt like it could've pulled straight out of a schedule from 1999: Bleach, Dragon Ball Z, Gundam Wing, Tenchi Muyo!, Outlaw Star, The Big O, Yu-Yu Hakusho, Blue Submarine No. 6, Trigun, Astro Boy, and ending the night with Gigantor. Bleach was a particularly interesting addition to this lineup, not only because it was the only show that came out after 2000 (with the partial exceptions of The Big O and Blue Submarine No. 6, which began in late 90s but didn't finish til after the turn of the millennium), but also because it was the only show on the lineup that was an Adult Swim show, as opposed to a Toonami show. But it was, nonetheless, part of Toonami tonight. And even though Bleach wasn't traditional Toonami fare, TOM's appearance, Steve Blum's familiar voice, and the fact that any anime was airing at all was more than enough to signal to the viewers that at least for tonight, the Toonami people missed was back.     An image that started circulating at the time  As the night went on and viewers saw how increasingly nostalgic the lineup became, the reminiscent fans couldn't help but express their excitement on social media—which, importantly, also helped to rapidly spread the word that this was happening. Searching for tweets and posts with words like “Toonami” or “Dragon Ball Z” during the night of March 31-April 1, 2012 showcases the elated thoughts of countless anime fans, intent to watch Toonami until its final moments—whatever plans they had for the upcoming morning be damned. So abundant were the tweets about it that “Toonami” (and some adjacent words/phrases like “Outlaw Star”, “Gundam Wing”, etc) quickly became one of the top trending topics on Twitter that evening. Said DeMarco about the fan reactions, “It was incredible, one of the first experiences of my life where I really saw the power of social media to create a collective experience around a particular event as it unfolds. Seeing it blow up on Twitter and watching the mentions just grow, and keep growing, was amazing. All of us were texting each other that night as the event unfolded, and we all stayed up all night having a blast reading the reactions. Just a super great experience for all of us. We came in to work the following Monday still excited and talking about how amazing the response was.”    The outpouring of love from fans was so immense that while the idea of bringing Toonami back began as a joke, it suddenly no longer felt like one to Adult Swim by that next day back at work. Thus, they tweeted that fans could let them know how badly they wanted Toonami to return permanently with the hashtag #BringBackToonami. Not only did this tweet itself garner well over 10,000 retweets (and get the hashtag trending in a matter of hours), but several voice actors and prominent entities in the anime industry even made their own posts featuring the hashtag. Fan made videos, Facebook pages, and petitions dedicated to supporting the hashtag began to appear one after the other. Nerdcore rapper Richie Branson even made a rap about it (which would later be used in an Adult Swim bumper). If it wasn't already abundantly obvious (which it was), then it was now: Now that they knew what Toonami was capable of (once again) being, and that it could air on Adult Swim rather than Cartoon Network, people wanted Toonami back for real.    After a little over a month of cheers to bring back Toonami, Adult Swim finally announced on May 16 with the hashtag  #ToonamisBackBitches that it would be back on Adult Swim (presumably indefinitely) in just a few days, the late night between May 26 and 27. The lineup, it was soon announced after a few days of speculation, would be three hours long and would then repeat itself (meaning it would be on air for a total of 6 hours) and would mostly be anime that had previously aired on Adult Swim such as Bleach and Cowboy Bebop, but also the new-to-U.S.-TV titles Casshern Sins and Deadman Wonderland (shows like Naruto and Dragon Ball Z, DeMarco tweeted, were simply too expensive).    Following the announcement, exuberant forum threads, blog posts, tweets, and videos about the hashtag's success and Toonami's confirmed revival plastered the walls of every online anime community. Richie Branson even made another rap about it to celebrate. In many ways, this marriage of Toonami and Adult Swim felt like a fitting one–they were already both on the same channel, both aired in the evening/at night, and a lot of anime fans spent their younger years in a Toonami to Adult Swim pipeline anyways. This felt perfect.     Despite all the anticipation and fanfare that led up to it, whether or not the night between May 26 and 27 was more than just moderately successful for Toonami depends on who you ask. While its revival made plenty of headlines, many fans lost interest when they saw its mostly-recycled lineup (many were hoping for a higher concentration of shows that either hadn't previously aired in the U.S. or aired in the 90s) which was largely the result of time and money constraints.    “Basically the reaction to [the April Fools] event, combined with the responses to [the Adult Swim tweet about bringing back Toonami], allowed us to come to Lazzo with a request to bring it back for real,” recalled DeMarco, “Gill and I had a plan within a week and brought him a way to do it CHEAP and FAST. And thankfully he said yes. We set a target launch date, and started sprinted towards that date immediately.""    Nonetheless, when ratings came to light a few days later, while they seemed good to many (Deadman Wonderland, for example, ranked #1 in its time slot among adults age 18-24), DeMarco would describe the Toonami revival's inaugural weekend as having gone, “OKAY. Not bad but not measurably better than the week before. We need to do better. Hopefully we will!”    Encouraged by better ratings the following week, (“We're doing well! I'm encouraged.” DeMarco tweeted about it) Toonami marched on—its impact on anime, while not as large as it once was, still tangible. A few weeks prior to its airing on Adult Swim, Deadman Wonderland was on 59,860 user's lists on MyAnimeList. A month into Toonami's revival (June 26), it went up to appearing on 66,110 lists even though it had long since finished airing in Japan (April-July 2011). Casshern Sins—which originally aired in Japan between 2008 and 2009—went from being on 26,671 user's lists on May 4, 2012, to 28,852 on June 28, 2012. These numbers neither 100% definitively prove how many people continually tuned in to this new Toonami, nor are they even particularly earth-shattering, but they do help to further illustrate the influence Toonami was having in the early days of its revival.    Despite the perilous times Adult Swim, like a lot of broadcast television, is currently trying to navigate, Toonami has remained a fixture of Adult Swim in the ten years since its revival began. It's since aired the wildly popular likes of My Hero Academia, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, One-Punch Man, The Promised Neverland, among plenty of other such anime. While it's less of the trendsetter it once was and more of a trend reaffirmer, it still feels much more like the generation-shaping Toonami people knew and loved in the 90s/early 2000s again (as opposed to the zombified state it was in throughout 2008). And Steve Blum, by the way, is still voicing TOM. Adult Swim has also since become more involved in anime than ever by way of producing a few projects (including, but not limited to, the recently announced Housing Complex C and two new seasons of FLCL).    2022 is a unique year for Toonami, as it gets to celebrate not only the 25th anniversary of its original airing, but also the 10th anniversary of its revival. “It's just amazing to me that this is the tenth year of the Adult Swim iteration of Toonami. It's very rare that a person gets to have a second chance at creative work once it's been cancelled or wrapped up by the rights holders,” reflected DeMarco, “It's something that in our case, only happened with the unique combination of fan love and network freedom that Toonami and Adult Swim have. It's been an amazing experience for all of us at Toonami, and one that never ceases to give us joy. We just hope we are giving that joy back.”    Below is the full interview that I had with DeMarco about how Toonami got brought back from the grave:    On April 1, 2012, Toonami once again aired as an April Fools Day joke, despite its 2008 cancellation.

The nighttime programming block had fallen into the routine of airing The Room—a legendary 2003 independent film (which has been called “the Citizen Kane of bad movies”) spearheaded by cinematic Swiss army knife Tommy Wiseau. By midnight of April 1, 2012, nobody had any reason to believe that this year would be any different. The (excruciatingly long) opening credits sequence began, and for almost 30 whole seconds everything was the way it had been in the years before—until, that is, the movie faded to black for a moment, revealing that a dark blue robot was watching the movie. “Oh hi, Adult Swim,” the robot with Steve Blum's voice said, “I got the results of the test back. I definitely have April Fools.” The robot, as many anime fans instantly recognized, was TOM: the host of a beloved anime programming block called Toonami that aired on Cartoon Network between 1997 and 2008. A brief animation played after TOM made his quip, the Toonami logo appeared on-screen, and an episode of Bleach began to play. Without any warning, Toonami was airing on television for the first time in almost four years—and anime fans across the U.S. lost their collective mind.      To understand how this happened and why it was such a big deal, we first need to rewind back to the 2000s. Originally, the anime-and-action-cartoon programming block aired on weekday afternoons, but in 2004 it got moved to Saturday nights. It's hard to understate how massive a role Toonami played in anime's burst of popularity in the West throughout the 90s by shaping tastes and making anime more accessible in its heyday. Such was its success that within a few years, even Cartoon Network started airing some anime as well (the only anime it had ever aired before the debut of Toonami was Speed Racer). Furthermore, an adult-oriented nighttime programming block on the same channel called Adult Swim started up in 2001, and an anime called Cowboy Bebop was included in its original lineup. Over the years, both Cartoon Network and Adult Swim would continue to air more anime outside of Toonami (and in fact, Adult Swim even started its own anime-centric block called Adult Swim Action in 2002, which featured some anime that had previously aired on Toonami). But even then, Toonami still felt different. It had its own host (a robot named TOM, though he reincarnated a few times), its own lore, the occasional game review, and unlike Cartoon Network and Adult Swim, anime was a foremost part of Toonami's identity—it felt lovingly tailored specifically for anime fans in a way Cartoon Network and Adult Swim never would be. Dragon Ball Z, Sailor Moon, Naruto, and Gundam Wing are only a few of the anime that found massive success airing on Toonami, and dominated Western anime fan culture for several years.    But by 2008, Toonami had become a shadow of its former self. Once four-hours-long, it spent most of the year with its time cut in half and saturated with Naruto episodes—a far cry from the gateway to discovering a variety of new anime that it once was. The kids who grew up with Toonami's biggest hits like Dragon Ball Z and Sailor Moon were now older and looking for anime that felt a little more dark or mature. And while Toonami had the extremely popular Naruto, Adult Swim had the likes of InuYasha, Bleach, Fullmetal Alchemist, and Cowboy Bebop among plenty of other immensely successful anime that fit the bill—quality and quantity. While anime was never Adult Swim's primary focus, it had nonetheless become an anime powerhouse in its own right, and seemed to take over Toonami's status as the U.S.'s largest anime tastemaker in the mid and late 2000s. Factoring in the massive recession happening on top of all this, and the only thing shocking about Cartoon Network's announcing the cancellation of Toonami at Anime Weekend Atlanta 2008 (they cited declining viewership as the reason why) was how Toonami managed to last as long as it did. The final Toonami block would air the same evening the announcement was made: September 20, 2008.    Much to the disappointment of longtime fans, Toonami didn't go out with so much as a fizzle. Its time wasn't extended, it didn't re-run any of its classic hits—nothing was out of the ordinary. It was the same two-hour block it had been for some time, half of which was spent airing Naruto (the other half was an episode of Ben 10: Alien Force, followed by an episode of Samurai Jack). If not for a clip of TOM saying goodbye at the end, then that evening's block wouldn't have felt like an ending for anything—let alone a once-great programming block that managed to stay on the air for 11 years. While saddened by it, most fans discussing the announcement online seemed to be understanding of the decision, and accepted it pretty quickly. In Memoriam-style posts and content looking back fondly on Toonami's glory days and wondering where it all went wrong (when Toonami got moved to Saturday nights probably marked the beginning of the end, many agreed) seemed to outnumber petitions to undo the cancellation and outraged posts by a landslide. Thus quietly ended Toonami.      In the years following Toonami's cancellation, any lingering conversations about it amongst fans were usually less about bringing it back, and more about being nostalgic for its late 90s/early 2000s lineups. People missed Toonami, that much was clear, but they missed a certain type of Toonami. They missed the anime-centric block that was chock-loaded with a variety of iconic hits—not the glorified Naruto block it eventually became. But with Cartoon Network airing fewer and fewer anime, the idea that Toonami would ever come back seemed less likely than ever.    Enter fellow-programming block Adult Swim in the early months of 2012.    “Usually Adult Swim has a brainstorm about what we might do for April Fools Day on any given year, where everyone throws out ideas and we see what sticks,” recalled Toonami co-creator Jason DeMarco, “Mike Lazzo tossed out “what if we just brought Toonami back for a night, just switched over and it was suddenly like you were in 1999 and watching Cartoon Network?” Everyone loved the idea immediately, and the conversation very quickly moved on to “how the heck can we pull this off?””    Considering the dilapidated state of Toonami at the time of its cancellation, it comes as little shock that—per DeMarco—there hadn't been any meaningful conversations about getting it back on the air prior to this meeting. (“Previous to the April Fools conversation we had, I swear, never ONCE talked in any serious way about bringing Toonami back. We just didn't think it was possible.”) This idea to bring Toonami back for a night must've felt as sudden and out-of-the-blue as any idea possibly could've been—but this speed bump wasn't enough to stop the April Fools Toonami revival from happening.    With only a few months to plan everything, Adult Swim's work was cut out for them. “We made a list of what we thought were the definitive Toonami shows,” said DeMarco. “Then we strategized with Kim Manning, our head of programming, how best to approach distributors to see who might be willing to give us a one time license for, like, one episode of a show. We had no idea at all if any of them would work with us on such a weird request.”    Just like the original vision for this idea, the lineup Adult Swim ultimately ended up with was one that mostly felt like it could've pulled straight out of a schedule from 1999: Bleach, Dragon Ball Z, Gundam Wing, Tenchi Muyo!, Outlaw Star, The Big O, Yu-Yu Hakusho, Blue Submarine No. 6, Trigun, Astro Boy, and ending the night with Gigantor. Bleach was a particularly interesting addition to this lineup, not only because it was the only show that came out after 2000 (with the partial exceptions of The Big O and Blue Submarine No. 6, which began in late 90s but didn't finish til after the turn of the millennium), but also because it was the only show on the lineup that was an Adult Swim show, as opposed to a Toonami show. But it was, nonetheless, part of Toonami tonight. And even though Bleach wasn't traditional Toonami fare, TOM's appearance, Steve Blum's familiar voice, and the fact that any anime was airing at all was more than enough to signal to the viewers that at least for tonight, the Toonami people missed was back.     An image that started circulating at the time  As the night went on and viewers saw how increasingly nostalgic the lineup became, the reminiscent fans couldn't help but express their excitement on social media—which, importantly, also helped to rapidly spread the word that this was happening. Searching for tweets and posts with words like “Toonami” or “Dragon Ball Z” during the night of March 31-April 1, 2012 showcases the elated thoughts of countless anime fans, intent to watch Toonami until its final moments—whatever plans they had for the upcoming morning be damned. So abundant were the tweets about it that “Toonami” (and some adjacent words/phrases like “Outlaw Star”, “Gundam Wing”, etc) quickly became one of the top trending topics on Twitter that evening. Said DeMarco about the fan reactions, “It was incredible, one of the first experiences of my life where I really saw the power of social media to create a collective experience around a particular event as it unfolds. Seeing it blow up on Twitter and watching the mentions just grow, and keep growing, was amazing. All of us were texting each other that night as the event unfolded, and we all stayed up all night having a blast reading the reactions. Just a super great experience for all of us. We came in to work the following Monday still excited and talking about how amazing the response was.”    The outpouring of love from fans was so immense that while the idea of bringing Toonami back began as a joke, it suddenly no longer felt like one to Adult Swim by that next day back at work. Thus, they tweeted that fans could let them know how badly they wanted Toonami to return permanently with the hashtag #BringBackToonami. Not only did this tweet itself garner well over 10,000 retweets (and get the hashtag trending in a matter of hours), but several voice actors and prominent entities in the anime industry even made their own posts featuring the hashtag. Fan made videos, Facebook pages, and petitions dedicated to supporting the hashtag began to appear one after the other. Nerdcore rapper Richie Branson even made a rap about it (which would later be used in an Adult Swim bumper). If it wasn't already abundantly obvious (which it was), then it was now: Now that they knew what Toonami was capable of (once again) being, and that it could air on Adult Swim rather than Cartoon Network, people wanted Toonami back for real.    After a little over a month of cheers to bring back Toonami, Adult Swim finally announced on May 16 with the hashtag  #ToonamisBackBitches that it would be back on Adult Swim (presumably indefinitely) in just a few days, the late night between May 26 and 27. The lineup, it was soon announced after a few days of speculation, would be three hours long and would then repeat itself (meaning it would be on air for a total of 6 hours) and would mostly be anime that had previously aired on Adult Swim such as Bleach and Cowboy Bebop, but also the new-to-U.S.-TV titles Casshern Sins and Deadman Wonderland (shows like Naruto and Dragon Ball Z, DeMarco tweeted, were simply too expensive).    Following the announcement, exuberant forum threads, blog posts, tweets, and videos about the hashtag's success and Toonami's confirmed revival plastered the walls of every online anime community. Richie Branson even made another rap about it to celebrate. In many ways, this marriage of Toonami and Adult Swim felt like a fitting one–they were already both on the same channel, both aired in the evening/at night, and a lot of anime fans spent their younger years in a Toonami to Adult Swim pipeline anyways. This felt perfect.     Despite all the anticipation and fanfare that led up to it, whether or not the night between May 26 and 27 was more than just moderately successful for Toonami depends on who you ask. While its revival made plenty of headlines, many fans lost interest when they saw its mostly-recycled lineup (many were hoping for a higher concentration of shows that either hadn't previously aired in the U.S. or aired in the 90s) which was largely the result of time and money constraints.    “Basically the reaction to [the April Fools] event, combined with the responses to [the Adult Swim tweet about bringing back Toonami], allowed us to come to Lazzo with a request to bring it back for real,” recalled DeMarco, “Gill and I had a plan within a week and brought him a way to do it CHEAP and FAST. And thankfully he said yes. We set a target launch date, and started sprinted towards that date immediately.""    Nonetheless, when ratings came to light a few days later, while they seemed good to many (Deadman Wonderland, for example, ranked #1 in its time slot among adults age 18-24), DeMarco would describe the Toonami revival's inaugural weekend as having gone, “OKAY. Not bad but not measurably better than the week before. We need to do better. Hopefully we will!”    Encouraged by better ratings the following week, (“We're doing well! I'm encouraged.” DeMarco tweeted about it) Toonami marched on—its impact on anime, while not as large as it once was, still tangible. A few weeks prior to its airing on Adult Swim, Deadman Wonderland was on 59,860 user's lists on MyAnimeList. A month into Toonami's revival (June 26), it went up to appearing on 66,110 lists even though it had long since finished airing in Japan (April-July 2011). Casshern Sins—which originally aired in Japan between 2008 and 2009—went from being on 26,671 user's lists on May 4, 2012, to 28,852 on June 28, 2012. These numbers neither 100% definitively prove how many people continually tuned in to this new Toonami, nor are they even particularly earth-shattering, but they do help to further illustrate the influence Toonami was having in the early days of its revival.    Despite the perilous times Adult Swim, like a lot of broadcast television, is currently trying to navigate, Toonami has remained a fixture of Adult Swim in the ten years since its revival began. It's since aired the wildly popular likes of My Hero Academia, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, One-Punch Man, The Promised Neverland, among plenty of other such anime. While it's less of the trendsetter it once was and more of a trend reaffirmer, it still feels much more like the generation-shaping Toonami people knew and loved in the 90s/early 2000s again (as opposed to the zombified state it was in throughout 2008). And Steve Blum, by the way, is still voicing TOM. Adult Swim has also since become more involved in anime than ever by way of producing a few projects (including, but not limited to, the recently announced Housing Complex C and two new seasons of FLCL).    2022 is a unique year for Toonami, as it gets to celebrate not only the 25th anniversary of its original airing, but also the 10th anniversary of its revival. “It's just amazing to me that this is the tenth year of the Adult Swim iteration of Toonami. It's very rare that a person gets to have a second chance at creative work once it's been cancelled or wrapped up by the rights holders,” reflected DeMarco, “It's something that in our case, only happened with the unique combination of fan love and network freedom that Toonami and Adult Swim have. It's been an amazing experience for all of us at Toonami, and one that never ceases to give us joy. We just hope we are giving that joy back.”    Below is the full interview that I had with DeMarco about how Toonami got brought back from the grave:    On April 1, 2012, Toonami once again aired as an April Fools Day joke, despite its 2008 cancellation. How involved were you in the process of making this happen?   Very much so. I believe it was actually Mike Lazzo's idea in one of our brainstorming meetings we had about April Fools. He brought it up as a lark, and Gill Austin and I immediately walked out of that meeting beginning to try to figure out how to pull it off with no time and no money.    What made you (and/or Adult Swim) want to bring Toonami back after its 2008 cancellation?   Well those of us who had worked on Toonami had made our peace with its cancellation. But when we were offered a small chance to bring it back we knew we had to try. It had become clear to us in the years after it was cancelled in 2008 that there were people who WANTED it back.    How (and when) did plans to bring Toonami back start?   I believe it was two and a half months before April Fools Day 2012. Usually Adult Swim has a brainstorm about what we might do for April Fools Day on any given year, where everyone throws out ideas and we see what sticks. Mike Lazzo tossed out “what if we just brought Toonami back for a night, just switched over and it was suddenly like you were in 1999 and watching Cartoon Network?” Everyone loved the idea immediately, and the conversation very quickly moved on to “how the heck can we pull this off?”    Was the plan always to bring it back via an April Fools Day joke? If not, how did that happen?   Previous to the April Fools conversation we had, I swear, never ONCE talked in any serious way about bringing Toonami back. We just didn't think it was possible.    How did the shows that aired for this get picked?   We made a list of what we thought were the definitive Toonami shows. Then we strategized with Kim Manning, our head of programming, how best to approach distributors to see who might be willing to give us a one time license for, like, one episode of a show. We had no idea at all if any of them would work with us on such a weird request.    How was the reception to the April Fools Day joke? Any particularly memorable reactions?   It was incredible, one of the first experiences of my life where I really saw the power of social media to create a collective experience around a particular event as it unfolds. Seeing it blow up on Twitter and watching the mentions just grow, and keep growing, was amazing. All of us were texting each other that night as the event unfolded, and we all stayed up all night having a blast reading the reactions. Just a super great experience for all of us. We came in to work the following Monday still excited and talking about how amazing the response was.    The call from fans to bring back Toonami after this April Fools Day joke was pretty much immediate, and the next day Adult Swim tweeted, ""Want it back? Let us know. #BringBackToonami""--did all this directly contribute to Toonami's full revival a few months later?   Very much so. Basically the reaction to the event, combined with the responses to that Tweet, allowed us to come to Lazzo with a request to bring it back for real. Gill and I had a plan within a week and brought him a way to do it CHEAP and FAST. And thankfully he said yes. We set a target launch date, and started sprinted towards that date immediately.    10 years later, and Adult Swim is more involved in anime production than ever, such as through 2 new seasons of FLCL, Housing Complex C, and Uzumaki. How important has the revival of Toonami been to all this?   It's interesting. Obviously, anime and action have been a part of Adult Swim's DNA since the network's beginning. And even without Toonami returning, it's highly likely that Adult Swim would still be airing anime. Whether or not they would air AS MUCH anime or action, and move into original productions… I don't know. I'm gonna say that would be unlikely without a weekly Toonami block.    Any other thoughts/reflections/fun facts about Toonami's 2012 April Fools Day joke?   Refection-wise, it's just amazing to me that this is the tenth year of the Adult Swim iteration of Toonami. It's very rare that a person gets to have a second chance at creative work once it's been cancelled or wrapped up by the rights holders. It's something that in our case,  only happened with the unique combination of fan love and network freedom that Toonami and Adult Swim have. It's been an amazing experience for all of us at Toonami, and one that never ceases to give us joy. We just hope we are giving that joy back.

Enter fellow-programming block Adult Swim in the early months of 2012.    “Usually Adult Swim has a brainstorm about what we might do for April Fools Day on any given year, where everyone throws out ideas and we see what sticks,” recalled Toonami co-creator Jason DeMarco, “Mike Lazzo tossed out “what if we just brought Toonami back for a night, just switched over and it was suddenly like you were in 1999 and watching Cartoon Network?” Everyone loved the idea immediately, and the conversation very quickly moved on to “how the heck can we pull this off?””    Considering the dilapidated state of Toonami at the time of its cancellation, it comes as little shock that—per DeMarco—there hadn't been any meaningful conversations about getting it back on the air prior to this meeting. (“Previous to the April Fools conversation we had, I swear, never ONCE talked in any serious way about bringing Toonami back. We just didn't think it was possible.”) This idea to bring Toonami back for a night must've felt as sudden and out-of-the-blue as any idea possibly could've been—but this speed bump wasn't enough to stop the April Fools Toonami revival from happening.    With only a few months to plan everything, Adult Swim's work was cut out for them. “We made a list of what we thought were the definitive Toonami shows,” said DeMarco. “Then we strategized with Kim Manning, our head of programming, how best to approach distributors to see who might be willing to give us a one time license for, like, one episode of a show. We had no idea at all if any of them would work with us on such a weird request.”    Just like the original vision for this idea, the lineup Adult Swim ultimately ended up with was one that mostly felt like it could've pulled straight out of a schedule from 1999: Bleach, Dragon Ball Z, Gundam Wing, Tenchi Muyo!, Outlaw Star, The Big O, Yu-Yu Hakusho, Blue Submarine No. 6, Trigun, Astro Boy, and ending the night with Gigantor. Bleach was a particularly interesting addition to this lineup, not only because it was the only show that came out after 2000 (with the partial exceptions of The Big O and Blue Submarine No. 6, which began in late 90s but didn't finish til after the turn of the millennium), but also because it was the only show on the lineup that was an Adult Swim show, as opposed to a Toonami show. But it was, nonetheless, part of Toonami tonight. And even though Bleach wasn't traditional Toonami fare, TOM's appearance, Steve Blum's familiar voice, and the fact that any anime was airing at all was more than enough to signal to the viewers that at least for tonight, the Toonami people missed was back.     An image that started circulating at the time  As the night went on and viewers saw how increasingly nostalgic the lineup became, the reminiscent fans couldn't help but express their excitement on social media—which, importantly, also helped to rapidly spread the word that this was happening. Searching for tweets and posts with words like “Toonami” or “Dragon Ball Z” during the night of March 31-April 1, 2012 showcases the elated thoughts of countless anime fans, intent to watch Toonami until its final moments—whatever plans they had for the upcoming morning be damned. So abundant were the tweets about it that “Toonami” (and some adjacent words/phrases like “Outlaw Star”, “Gundam Wing”, etc) quickly became one of the top trending topics on Twitter that evening. Said DeMarco about the fan reactions, “It was incredible, one of the first experiences of my life where I really saw the power of social media to create a collective experience around a particular event as it unfolds. Seeing it blow up on Twitter and watching the mentions just grow, and keep growing, was amazing. All of us were texting each other that night as the event unfolded, and we all stayed up all night having a blast reading the reactions. Just a super great experience for all of us. We came in to work the following Monday still excited and talking about how amazing the response was.”    The outpouring of love from fans was so immense that while the idea of bringing Toonami back began as a joke, it suddenly no longer felt like one to Adult Swim by that next day back at work. Thus, they tweeted that fans could let them know how badly they wanted Toonami to return permanently with the hashtag #BringBackToonami. Not only did this tweet itself garner well over 10,000 retweets (and get the hashtag trending in a matter of hours), but several voice actors and prominent entities in the anime industry even made their own posts featuring the hashtag. Fan made videos, Facebook pages, and petitions dedicated to supporting the hashtag began to appear one after the other. Nerdcore rapper Richie Branson even made a rap about it (which would later be used in an Adult Swim bumper). If it wasn't already abundantly obvious (which it was), then it was now: Now that they knew what Toonami was capable of (once again) being, and that it could air on Adult Swim rather than Cartoon Network, people wanted Toonami back for real.    After a little over a month of cheers to bring back Toonami, Adult Swim finally announced on May 16 with the hashtag  #ToonamisBackBitches that it would be back on Adult Swim (presumably indefinitely) in just a few days, the late night between May 26 and 27. The lineup, it was soon announced after a few days of speculation, would be three hours long and would then repeat itself (meaning it would be on air for a total of 6 hours) and would mostly be anime that had previously aired on Adult Swim such as Bleach and Cowboy Bebop, but also the new-to-U.S.-TV titles Casshern Sins and Deadman Wonderland (shows like Naruto and Dragon Ball Z, DeMarco tweeted, were simply too expensive).    Following the announcement, exuberant forum threads, blog posts, tweets, and videos about the hashtag's success and Toonami's confirmed revival plastered the walls of every online anime community. Richie Branson even made another rap about it to celebrate. In many ways, this marriage of Toonami and Adult Swim felt like a fitting one–they were already both on the same channel, both aired in the evening/at night, and a lot of anime fans spent their younger years in a Toonami to Adult Swim pipeline anyways. This felt perfect.     Despite all the anticipation and fanfare that led up to it, whether or not the night between May 26 and 27 was more than just moderately successful for Toonami depends on who you ask. While its revival made plenty of headlines, many fans lost interest when they saw its mostly-recycled lineup (many were hoping for a higher concentration of shows that either hadn't previously aired in the U.S. or aired in the 90s) which was largely the result of time and money constraints.    “Basically the reaction to [the April Fools] event, combined with the responses to [the Adult Swim tweet about bringing back Toonami], allowed us to come to Lazzo with a request to bring it back for real,” recalled DeMarco, “Gill and I had a plan within a week and brought him a way to do it CHEAP and FAST. And thankfully he said yes. We set a target launch date, and started sprinted towards that date immediately.""    Nonetheless, when ratings came to light a few days later, while they seemed good to many (Deadman Wonderland, for example, ranked #1 in its time slot among adults age 18-24), DeMarco would describe the Toonami revival's inaugural weekend as having gone, “OKAY. Not bad but not measurably better than the week before. We need to do better. Hopefully we will!”    Encouraged by better ratings the following week, (“We're doing well! I'm encouraged.” DeMarco tweeted about it) Toonami marched on—its impact on anime, while not as large as it once was, still tangible. A few weeks prior to its airing on Adult Swim, Deadman Wonderland was on 59,860 user's lists on MyAnimeList. A month into Toonami's revival (June 26), it went up to appearing on 66,110 lists even though it had long since finished airing in Japan (April-July 2011). Casshern Sins—which originally aired in Japan between 2008 and 2009—went from being on 26,671 user's lists on May 4, 2012, to 28,852 on June 28, 2012. These numbers neither 100% definitively prove how many people continually tuned in to this new Toonami, nor are they even particularly earth-shattering, but they do help to further illustrate the influence Toonami was having in the early days of its revival.    Despite the perilous times Adult Swim, like a lot of broadcast television, is currently trying to navigate, Toonami has remained a fixture of Adult Swim in the ten years since its revival began. It's since aired the wildly popular likes of My Hero Academia, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, One-Punch Man, The Promised Neverland, among plenty of other such anime. While it's less of the trendsetter it once was and more of a trend reaffirmer, it still feels much more like the generation-shaping Toonami people knew and loved in the 90s/early 2000s again (as opposed to the zombified state it was in throughout 2008). And Steve Blum, by the way, is still voicing TOM. Adult Swim has also since become more involved in anime than ever by way of producing a few projects (including, but not limited to, the recently announced Housing Complex C and two new seasons of FLCL).    2022 is a unique year for Toonami, as it gets to celebrate not only the 25th anniversary of its original airing, but also the 10th anniversary of its revival. “It's just amazing to me that this is the tenth year of the Adult Swim iteration of Toonami. It's very rare that a person gets to have a second chance at creative work once it's been cancelled or wrapped up by the rights holders,” reflected DeMarco, “It's something that in our case, only happened with the unique combination of fan love and network freedom that Toonami and Adult Swim have. It's been an amazing experience for all of us at Toonami, and one that never ceases to give us joy. We just hope we are giving that joy back.”    Below is the full interview that I had with DeMarco about how Toonami got brought back from the grave:    On April 1, 2012, Toonami once again aired as an April Fools Day joke, despite its 2008 cancellation. How involved were you in the process of making this happen?   Very much so. I believe it was actually Mike Lazzo's idea in one of our brainstorming meetings we had about April Fools. He brought it up as a lark, and Gill Austin and I immediately walked out of that meeting beginning to try to figure out how to pull it off with no time and no money.    What made you (and/or Adult Swim) want to bring Toonami back after its 2008 cancellation?   Well those of us who had worked on Toonami had made our peace with its cancellation. But when we were offered a small chance to bring it back we knew we had to try. It had become clear to us in the years after it was cancelled in 2008 that there were people who WANTED it back.    How (and when) did plans to bring Toonami back start?   I believe it was two and a half months before April Fools Day 2012. Usually Adult Swim has a brainstorm about what we might do for April Fools Day on any given year, where everyone throws out ideas and we see what sticks. Mike Lazzo tossed out “what if we just brought Toonami back for a night, just switched over and it was suddenly like you were in 1999 and watching Cartoon Network?” Everyone loved the idea immediately, and the conversation very quickly moved on to “how the heck can we pull this off?”    Was the plan always to bring it back via an April Fools Day joke? If not, how did that happen?   Previous to the April Fools conversation we had, I swear, never ONCE talked in any serious way about bringing Toonami back. We just didn't think it was possible.    How did the shows that aired for this get picked?   We made a list of what we thought were the definitive Toonami shows. Then we strategized with Kim Manning, our head of programming, how best to approach distributors to see who might be willing to give us a one time license for, like, one episode of a show. We had no idea at all if any of them would work with us on such a weird request.    How was the reception to the April Fools Day joke? Any particularly memorable reactions?   It was incredible, one of the first experiences of my life where I really saw the power of social media to create a collective experience around a particular event as it unfolds. Seeing it blow up on Twitter and watching the mentions just grow, and keep growing, was amazing. All of us were texting each other that night as the event unfolded, and we all stayed up all night having a blast reading the reactions. Just a super great experience for all of us. We came in to work the following Monday still excited and talking about how amazing the response was.    The call from fans to bring back Toonami after this April Fools Day joke was pretty much immediate, and the next day Adult Swim tweeted, ""Want it back? Let us know. #BringBackToonami""--did all this directly contribute to Toonami's full revival a few months later?   Very much so. Basically the reaction to the event, combined with the responses to that Tweet, allowed us to come to Lazzo with a request to bring it back for real. Gill and I had a plan within a week and brought him a way to do it CHEAP and FAST. And thankfully he said yes. We set a target launch date, and started sprinted towards that date immediately.    10 years later, and Adult Swim is more involved in anime production than ever, such as through 2 new seasons of FLCL, Housing Complex C, and Uzumaki. How important has the revival of Toonami been to all this?   It's interesting. Obviously, anime and action have been a part of Adult Swim's DNA since the network's beginning. And even without Toonami returning, it's highly likely that Adult Swim would still be airing anime. Whether or not they would air AS MUCH anime or action, and move into original productions… I don't know. I'm gonna say that would be unlikely without a weekly Toonami block.    Any other thoughts/reflections/fun facts about Toonami's 2012 April Fools Day joke?   Refection-wise, it's just amazing to me that this is the tenth year of the Adult Swim iteration of Toonami. It's very rare that a person gets to have a second chance at creative work once it's been cancelled or wrapped up by the rights holders. It's something that in our case,  only happened with the unique combination of fan love and network freedom that Toonami and Adult Swim have. It's been an amazing experience for all of us at Toonami, and one that never ceases to give us joy. We just hope we are giving that joy back.

Community score: 4.7            Because the fanservice and the cosplay insights are oftentimes My Dress-Up Darling's biggest attention grabbers – as well as being some of the primary elements the show is marketed on – I was genuinely shocked when it decided to end on a note that embraces neither of those things. Instead, this episode cements My Dress-Up Darling as a romance about two characters coming into their own all along, and while I think the show could have definitely made this more of a focus earlier on, it still makes for one of the best season finales one could hope for.    In terms of narrative progression, there's not a lot that goes on in this episode. We don't really see a lot of the other characters we got introduced to outside of the main duo, and cosplay is barely even mentioned aside from one or two small conversation points (my favorite is the scene towards the beginning where Gojo isn't affected by a horror movie because he's focusing so hard on things like the makeup and costume design). This is just an episode about Gojo and Kitagawa living out the last days of their summer break, spending time together and fortifying the foundation of their relationship that has been slowly building up to this point. We get scenes of Kitagawa getting in over her head and needing to rely on Gojo to help keep her steady, and it's clear that Gojo appreciates Kitagawa for taking him out to experience things that he never really got the chance to. It's not like there was really anything stopping him from experiencing these things on his own, but this boy had grown to be so accepting of his loneliness due to his childhood trauma that he probably just came to his own conclusion that he could never be a part of social gatherings like that. So Kitagawa not only going with him to the festival but also casually bringing up that they will do more things together next year means the world to him, and those quiet moments where he's just staring off into the scenery or appreciating the beautiful ball of energy that steamrolled into his life genuinely moved me.    A couple reviews ago I mentioned how I almost didn't want these two to get together too quickly despite Kitagawa realizing her feelings for Gojo early on, as I think the characters needed to come to terms with how they view themselves before they would be ready to commit to something like a romantic relationship. This episode was definitely a step in that direction as Gojo begins to further appreciate and accept the fact that he does not need to be alone anymore while Kitagawa continues to rely on Gojo as a source of support and understanding. I love these two characters and I look forward to the day when I might be able to see them come together as equals. Despite all of the unabashed horniness and some questionable and borderline problematic practices the show touches upon, you will never convince me that My Dress Up Darling doesn't have a heart. It might take some time to get it, and some might feel like it's not worth trying to find in the first place, but that heart was strong enough to carry me all the way to the end of the show and also consider it one of the better slice of life anime that I've seen in a bit.

It's not like there was really anything stopping him from experiencing these things on his own, but this boy had grown to be so accepting of his loneliness due to his childhood trauma that he probably just came to his own conclusion that he could never be a part of social gatherings like that. So Kitagawa not only going with him to the festival but also casually bringing up that they will do more things together next year means the world to him, and those quiet moments where he's just staring off into the scenery or appreciating the beautiful ball of energy that steamrolled into his life genuinely moved me.    A couple reviews ago I mentioned how I almost didn't want these two to get together too quickly despite Kitagawa realizing her feelings for Gojo early on, as I think the characters needed to come to terms with how they view themselves before they would be ready to commit to something like a romantic relationship. This episode was definitely a step in that direction as Gojo begins to further appreciate and accept the fact that he does not need to be alone anymore while Kitagawa continues to rely on Gojo as a source of support and understanding. I love these two characters and I look forward to the day when I might be able to see them come together as equals. Despite all of the unabashed horniness and some questionable and borderline problematic practices the show touches upon, you will never convince me that My Dress Up Darling doesn't have a heart. It might take some time to get it, and some might feel like it's not worth trying to find in the first place, but that heart was strong enough to carry me all the way to the end of the show and also consider it one of the better slice of life anime that I've seen in a bit.

Community score: 3.6              What is this?   Leo is a hero who once saved the world from a demon army's invasion. However, he was feared and ostracized by people afterward, and ended up with no job. Feeling that his skills would be better appreciated elsewhere, he joins the demon lord's army that he once fought. Now in a new work environment, Leo strives to use his skills and revive the demon army that is on the brink of collapse.    I'm Quitting Heroing is based on Quantum and Hana Amano's fantasy light novel series and streams on HIDIVE on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                You know, I have to give I'm Quitting Heroing some credit. It's not a premise I've encountered before, which can be very valuable when it feels like half the series that come out each season are variations on the same three themes. It also gets off to a strong start, with Leo marching himself into the Demon Lord's castle and proudly presenting his resume. His blunt, arrogant, and somewhat abrasive personality kind of sucks and he knows it, but he's also confident that his skills more than make up for his social deficiencies.    With the first few minutes dedicated to some solid physical comedy and character-based gags, I was ready to lean in and accept that hey, maybe this isn't the anime for me, but it's still pretty fun. The character designs are attractive and varied without being totally hackneyed; plus, one of them has very similar energy to Iskander from Fate/Zero, and I kind of love that. By the time Leo was meeting with the Four Generals in the boardroom, I had settled in for a good, solid 3.5 star premiere. Not my thing necessarily, but a solid recommendation for people who read the summary and think it sounds like something they'd enjoy.    But then the flashbacks start. Leo talks about how he defeated each of the Four Generals while black and white depictions of what he's describing play on screen. It's half showing, half telling, all redundancy, and it really sucks all the oxygen out of the room. It's too abbreviated for any kind of decent action, but there aren't really any jokes there either. It gives us a little information about each character, but mostly shows off what kind of archetype they are, along with reiterating that Leo is really, really strong. My eyes started to glaze over but hey, at least it handled Lily's crush on Leo without being really creepy about it.    And then! And then! It slides straight into melodrama as Leo tells the Four Generals how he ended up deciding to join them in yet another gray-tinged flashback and by now I am checked out. We've gone straight from “fun romp” to “whiny slog” in the space of less than an episode, and I need someone to go out and buy me a neck brace because I am seriously suffering from tonal whiplash. It's a real galaxy-brained choice to make the first episode almost entirely backstory, and I don't mean that in the good way. It stops the story in its tracks before it can even get going. It has the stink of an overly-faithful adaptation of an under-edited light novel to it, and I'm not holding my nose for it.        James Beckett  Rating:               Watching a premiere like the one we get with I'm Quitting Heroing is like eating a Hot Pocket for dinner. You know that it isn't going to be very healthy, or filling, or even very tasty. As you spend two-to-three minutes watching the little meat-and-cheese pastry spin around on the microwave plate, secure in its patented “crispy sleeve” or whatever the hell it's called,  you will have plenty of time to ask yourself the important questions: “Is this really what I'm going to settle for?” “Surely, there must have been something better to choose from than this?” “How many years is eating this mass-produced and possibly irradiated junk food going to take off my life, anyways?” Then you eat the thing, and it's…fine. It's technically food. It contains plenty of sugars and empty calories to keep your body functioning for a few hours more. It could have been worse, probably. It could have been a Lean Pocket.    Anyways, you all know the drill with these overlong food metaphors: They indicate that the subject being reviewed is too bland and featureless to inspire much thought-provoking criticism, so the writer in question had to reach just to find an interesting way of saying that they were mildly but not offensively bored by the whole experience. Also, I'm very hungry as I'm writing this.    I didn't hate I'm Quitting Heroing. It's just that, as a generic workplace comedy twist on even more generic anime fantasy tropes, there is literally nothing about the cast or the story that we haven't seen done ten thousand times before already. The main character is named “Leo Demonheart” for crying out loud. He and all of the Demon Queen's generals look and sound like they were yanked right out of the Default Templates folder you'd find on a vanilla install of RPG Maker.    A couple of the jokes in this episode made me laugh, and at no point did the main guy behave in a way that was creepy or irritating. The episode didn't feel any longer than its 23-minute runtime (though it didn't exactly breeze by, either). So, while I didn't like anything about I'm Quitting Heroing, I didn't actively hate my time with it either. It just sort of exists, designed to be consumed and immediately forgotten, like so many of the cheap frozen dinners that have come and gone throughout the college dorms of the world.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               The premise of this series boils down to a single question: “What happens to the hero after they win?” You may want the legendary hero around when there's an army of invading demons led by an all-powerful Demon Lord, but the moment the hero is triumphant, the whole situation changes. Now you have someone powerful enough to take down the ultimate evil—without the evil part of the equation. This begets fear in the general population which then turns to anger. Soon they will want him gone—if not dead then at least out of sight and out of mind.    This is doubly true in the case of Leo who is a hero so overpowered, he single-handedly took out not only the Demon Lord's army but the Demon Lord and her four generals as well. So what does he do when he is abandoned by all those he worked to save? He sets off to join the remnants of the Demon Lord's army. After all, they will surely accept him since they've seen how effective he is—won't they?    It's a solid premise with a lot of potential for both comedy and drama. But in setting it up, this whole episode becomes little more than a giant backstory dump. We meet the Demon Lord (however briefly) and get introduced to the four generals. Each of the four are walking fantasy stereotypes but this is played for comedy by showing how easily Leo beat them by exploiting their obvious weaknesses. Normally that alone is not enough to carry the episode, but thankfully Leo himself is able to pick up the slack.    Leo is a deeply flawed person. He has ungodly amounts of power and an ego to match. Because of this, he just expects things to work out in his favor and seems more than a little confused when they don't (though he rebounds quickly). But what makes Leo interesting is the simple fact that he doesn't seem to care about anything. He doesn't care about his fellow humans or the things they hold dear. He likewise doesn't care about the demons and all the pain and suffering he has personally put them through.    He doesn't even really seem to care about himself. Even when he is exiled, he doesn't get angry or go on a killing spree like the people fear, he just kind of becomes aimless. It's not like he forgives the people for casting him aside but it seems to roll off of him like something that can't be helped. This is equal parts intriguing and unsettling. Behind the jokes, we have this mystery of a broken man and what made him become this way. And for me, that's enough to give it another watch next week.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Even if you don't admire Leo's chutzpah for waltzing into the castle of the very demon lord he just defeated and asking for a job, you have to give him credit for realizing that he was fighting on the wrong side before. This wouldn't be the first title to posit that humans are the real monsters, and while it isn't necessarily going to be expanded upon here, that line of reasoning is very much open in this first episode. That Leo, after realizing that he wasn't doing great work with a party, took it upon himself to fight Echidna the Demon Queen and her four generals, only to be completely rejected by the very humans he was fighting for after defeating them, is a good demonstration of what's wrong with the story's world. In another show, I might say that it was an indication of what's wrong with the basic narrative of good versus evil, but I honestly don't think that's what this series is going for.    What it does appear to be working towards is a simple role reversal: Leo wasn't respected as a hero, so he's going to try his luck as a villain. He knows the road will be a tricky one, seeing as how he was the instrument of the demons' defeat, but he's also tired, emotionally wounded, and really, really sick of living in a cave since he was banished from the very kingdom he saved. I wouldn't blame him if he had a serious grudge; that he doesn't appear to seems to indicate that this is going to be more of a lighthearted piece – or at least as lighthearted as it can be when there's war involved. Not that anyone seems all that keen on attacking the humans again, Leo included. In part that may be due to the drubbing the demons took, but it's just as likely to be because absolutely nobody involved has any taste for logistics. Since Leo came equipped with handouts, graphs, and a resumé, I think we can assume that planning and other logistical tasks are in his wheelhouse.    Despite all of this relatively interesting information and a decent premise, the episode is kind of dull. Most of it is Leo explaining things, both to his prospective employers and to us in the audience, and while there's some animation, it's not very exciting. Lily's constantly wagging tail is cute, and the scene where Leo returns to town after defeating Echidna has the right uncomfortable balance, but if you don't love exposition, this may be a real slog. It has potential in Leo using his skills to turn things around for the people he previously defeated, but I could see the drag of this episode turning people off.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Just off the bat, I hate this title. Sure, it's succinct enough and doesn't have an overlong subtitle, but “Heroing” is such a clunky word that just never looks right when I read it. The show itself is perfectly alright so far – maybe a little too muddled on whether it wants to take its premise seriously or treat it entirely as a farce – but overall this premiere isn't a bad sit. But that title? Terrible. Awful. My phone keeps auto-correcting it to “I'm Quitting Heroin” and I don't need that kind of mistake in my work e-mails. As protest I'm going to call this one I Quit for the rest of time.    Anyway, the actual premise of I Quit is a solid enough one, though I can't shake the feeling of having seen so many parts of it done better in other shows. I'm also just really tired of over-powered heroes wallowing in how being a LVL 99 Übermensch isn't as fun as they always thought it would be. So Leo himself is kind of a bore throughout this premiere whenever he's supposed to be taken seriously. Thankfully he's a lot more charming when he's played as an obtuse jerk who can't stop talking about how he's so much stronger than the demon army he's trying to get a job at. He's a jerk, sure, but his casual ego gives him some personality and lets him bounce off the other characters in this episode in a way that's funny more often than not.    Though there aren't really any laugh-out-loud moments in this episode, mostly because a lot of it is used for building up the same joke four or five times in a row. Yep, Leo sure is way stronger than everyone else and he totally punked out the demon generals! We definitely needed to see that gag run through the wash multiple times across the episode. Doesn't help that while some of the Generals at least sass him back, a couple of them just roll with Leo's obnoxious personality. Jokes like this one need some real friction to be funny, and that's in short supply across too much of this premiere. I'm especially not a fan of the underage beast-girl who's declared she wants to marry him. The show hasn't yet used her for obvious fanservice, but the prospect of seeing more of that is a pretty good motivator to not watch another episode.    And it didn't really need more help in that endeavor. While there's nothing particularly bad about this premiere, it also just doesn't do much that's interesting or compelling. Maybe it's the generic art style and character designs, maybe it's just the show splitting itself too much between a wacky comedy and a serious story of a banished hero joining the “dark side” –  either way, not being bad or objectionable isn't the same as being good, and I can't give much enthusiasm for a show that leaves such little impression.     discuss this in the forum (290 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 3.6              What is this?   Leo is a hero who once saved the world from a demon army's invasion. However, he was feared and ostracized by people afterward, and ended up with no job. Feeling that his skills would be better appreciated elsewhere, he joins the demon lord's army that he once fought. Now in a new work environment, Leo strives to use his skills and revive the demon army that is on the brink of collapse.    I'm Quitting Heroing is based on Quantum and Hana Amano's fantasy light novel series and streams on HIDIVE on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                You know, I have to give I'm Quitting Heroing some credit. It's not a premise I've encountered before, which can be very valuable when it feels like half the series that come out each season are variations on the same three themes. It also gets off to a strong start, with Leo marching himself into the Demon Lord's castle and proudly presenting his resume. His blunt, arrogant, and somewhat abrasive personality kind of sucks and he knows it, but he's also confident that his skills more than make up for his social deficiencies.    With the first few minutes dedicated to some solid physical comedy and character-based gags, I was ready to lean in and accept that hey, maybe this isn't the anime for me, but it's still pretty fun. The character designs are attractive and varied without being totally hackneyed; plus, one of them has very similar energy to Iskander from Fate/Zero, and I kind of love that. By the time Leo was meeting with the Four Generals in the boardroom, I had settled in for a good, solid 3.5 star premiere. Not my thing necessarily, but a solid recommendation for people who read the summary and think it sounds like something they'd enjoy.    But then the flashbacks start. Leo talks about how he defeated each of the Four Generals while black and white depictions of what he's describing play on screen. It's half showing, half telling, all redundancy, and it really sucks all the oxygen out of the room. It's too abbreviated for any kind of decent action, but there aren't really any jokes there either. It gives us a little information about each character, but mostly shows off what kind of archetype they are, along with reiterating that Leo is really, really strong. My eyes started to glaze over but hey, at least it handled Lily's crush on Leo without being really creepy about it.    And then! And then! It slides straight into melodrama as Leo tells the Four Generals how he ended up deciding to join them in yet another gray-tinged flashback and by now I am checked out. We've gone straight from “fun romp” to “whiny slog” in the space of less than an episode, and I need someone to go out and buy me a neck brace because I am seriously suffering from tonal whiplash. It's a real galaxy-brained choice to make the first episode almost entirely backstory, and I don't mean that in the good way. It stops the story in its tracks before it can even get going. It has the stink of an overly-faithful adaptation of an under-edited light novel to it, and I'm not holding my nose for it.        James Beckett  Rating:               Watching a premiere like the one we get with I'm Quitting Heroing is like eating a Hot Pocket for dinner. You know that it isn't going to be very healthy, or filling, or even very tasty. As you spend two-to-three minutes watching the little meat-and-cheese pastry spin around on the microwave plate, secure in its patented “crispy sleeve” or whatever the hell it's called,  you will have plenty of time to ask yourself the important questions: “Is this really what I'm going to settle for?” “Surely, there must have been something better to choose from than this?” “How many years is eating this mass-produced and possibly irradiated junk food going to take off my life, anyways?” Then you eat the thing, and it's…fine. It's technically food. It contains plenty of sugars and empty calories to keep your body functioning for a few hours more. It could have been worse, probably. It could have been a Lean Pocket.    Anyways, you all know the drill with these overlong food metaphors: They indicate that the subject being reviewed is too bland and featureless to inspire much thought-provoking criticism, so the writer in question had to reach just to find an interesting way of saying that they were mildly but not offensively bored by the whole experience. Also, I'm very hungry as I'm writing this.    I didn't hate I'm Quitting Heroing. It's just that, as a generic workplace comedy twist on even more generic anime fantasy tropes, there is literally nothing about the cast or the story that we haven't seen done ten thousand times before already. The main character is named “Leo Demonheart” for crying out loud. He and all of the Demon Queen's generals look and sound like they were yanked right out of the Default Templates folder you'd find on a vanilla install of RPG Maker.    A couple of the jokes in this episode made me laugh, and at no point did the main guy behave in a way that was creepy or irritating. The episode didn't feel any longer than its 23-minute runtime (though it didn't exactly breeze by, either). So, while I didn't like anything about I'm Quitting Heroing, I didn't actively hate my time with it either. It just sort of exists, designed to be consumed and immediately forgotten, like so many of the cheap frozen dinners that have come and gone throughout the college dorms of the world.

In another show, I might say that it was an indication of what's wrong with the basic narrative of good versus evil, but I honestly don't think that's what this series is going for.    What it does appear to be working towards is a simple role reversal: Leo wasn't respected as a hero, so he's going to try his luck as a villain. He knows the road will be a tricky one, seeing as how he was the instrument of the demons' defeat, but he's also tired, emotionally wounded, and really, really sick of living in a cave since he was banished from the very kingdom he saved. I wouldn't blame him if he had a serious grudge; that he doesn't appear to seems to indicate that this is going to be more of a lighthearted piece – or at least as lighthearted as it can be when there's war involved. Not that anyone seems all that keen on attacking the humans again, Leo included. In part that may be due to the drubbing the demons took, but it's just as likely to be because absolutely nobody involved has any taste for logistics. Since Leo came equipped with handouts, graphs, and a resumé, I think we can assume that planning and other logistical tasks are in his wheelhouse.    Despite all of this relatively interesting information and a decent premise, the episode is kind of dull. Most of it is Leo explaining things, both to his prospective employers and to us in the audience, and while there's some animation, it's not very exciting. Lily's constantly wagging tail is cute, and the scene where Leo returns to town after defeating Echidna has the right uncomfortable balance, but if you don't love exposition, this may be a real slog. It has potential in Leo using his skills to turn things around for the people he previously defeated, but I could see the drag of this episode turning people off.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Just off the bat, I hate this title. Sure, it's succinct enough and doesn't have an overlong subtitle, but “Heroing” is such a clunky word that just never looks right when I read it. The show itself is perfectly alright so far – maybe a little too muddled on whether it wants to take its premise seriously or treat it entirely as a farce – but overall this premiere isn't a bad sit. But that title? Terrible. Awful. My phone keeps auto-correcting it to “I'm Quitting Heroin” and I don't need that kind of mistake in my work e-mails. As protest I'm going to call this one I Quit for the rest of time.    Anyway, the actual premise of I Quit is a solid enough one, though I can't shake the feeling of having seen so many parts of it done better in other shows. I'm also just really tired of over-powered heroes wallowing in how being a LVL 99 Übermensch isn't as fun as they always thought it would be. So Leo himself is kind of a bore throughout this premiere whenever he's supposed to be taken seriously. Thankfully he's a lot more charming when he's played as an obtuse jerk who can't stop talking about how he's so much stronger than the demon army he's trying to get a job at. He's a jerk, sure, but his casual ego gives him some personality and lets him bounce off the other characters in this episode in a way that's funny more often than not.    Though there aren't really any laugh-out-loud moments in this episode, mostly because a lot of it is used for building up the same joke four or five times in a row. Yep, Leo sure is way stronger than everyone else and he totally punked out the demon generals! We definitely needed to see that gag run through the wash multiple times across the episode. Doesn't help that while some of the Generals at least sass him back, a couple of them just roll with Leo's obnoxious personality. Jokes like this one need some real friction to be funny, and that's in short supply across too much of this premiere. I'm especially not a fan of the underage beast-girl who's declared she wants to marry him. The show hasn't yet used her for obvious fanservice, but the prospect of seeing more of that is a pretty good motivator to not watch another episode.    And it didn't really need more help in that endeavor. While there's nothing particularly bad about this premiere, it also just doesn't do much that's interesting or compelling. Maybe it's the generic art style and character designs, maybe it's just the show splitting itself too much between a wacky comedy and a serious story of a banished hero joining the “dark side” –  either way, not being bad or objectionable isn't the same as being good, and I can't give much enthusiasm for a show that leaves such little impression.     discuss this in the forum (290 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives    ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"
14-04-2022,anime,2,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/preview-guide/2022/spring/im-quitting-heroing/.183521,I'm Quitting Heroing - The Spring 2022 Preview Guide - Anime News Network:SEA,"                How would you rate episode 1 of I'm Quitting Heroing ?                     Community score: 3.6              What is this?   Leo is a hero who once saved the world from a demon army's invasion. However, he was feared and ostracized by people afterward, and ended up with no job. Feeling that his skills would be better appreciated elsewhere, he joins the demon lord's army that he once fought. Now in a new work environment, Leo strives to use his skills and revive the demon army that is on the brink of collapse.    I'm Quitting Heroing is based on Quantum and Hana Amano's fantasy light novel series and streams on HIDIVE on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                You know, I have to give I'm Quitting Heroing some credit. It's not a premise I've encountered before, which can be very valuable when it feels like half the series that come out each season are variations on the same three themes. It also gets off to a strong start, with Leo marching himself into the Demon Lord's castle and proudly presenting his resume. His blunt, arrogant, and somewhat abrasive personality kind of sucks and he knows it, but he's also confident that his skills more than make up for his social deficiencies.    With the first few minutes dedicated to some solid physical comedy and character-based gags, I was ready to lean in and accept that hey, maybe this isn't the anime for me, but it's still pretty fun. The character designs are attractive and varied without being totally hackneyed; plus, one of them has very similar energy to Iskander from Fate/Zero, and I kind of love that. By the time Leo was meeting with the Four Generals in the boardroom, I had settled in for a good, solid 3.5 star premiere. Not my thing necessarily, but a solid recommendation for people who read the summary and think it sounds like something they'd enjoy.    But then the flashbacks start. Leo talks about how he defeated each of the Four Generals while black and white depictions of what he's describing play on screen. It's half showing, half telling, all redundancy, and it really sucks all the oxygen out of the room. It's too abbreviated for any kind of decent action, but there aren't really any jokes there either. It gives us a little information about each character, but mostly shows off what kind of archetype they are, along with reiterating that Leo is really, really strong. My eyes started to glaze over but hey, at least it handled Lily's crush on Leo without being really creepy about it.    And then! And then! It slides straight into melodrama as Leo tells the Four Generals how he ended up deciding to join them in yet another gray-tinged flashback and by now I am checked out. We've gone straight from “fun romp” to “whiny slog” in the space of less than an episode, and I need someone to go out and buy me a neck brace because I am seriously suffering from tonal whiplash. It's a real galaxy-brained choice to make the first episode almost entirely backstory, and I don't mean that in the good way. It stops the story in its tracks before it can even get going. It has the stink of an overly-faithful adaptation of an under-edited light novel to it, and I'm not holding my nose for it.        James Beckett  Rating:               Watching a premiere like the one we get with I'm Quitting Heroing is like eating a Hot Pocket for dinner. You know that it isn't going to be very healthy, or filling, or even very tasty. As you spend two-to-three minutes watching the little meat-and-cheese pastry spin around on the microwave plate, secure in its patented “crispy sleeve” or whatever the hell it's called,  you will have plenty of time to ask yourself the important questions: “Is this really what I'm going to settle for?” “Surely, there must have been something better to choose from than this?” “How many years is eating this mass-produced and possibly irradiated junk food going to take off my life, anyways?” Then you eat the thing, and it's…fine. It's technically food. It contains plenty of sugars and empty calories to keep your body functioning for a few hours more. It could have been worse, probably. It could have been a Lean Pocket.    Anyways, you all know the drill with these overlong food metaphors: They indicate that the subject being reviewed is too bland and featureless to inspire much thought-provoking criticism, so the writer in question had to reach just to find an interesting way of saying that they were mildly but not offensively bored by the whole experience. Also, I'm very hungry as I'm writing this.    I didn't hate I'm Quitting Heroing. It's just that, as a generic workplace comedy twist on even more generic anime fantasy tropes, there is literally nothing about the cast or the story that we haven't seen done ten thousand times before already. The main character is named “Leo Demonheart” for crying out loud. He and all of the Demon Queen's generals look and sound like they were yanked right out of the Default Templates folder you'd find on a vanilla install of RPG Maker.    A couple of the jokes in this episode made me laugh, and at no point did the main guy behave in a way that was creepy or irritating. The episode didn't feel any longer than its 23-minute runtime (though it didn't exactly breeze by, either). So, while I didn't like anything about I'm Quitting Heroing, I didn't actively hate my time with it either. It just sort of exists, designed to be consumed and immediately forgotten, like so many of the cheap frozen dinners that have come and gone throughout the college dorms of the world.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               The premise of this series boils down to a single question: “What happens to the hero after they win?” You may want the legendary hero around when there's an army of invading demons led by an all-powerful Demon Lord, but the moment the hero is triumphant, the whole situation changes. Now you have someone powerful enough to take down the ultimate evil—without the evil part of the equation. This begets fear in the general population which then turns to anger. Soon they will want him gone—if not dead then at least out of sight and out of mind.    This is doubly true in the case of Leo who is a hero so overpowered, he single-handedly took out not only the Demon Lord's army but the Demon Lord and her four generals as well. So what does he do when he is abandoned by all those he worked to save? He sets off to join the remnants of the Demon Lord's army. After all, they will surely accept him since they've seen how effective he is—won't they?    It's a solid premise with a lot of potential for both comedy and drama. But in setting it up, this whole episode becomes little more than a giant backstory dump. We meet the Demon Lord (however briefly) and get introduced to the four generals. Each of the four are walking fantasy stereotypes but this is played for comedy by showing how easily Leo beat them by exploiting their obvious weaknesses. Normally that alone is not enough to carry the episode, but thankfully Leo himself is able to pick up the slack.    Leo is a deeply flawed person. He has ungodly amounts of power and an ego to match. Because of this, he just expects things to work out in his favor and seems more than a little confused when they don't (though he rebounds quickly). But what makes Leo interesting is the simple fact that he doesn't seem to care about anything. He doesn't care about his fellow humans or the things they hold dear. He likewise doesn't care about the demons and all the pain and suffering he has personally put them through.    He doesn't even really seem to care about himself. Even when he is exiled, he doesn't get angry or go on a killing spree like the people fear, he just kind of becomes aimless. It's not like he forgives the people for casting him aside but it seems to roll off of him like something that can't be helped. This is equal parts intriguing and unsettling. Behind the jokes, we have this mystery of a broken man and what made him become this way. And for me, that's enough to give it another watch next week.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Even if you don't admire Leo's chutzpah for waltzing into the castle of the very demon lord he just defeated and asking for a job, you have to give him credit for realizing that he was fighting on the wrong side before. This wouldn't be the first title to posit that humans are the real monsters, and while it isn't necessarily going to be expanded upon here, that line of reasoning is very much open in this first episode.

Though there aren't really any laugh-out-loud moments in this episode, mostly because a lot of it is used for building up the same joke four or five times in a row. Yep, Leo sure is way stronger than everyone else and he totally punked out the demon generals! We definitely needed to see that gag run through the wash multiple times across the episode. Doesn't help that while some of the Generals at least sass him back, a couple of them just roll with Leo's obnoxious personality. Jokes like this one need some real friction to be funny, and that's in short supply across too much of this premiere. I'm especially not a fan of the underage beast-girl who's declared she wants to marry him. The show hasn't yet used her for obvious fanservice, but the prospect of seeing more of that is a pretty good motivator to not watch another episode.    And it didn't really need more help in that endeavor. While there's nothing particularly bad about this premiere, it also just doesn't do much that's interesting or compelling. Maybe it's the generic art style and character designs, maybe it's just the show splitting itself too much between a wacky comedy and a serious story of a banished hero joining the “dark side” –  either way, not being bad or objectionable isn't the same as being good, and I can't give much enthusiasm for a show that leaves such little impression.

14-04-2022,anime,2,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/preview-guide/2022/spring/im-quitting-heroing/.183521,I'm Quitting Heroing - The Spring 2022 Preview Guide - Anime News Network:SEA,"            How would you rate episode 1 of I'm Quitting Heroing ?                     Community score: 3.6              What is this?   Leo is a hero who once saved the world from a demon army's invasion. However, he was feared and ostracized by people afterward, and ended up with no job. Feeling that his skills would be better appreciated elsewhere, he joins the demon lord's army that he once fought. Now in a new work environment, Leo strives to use his skills and revive the demon army that is on the brink of collapse.    I'm Quitting Heroing is based on Quantum and Hana Amano's fantasy light novel series and streams on HIDIVE on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                You know, I have to give I'm Quitting Heroing some credit. It's not a premise I've encountered before, which can be very valuable when it feels like half the series that come out each season are variations on the same three themes. It also gets off to a strong start, with Leo marching himself into the Demon Lord's castle and proudly presenting his resume. His blunt, arrogant, and somewhat abrasive personality kind of sucks and he knows it, but he's also confident that his skills more than make up for his social deficiencies.    With the first few minutes dedicated to some solid physical comedy and character-based gags, I was ready to lean in and accept that hey, maybe this isn't the anime for me, but it's still pretty fun. The character designs are attractive and varied without being totally hackneyed; plus, one of them has very similar energy to Iskander from Fate/Zero, and I kind of love that. By the time Leo was meeting with the Four Generals in the boardroom, I had settled in for a good, solid 3.5 star premiere. Not my thing necessarily, but a solid recommendation for people who read the summary and think it sounds like something they'd enjoy.    But then the flashbacks start. Leo talks about how he defeated each of the Four Generals while black and white depictions of what he's describing play on screen. It's half showing, half telling, all redundancy, and it really sucks all the oxygen out of the room. It's too abbreviated for any kind of decent action, but there aren't really any jokes there either. It gives us a little information about each character, but mostly shows off what kind of archetype they are, along with reiterating that Leo is really, really strong. My eyes started to glaze over but hey, at least it handled Lily's crush on Leo without being really creepy about it.    And then! And then! It slides straight into melodrama as Leo tells the Four Generals how he ended up deciding to join them in yet another gray-tinged flashback and by now I am checked out. We've gone straight from “fun romp” to “whiny slog” in the space of less than an episode, and I need someone to go out and buy me a neck brace because I am seriously suffering from tonal whiplash. It's a real galaxy-brained choice to make the first episode almost entirely backstory, and I don't mean that in the good way. It stops the story in its tracks before it can even get going. It has the stink of an overly-faithful adaptation of an under-edited light novel to it, and I'm not holding my nose for it.        James Beckett  Rating:               Watching a premiere like the one we get with I'm Quitting Heroing is like eating a Hot Pocket for dinner. You know that it isn't going to be very healthy, or filling, or even very tasty. As you spend two-to-three minutes watching the little meat-and-cheese pastry spin around on the microwave plate, secure in its patented “crispy sleeve” or whatever the hell it's called,  you will have plenty of time to ask yourself the important questions: “Is this really what I'm going to settle for?” “Surely, there must have been something better to choose from than this?” “How many years is eating this mass-produced and possibly irradiated junk food going to take off my life, anyways?” Then you eat the thing, and it's…fine. It's technically food. It contains plenty of sugars and empty calories to keep your body functioning for a few hours more. It could have been worse, probably. It could have been a Lean Pocket.    Anyways, you all know the drill with these overlong food metaphors: They indicate that the subject being reviewed is too bland and featureless to inspire much thought-provoking criticism, so the writer in question had to reach just to find an interesting way of saying that they were mildly but not offensively bored by the whole experience. Also, I'm very hungry as I'm writing this.    I didn't hate I'm Quitting Heroing. It's just that, as a generic workplace comedy twist on even more generic anime fantasy tropes, there is literally nothing about the cast or the story that we haven't seen done ten thousand times before already. The main character is named “Leo Demonheart” for crying out loud. He and all of the Demon Queen's generals look and sound like they were yanked right out of the Default Templates folder you'd find on a vanilla install of RPG Maker.    A couple of the jokes in this episode made me laugh, and at no point did the main guy behave in a way that was creepy or irritating. The episode didn't feel any longer than its 23-minute runtime (though it didn't exactly breeze by, either). So, while I didn't like anything about I'm Quitting Heroing, I didn't actively hate my time with it either. It just sort of exists, designed to be consumed and immediately forgotten, like so many of the cheap frozen dinners that have come and gone throughout the college dorms of the world.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               The premise of this series boils down to a single question: “What happens to the hero after they win?” You may want the legendary hero around when there's an army of invading demons led by an all-powerful Demon Lord, but the moment the hero is triumphant, the whole situation changes. Now you have someone powerful enough to take down the ultimate evil—without the evil part of the equation. This begets fear in the general population which then turns to anger. Soon they will want him gone—if not dead then at least out of sight and out of mind.    This is doubly true in the case of Leo who is a hero so overpowered, he single-handedly took out not only the Demon Lord's army but the Demon Lord and her four generals as well. So what does he do when he is abandoned by all those he worked to save? He sets off to join the remnants of the Demon Lord's army. After all, they will surely accept him since they've seen how effective he is—won't they?    It's a solid premise with a lot of potential for both comedy and drama. But in setting it up, this whole episode becomes little more than a giant backstory dump. We meet the Demon Lord (however briefly) and get introduced to the four generals. Each of the four are walking fantasy stereotypes but this is played for comedy by showing how easily Leo beat them by exploiting their obvious weaknesses. Normally that alone is not enough to carry the episode, but thankfully Leo himself is able to pick up the slack.    Leo is a deeply flawed person. He has ungodly amounts of power and an ego to match. Because of this, he just expects things to work out in his favor and seems more than a little confused when they don't (though he rebounds quickly). But what makes Leo interesting is the simple fact that he doesn't seem to care about anything. He doesn't care about his fellow humans or the things they hold dear. He likewise doesn't care about the demons and all the pain and suffering he has personally put them through.    He doesn't even really seem to care about himself. Even when he is exiled, he doesn't get angry or go on a killing spree like the people fear, he just kind of becomes aimless. It's not like he forgives the people for casting him aside but it seems to roll off of him like something that can't be helped. This is equal parts intriguing and unsettling. Behind the jokes, we have this mystery of a broken man and what made him become this way. And for me, that's enough to give it another watch next week.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Even if you don't admire Leo's chutzpah for waltzing into the castle of the very demon lord he just defeated and asking for a job, you have to give him credit for realizing that he was fighting on the wrong side before. This wouldn't be the first title to posit that humans are the real monsters, and while it isn't necessarily going to be expanded upon here, that line of reasoning is very much open in this first episode. That Leo, after realizing that he wasn't doing great work with a party, took it upon himself to fight Echidna the Demon Queen and her four generals, only to be completely rejected by the very humans he was fighting for after defeating them, is a good demonstration of what's wrong with the story's world. In another show, I might say that it was an indication of what's wrong with the basic narrative of good versus evil, but I honestly don't think that's what this series is going for.    What it does appear to be working towards is a simple role reversal: Leo wasn't respected as a hero, so he's going to try his luck as a villain. He knows the road will be a tricky one, seeing as how he was the instrument of the demons' defeat, but he's also tired, emotionally wounded, and really, really sick of living in a cave since he was banished from the very kingdom he saved. I wouldn't blame him if he had a serious grudge; that he doesn't appear to seems to indicate that this is going to be more of a lighthearted piece – or at least as lighthearted as it can be when there's war involved. Not that anyone seems all that keen on attacking the humans again, Leo included. In part that may be due to the drubbing the demons took, but it's just as likely to be because absolutely nobody involved has any taste for logistics. Since Leo came equipped with handouts, graphs, and a resumé, I think we can assume that planning and other logistical tasks are in his wheelhouse.    Despite all of this relatively interesting information and a decent premise, the episode is kind of dull. Most of it is Leo explaining things, both to his prospective employers and to us in the audience, and while there's some animation, it's not very exciting. Lily's constantly wagging tail is cute, and the scene where Leo returns to town after defeating Echidna has the right uncomfortable balance, but if you don't love exposition, this may be a real slog. It has potential in Leo using his skills to turn things around for the people he previously defeated, but I could see the drag of this episode turning people off.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Just off the bat, I hate this title. Sure, it's succinct enough and doesn't have an overlong subtitle, but “Heroing” is such a clunky word that just never looks right when I read it. The show itself is perfectly alright so far – maybe a little too muddled on whether it wants to take its premise seriously or treat it entirely as a farce – but overall this premiere isn't a bad sit. But that title? Terrible. Awful. My phone keeps auto-correcting it to “I'm Quitting Heroin” and I don't need that kind of mistake in my work e-mails. As protest I'm going to call this one I Quit for the rest of time.    Anyway, the actual premise of I Quit is a solid enough one, though I can't shake the feeling of having seen so many parts of it done better in other shows. I'm also just really tired of over-powered heroes wallowing in how being a LVL 99 Übermensch isn't as fun as they always thought it would be. So Leo himself is kind of a bore throughout this premiere whenever he's supposed to be taken seriously. Thankfully he's a lot more charming when he's played as an obtuse jerk who can't stop talking about how he's so much stronger than the demon army he's trying to get a job at. He's a jerk, sure, but his casual ego gives him some personality and lets him bounce off the other characters in this episode in a way that's funny more often than not.    Though there aren't really any laugh-out-loud moments in this episode, mostly because a lot of it is used for building up the same joke four or five times in a row. Yep, Leo sure is way stronger than everyone else and he totally punked out the demon generals! We definitely needed to see that gag run through the wash multiple times across the episode.

14-04-2022,anime,3,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/teasing-master-takagi-san-season-3/episode-12/.184204,Episode 12 - Teasing Master Takagi-san Season 3 - Anime News Network:SEA,"       Teasing Master Takagi-san Season 3 Episode 12  by James Beckett, Mar 31st 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Teasing Master Takagi-san (TV 3) ?                     Community score: 4.8             Wow. Given how absolutely wonderful this third season of Teasing Master Takagi-san has been, I was trying to keep my expectations as low-key as possible going into this finale. There's a shiny new theatrical release on its way, after all, so I figured that the show would save its biggest romantic revelations for the big screen. Now, it's true that we don't technically get a confession this week, so that Takagi-san movie still has some ammo left in its pocket to work with, but that doesn't prevent “March 14th” from being one of the most sweet and satisfying finales that I've ever seen in a romance anime. Even if we didn't have a movie to look forward to, and this final episode of Season 3 was the last we were ever going to see of Nishikata and Takagi, I would have walked away from Teasing Master Takagi-san feeling completely satisfied. To steal a phrase from New Girl's Schmidt: “No notes!” First of all, it is impossible to understate how gosh darned adorable it is to see Nishikata slowly-but-surely piece together his own feelings for Takagi after Hamaguchi tries to pressure him into confessing to Takagi. At first, of course, Nishikata feels like there is no way that he feels anything other than a friendly (but fierce) rivalry towards the girl who teases him so much, and his elaborately designed “Nishikata Quest” is going to be the ultimate test of Takagi's mental fortitude against his. It's just pure, platonic friendship that is fueling Nishikata's urge to spend inordinate amounts of time arranging elaborate scavenger hunts for the girl he spends nearly every minute of his free time with…right? Sure, he does like hanging out with Takagi, and he can admit that she's pretty cute…and his heart starts to sink when he realizes she's not around to play the usual games with him in class…and he was so excited to see her face when she discovered the game-to-end-all-games that he made just for her… That alone would have been enough to dial my heart's Melt-o-Meter™ to dangerously high levels, but then the show actually goes out of its way to bring back the sneaky love confession that Takagi gave with that book she was teasing Nishikata with all the way back in Episode 2. Nishikata learns that there certainly wasn't an oddly specific and direct love confession for Takagi to read in the text of the book, and if that was Takagi trying to stealthily communicate her true feelings for Nishikata, then maybe the dozens of other times she's pulled similar stunts have also been…. (Dear readers, let me tell you that watching the truth of it all slowly dawn on our precious idiot's face has been one of the anime highlights of the past who-knows-how-long for me. I can only thank the Anime Gods that text reviews are incapable of transmitting the embarrassing noises I was making for half of this episode).  Also, can we talk for a moment about how incredible of a boyfriend Nishikata is going to be once he realizes that he's already been dating Takagi for, like, two years now? Nishikata may have been able to fool himself into thinking that “Nishikata Quest” was nothing more than an attempt to finally one-up his lifelong rival, but you and I (and the Girl Squad!) all know that his insanely elaborate scavenger hunt is one of the most romantic gestures imaginable, and if I had just one completely petty complaint to make about “March 14th”, it is that we have to settle for watching Mina and Co. solve all of the puzzles instead of Takagi herself. Yes, I am fully aware that the sight of Takagi falling in love with Nishikata all over again as she played Nishikata Quest would likely have fully killed me, or at the very least sent me into a shock-induced coma, but dammit, that's a risk I'm willing to take! I need this, Takagi-san! Ah well. I suppose I'll just have to settle for the utterly delightful ending scene that sees Nishikata racing after Takagi's car to make sure he can get her the traditional White Day gift on time.

Sure, I could…if I was a monster that hated love and art. I am not a monster, though, so instead I will simply revel in the simple joy that comes from watching two sweet kids get one step closer to expressing how much they love each other. Sure, Nishikata might not say “I love you” in this finale, but he doesn't need to. All Takagi needs to hear is that the boy of her dreams wanted nothing more than to see her, and to give her a small token of appreciation, because she really does mean the world to him.

Community score: 4.8             Wow. Given how absolutely wonderful this third season of Teasing Master Takagi-san has been, I was trying to keep my expectations as low-key as possible going into this finale. There's a shiny new theatrical release on its way, after all, so I figured that the show would save its biggest romantic revelations for the big screen. Now, it's true that we don't technically get a confession this week, so that Takagi-san movie still has some ammo left in its pocket to work with, but that doesn't prevent “March 14th” from being one of the most sweet and satisfying finales that I've ever seen in a romance anime. Even if we didn't have a movie to look forward to, and this final episode of Season 3 was the last we were ever going to see of Nishikata and Takagi, I would have walked away from Teasing Master Takagi-san feeling completely satisfied. To steal a phrase from New Girl's Schmidt: “No notes!” First of all, it is impossible to understate how gosh darned adorable it is to see Nishikata slowly-but-surely piece together his own feelings for Takagi after Hamaguchi tries to pressure him into confessing to Takagi. At first, of course, Nishikata feels like there is no way that he feels anything other than a friendly (but fierce) rivalry towards the girl who teases him so much, and his elaborately designed “Nishikata Quest” is going to be the ultimate test of Takagi's mental fortitude against his. It's just pure, platonic friendship that is fueling Nishikata's urge to spend inordinate amounts of time arranging elaborate scavenger hunts for the girl he spends nearly every minute of his free time with…right? Sure, he does like hanging out with Takagi, and he can admit that she's pretty cute…and his heart starts to sink when he realizes she's not around to play the usual games with him in class…and he was so excited to see her face when she discovered the game-to-end-all-games that he made just for her… That alone would have been enough to dial my heart's Melt-o-Meter™ to dangerously high levels, but then the show actually goes out of its way to bring back the sneaky love confession that Takagi gave with that book she was teasing Nishikata with all the way back in Episode 2. Nishikata learns that there certainly wasn't an oddly specific and direct love confession for Takagi to read in the text of the book, and if that was Takagi trying to stealthily communicate her true feelings for Nishikata, then maybe the dozens of other times she's pulled similar stunts have also been…. (Dear readers, let me tell you that watching the truth of it all slowly dawn on our precious idiot's face has been one of the anime highlights of the past who-knows-how-long for me. I can only thank the Anime Gods that text reviews are incapable of transmitting the embarrassing noises I was making for half of this episode).  Also, can we talk for a moment about how incredible of a boyfriend Nishikata is going to be once he realizes that he's already been dating Takagi for, like, two years now? Nishikata may have been able to fool himself into thinking that “Nishikata Quest” was nothing more than an attempt to finally one-up his lifelong rival, but you and I (and the Girl Squad!) all know that his insanely elaborate scavenger hunt is one of the most romantic gestures imaginable, and if I had just one completely petty complaint to make about “March 14th”, it is that we have to settle for watching Mina and Co. solve all of the puzzles instead of Takagi herself. Yes, I am fully aware that the sight of Takagi falling in love with Nishikata all over again as she played Nishikata Quest would likely have fully killed me, or at the very least sent me into a shock-induced coma, but dammit, that's a risk I'm willing to take! I need this, Takagi-san! Ah well. I suppose I'll just have to settle for the utterly delightful ending scene that sees Nishikata racing after Takagi's car to make sure he can get her the traditional White Day gift on time.

I suppose I'll just have to settle for the utterly delightful ending scene that sees Nishikata racing after Takagi's car to make sure he can get her the traditional White Day gift on time. Could I maybe nitpick a little about how some of the running animation looks a little off, or how the general timing of the scene feels just a little bit stretched out? Sure, I could…if I was a monster that hated love and art. I am not a monster, though, so instead I will simply revel in the simple joy that comes from watching two sweet kids get one step closer to expressing how much they love each other. Sure, Nishikata might not say “I love you” in this finale, but he doesn't need to. All Takagi needs to hear is that the boy of her dreams wanted nothing more than to see her, and to give her a small token of appreciation, because she really does mean the world to him.  That's more than enough for me. Whatever comes next for Teasing Master Takagi-san is just icing on the cake. What we've got here, already, is maybe about as close to a perfect anime love story is you can get. Rating:                 Teasing Master Takagi-san Season 3 is currently streaming on HIDIVE.

Last year's Crunchyroll Expo revealed the series was green-lit for second and third season, and after today the wait is over. Season two will premiere sometime in 2021, and the third season won't be as long of a wait.    This year's panel for Shield Hero features Keigo Koyanagi (series composition), Masahiro Suwa (character design and chief animation director), Junichiro Tamura (producer from Kadokawa), and MC'd by voice actress Sarah Emi Bridcutt.    Following up on the excitement of last year, the panel began with a Q&A focused on reflection and production. Tamura shared he was surprised to see a variety of languages and support from fans around the world commenting on the Shield Hero videos. Regarding what episode drove the most excitement, Koyanagi confidently claimed episode 21, aka Myne's “execution.” As reference, Crunchyroll's post of that scene has 2.8M views on YouTube, making it the most popular clip from the series.    On a more relaxed note, character designer Suwa voiced his surprise at how popular Raphtalia was, but he thought she and Naofumi make a “great combo.” Conversely, his favorite character to design was The Pope because of how hard it was to pin down. Otherwise, Suwa tried to keep the designs relatively simple to make it easier for others to draw.    The next set of questions focused on the care and level of detail taken in terms of the script and the character designs. Although Koyanagi said it was difficult to convince the audience to keep watching and build excitement for the following episodes, Bridcutt assured that he did a great job based on the sheer volume of reactions from Twitter and streams of the show.    When asked if there was anything memorable from the voice recording sessions, Tamura said his impressions of the characters had changed once he heard the voice auditions. In addition to the main cast, he had help picked the candidates that fit characters that show up later in the series. Looking back at last year, the panelists voiced how encouraged and motivated they were after interacting with fans overseas. Although the autograph sessions were more than what they expected, they all thoroughly enjoyed their time seeing fans face to face and receiving words of appreciation and fanart. They wish they had more to show last year, but luckily they have more to reveal.    Unfortunately, they couldn't reveal all their secrets for what's to come, but what they could talk about was how production for season two is rolling along. Producer Tamura divulged how the script and other parts of anime production were proceeding, but there was no information on how much of the story the next season would cover. Of course, the question that many fans—and Sarah Emi Bridcutt herself—had on their mind was, “Will Myne be back?” No clear answer was given, but Tamura encouraged people to stay tuned for characters who might return.  Auditions for the upcoming season are underway.    In the meantime, because Masato Jinbo had replaced Takao Abo as director for season two, Tamura reiterated that there are many surprises to look forward to. Before closing off the panel entirely, surprise guests Kaito Ishikawa (Naofumi), Asami Seto (Raphtalia), and Rina Hidaka (Firo) all separately shared their reflection of season one and their characters through audio. Even though there was no video recording accompanying their audio, all three actors couldn't hold back their tension and excitement to reprise their roles. For those who can't wait for next year, Rina Hidaka puts it best: “Season two will be here soon!”     discuss this in the forum (2 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Convention homepage / archives      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

On a more relaxed note, character designer Suwa voiced his surprise at how popular Raphtalia was, but he thought she and Naofumi make a “great combo.” Conversely, his favorite character to design was The Pope because of how hard it was to pin down. Otherwise, Suwa tried to keep the designs relatively simple to make it easier for others to draw.    The next set of questions focused on the care and level of detail taken in terms of the script and the character designs. Although Koyanagi said it was difficult to convince the audience to keep watching and build excitement for the following episodes, Bridcutt assured that he did a great job based on the sheer volume of reactions from Twitter and streams of the show.    When asked if there was anything memorable from the voice recording sessions, Tamura said his impressions of the characters had changed once he heard the voice auditions. In addition to the main cast, he had help picked the candidates that fit characters that show up later in the series. Looking back at last year, the panelists voiced how encouraged and motivated they were after interacting with fans overseas. Although the autograph sessions were more than what they expected, they all thoroughly enjoyed their time seeing fans face to face and receiving words of appreciation and fanart. They wish they had more to show last year, but luckily they have more to reveal.    Unfortunately, they couldn't reveal all their secrets for what's to come, but what they could talk about was how production for season two is rolling along. Producer Tamura divulged how the script and other parts of anime production were proceeding, but there was no information on how much of the story the next season would cover. Of course, the question that many fans—and Sarah Emi Bridcutt herself—had on their mind was, “Will Myne be back?” No clear answer was given, but Tamura encouraged people to stay tuned for characters who might return.  Auditions for the upcoming season are underway.    In the meantime, because Masato Jinbo had replaced Takao Abo as director for season two, Tamura reiterated that there are many surprises to look forward to. Before closing off the panel entirely, surprise guests Kaito Ishikawa (Naofumi), Asami Seto (Raphtalia), and Rina Hidaka (Firo) all separately shared their reflection of season one and their characters through audio. Even though there was no video recording accompanying their audio, all three actors couldn't hold back their tension and excitement to reprise their roles. For those who can't wait for next year, Rina Hidaka puts it best: “Season two will be here soon!”   ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Last year's Crunchyroll Expo revealed the series was green-lit for second and third season, and after today the wait is over. Season two will premiere sometime in 2021, and the third season won't be as long of a wait.    This year's panel for Shield Hero features Keigo Koyanagi (series composition), Masahiro Suwa (character design and chief animation director), Junichiro Tamura (producer from Kadokawa), and MC'd by voice actress Sarah Emi Bridcutt.    Following up on the excitement of last year, the panel began with a Q&A focused on reflection and production. Tamura shared he was surprised to see a variety of languages and support from fans around the world commenting on the Shield Hero videos.

Gunpla is a contraction of “Gundam plastic” and refers to the plastic model kits based on the mechs that appear in the anime. It's been a prominent part of Gundam merchandise and the fandom for a while, and it's easy to see why. A lot of these designs look damn impressive and bring back memories of their iconic stories. Who wouldn't want a detailed, customizable, poseable statue of them that you can assemble piece by piece? The anime we'll be talking about today though is about the plastic toys themselves rather than the giant mechs, so it's a toy show through and through. It also just happens to be some of the most fun we had with an anime in a long time! This is The Cartoon Cipher here with Anime News Network to reminisce about Gundam Build Fighters.      Before Build Fighters came Model Suit Gunpla Builders Beginning G. This was a short and sweet 3-part OVA produced to celebrate the 30th anniversary of gunpla, and is set in a variation of the real world where you can put the Gunpla you've made into a scanner then use VR to actually pilot it and battle others. The protagonist Haru is on a journey to be worthy of challenging a mysterious yet skilled rival, and along the way discovers how expansive and creative Gunpla can be.    These are essentially toy fights without grave stakes, however the passion behind what it means to build the Gunpla is put front-and-center, and a lot of key moments felt like “the heart of the cards” but for Gunpla. I think a lot of Western fans my age grew up with shows like Yu Gi Oh!, Beyblade or Pokémon, and the way Beginning G delivers these positive morals aimed at children will really hit that nostalgic sweet spot. The battle scenes are about giving things your all and the importance of new challenges, so by the end the fights escalate into absolute insanity with all manner of Gundam weapons and strategies deployed at once for an incredible spectacle. Meanwhile the building scenes show you how being passionate about Gunpla can create new friendships as you all strive to hold each other up. Beginning G also made sure to show how accessible Gunpla is for beginners, including some of the tools you'll need and basic customization. Overall however, the storyline was nothing ambitious and the characters were honestly pretty forgettable outside the one who looks like Quattro Bajeena. Maybe this was down to the limited runtime, but Sunrise would soon revisit this concept in anime form a few years later, with room for many more interesting ideas…    Gundam Build Fighters season 1 began airing in fall 2013. Instead of VR, scientists in this world have developed special particles called Plavsky Particles which seem to react to the kind of plastic Gunpla is made of. With this, the model kits can be brought to life and fight just like the mechs in the Gundam anime. The protagonist Sei Iori hopes to be a legendary Gunpla battler like his father, but while he is an expert at creating and customizing Gunpla, he's not so great at controlling them. Suddenly, a boy named Reiji mysteriously appears from another world (don't worry, that's not a plot twist) and it turns out that he's great at controlling Sei's Gunpla in battle. The two boys decide to team up and take on the world of Gunpla together, facing opponents from all over the world, making plenty of friends, rivals, and even love interests along the way. Obviously this is nothing like the war stories and space adventures of the main Gundam shows, including the more lighthearted ones. You could compare it to the tournaments in G-Gundam but even then there aren't any political stakes this time. Though keep G-Gundam in the back of your mind, as it will become relevant later.    Being a giant homage to Gundam's legacy there's obviously tons of references and inside jokes scattered throughout both seasons, such as background cameos, lines of dialogue, or Ramba Ral straight-up being a prominent character in this story. He acts as the mentor to the protagonists, always dispensing words of wisdom and generally being a lovable Gouf-ball. The series has a nice even mix of characters who know all there is to know about Gundam, and total newcomers who wouldn't get a Char reference if it hit them in the face at three-times the normal speed. Build Fighters has fun lamp shading that disconnect, but is still committed to the idea that Gunpla can and does bring all kinds of people together. It's just as fun watching some characters get bamboozled by the references as it is watching the Gundam junkies go full-otaku at a moment's notice, and because of the variety you're bound to find characters to relate to no matter how much Gundam you've seen.    Likewise, it's just plain cool to see so many different Gundam elements from different series united in one place and playing off each other. There's the Trans-Am System, funnels, backpacks, transforming, combining, any weapon you can imagine but as a laser beam, a whole different style for the SD Gundams, and that's not even getting into how different environments can be used to your advantage! A variety of strategies and formats also keeps things fresh so that it's not always possible to blast your way out of a problem. Some fighters stay hidden for the majority of the fight, some go into battle with no guns at all, and some people… straight-up cheat. If you're in a race, you need to optimize your Gunpla for speed. If you have a unique ability, all the other fighters are going to start adjusting their strategies against it. If you're on the ropes then you need to weigh surrendering versus fighting on because remember, the plastic models are fighting for real so any damage they take is also for real and you'll have to repair it yourself afterwards. The show truly believes that Gunpla is freedom and is committed to show you as many possibilities as it can squeeze in, no matter how out-there.    Build Fighters season 1 was directed by Kenji Nagasaki, written by Yosuke Kuroda, with music by Yuki Hayashi, and if that combination of names sounds familiar it's because they've worked together before and since, most notably on a little show called My Hero Academia. Particular mention needs to go to the soundtrack by Yuki Hayashi. While Beginning G's music felt like a more straightforward film score, Hayashi's music is incredibly hype-inducing, with energetic beats and the occasional fusion of genres in certain tracks. If you remember our video on the Bastard!! anime you'll know Kuroda has been a writer on many great anime adaptations but he's also no stranger to Gundam, having written for the popular Gundam 00 series in the mid-2000s.    The journey of Sei and Reiji is a classic of polar-opposite protagonists who complete each other. Sei is so passionate about his Gunpla that it hurts his piloting because he subconsciously doesn't want to damage his creation, and his time with Reiji is what helps him become a more complete person by the end. Meanwhile Reiji is pretty inconsiderate at the start of the show, but his time with Gunpla teaches him a great deal of respect for those around him. Much like the story, the characters are each quite straightforward but executed incredibly well. The relationships they share are the true highlight, whether it be Sei and Reiji completing each other and covering each other's weakness, or the lighthearted comedy and especially the romantic teases elsewhere in the show. Both seasons invest a lot in the romance department and it's always either hilarious or wholesome, never bogging the story down either. It's usually fairly obvious who will win any given fight in this show, but in the best of matches I always found myself feeling for the rival who couldn't win because they're still so likable. Even side characters who aren't that involved in the actual battles come across as really charming in a way that enriches the optimism of the anime. The main villain is also evil in a fun way, essentially being a giant baby who you can't help but laugh at despite his plans being corrupt and going against what the protagonists stand for.    So then what does the show stand for? This may sound contradictory, but it's about the freedom to have fun… by taking things seriously. I feel like that's an important theme to get right, and it makes Build Fighters a great, emotionally-healthy show for kids (if you're older like me though it will still speak to your inner child). Despite all the battles and conflicts the show is just incredibly uplifting, with the main goal simply being to have as much fun as possible. Most of the antagonists are usually fighting for ulterior motives such as business moves, or just winning by any means necessary. Like Beginning G before it, there's a lot of “heart of the Gunpla”-esque moments about competing for the right reasons, not taking the easy way out, respecting your opponent, and everything else that made me feel like I was a kid watching Yu Gi Oh! for the first time, and loving every second. A big takeaway from each match is that winning or losing doesn't matter as long as you're having a good time. That doesn't mean slack off and do things lazily by any means though.  And its that idea of getting serious for fun that solidifies so many of the best relationships in this show from romances to rivalries, whether it's through building together, training together, cheering together and yes, fighting together.    Obviously the show is doing all this to get people to buy more model kits, but the expansive nature of Gunpla and exploring new relationships through the hobby can be a good message about life in general. Not only is it for everyone but there's all sorts of things you can do with it. Some people enjoy Gunpla battling and as we've seen there's plenty of ways to go about that, but others prefer to be more artistic, creating displays based on scenes from Gundam stories. With this being a world with Gunpla at the center, we got to see a lot of custom designs that take the pre-existing ones from the show and build upon them. These both look awesome while adding twists to the battles, and Build Fighters doesn't stop there. The freedom of Gunpla is expressed all over society and culture as well: there's Gunpla in the arts, Gunpla idols and rock stars, fashion models who do shoots with Gunpla, you can even flirt and settle property disputes with Gunpla!    The battles themselves are all flashy and fast-paced, with most of them actually getting wrapped up within a single episode. This not only keeps the action exciting but also stops things from dragging too much. This allows the show to have plenty of down time for comedy and character arcs to build, with the battles essentially being the big climaxes of those arcs, complete with hype music and hype animation. Whether it was on the battlefield or on the shelf, all the Gunpla in this anime looked vibrant and sharp. Only one machine in both seasons was done in CG, and the effects animation does a lot to make the action scenes pop. In fact, the entire show both in and outside the arena is full of vibrant colors which really adds to the fun and lively vibe of the overarching story. The character designs are striking, the environments are vivid, even the explosions of defeated Gunpla look fun!    With such an enjoyable 25 episode run coming to an end in 2014, Gundam Build Fighters Try would come along in fall of that year to add some new twists. This sequel season is set seven years later at Sei Iori's school. At first, Fumina Hoshino is just trying to save her beloved Gunpla Battle Club from being shut down. But with the help of her childhood friend Yuuma, and a hot-headed kenpo fighter called Sekai (who may look familiar to Build Fighters fans), she puts together Team Try Fighters to compete in the Japanese Under-19 division. It retains a lot of the strengths and themes of season one however Kenji Nagasaki wasn't the director this time, with an at-the-time newer director by the name of Shinya Watada taking up that role. Try still has homages to various Gundam anime but it leans into G-Gundam's influence in particular, not just with direct references but with the overall bombastic tone and greater focus on martial arts.    A big shake-up to the Build Fighters comes in the form of battlers having to form teams of three, making teamwork a more prominent theme this time around. Each member of Try Fighter has a distinct relationship with each other as well as having their own, more personal character arcs: Yuuma with his identity crisis, Fumina finding her own strength while also supporting her friends, and Sekai needing to appreciate this brand new world he's stepped into. Their personalities are also well reflected in their fighting styles and signature colors, making for a very robust dynamic. As a consequence of this focus on teamwork though, many side members of opponent teams weren't as fleshed out as the rivals in season 1. Either their team leader would take most of the focus, or all three of them would only show up very briefly, being tied together by an identifiable design theme, which would still be neat on its own. That isn't to say Try Fighters are the only decent characters though, as the rivalries and romances this time were just as good if not better than in season 1.    The motto of the show is still very much “Gunpla is freedom” however this time it's also expressed through the idea of constantly breaking limits. The episodes are always building up bigger and bigger rivals for Try Fighters in the background, because if Gunpla is freedom then like the first OP song says… “There are no limits.”  Unlike season 1 there was no overarching villain working against the main characters, however this was made up for by certain rivals having especially twisted dispositions which lead to enough dark moments to keep things interesting. The escalating skill of the rivals also drives home the notion that there's always a bigger fish out there, which sometimes hits our protagonists hard. But that in itself leads to another important message of getting back up when you fall. And with the characters constantly breaking their limits, the intensity and absurdity of the fights escalates with them. The sheer concept of what was happening in some of these fights was delightful, and it all kept building and building right up till the final battle where the hype absolutely exploded. I don't want to give too much away because it truly was that good, but suffice to say it was a perfect resolution to the main rival AND team dynamics in an amazingly animated package. Even if some of the Build Fighters from other teams weren't as developed as season one's cast, the sheer hype made up for that in spades. Speaking of which, there were quite a few season one cameos in Try and all of them felt very rewarding. However looking back on Try almost 8 years later, it is a bit disappointing that what those cameos brought to the table never went anywhere.    After Try ended, both it and season 1 eventually received a longer-than-usual OVA set after their respective events, those being Island Wars and GM's Counterattack. They have elements that made their respective seasons shine, but are both essentially scenarios set up so that the good guys can deploy all their Gunpla at once for a huge battle. There was also Gundam Build Fighters: Battlogue which was a series of five short episodes exploring different parts of the Build Fighters world. I found a couple of them fun, but less so for the other three. There's a spin-off manga called Gundam Build Fighters Amazing about Tatsuya Yuuki's childhood, as well some light novel series' called Honoo and Honno Try that are also side stories from what I can gather. So while we have gotten more, so far it hasn't been substantial enough to match my hopes for a third season tying everything together. Without spoiling Try, certain promises were made about exciting future battles that we never got to see. Then there's the mysterious nature of Reiji, his connection to Sekai, and the parallel world he comes from. I imagine not everyone's gonna feel the same about this in particular; this is a show about magic fighting toys after all so a boy traveling from a kingdom in a parallel world doesn't seem that farfetched. What we got from Build Fighters was pretty much all excellent so while I can't criticize it for not having more, it's because it was so good that I wanted more. I don't play that many video games but at the very least, perhaps the Gundam Vs. or Super Robot Wars video games are satisfying fans' desires to see mechs from different series' duking it out.    Then there's the next spin-off Gundam Build Divers, which personally I never got very far into. While Shinya Watada stayed on from Try to direct Divers, the writing and musical staff are different. Maybe the reason I couldn't get into Divers was because of the departure of those key staff members, maybe it's because I wasn't up for yet another cast change after Try, or maybe it's because the technology of Divers was so different. Regardless, if we want to discuss Divers, we're gonna have to do it another time because we've been talking about fighting Gundam toys for way too long. It's unknown where the series will go from here but here's hoping that it never loses that kinetic fun and optimism!  Gundam Build Fighters and the first season of Divers are available right here on the Gundam.info YouTube channel for free, although unfortunately both Try and the second season of Divers have recently been taken down from there.     discuss this in the forum (8 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Watch homepage / archives      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Gunpla is a contraction of “Gundam plastic” and refers to the plastic model kits based on the mechs that appear in the anime. It's been a prominent part of Gundam merchandise and the fandom for a while, and it's easy to see why. A lot of these designs look damn impressive and bring back memories of their iconic stories.

Gundam Build Fighters and the first season of Divers are available right here on the Gundam.info YouTube channel for free, although unfortunately both Try and the second season of Divers have recently been taken down from there.     discuss this in the forum (8 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Watch homepage / archives     ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Gunpla is a contraction of “Gundam plastic” and refers to the plastic model kits based on the mechs that appear in the anime. It's been a prominent part of Gundam merchandise and the fandom for a while, and it's easy to see why. A lot of these designs look damn impressive and bring back memories of their iconic stories. Who wouldn't want a detailed, customizable, poseable statue of them that you can assemble piece by piece? The anime we'll be talking about today though is about the plastic toys themselves rather than the giant mechs, so it's a toy show through and through. It also just happens to be some of the most fun we had with an anime in a long time! This is The Cartoon Cipher here with Anime News Network to reminisce about Gundam Build Fighters.      Before Build Fighters came Model Suit Gunpla Builders Beginning G. This was a short and sweet 3-part OVA produced to celebrate the 30th anniversary of gunpla, and is set in a variation of the real world where you can put the Gunpla you've made into a scanner then use VR to actually pilot it and battle others. The protagonist Haru is on a journey to be worthy of challenging a mysterious yet skilled rival, and along the way discovers how expansive and creative Gunpla can be.    These are essentially toy fights without grave stakes, however the passion behind what it means to build the Gunpla is put front-and-center, and a lot of key moments felt like “the heart of the cards” but for Gunpla. I think a lot of Western fans my age grew up with shows like Yu Gi Oh!, Beyblade or Pokémon, and the way Beginning G delivers these positive morals aimed at children will really hit that nostalgic sweet spot. The battle scenes are about giving things your all and the importance of new challenges, so by the end the fights escalate into absolute insanity with all manner of Gundam weapons and strategies deployed at once for an incredible spectacle. Meanwhile the building scenes show you how being passionate about Gunpla can create new friendships as you all strive to hold each other up. Beginning G also made sure to show how accessible Gunpla is for beginners, including some of the tools you'll need and basic customization. Overall however, the storyline was nothing ambitious and the characters were honestly pretty forgettable outside the one who looks like Quattro Bajeena. Maybe this was down to the limited runtime, but Sunrise would soon revisit this concept in anime form a few years later, with room for many more interesting ideas…    Gundam Build Fighters season 1 began airing in fall 2013. Instead of VR, scientists in this world have developed special particles called Plavsky Particles which seem to react to the kind of plastic Gunpla is made of. With this, the model kits can be brought to life and fight just like the mechs in the Gundam anime. The protagonist Sei Iori hopes to be a legendary Gunpla battler like his father, but while he is an expert at creating and customizing Gunpla, he's not so great at controlling them. Suddenly, a boy named Reiji mysteriously appears from another world (don't worry, that's not a plot twist) and it turns out that he's great at controlling Sei's Gunpla in battle. The two boys decide to team up and take on the world of Gunpla together, facing opponents from all over the world, making plenty of friends, rivals, and even love interests along the way. Obviously this is nothing like the war stories and space adventures of the main Gundam shows, including the more lighthearted ones. You could compare it to the tournaments in G-Gundam but even then there aren't any political stakes this time. Though keep G-Gundam in the back of your mind, as it will become relevant later.    Being a giant homage to Gundam's legacy there's obviously tons of references and inside jokes scattered throughout both seasons, such as background cameos, lines of dialogue, or Ramba Ral straight-up being a prominent character in this story. He acts as the mentor to the protagonists, always dispensing words of wisdom and generally being a lovable Gouf-ball. The series has a nice even mix of characters who know all there is to know about Gundam, and total newcomers who wouldn't get a Char reference if it hit them in the face at three-times the normal speed. Build Fighters has fun lamp shading that disconnect, but is still committed to the idea that Gunpla can and does bring all kinds of people together. It's just as fun watching some characters get bamboozled by the references as it is watching the Gundam junkies go full-otaku at a moment's notice, and because of the variety you're bound to find characters to relate to no matter how much Gundam you've seen.    Likewise, it's just plain cool to see so many different Gundam elements from different series united in one place and playing off each other. There's the Trans-Am System, funnels, backpacks, transforming, combining, any weapon you can imagine but as a laser beam, a whole different style for the SD Gundams, and that's not even getting into how different environments can be used to your advantage! A variety of strategies and formats also keeps things fresh so that it's not always possible to blast your way out of a problem. Some fighters stay hidden for the majority of the fight, some go into battle with no guns at all, and some people… straight-up cheat. If you're in a race, you need to optimize your Gunpla for speed. If you have a unique ability, all the other fighters are going to start adjusting their strategies against it. If you're on the ropes then you need to weigh surrendering versus fighting on because remember, the plastic models are fighting for real so any damage they take is also for real and you'll have to repair it yourself afterwards. The show truly believes that Gunpla is freedom and is committed to show you as many possibilities as it can squeeze in, no matter how out-there.    Build Fighters season 1 was directed by Kenji Nagasaki, written by Yosuke Kuroda, with music by Yuki Hayashi, and if that combination of names sounds familiar it's because they've worked together before and since, most notably on a little show called My Hero Academia. Particular mention needs to go to the soundtrack by Yuki Hayashi. While Beginning G's music felt like a more straightforward film score, Hayashi's music is incredibly hype-inducing, with energetic beats and the occasional fusion of genres in certain tracks. If you remember our video on the Bastard!! anime you'll know Kuroda has been a writer on many great anime adaptations but he's also no stranger to Gundam, having written for the popular Gundam 00 series in the mid-2000s.    The journey of Sei and Reiji is a classic of polar-opposite protagonists who complete each other. Sei is so passionate about his Gunpla that it hurts his piloting because he subconsciously doesn't want to damage his creation, and his time with Reiji is what helps him become a more complete person by the end. Meanwhile Reiji is pretty inconsiderate at the start of the show, but his time with Gunpla teaches him a great deal of respect for those around him. Much like the story, the characters are each quite straightforward but executed incredibly well. The relationships they share are the true highlight, whether it be Sei and Reiji completing each other and covering each other's weakness, or the lighthearted comedy and especially the romantic teases elsewhere in the show. Both seasons invest a lot in the romance department and it's always either hilarious or wholesome, never bogging the story down either. It's usually fairly obvious who will win any given fight in this show, but in the best of matches I always found myself feeling for the rival who couldn't win because they're still so likable. Even side characters who aren't that involved in the actual battles come across as really charming in a way that enriches the optimism of the anime. The main villain is also evil in a fun way, essentially being a giant baby who you can't help but laugh at despite his plans being corrupt and going against what the protagonists stand for.    So then what does the show stand for? This may sound contradictory, but it's about the freedom to have fun… by taking things seriously. I feel like that's an important theme to get right, and it makes Build Fighters a great, emotionally-healthy show for kids (if you're older like me though it will still speak to your inner child). Despite all the battles and conflicts the show is just incredibly uplifting, with the main goal simply being to have as much fun as possible. Most of the antagonists are usually fighting for ulterior motives such as business moves, or just winning by any means necessary. Like Beginning G before it, there's a lot of “heart of the Gunpla”-esque moments about competing for the right reasons, not taking the easy way out, respecting your opponent, and everything else that made me feel like I was a kid watching Yu Gi Oh! for the first time, and loving every second. A big takeaway from each match is that winning or losing doesn't matter as long as you're having a good time. That doesn't mean slack off and do things lazily by any means though.  And its that idea of getting serious for fun that solidifies so many of the best relationships in this show from romances to rivalries, whether it's through building together, training together, cheering together and yes, fighting together.    Obviously the show is doing all this to get people to buy more model kits, but the expansive nature of Gunpla and exploring new relationships through the hobby can be a good message about life in general. Not only is it for everyone but there's all sorts of things you can do with it. Some people enjoy Gunpla battling and as we've seen there's plenty of ways to go about that, but others prefer to be more artistic, creating displays based on scenes from Gundam stories. With this being a world with Gunpla at the center, we got to see a lot of custom designs that take the pre-existing ones from the show and build upon them. These both look awesome while adding twists to the battles, and Build Fighters doesn't stop there. The freedom of Gunpla is expressed all over society and culture as well: there's Gunpla in the arts, Gunpla idols and rock stars, fashion models who do shoots with Gunpla, you can even flirt and settle property disputes with Gunpla!    The battles themselves are all flashy and fast-paced, with most of them actually getting wrapped up within a single episode. This not only keeps the action exciting but also stops things from dragging too much. This allows the show to have plenty of down time for comedy and character arcs to build, with the battles essentially being the big climaxes of those arcs, complete with hype music and hype animation. Whether it was on the battlefield or on the shelf, all the Gunpla in this anime looked vibrant and sharp. Only one machine in both seasons was done in CG, and the effects animation does a lot to make the action scenes pop. In fact, the entire show both in and outside the arena is full of vibrant colors which really adds to the fun and lively vibe of the overarching story. The character designs are striking, the environments are vivid, even the explosions of defeated Gunpla look fun!    With such an enjoyable 25 episode run coming to an end in 2014, Gundam Build Fighters Try would come along in fall of that year to add some new twists. This sequel season is set seven years later at Sei Iori's school. At first, Fumina Hoshino is just trying to save her beloved Gunpla Battle Club from being shut down. But with the help of her childhood friend Yuuma, and a hot-headed kenpo fighter called Sekai (who may look familiar to Build Fighters fans), she puts together Team Try Fighters to compete in the Japanese Under-19 division. It retains a lot of the strengths and themes of season one however Kenji Nagasaki wasn't the director this time, with an at-the-time newer director by the name of Shinya Watada taking up that role. Try still has homages to various Gundam anime but it leans into G-Gundam's influence in particular, not just with direct references but with the overall bombastic tone and greater focus on martial arts.    A big shake-up to the Build Fighters comes in the form of battlers having to form teams of three, making teamwork a more prominent theme this time around. Each member of Try Fighter has a distinct relationship with each other as well as having their own, more personal character arcs: Yuuma with his identity crisis, Fumina finding her own strength while also supporting her friends, and Sekai needing to appreciate this brand new world he's stepped into. Their personalities are also well reflected in their fighting styles and signature colors, making for a very robust dynamic. As a consequence of this focus on teamwork though, many side members of opponent teams weren't as fleshed out as the rivals in season 1. Either their team leader would take most of the focus, or all three of them would only show up very briefly, being tied together by an identifiable design theme, which would still be neat on its own. That isn't to say Try Fighters are the only decent characters though, as the rivalries and romances this time were just as good if not better than in season 1.    The motto of the show is still very much “Gunpla is freedom” however this time it's also expressed through the idea of constantly breaking limits. The episodes are always building up bigger and bigger rivals for Try Fighters in the background, because if Gunpla is freedom then like the first OP song says… “There are no limits.”  Unlike season 1 there was no overarching villain working against the main characters, however this was made up for by certain rivals having especially twisted dispositions which lead to enough dark moments to keep things interesting. The escalating skill of the rivals also drives home the notion that there's always a bigger fish out there, which sometimes hits our protagonists hard. But that in itself leads to another important message of getting back up when you fall. And with the characters constantly breaking their limits, the intensity and absurdity of the fights escalates with them. The sheer concept of what was happening in some of these fights was delightful, and it all kept building and building right up till the final battle where the hype absolutely exploded. I don't want to give too much away because it truly was that good, but suffice to say it was a perfect resolution to the main rival AND team dynamics in an amazingly animated package. Even if some of the Build Fighters from other teams weren't as developed as season one's cast, the sheer hype made up for that in spades. Speaking of which, there were quite a few season one cameos in Try and all of them felt very rewarding. However looking back on Try almost 8 years later, it is a bit disappointing that what those cameos brought to the table never went anywhere.    After Try ended, both it and season 1 eventually received a longer-than-usual OVA set after their respective events, those being Island Wars and GM's Counterattack. They have elements that made their respective seasons shine, but are both essentially scenarios set up so that the good guys can deploy all their Gunpla at once for a huge battle. There was also Gundam Build Fighters: Battlogue which was a series of five short episodes exploring different parts of the Build Fighters world. I found a couple of them fun, but less so for the other three. There's a spin-off manga called Gundam Build Fighters Amazing about Tatsuya Yuuki's childhood, as well some light novel series' called Honoo and Honno Try that are also side stories from what I can gather. So while we have gotten more, so far it hasn't been substantial enough to match my hopes for a third season tying everything together. Without spoiling Try, certain promises were made about exciting future battles that we never got to see. Then there's the mysterious nature of Reiji, his connection to Sekai, and the parallel world he comes from. I imagine not everyone's gonna feel the same about this in particular; this is a show about magic fighting toys after all so a boy traveling from a kingdom in a parallel world doesn't seem that farfetched. What we got from Build Fighters was pretty much all excellent so while I can't criticize it for not having more, it's because it was so good that I wanted more. I don't play that many video games but at the very least, perhaps the Gundam Vs. or Super Robot Wars video games are satisfying fans' desires to see mechs from different series' duking it out.    Then there's the next spin-off Gundam Build Divers, which personally I never got very far into. While Shinya Watada stayed on from Try to direct Divers, the writing and musical staff are different. Maybe the reason I couldn't get into Divers was because of the departure of those key staff members, maybe it's because I wasn't up for yet another cast change after Try, or maybe it's because the technology of Divers was so different. Regardless, if we want to discuss Divers, we're gonna have to do it another time because we've been talking about fighting Gundam toys for way too long. It's unknown where the series will go from here but here's hoping that it never loses that kinetic fun and optimism!

Without spoiling Try, certain promises were made about exciting future battles that we never got to see. Then there's the mysterious nature of Reiji, his connection to Sekai, and the parallel world he comes from. I imagine not everyone's gonna feel the same about this in particular; this is a show about magic fighting toys after all so a boy traveling from a kingdom in a parallel world doesn't seem that farfetched. What we got from Build Fighters was pretty much all excellent so while I can't criticize it for not having more, it's because it was so good that I wanted more. I don't play that many video games but at the very least, perhaps the Gundam Vs. or Super Robot Wars video games are satisfying fans' desires to see mechs from different series' duking it out.    Then there's the next spin-off Gundam Build Divers, which personally I never got very far into. While Shinya Watada stayed on from Try to direct Divers, the writing and musical staff are different. Maybe the reason I couldn't get into Divers was because of the departure of those key staff members, maybe it's because I wasn't up for yet another cast change after Try, or maybe it's because the technology of Divers was so different. Regardless, if we want to discuss Divers, we're gonna have to do it another time because we've been talking about fighting Gundam toys for way too long. It's unknown where the series will go from here but here's hoping that it never loses that kinetic fun and optimism!  Gundam Build Fighters and the first season of Divers are available right here on the Gundam.info YouTube channel for free, although unfortunately both Try and the second season of Divers have recently been taken down from there.     discuss this in the forum (8 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Watch homepage / archives   ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"
14-04-2022,anime,7,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/watch/2022-04-01/gundam-build-fighters-and-the-power-of-toy-anime/.184235,Gundam Build Fighters and the Power of Toy Anime - Anime News Network:SEA,"    Gundam is a mecha franchise that's been going strong for decades with amazing entries in all kinds of styles. Gunpla is a contraction of “Gundam plastic” and refers to the plastic model kits based on the mechs that appear in the anime. It's been a prominent part of Gundam merchandise and the fandom for a while, and it's easy to see why. A lot of these designs look damn impressive and bring back memories of their iconic stories. Who wouldn't want a detailed, customizable, poseable statue of them that you can assemble piece by piece? The anime we'll be talking about today though is about the plastic toys themselves rather than the giant mechs, so it's a toy show through and through. It also just happens to be some of the most fun we had with an anime in a long time! This is The Cartoon Cipher here with Anime News Network to reminisce about Gundam Build Fighters.      Before Build Fighters came Model Suit Gunpla Builders Beginning G. This was a short and sweet 3-part OVA produced to celebrate the 30th anniversary of gunpla, and is set in a variation of the real world where you can put the Gunpla you've made into a scanner then use VR to actually pilot it and battle others. The protagonist Haru is on a journey to be worthy of challenging a mysterious yet skilled rival, and along the way discovers how expansive and creative Gunpla can be.    These are essentially toy fights without grave stakes, however the passion behind what it means to build the Gunpla is put front-and-center, and a lot of key moments felt like “the heart of the cards” but for Gunpla. I think a lot of Western fans my age grew up with shows like Yu Gi Oh!, Beyblade or Pokémon, and the way Beginning G delivers these positive morals aimed at children will really hit that nostalgic sweet spot. The battle scenes are about giving things your all and the importance of new challenges, so by the end the fights escalate into absolute insanity with all manner of Gundam weapons and strategies deployed at once for an incredible spectacle. Meanwhile the building scenes show you how being passionate about Gunpla can create new friendships as you all strive to hold each other up. Beginning G also made sure to show how accessible Gunpla is for beginners, including some of the tools you'll need and basic customization. Overall however, the storyline was nothing ambitious and the characters were honestly pretty forgettable outside the one who looks like Quattro Bajeena. Maybe this was down to the limited runtime, but Sunrise would soon revisit this concept in anime form a few years later, with room for many more interesting ideas…    Gundam Build Fighters season 1 began airing in fall 2013. Instead of VR, scientists in this world have developed special particles called Plavsky Particles which seem to react to the kind of plastic Gunpla is made of. With this, the model kits can be brought to life and fight just like the mechs in the Gundam anime. The protagonist Sei Iori hopes to be a legendary Gunpla battler like his father, but while he is an expert at creating and customizing Gunpla, he's not so great at controlling them. Suddenly, a boy named Reiji mysteriously appears from another world (don't worry, that's not a plot twist) and it turns out that he's great at controlling Sei's Gunpla in battle. The two boys decide to team up and take on the world of Gunpla together, facing opponents from all over the world, making plenty of friends, rivals, and even love interests along the way. Obviously this is nothing like the war stories and space adventures of the main Gundam shows, including the more lighthearted ones. You could compare it to the tournaments in G-Gundam but even then there aren't any political stakes this time. Though keep G-Gundam in the back of your mind, as it will become relevant later.    Being a giant homage to Gundam's legacy there's obviously tons of references and inside jokes scattered throughout both seasons, such as background cameos, lines of dialogue, or Ramba Ral straight-up being a prominent character in this story. He acts as the mentor to the protagonists, always dispensing words of wisdom and generally being a lovable Gouf-ball. The series has a nice even mix of characters who know all there is to know about Gundam, and total newcomers who wouldn't get a Char reference if it hit them in the face at three-times the normal speed. Build Fighters has fun lamp shading that disconnect, but is still committed to the idea that Gunpla can and does bring all kinds of people together. It's just as fun watching some characters get bamboozled by the references as it is watching the Gundam junkies go full-otaku at a moment's notice, and because of the variety you're bound to find characters to relate to no matter how much Gundam you've seen.    Likewise, it's just plain cool to see so many different Gundam elements from different series united in one place and playing off each other. There's the Trans-Am System, funnels, backpacks, transforming, combining, any weapon you can imagine but as a laser beam, a whole different style for the SD Gundams, and that's not even getting into how different environments can be used to your advantage! A variety of strategies and formats also keeps things fresh so that it's not always possible to blast your way out of a problem. Some fighters stay hidden for the majority of the fight, some go into battle with no guns at all, and some people… straight-up cheat. If you're in a race, you need to optimize your Gunpla for speed. If you have a unique ability, all the other fighters are going to start adjusting their strategies against it. If you're on the ropes then you need to weigh surrendering versus fighting on because remember, the plastic models are fighting for real so any damage they take is also for real and you'll have to repair it yourself afterwards. The show truly believes that Gunpla is freedom and is committed to show you as many possibilities as it can squeeze in, no matter how out-there.    Build Fighters season 1 was directed by Kenji Nagasaki, written by Yosuke Kuroda, with music by Yuki Hayashi, and if that combination of names sounds familiar it's because they've worked together before and since, most notably on a little show called My Hero Academia. Particular mention needs to go to the soundtrack by Yuki Hayashi. While Beginning G's music felt like a more straightforward film score, Hayashi's music is incredibly hype-inducing, with energetic beats and the occasional fusion of genres in certain tracks. If you remember our video on the Bastard!! anime you'll know Kuroda has been a writer on many great anime adaptations but he's also no stranger to Gundam, having written for the popular Gundam 00 series in the mid-2000s.    The journey of Sei and Reiji is a classic of polar-opposite protagonists who complete each other. Sei is so passionate about his Gunpla that it hurts his piloting because he subconsciously doesn't want to damage his creation, and his time with Reiji is what helps him become a more complete person by the end. Meanwhile Reiji is pretty inconsiderate at the start of the show, but his time with Gunpla teaches him a great deal of respect for those around him. Much like the story, the characters are each quite straightforward but executed incredibly well. The relationships they share are the true highlight, whether it be Sei and Reiji completing each other and covering each other's weakness, or the lighthearted comedy and especially the romantic teases elsewhere in the show. Both seasons invest a lot in the romance department and it's always either hilarious or wholesome, never bogging the story down either. It's usually fairly obvious who will win any given fight in this show, but in the best of matches I always found myself feeling for the rival who couldn't win because they're still so likable. Even side characters who aren't that involved in the actual battles come across as really charming in a way that enriches the optimism of the anime. The main villain is also evil in a fun way, essentially being a giant baby who you can't help but laugh at despite his plans being corrupt and going against what the protagonists stand for.    So then what does the show stand for? This may sound contradictory, but it's about the freedom to have fun… by taking things seriously. I feel like that's an important theme to get right, and it makes Build Fighters a great, emotionally-healthy show for kids (if you're older like me though it will still speak to your inner child). Despite all the battles and conflicts the show is just incredibly uplifting, with the main goal simply being to have as much fun as possible. Most of the antagonists are usually fighting for ulterior motives such as business moves, or just winning by any means necessary. Like Beginning G before it, there's a lot of “heart of the Gunpla”-esque moments about competing for the right reasons, not taking the easy way out, respecting your opponent, and everything else that made me feel like I was a kid watching Yu Gi Oh! for the first time, and loving every second. A big takeaway from each match is that winning or losing doesn't matter as long as you're having a good time. That doesn't mean slack off and do things lazily by any means though.  And its that idea of getting serious for fun that solidifies so many of the best relationships in this show from romances to rivalries, whether it's through building together, training together, cheering together and yes, fighting together.    Obviously the show is doing all this to get people to buy more model kits, but the expansive nature of Gunpla and exploring new relationships through the hobby can be a good message about life in general. Not only is it for everyone but there's all sorts of things you can do with it. Some people enjoy Gunpla battling and as we've seen there's plenty of ways to go about that, but others prefer to be more artistic, creating displays based on scenes from Gundam stories. With this being a world with Gunpla at the center, we got to see a lot of custom designs that take the pre-existing ones from the show and build upon them. These both look awesome while adding twists to the battles, and Build Fighters doesn't stop there. The freedom of Gunpla is expressed all over society and culture as well: there's Gunpla in the arts, Gunpla idols and rock stars, fashion models who do shoots with Gunpla, you can even flirt and settle property disputes with Gunpla!    The battles themselves are all flashy and fast-paced, with most of them actually getting wrapped up within a single episode. This not only keeps the action exciting but also stops things from dragging too much. This allows the show to have plenty of down time for comedy and character arcs to build, with the battles essentially being the big climaxes of those arcs, complete with hype music and hype animation. Whether it was on the battlefield or on the shelf, all the Gunpla in this anime looked vibrant and sharp. Only one machine in both seasons was done in CG, and the effects animation does a lot to make the action scenes pop. In fact, the entire show both in and outside the arena is full of vibrant colors which really adds to the fun and lively vibe of the overarching story. The character designs are striking, the environments are vivid, even the explosions of defeated Gunpla look fun!    With such an enjoyable 25 episode run coming to an end in 2014, Gundam Build Fighters Try would come along in fall of that year to add some new twists. This sequel season is set seven years later at Sei Iori's school. At first, Fumina Hoshino is just trying to save her beloved Gunpla Battle Club from being shut down. But with the help of her childhood friend Yuuma, and a hot-headed kenpo fighter called Sekai (who may look familiar to Build Fighters fans), she puts together Team Try Fighters to compete in the Japanese Under-19 division. It retains a lot of the strengths and themes of season one however Kenji Nagasaki wasn't the director this time, with an at-the-time newer director by the name of Shinya Watada taking up that role. Try still has homages to various Gundam anime but it leans into G-Gundam's influence in particular, not just with direct references but with the overall bombastic tone and greater focus on martial arts.    A big shake-up to the Build Fighters comes in the form of battlers having to form teams of three, making teamwork a more prominent theme this time around. Each member of Try Fighter has a distinct relationship with each other as well as having their own, more personal character arcs: Yuuma with his identity crisis, Fumina finding her own strength while also supporting her friends, and Sekai needing to appreciate this brand new world he's stepped into. Their personalities are also well reflected in their fighting styles and signature colors, making for a very robust dynamic. As a consequence of this focus on teamwork though, many side members of opponent teams weren't as fleshed out as the rivals in season 1. Either their team leader would take most of the focus, or all three of them would only show up very briefly, being tied together by an identifiable design theme, which would still be neat on its own. That isn't to say Try Fighters are the only decent characters though, as the rivalries and romances this time were just as good if not better than in season 1.    The motto of the show is still very much “Gunpla is freedom” however this time it's also expressed through the idea of constantly breaking limits. The episodes are always building up bigger and bigger rivals for Try Fighters in the background, because if Gunpla is freedom then like the first OP song says… “There are no limits.”  Unlike season 1 there was no overarching villain working against the main characters, however this was made up for by certain rivals having especially twisted dispositions which lead to enough dark moments to keep things interesting. The escalating skill of the rivals also drives home the notion that there's always a bigger fish out there, which sometimes hits our protagonists hard. But that in itself leads to another important message of getting back up when you fall. And with the characters constantly breaking their limits, the intensity and absurdity of the fights escalates with them. The sheer concept of what was happening in some of these fights was delightful, and it all kept building and building right up till the final battle where the hype absolutely exploded. I don't want to give too much away because it truly was that good, but suffice to say it was a perfect resolution to the main rival AND team dynamics in an amazingly animated package. Even if some of the Build Fighters from other teams weren't as developed as season one's cast, the sheer hype made up for that in spades. Speaking of which, there were quite a few season one cameos in Try and all of them felt very rewarding. However looking back on Try almost 8 years later, it is a bit disappointing that what those cameos brought to the table never went anywhere.    After Try ended, both it and season 1 eventually received a longer-than-usual OVA set after their respective events, those being Island Wars and GM's Counterattack. They have elements that made their respective seasons shine, but are both essentially scenarios set up so that the good guys can deploy all their Gunpla at once for a huge battle. There was also Gundam Build Fighters: Battlogue which was a series of five short episodes exploring different parts of the Build Fighters world. I found a couple of them fun, but less so for the other three. There's a spin-off manga called Gundam Build Fighters Amazing about Tatsuya Yuuki's childhood, as well some light novel series' called Honoo and Honno Try that are also side stories from what I can gather. So while we have gotten more, so far it hasn't been substantial enough to match my hopes for a third season tying everything together. Without spoiling Try, certain promises were made about exciting future battles that we never got to see. Then there's the mysterious nature of Reiji, his connection to Sekai, and the parallel world he comes from. I imagine not everyone's gonna feel the same about this in particular; this is a show about magic fighting toys after all so a boy traveling from a kingdom in a parallel world doesn't seem that farfetched. What we got from Build Fighters was pretty much all excellent so while I can't criticize it for not having more, it's because it was so good that I wanted more. I don't play that many video games but at the very least, perhaps the Gundam Vs. or Super Robot Wars video games are satisfying fans' desires to see mechs from different series' duking it out.    Then there's the next spin-off Gundam Build Divers, which personally I never got very far into. While Shinya Watada stayed on from Try to direct Divers, the writing and musical staff are different. Maybe the reason I couldn't get into Divers was because of the departure of those key staff members, maybe it's because I wasn't up for yet another cast change after Try, or maybe it's because the technology of Divers was so different.

Even if some of the Build Fighters from other teams weren't as developed as season one's cast, the sheer hype made up for that in spades. Speaking of which, there were quite a few season one cameos in Try and all of them felt very rewarding. However looking back on Try almost 8 years later, it is a bit disappointing that what those cameos brought to the table never went anywhere.    After Try ended, both it and season 1 eventually received a longer-than-usual OVA set after their respective events, those being Island Wars and GM's Counterattack. They have elements that made their respective seasons shine, but are both essentially scenarios set up so that the good guys can deploy all their Gunpla at once for a huge battle. There was also Gundam Build Fighters: Battlogue which was a series of five short episodes exploring different parts of the Build Fighters world. I found a couple of them fun, but less so for the other three. There's a spin-off manga called Gundam Build Fighters Amazing about Tatsuya Yuuki's childhood, as well some light novel series' called Honoo and Honno Try that are also side stories from what I can gather. So while we have gotten more, so far it hasn't been substantial enough to match my hopes for a third season tying everything together. Without spoiling Try, certain promises were made about exciting future battles that we never got to see. Then there's the mysterious nature of Reiji, his connection to Sekai, and the parallel world he comes from. I imagine not everyone's gonna feel the same about this in particular; this is a show about magic fighting toys after all so a boy traveling from a kingdom in a parallel world doesn't seem that farfetched. What we got from Build Fighters was pretty much all excellent so while I can't criticize it for not having more, it's because it was so good that I wanted more. I don't play that many video games but at the very least, perhaps the Gundam Vs. or Super Robot Wars video games are satisfying fans' desires to see mechs from different series' duking it out.    Then there's the next spin-off Gundam Build Divers, which personally I never got very far into. While Shinya Watada stayed on from Try to direct Divers, the writing and musical staff are different. Maybe the reason I couldn't get into Divers was because of the departure of those key staff members, maybe it's because I wasn't up for yet another cast change after Try, or maybe it's because the technology of Divers was so different. Regardless, if we want to discuss Divers, we're gonna have to do it another time because we've been talking about fighting Gundam toys for way too long. It's unknown where the series will go from here but here's hoping that it never loses that kinetic fun and optimism!  Gundam Build Fighters and the first season of Divers are available right here on the Gundam.info YouTube channel for free, although unfortunately both Try and the second season of Divers have recently been taken down from there.

Below you'll find our editorial team's top (tentative) picks from the 46-odd shows slated to premiere in January. What are your favorite picks? Head on over to our poll and pick your top five. We'll publish the results before preview guide launches on April 1. Also, if you're still having a hard time choosing what to add to your queue, or you're just down for a good time, do check out Anime News Network's Spring 2022 Trailer Watch Party with YouTube personality Geoff Thew (Mother's Basement)!          Most Anticipated: Love After World Domination  Yeah yeah, I know this is likely interrupting a lengthy sweep of SPY x FAMILY top spots, but I'm more than happy to play the spoiler for this adorable-looking Super Sentai RomCom. There's nothing that I enjoy more than a good romantic comedy anime, and this looks like a total treat. The premise is great, the character designs are wonderful, and based on the trailers the animation looks strong all-around. Like this past season's Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department there's the risk of it playing a little too much inside baseball with the tokusatsu angle, but that's a small hurdle to clear for what looks like an absolutely adorable setup.    Runner-Up: SPY x FAMILY   That being said, yeah, I'm hyped for SPY x FAMILY a whole lot too. I've been reading the manga since it began, loving it just as long, and waiting for its inevitable anime adaptation to bring as many people as possible in for this wonderful, funny, and endlessly charming series. And going by the promos the production is seriously on-point. The secret sauce of this story is how it can effortlessly balance intense action and gut-busting humor without sweating a drop, and the trailers look ridiculously great at both. You probably don't need me to tell you this one's worth watching, but it's good enough that I feel compelled to do it anyway.    Alongside those, I am going to be feasting this season. Kaguya-sama is coming back, and as one of the greatest modern romcoms ever made it stands to reason I'm going to devour it. In fact, there's a whole block of romance-tinged series this season for me to chow down on between Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie, Aharen-san wa Hakarenai, and the potential disasterpiece of A Couple of Cuckoos. While I don't know if it'll actually have any romance, just the fact that In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki is from the creator of Teasing Master Takagi-san is enough for me to check it out. There's even some fantasy series of different varieties that look appealing like Healer Girl and The Dawn of the Witch. And of course, this spring marks the beginning of back-to-back seasons of Love Live!, which means I've automatically won for the next six months.          Most Anticipated: SPY X FAMILY  I love a good comedy anime, and some of my favorite comedies of all time are those that revolve around character misunderstandings – shows like Gamers!, School Rumble, and Yamada's First Time that are able to push misunderstandings to absurd lengths through unique circumstances for the sake of comedic payoff. So when I heard that SPY x FAMILY was basically that but with a spy, an assassin, and a telepath, you end up getting more than just my curiosity… you get my full, undivided attention. I marathoned the first six volumes of the manga and it is impressive how deftly the author is able to juggle all the unique abilities and over-the-top characters in such a serious setting. After watching some of the previews and being impressed by the above-average presentation for what is extensively a reactionary type of comedy, I look forward to seeing how some of these classic situations where the characters completely misjudge each other end up playing out.    Runner-Up: Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic    I will admit that I wasn't the biggest fan of Kaguya Sama: Love Is War at first. While the show definitely seemed to fall into my wheelhouse of comedy anime, I initially found it a bit too cynical for its own good. However, as time went on and the show managed to find its emotional foothold, I began to appreciate both its comedy and character writing a lot more. Season two especially allowed me to better appreciate these characters by giving us a better look at where that rather cynical worldview can sometimes come from. I have read a bit of the manga after season two and there's a good chance that season three will feature even more of those intense character moments. Either way, I think there will definitely be a lot of good material to appreciate and I definitely can't wait for another snazzy anime opening!          Most Anticipated: Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs   In 2020's My Next Life as a Villainess: All Routes Lead to Doom!, a young woman is reincarnated as the villainess in a stereotypical girl's dating sim. The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs takes the same general idea and twists it. Instead of a young woman, it's a young man. Instead of becoming the villainess, he is a random background character. Instead of a kind dunce, he's a bit of a self-serving asshole. But that's just the start of things.    As it's based on the setting of a D-grade reverse-harem romance, the fantasy world is full of plot holes, most notably the absurd level of misandry that permeates society. Noblewomen have several lovers beyond their husbands (who are little more than slaves making money for their wives). Second and third sons are married off to elderly women, only to then be sent off to the front lines for an easy life insurance payout. Our hero wants to avoid this fate and is willing to do whatever it takes to do so. His plan is simply to have enough money and power to secure his own independence—too bad he somehow catches the eye of both the heroine and the villainess. It's a hilarious ride where you can both cheer for the hero fighting against this half-baked world and laugh whenever karma smacks him upside the head.    Runner-Up: Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie    So many stories end with the main couple getting together. However, this is where Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie begins. Shikimori is cute and popular, athletic and intelligent. But her boyfriend, Izumi, is none of these things; worse still, he is unlucky and accident-prone to a dangerous degree. However, because of this, he is one of the few to see the other side of his girlfriend. Whenever he is in trouble, be that physical or emotional, her cute veneer fades away and she becomes a suave badass that oozes coolness from every pore.    What I love about this change is that it's accompanied by a shift in Shikimori's character design—her chin becomes sharper, as do her eyes. She looks elegant and dangerous, capable of sweeping anyone off their feet. And while there is an obvious swapping of stereotypical gender roles between Shikimori and Izumi in this story, it's important to remember that Shikimori isn't just the cute girl or the badass; she's both. Shikimori and Izumi simply bring out the best in each other across the board, as any good couple should.          Most Anticipated: Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie  You can blame My Dress-Up Darling for rekindling my romcom torch just in time for Kaguya-sama season 3 and Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie. Since I like to highlight non-sequels here, however, I'll defer my focus to Shikimori, which comes with the blue-ribbon premise of “what if Utena Tenjou was your girlfriend?” If romcoms live or die by their gimmicks, then I can hardly think of one more ripe for virality than the one about a handsome tomboy coolly kabedon-ing her doe-eyed boy squeeze. Online wasn't quite ready for Witch Craft Works and its perpetually princess-carried male protagonist—a fact towards which I will forever be bitter, because that show rules—but I hope, in 2022, Shikimori can at least find some justice. Plus, the previews are bursting with color, and Doga Kobo know how to put together a good-looking anime. Maybe this will be the year of sakuga-rich romcom supremacy.    Beyond that, I have my eye on Vampire in the Garden. No doubt this looks and sounds pretty generic at first blush, but its staff has a good pedigree, and more importantly, I like vampires. Vanitas is nearly over, and Call of the Night doesn't air until the summer, so perhaps Studio Wit can slake my spring bloodthirst. Bubble, also on Wit's docket, will be premiering this season, and I will be heartbroken if the chaotic dream team alignment of Gen Urobuchi, Tetsuro Araki, and Takeshi Obata somehow manages to be boring. I couldn't care less about it being good or not, but it had better be loud. Finally, the only thing I know about SPY x FAMILY is that there's a funny-faced little gremlin girl, and that's good enough for me.          Most Anticipated: Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic  Some ongoing shows can struggle with diminishing returns as they accumulate more seasons, but Kaguya-sama: Love is War seems just a bit more ambitious than that. It's still probably the funniest, most laugh-out-loud anime comedy of the modern era, yes, but recall all the other stuff its second season was able to get up to. The series showed an impressive penchant for pulling off dramatic turns too, which is no small feat when you consider how most of these characters are necessarily stupid as hell. That's the trick though, that this series has endeared these doofuses to me. They're idiots, but they're my idiots, and that even includes Ishigami. Plus, I can't not admire the stones on this series to announce its third season by putting out a whole bonus episode, featuring the characters joking about the very notion of third seasons! Now that's confidence, and if you, like me, have been won over by Kaguya-sama this far along, you know it's earned confidence.    Runner-up: Love Live! Nijigasaki High School Idol Club 2nd Season   There are actually a fair amount of returning faces in this forthcoming Spring season, some more surprising than others. A new Black Rock Shooter? A new Ikki Tousen?! What year is it?! But the other follow-up I'm really looking forward to is the return of those girls in the Nijigasaki High School Idol Club, coming back for another go at what was one of Love Live!'s more atypical iterations. I'm specifically hopeful for this second round since, after the first season necessarily loaded itself up with specific character-focus episodes, having all those now covered means the opportunity for some more complex or ambitious plot-lines featuring all these girls. Of course, I already know that several new members are going to be added to the club this season as well, but given that I'm not a devotee of the mobile game they spawned from, I'm looking forward to getting to know them on my own time. And seeing how they get wrangled into things by the unstoppable swag of that sentient can of Monster Energy known as Yu Takasaki.          Most Anticipated: SPY x FAMILY  This was a no brainer – one of my current favorite manga titles getting an adaptation? Yes, please! Not that that's really any different from my usual criteria for whether I'm anticipating a show or not, but it really felt even easier this time around. That's because the Cold War-set spy spoof is the kind of story that I could see making excellent use of the additional elements anime can provide – music and movement could really work to enhance the way the humor works in the story of the Forger family's semi-secret missions, and giving Anya specifically a voice could help to make her an even more delightful character. Since she's arguably the beating heart of the series, that's especially important. Anya's the only person who knows what's actually going on with pretty much everyone else, because the little dear's a psychic…which no one else has the least clue about. So her adoptive father Loid has no idea that she knows that he's really the master spy Twilight and her adoptive mother Yor is in the dark about the fact that Anya knows she's actually an elite assassin. Mostly poor Anya uses her power to ensure that she gets to keep her happy family without getting sent back to the orphanage, but while this does add an element of pathos, it never overwhelms the zanier aspects of the story. SPY x FAMILY in manga form is a near-perfect blend of goofy spy parody and heartfelt family tale with one of my favorite dog characters (Bond could easily be this season's best boy), and unlike with other manga-to-anime transitions, I have very few worries that this one won't make the leap to anime very well.    And while I'm hoping that those aren't going to be famous last words, I'm also harboring hopes for two other favorite manga titles to make a successful transition: Love After World Domination, which should appeal to fans of Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department, and Ya Boy Kongming!, and not just because it brings my poetry-was-the-rap-battle-of-the-ancient-world teaching method to life. (But okay, mostly because of that.) But my true second pick for most anticipated show this spring is Dance Dance Danseur, surprising precisely no one. While it isn't likely to be Swan or Princess Tutu, the angle of a male dancer in classical ballet isn't one we see all that often, and done well, there's a lot of room for an exploration of the stigma boys face for taking up ballet and the beauty (and pain) of the art form. If the animation lives up to it, this could be a treat.          Most Anticipated: Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic  This year so far has been a relatively strong contender for romantic comedy anime. Komi-san, My Dress-Up Darling, Sasaki and Miyano, hell even a show like Fantasy Knockout really surprised me. And this new season seems to be shaping up to continue to the streak with Kanamori's Not Just a Cutie already piquing my interest.    There's a lot of top contenders, but when this anime walks in the room everyone else needs to step aside and let the real champion do the fighting. It's time for the big guns, it's not just love, it's war! Kaguya-sama is back baby and she's ready to throw down!! Season 1 was filled with belly-laughing over-the-top punchlines as we watched the two smartest idiots in the room tip-toe-tango around their mutual bludgeoning feelings for each other. Then season 2 delivered a real wallop while being able include the same hilarious jokes and teasing heart pounders, with some real drama! For a character most people didn't even like at first, no less! I was laughing and sobbing, and it's all thanks to the wonderful animation and direction brought by the team to bring out just the maximum amount of emotion. And I expect nothing less from season 3 after two strong showings. Kaguya-sama is a contender not to be overlooked.    Runner-up: SPY x FAMILY   Not a rom-com but equally strong AND cute, is the much awaited adaption of the Shonen Jump spy thriller and family comedy, SPY x FAMILY. I've been a fan of this manga since the beginning. Keeping up with the Forgers is always a good time with the cool undercover spy Loid, the powerful assassin Yor, and the precious and precocious psychic-powered daughter, Anya. Together they make up one family of misfits tied together by a common goal to keep the two neighboring countries at peace. Or at least the best a six-year-old can handle!    It's a good read, and one of my favorite currently running manga in Jump, with enough material to make a compelling show. I can't wait to see people watch it! The trailer looks smooth and colorful with animation by Studio Wit and CloverWorks. Just look at Anya's face! Isn't she such a cutie?! . She's full of great reactions that I can't wait to see animated. Yor and Loid look equally good as a power couple, you can tell they adapted the designs well. The action and music also seem promising from what I can see. I'm hoping for everything cool, cute, and comedic to be in full force here. It's a fun time for the whole family with the SPY x FAMILY!     discuss this in the forum (34 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Feature homepage / archives      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4, 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgxHxRAm8Xs': 1}"

While I don't know if it'll actually have any romance, just the fact that In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki is from the creator of Teasing Master Takagi-san is enough for me to check it out. There's even some fantasy series of different varieties that look appealing like Healer Girl and The Dawn of the Witch. And of course, this spring marks the beginning of back-to-back seasons of Love Live!, which means I've automatically won for the next six months.          Most Anticipated: SPY X FAMILY  I love a good comedy anime, and some of my favorite comedies of all time are those that revolve around character misunderstandings – shows like Gamers!, School Rumble, and Yamada's First Time that are able to push misunderstandings to absurd lengths through unique circumstances for the sake of comedic payoff. So when I heard that SPY x FAMILY was basically that but with a spy, an assassin, and a telepath, you end up getting more than just my curiosity… you get my full, undivided attention. I marathoned the first six volumes of the manga and it is impressive how deftly the author is able to juggle all the unique abilities and over-the-top characters in such a serious setting. After watching some of the previews and being impressed by the above-average presentation for what is extensively a reactionary type of comedy, I look forward to seeing how some of these classic situations where the characters completely misjudge each other end up playing out.    Runner-Up: Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic    I will admit that I wasn't the biggest fan of Kaguya Sama: Love Is War at first. While the show definitely seemed to fall into my wheelhouse of comedy anime, I initially found it a bit too cynical for its own good. However, as time went on and the show managed to find its emotional foothold, I began to appreciate both its comedy and character writing a lot more. Season two especially allowed me to better appreciate these characters by giving us a better look at where that rather cynical worldview can sometimes come from. I have read a bit of the manga after season two and there's a good chance that season three will feature even more of those intense character moments. Either way, I think there will definitely be a lot of good material to appreciate and I definitely can't wait for another snazzy anime opening!          Most Anticipated: Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs   In 2020's My Next Life as a Villainess: All Routes Lead to Doom!, a young woman is reincarnated as the villainess in a stereotypical girl's dating sim. The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs takes the same general idea and twists it. Instead of a young woman, it's a young man. Instead of becoming the villainess, he is a random background character. Instead of a kind dunce, he's a bit of a self-serving asshole. But that's just the start of things.    As it's based on the setting of a D-grade reverse-harem romance, the fantasy world is full of plot holes, most notably the absurd level of misandry that permeates society. Noblewomen have several lovers beyond their husbands (who are little more than slaves making money for their wives). Second and third sons are married off to elderly women, only to then be sent off to the front lines for an easy life insurance payout. Our hero wants to avoid this fate and is willing to do whatever it takes to do so. His plan is simply to have enough money and power to secure his own independence—too bad he somehow catches the eye of both the heroine and the villainess. It's a hilarious ride where you can both cheer for the hero fighting against this half-baked world and laugh whenever karma smacks him upside the head.    Runner-Up: Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie    So many stories end with the main couple getting together. However, this is where Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie begins. Shikimori is cute and popular, athletic and intelligent. But her boyfriend, Izumi, is none of these things; worse still, he is unlucky and accident-prone to a dangerous degree. However, because of this, he is one of the few to see the other side of his girlfriend. Whenever he is in trouble, be that physical or emotional, her cute veneer fades away and she becomes a suave badass that oozes coolness from every pore.    What I love about this change is that it's accompanied by a shift in Shikimori's character design—her chin becomes sharper, as do her eyes. She looks elegant and dangerous, capable of sweeping anyone off their feet. And while there is an obvious swapping of stereotypical gender roles between Shikimori and Izumi in this story, it's important to remember that Shikimori isn't just the cute girl or the badass; she's both. Shikimori and Izumi simply bring out the best in each other across the board, as any good couple should.          Most Anticipated: Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie  You can blame My Dress-Up Darling for rekindling my romcom torch just in time for Kaguya-sama season 3 and Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie. Since I like to highlight non-sequels here, however, I'll defer my focus to Shikimori, which comes with the blue-ribbon premise of “what if Utena Tenjou was your girlfriend?” If romcoms live or die by their gimmicks, then I can hardly think of one more ripe for virality than the one about a handsome tomboy coolly kabedon-ing her doe-eyed boy squeeze. Online wasn't quite ready for Witch Craft Works and its perpetually princess-carried male protagonist—a fact towards which I will forever be bitter, because that show rules—but I hope, in 2022, Shikimori can at least find some justice. Plus, the previews are bursting with color, and Doga Kobo know how to put together a good-looking anime. Maybe this will be the year of sakuga-rich romcom supremacy.    Beyond that, I have my eye on Vampire in the Garden. No doubt this looks and sounds pretty generic at first blush, but its staff has a good pedigree, and more importantly, I like vampires. Vanitas is nearly over, and Call of the Night doesn't air until the summer, so perhaps Studio Wit can slake my spring bloodthirst. Bubble, also on Wit's docket, will be premiering this season, and I will be heartbroken if the chaotic dream team alignment of Gen Urobuchi, Tetsuro Araki, and Takeshi Obata somehow manages to be boring. I couldn't care less about it being good or not, but it had better be loud. Finally, the only thing I know about SPY x FAMILY is that there's a funny-faced little gremlin girl, and that's good enough for me.          Most Anticipated: Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic  Some ongoing shows can struggle with diminishing returns as they accumulate more seasons, but Kaguya-sama: Love is War seems just a bit more ambitious than that. It's still probably the funniest, most laugh-out-loud anime comedy of the modern era, yes, but recall all the other stuff its second season was able to get up to. The series showed an impressive penchant for pulling off dramatic turns too, which is no small feat when you consider how most of these characters are necessarily stupid as hell. That's the trick though, that this series has endeared these doofuses to me. They're idiots, but they're my idiots, and that even includes Ishigami. Plus, I can't not admire the stones on this series to announce its third season by putting out a whole bonus episode, featuring the characters joking about the very notion of third seasons! Now that's confidence, and if you, like me, have been won over by Kaguya-sama this far along, you know it's earned confidence.    Runner-up: Love Live! Nijigasaki High School Idol Club 2nd Season   There are actually a fair amount of returning faces in this forthcoming Spring season, some more surprising than others. A new Black Rock Shooter? A new Ikki Tousen?! What year is it?! But the other follow-up I'm really looking forward to is the return of those girls in the Nijigasaki High School Idol Club, coming back for another go at what was one of Love Live!'s more atypical iterations. I'm specifically hopeful for this second round since, after the first season necessarily loaded itself up with specific character-focus episodes, having all those now covered means the opportunity for some more complex or ambitious plot-lines featuring all these girls. Of course, I already know that several new members are going to be added to the club this season as well, but given that I'm not a devotee of the mobile game they spawned from, I'm looking forward to getting to know them on my own time. And seeing how they get wrangled into things by the unstoppable swag of that sentient can of Monster Energy known as Yu Takasaki.          Most Anticipated: SPY x FAMILY  This was a no brainer – one of my current favorite manga titles getting an adaptation? Yes, please! Not that that's really any different from my usual criteria for whether I'm anticipating a show or not, but it really felt even easier this time around. That's because the Cold War-set spy spoof is the kind of story that I could see making excellent use of the additional elements anime can provide – music and movement could really work to enhance the way the humor works in the story of the Forger family's semi-secret missions, and giving Anya specifically a voice could help to make her an even more delightful character. Since she's arguably the beating heart of the series, that's especially important. Anya's the only person who knows what's actually going on with pretty much everyone else, because the little dear's a psychic…which no one else has the least clue about. So her adoptive father Loid has no idea that she knows that he's really the master spy Twilight and her adoptive mother Yor is in the dark about the fact that Anya knows she's actually an elite assassin. Mostly poor Anya uses her power to ensure that she gets to keep her happy family without getting sent back to the orphanage, but while this does add an element of pathos, it never overwhelms the zanier aspects of the story. SPY x FAMILY in manga form is a near-perfect blend of goofy spy parody and heartfelt family tale with one of my favorite dog characters (Bond could easily be this season's best boy), and unlike with other manga-to-anime transitions, I have very few worries that this one won't make the leap to anime very well.    And while I'm hoping that those aren't going to be famous last words, I'm also harboring hopes for two other favorite manga titles to make a successful transition: Love After World Domination, which should appeal to fans of Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department, and Ya Boy Kongming!, and not just because it brings my poetry-was-the-rap-battle-of-the-ancient-world teaching method to life. (But okay, mostly because of that.) But my true second pick for most anticipated show this spring is Dance Dance Danseur, surprising precisely no one. While it isn't likely to be Swan or Princess Tutu, the angle of a male dancer in classical ballet isn't one we see all that often, and done well, there's a lot of room for an exploration of the stigma boys face for taking up ballet and the beauty (and pain) of the art form. If the animation lives up to it, this could be a treat.          Most Anticipated: Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic  This year so far has been a relatively strong contender for romantic comedy anime. Komi-san, My Dress-Up Darling, Sasaki and Miyano, hell even a show like Fantasy Knockout really surprised me. And this new season seems to be shaping up to continue to the streak with Kanamori's Not Just a Cutie already piquing my interest.    There's a lot of top contenders, but when this anime walks in the room everyone else needs to step aside and let the real champion do the fighting. It's time for the big guns, it's not just love, it's war! Kaguya-sama is back baby and she's ready to throw down!! Season 1 was filled with belly-laughing over-the-top punchlines as we watched the two smartest idiots in the room tip-toe-tango around their mutual bludgeoning feelings for each other. Then season 2 delivered a real wallop while being able include the same hilarious jokes and teasing heart pounders, with some real drama! For a character most people didn't even like at first, no less! I was laughing and sobbing, and it's all thanks to the wonderful animation and direction brought by the team to bring out just the maximum amount of emotion. And I expect nothing less from season 3 after two strong showings. Kaguya-sama is a contender not to be overlooked.    Runner-up: SPY x FAMILY   Not a rom-com but equally strong AND cute, is the much awaited adaption of the Shonen Jump spy thriller and family comedy, SPY x FAMILY. I've been a fan of this manga since the beginning. Keeping up with the Forgers is always a good time with the cool undercover spy Loid, the powerful assassin Yor, and the precious and precocious psychic-powered daughter, Anya. Together they make up one family of misfits tied together by a common goal to keep the two neighboring countries at peace. Or at least the best a six-year-old can handle!    It's a good read, and one of my favorite currently running manga in Jump, with enough material to make a compelling show. I can't wait to see people watch it! The trailer looks smooth and colorful with animation by Studio Wit and CloverWorks. Just look at Anya's face! Isn't she such a cutie?! . She's full of great reactions that I can't wait to see animated. Yor and Loid look equally good as a power couple, you can tell they adapted the designs well. The action and music also seem promising from what I can see. I'm hoping for everything cool, cute, and comedic to be in full force here. It's a fun time for the whole family with the SPY x FAMILY!     discuss this in the forum (34 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Feature homepage / archives     ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4, 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgxHxRAm8Xs': 1}"

Below you'll find our editorial team's top (tentative) picks from the 46-odd shows slated to premiere in January. What are your favorite picks? Head on over to our poll and pick your top five. We'll publish the results before preview guide launches on April 1. Also, if you're still having a hard time choosing what to add to your queue, or you're just down for a good time, do check out Anime News Network's Spring 2022 Trailer Watch Party with YouTube personality Geoff Thew (Mother's Basement)!          Most Anticipated: Love After World Domination  Yeah yeah, I know this is likely interrupting a lengthy sweep of SPY x FAMILY top spots, but I'm more than happy to play the spoiler for this adorable-looking Super Sentai RomCom. There's nothing that I enjoy more than a good romantic comedy anime, and this looks like a total treat. The premise is great, the character designs are wonderful, and based on the trailers the animation looks strong all-around. Like this past season's Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department there's the risk of it playing a little too much inside baseball with the tokusatsu angle, but that's a small hurdle to clear for what looks like an absolutely adorable setup.    Runner-Up: SPY x FAMILY   That being said, yeah, I'm hyped for SPY x FAMILY a whole lot too. I've been reading the manga since it began, loving it just as long, and waiting for its inevitable anime adaptation to bring as many people as possible in for this wonderful, funny, and endlessly charming series. And going by the promos the production is seriously on-point. The secret sauce of this story is how it can effortlessly balance intense action and gut-busting humor without sweating a drop, and the trailers look ridiculously great at both. You probably don't need me to tell you this one's worth watching, but it's good enough that I feel compelled to do it anyway.    Alongside those, I am going to be feasting this season. Kaguya-sama is coming back, and as one of the greatest modern romcoms ever made it stands to reason I'm going to devour it. In fact, there's a whole block of romance-tinged series this season for me to chow down on between Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie, Aharen-san wa Hakarenai, and the potential disasterpiece of A Couple of Cuckoos.

Runner-Up: SPY x FAMILY   That being said, yeah, I'm hyped for SPY x FAMILY a whole lot too. I've been reading the manga since it began, loving it just as long, and waiting for its inevitable anime adaptation to bring as many people as possible in for this wonderful, funny, and endlessly charming series. And going by the promos the production is seriously on-point. The secret sauce of this story is how it can effortlessly balance intense action and gut-busting humor without sweating a drop, and the trailers look ridiculously great at both. You probably don't need me to tell you this one's worth watching, but it's good enough that I feel compelled to do it anyway.    Alongside those, I am going to be feasting this season. Kaguya-sama is coming back, and as one of the greatest modern romcoms ever made it stands to reason I'm going to devour it. In fact, there's a whole block of romance-tinged series this season for me to chow down on between Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie, Aharen-san wa Hakarenai, and the potential disasterpiece of A Couple of Cuckoos. While I don't know if it'll actually have any romance, just the fact that In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki is from the creator of Teasing Master Takagi-san is enough for me to check it out. There's even some fantasy series of different varieties that look appealing like Healer Girl and The Dawn of the Witch. And of course, this spring marks the beginning of back-to-back seasons of Love Live!, which means I've automatically won for the next six months.          Most Anticipated: SPY X FAMILY  I love a good comedy anime, and some of my favorite comedies of all time are those that revolve around character misunderstandings – shows like Gamers!, School Rumble, and Yamada's First Time that are able to push misunderstandings to absurd lengths through unique circumstances for the sake of comedic payoff. So when I heard that SPY x FAMILY was basically that but with a spy, an assassin, and a telepath, you end up getting more than just my curiosity… you get my full, undivided attention. I marathoned the first six volumes of the manga and it is impressive how deftly the author is able to juggle all the unique abilities and over-the-top characters in such a serious setting. After watching some of the previews and being impressed by the above-average presentation for what is extensively a reactionary type of comedy, I look forward to seeing how some of these classic situations where the characters completely misjudge each other end up playing out.    Runner-Up: Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic    I will admit that I wasn't the biggest fan of Kaguya Sama: Love Is War at first. While the show definitely seemed to fall into my wheelhouse of comedy anime, I initially found it a bit too cynical for its own good. However, as time went on and the show managed to find its emotional foothold, I began to appreciate both its comedy and character writing a lot more. Season two especially allowed me to better appreciate these characters by giving us a better look at where that rather cynical worldview can sometimes come from. I have read a bit of the manga after season two and there's a good chance that season three will feature even more of those intense character moments. Either way, I think there will definitely be a lot of good material to appreciate and I definitely can't wait for another snazzy anime opening!          Most Anticipated: Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs   In 2020's My Next Life as a Villainess: All Routes Lead to Doom!, a young woman is reincarnated as the villainess in a stereotypical girl's dating sim. The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs takes the same general idea and twists it. Instead of a young woman, it's a young man. Instead of becoming the villainess, he is a random background character. Instead of a kind dunce, he's a bit of a self-serving asshole. But that's just the start of things.    As it's based on the setting of a D-grade reverse-harem romance, the fantasy world is full of plot holes, most notably the absurd level of misandry that permeates society. Noblewomen have several lovers beyond their husbands (who are little more than slaves making money for their wives). Second and third sons are married off to elderly women, only to then be sent off to the front lines for an easy life insurance payout. Our hero wants to avoid this fate and is willing to do whatever it takes to do so. His plan is simply to have enough money and power to secure his own independence—too bad he somehow catches the eye of both the heroine and the villainess. It's a hilarious ride where you can both cheer for the hero fighting against this half-baked world and laugh whenever karma smacks him upside the head.    Runner-Up: Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie    So many stories end with the main couple getting together. However, this is where Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie begins. Shikimori is cute and popular, athletic and intelligent. But her boyfriend, Izumi, is none of these things; worse still, he is unlucky and accident-prone to a dangerous degree. However, because of this, he is one of the few to see the other side of his girlfriend. Whenever he is in trouble, be that physical or emotional, her cute veneer fades away and she becomes a suave badass that oozes coolness from every pore.    What I love about this change is that it's accompanied by a shift in Shikimori's character design—her chin becomes sharper, as do her eyes. She looks elegant and dangerous, capable of sweeping anyone off their feet. And while there is an obvious swapping of stereotypical gender roles between Shikimori and Izumi in this story, it's important to remember that Shikimori isn't just the cute girl or the badass; she's both. Shikimori and Izumi simply bring out the best in each other across the board, as any good couple should.          Most Anticipated: Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie  You can blame My Dress-Up Darling for rekindling my romcom torch just in time for Kaguya-sama season 3 and Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie. Since I like to highlight non-sequels here, however, I'll defer my focus to Shikimori, which comes with the blue-ribbon premise of “what if Utena Tenjou was your girlfriend?” If romcoms live or die by their gimmicks, then I can hardly think of one more ripe for virality than the one about a handsome tomboy coolly kabedon-ing her doe-eyed boy squeeze. Online wasn't quite ready for Witch Craft Works and its perpetually princess-carried male protagonist—a fact towards which I will forever be bitter, because that show rules—but I hope, in 2022, Shikimori can at least find some justice. Plus, the previews are bursting with color, and Doga Kobo know how to put together a good-looking anime. Maybe this will be the year of sakuga-rich romcom supremacy.    Beyond that, I have my eye on Vampire in the Garden. No doubt this looks and sounds pretty generic at first blush, but its staff has a good pedigree, and more importantly, I like vampires. Vanitas is nearly over, and Call of the Night doesn't air until the summer, so perhaps Studio Wit can slake my spring bloodthirst. Bubble, also on Wit's docket, will be premiering this season, and I will be heartbroken if the chaotic dream team alignment of Gen Urobuchi, Tetsuro Araki, and Takeshi Obata somehow manages to be boring. I couldn't care less about it being good or not, but it had better be loud. Finally, the only thing I know about SPY x FAMILY is that there's a funny-faced little gremlin girl, and that's good enough for me.          Most Anticipated: Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic  Some ongoing shows can struggle with diminishing returns as they accumulate more seasons, but Kaguya-sama: Love is War seems just a bit more ambitious than that. It's still probably the funniest, most laugh-out-loud anime comedy of the modern era, yes, but recall all the other stuff its second season was able to get up to. The series showed an impressive penchant for pulling off dramatic turns too, which is no small feat when you consider how most of these characters are necessarily stupid as hell. That's the trick though, that this series has endeared these doofuses to me. They're idiots, but they're my idiots, and that even includes Ishigami. Plus, I can't not admire the stones on this series to announce its third season by putting out a whole bonus episode, featuring the characters joking about the very notion of third seasons! Now that's confidence, and if you, like me, have been won over by Kaguya-sama this far along, you know it's earned confidence.    Runner-up: Love Live! Nijigasaki High School Idol Club 2nd Season   There are actually a fair amount of returning faces in this forthcoming Spring season, some more surprising than others. A new Black Rock Shooter? A new Ikki Tousen?! What year is it?! But the other follow-up I'm really looking forward to is the return of those girls in the Nijigasaki High School Idol Club, coming back for another go at what was one of Love Live!'s more atypical iterations. I'm specifically hopeful for this second round since, after the first season necessarily loaded itself up with specific character-focus episodes, having all those now covered means the opportunity for some more complex or ambitious plot-lines featuring all these girls. Of course, I already know that several new members are going to be added to the club this season as well, but given that I'm not a devotee of the mobile game they spawned from, I'm looking forward to getting to know them on my own time. And seeing how they get wrangled into things by the unstoppable swag of that sentient can of Monster Energy known as Yu Takasaki.          Most Anticipated: SPY x FAMILY  This was a no brainer – one of my current favorite manga titles getting an adaptation? Yes, please! Not that that's really any different from my usual criteria for whether I'm anticipating a show or not, but it really felt even easier this time around. That's because the Cold War-set spy spoof is the kind of story that I could see making excellent use of the additional elements anime can provide – music and movement could really work to enhance the way the humor works in the story of the Forger family's semi-secret missions, and giving Anya specifically a voice could help to make her an even more delightful character. Since she's arguably the beating heart of the series, that's especially important. Anya's the only person who knows what's actually going on with pretty much everyone else, because the little dear's a psychic…which no one else has the least clue about. So her adoptive father Loid has no idea that she knows that he's really the master spy Twilight and her adoptive mother Yor is in the dark about the fact that Anya knows she's actually an elite assassin. Mostly poor Anya uses her power to ensure that she gets to keep her happy family without getting sent back to the orphanage, but while this does add an element of pathos, it never overwhelms the zanier aspects of the story. SPY x FAMILY in manga form is a near-perfect blend of goofy spy parody and heartfelt family tale with one of my favorite dog characters (Bond could easily be this season's best boy), and unlike with other manga-to-anime transitions, I have very few worries that this one won't make the leap to anime very well.    And while I'm hoping that those aren't going to be famous last words, I'm also harboring hopes for two other favorite manga titles to make a successful transition: Love After World Domination, which should appeal to fans of Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department, and Ya Boy Kongming!, and not just because it brings my poetry-was-the-rap-battle-of-the-ancient-world teaching method to life. (But okay, mostly because of that.) But my true second pick for most anticipated show this spring is Dance Dance Danseur, surprising precisely no one. While it isn't likely to be Swan or Princess Tutu, the angle of a male dancer in classical ballet isn't one we see all that often, and done well, there's a lot of room for an exploration of the stigma boys face for taking up ballet and the beauty (and pain) of the art form. If the animation lives up to it, this could be a treat.          Most Anticipated: Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic  This year so far has been a relatively strong contender for romantic comedy anime. Komi-san, My Dress-Up Darling, Sasaki and Miyano, hell even a show like Fantasy Knockout really surprised me. And this new season seems to be shaping up to continue to the streak with Kanamori's Not Just a Cutie already piquing my interest.    There's a lot of top contenders, but when this anime walks in the room everyone else needs to step aside and let the real champion do the fighting. It's time for the big guns, it's not just love, it's war! Kaguya-sama is back baby and she's ready to throw down!! Season 1 was filled with belly-laughing over-the-top punchlines as we watched the two smartest idiots in the room tip-toe-tango around their mutual bludgeoning feelings for each other. Then season 2 delivered a real wallop while being able include the same hilarious jokes and teasing heart pounders, with some real drama! For a character most people didn't even like at first, no less! I was laughing and sobbing, and it's all thanks to the wonderful animation and direction brought by the team to bring out just the maximum amount of emotion. And I expect nothing less from season 3 after two strong showings. Kaguya-sama is a contender not to be overlooked.    Runner-up: SPY x FAMILY   Not a rom-com but equally strong AND cute, is the much awaited adaption of the Shonen Jump spy thriller and family comedy, SPY x FAMILY. I've been a fan of this manga since the beginning. Keeping up with the Forgers is always a good time with the cool undercover spy Loid, the powerful assassin Yor, and the precious and precocious psychic-powered daughter, Anya. Together they make up one family of misfits tied together by a common goal to keep the two neighboring countries at peace. Or at least the best a six-year-old can handle!    It's a good read, and one of my favorite currently running manga in Jump, with enough material to make a compelling show. I can't wait to see people watch it! The trailer looks smooth and colorful with animation by Studio Wit and CloverWorks. Just look at Anya's face! Isn't she such a cutie?! . She's full of great reactions that I can't wait to see animated. Yor and Loid look equally good as a power couple, you can tell they adapted the designs well. The action and music also seem promising from what I can see. I'm hoping for everything cool, cute, and comedic to be in full force here. It's a fun time for the whole family with the SPY x FAMILY!     discuss this in the forum (34 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Feature homepage / archives   ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4, 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgxHxRAm8Xs': 1}"

Most Anticipated: Love After World Domination  Yeah yeah, I know this is likely interrupting a lengthy sweep of SPY x FAMILY top spots, but I'm more than happy to play the spoiler for this adorable-looking Super Sentai RomCom. There's nothing that I enjoy more than a good romantic comedy anime, and this looks like a total treat. The premise is great, the character designs are wonderful, and based on the trailers the animation looks strong all-around. Like this past season's Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department there's the risk of it playing a little too much inside baseball with the tokusatsu angle, but that's a small hurdle to clear for what looks like an absolutely adorable setup.

Most Anticipated: Love After World Domination  Yeah yeah, I know this is likely interrupting a lengthy sweep of SPY x FAMILY top spots, but I'm more than happy to play the spoiler for this adorable-looking Super Sentai RomCom. There's nothing that I enjoy more than a good romantic comedy anime, and this looks like a total treat. The premise is great, the character designs are wonderful, and based on the trailers the animation looks strong all-around. Like this past season's Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department there's the risk of it playing a little too much inside baseball with the tokusatsu angle, but that's a small hurdle to clear for what looks like an absolutely adorable setup.    Runner-Up: SPY x FAMILY   That being said, yeah, I'm hyped for SPY x FAMILY a whole lot too. I've been reading the manga since it began, loving it just as long, and waiting for its inevitable anime adaptation to bring as many people as possible in for this wonderful, funny, and endlessly charming series. And going by the promos the production is seriously on-point. The secret sauce of this story is how it can effortlessly balance intense action and gut-busting humor without sweating a drop, and the trailers look ridiculously great at both. You probably don't need me to tell you this one's worth watching, but it's good enough that I feel compelled to do it anyway.    Alongside those, I am going to be feasting this season. Kaguya-sama is coming back, and as one of the greatest modern romcoms ever made it stands to reason I'm going to devour it. In fact, there's a whole block of romance-tinged series this season for me to chow down on between Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie, Aharen-san wa Hakarenai, and the potential disasterpiece of A Couple of Cuckoos. While I don't know if it'll actually have any romance, just the fact that In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki is from the creator of Teasing Master Takagi-san is enough for me to check it out. There's even some fantasy series of different varieties that look appealing like Healer Girl and The Dawn of the Witch. And of course, this spring marks the beginning of back-to-back seasons of Love Live!, which means I've automatically won for the next six months.          Most Anticipated: SPY X FAMILY  I love a good comedy anime, and some of my favorite comedies of all time are those that revolve around character misunderstandings – shows like Gamers!, School Rumble, and Yamada's First Time that are able to push misunderstandings to absurd lengths through unique circumstances for the sake of comedic payoff. So when I heard that SPY x FAMILY was basically that but with a spy, an assassin, and a telepath, you end up getting more than just my curiosity… you get my full, undivided attention. I marathoned the first six volumes of the manga and it is impressive how deftly the author is able to juggle all the unique abilities and over-the-top characters in such a serious setting. After watching some of the previews and being impressed by the above-average presentation for what is extensively a reactionary type of comedy, I look forward to seeing how some of these classic situations where the characters completely misjudge each other end up playing out.    Runner-Up: Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic    I will admit that I wasn't the biggest fan of Kaguya Sama: Love Is War at first. While the show definitely seemed to fall into my wheelhouse of comedy anime, I initially found it a bit too cynical for its own good. However, as time went on and the show managed to find its emotional foothold, I began to appreciate both its comedy and character writing a lot more. Season two especially allowed me to better appreciate these characters by giving us a better look at where that rather cynical worldview can sometimes come from. I have read a bit of the manga after season two and there's a good chance that season three will feature even more of those intense character moments. Either way, I think there will definitely be a lot of good material to appreciate and I definitely can't wait for another snazzy anime opening!          Most Anticipated: Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs   In 2020's My Next Life as a Villainess: All Routes Lead to Doom!, a young woman is reincarnated as the villainess in a stereotypical girl's dating sim. The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs takes the same general idea and twists it. Instead of a young woman, it's a young man. Instead of becoming the villainess, he is a random background character. Instead of a kind dunce, he's a bit of a self-serving asshole. But that's just the start of things.    As it's based on the setting of a D-grade reverse-harem romance, the fantasy world is full of plot holes, most notably the absurd level of misandry that permeates society. Noblewomen have several lovers beyond their husbands (who are little more than slaves making money for their wives). Second and third sons are married off to elderly women, only to then be sent off to the front lines for an easy life insurance payout. Our hero wants to avoid this fate and is willing to do whatever it takes to do so. His plan is simply to have enough money and power to secure his own independence—too bad he somehow catches the eye of both the heroine and the villainess. It's a hilarious ride where you can both cheer for the hero fighting against this half-baked world and laugh whenever karma smacks him upside the head.    Runner-Up: Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie    So many stories end with the main couple getting together. However, this is where Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie begins. Shikimori is cute and popular, athletic and intelligent. But her boyfriend, Izumi, is none of these things; worse still, he is unlucky and accident-prone to a dangerous degree. However, because of this, he is one of the few to see the other side of his girlfriend. Whenever he is in trouble, be that physical or emotional, her cute veneer fades away and she becomes a suave badass that oozes coolness from every pore.    What I love about this change is that it's accompanied by a shift in Shikimori's character design—her chin becomes sharper, as do her eyes. She looks elegant and dangerous, capable of sweeping anyone off their feet. And while there is an obvious swapping of stereotypical gender roles between Shikimori and Izumi in this story, it's important to remember that Shikimori isn't just the cute girl or the badass; she's both. Shikimori and Izumi simply bring out the best in each other across the board, as any good couple should.          Most Anticipated: Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie  You can blame My Dress-Up Darling for rekindling my romcom torch just in time for Kaguya-sama season 3 and Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie. Since I like to highlight non-sequels here, however, I'll defer my focus to Shikimori, which comes with the blue-ribbon premise of “what if Utena Tenjou was your girlfriend?” If romcoms live or die by their gimmicks, then I can hardly think of one more ripe for virality than the one about a handsome tomboy coolly kabedon-ing her doe-eyed boy squeeze. Online wasn't quite ready for Witch Craft Works and its perpetually princess-carried male protagonist—a fact towards which I will forever be bitter, because that show rules—but I hope, in 2022, Shikimori can at least find some justice. Plus, the previews are bursting with color, and Doga Kobo know how to put together a good-looking anime. Maybe this will be the year of sakuga-rich romcom supremacy.    Beyond that, I have my eye on Vampire in the Garden. No doubt this looks and sounds pretty generic at first blush, but its staff has a good pedigree, and more importantly, I like vampires. Vanitas is nearly over, and Call of the Night doesn't air until the summer, so perhaps Studio Wit can slake my spring bloodthirst. Bubble, also on Wit's docket, will be premiering this season, and I will be heartbroken if the chaotic dream team alignment of Gen Urobuchi, Tetsuro Araki, and Takeshi Obata somehow manages to be boring. I couldn't care less about it being good or not, but it had better be loud. Finally, the only thing I know about SPY x FAMILY is that there's a funny-faced little gremlin girl, and that's good enough for me.          Most Anticipated: Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic  Some ongoing shows can struggle with diminishing returns as they accumulate more seasons, but Kaguya-sama: Love is War seems just a bit more ambitious than that. It's still probably the funniest, most laugh-out-loud anime comedy of the modern era, yes, but recall all the other stuff its second season was able to get up to. The series showed an impressive penchant for pulling off dramatic turns too, which is no small feat when you consider how most of these characters are necessarily stupid as hell. That's the trick though, that this series has endeared these doofuses to me. They're idiots, but they're my idiots, and that even includes Ishigami. Plus, I can't not admire the stones on this series to announce its third season by putting out a whole bonus episode, featuring the characters joking about the very notion of third seasons! Now that's confidence, and if you, like me, have been won over by Kaguya-sama this far along, you know it's earned confidence.    Runner-up: Love Live! Nijigasaki High School Idol Club 2nd Season   There are actually a fair amount of returning faces in this forthcoming Spring season, some more surprising than others. A new Black Rock Shooter? A new Ikki Tousen?! What year is it?! But the other follow-up I'm really looking forward to is the return of those girls in the Nijigasaki High School Idol Club, coming back for another go at what was one of Love Live!'s more atypical iterations. I'm specifically hopeful for this second round since, after the first season necessarily loaded itself up with specific character-focus episodes, having all those now covered means the opportunity for some more complex or ambitious plot-lines featuring all these girls. Of course, I already know that several new members are going to be added to the club this season as well, but given that I'm not a devotee of the mobile game they spawned from, I'm looking forward to getting to know them on my own time. And seeing how they get wrangled into things by the unstoppable swag of that sentient can of Monster Energy known as Yu Takasaki.          Most Anticipated: SPY x FAMILY  This was a no brainer – one of my current favorite manga titles getting an adaptation? Yes, please! Not that that's really any different from my usual criteria for whether I'm anticipating a show or not, but it really felt even easier this time around. That's because the Cold War-set spy spoof is the kind of story that I could see making excellent use of the additional elements anime can provide – music and movement could really work to enhance the way the humor works in the story of the Forger family's semi-secret missions, and giving Anya specifically a voice could help to make her an even more delightful character. Since she's arguably the beating heart of the series, that's especially important. Anya's the only person who knows what's actually going on with pretty much everyone else, because the little dear's a psychic…which no one else has the least clue about. So her adoptive father Loid has no idea that she knows that he's really the master spy Twilight and her adoptive mother Yor is in the dark about the fact that Anya knows she's actually an elite assassin. Mostly poor Anya uses her power to ensure that she gets to keep her happy family without getting sent back to the orphanage, but while this does add an element of pathos, it never overwhelms the zanier aspects of the story. SPY x FAMILY in manga form is a near-perfect blend of goofy spy parody and heartfelt family tale with one of my favorite dog characters (Bond could easily be this season's best boy), and unlike with other manga-to-anime transitions, I have very few worries that this one won't make the leap to anime very well.    And while I'm hoping that those aren't going to be famous last words, I'm also harboring hopes for two other favorite manga titles to make a successful transition: Love After World Domination, which should appeal to fans of Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department, and Ya Boy Kongming!, and not just because it brings my poetry-was-the-rap-battle-of-the-ancient-world teaching method to life. (But okay, mostly because of that.) But my true second pick for most anticipated show this spring is Dance Dance Danseur, surprising precisely no one. While it isn't likely to be Swan or Princess Tutu, the angle of a male dancer in classical ballet isn't one we see all that often, and done well, there's a lot of room for an exploration of the stigma boys face for taking up ballet and the beauty (and pain) of the art form. If the animation lives up to it, this could be a treat.          Most Anticipated: Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic  This year so far has been a relatively strong contender for romantic comedy anime. Komi-san, My Dress-Up Darling, Sasaki and Miyano, hell even a show like Fantasy Knockout really surprised me. And this new season seems to be shaping up to continue to the streak with Kanamori's Not Just a Cutie already piquing my interest.    There's a lot of top contenders, but when this anime walks in the room everyone else needs to step aside and let the real champion do the fighting. It's time for the big guns, it's not just love, it's war! Kaguya-sama is back baby and she's ready to throw down!! Season 1 was filled with belly-laughing over-the-top punchlines as we watched the two smartest idiots in the room tip-toe-tango around their mutual bludgeoning feelings for each other. Then season 2 delivered a real wallop while being able include the same hilarious jokes and teasing heart pounders, with some real drama! For a character most people didn't even like at first, no less! I was laughing and sobbing, and it's all thanks to the wonderful animation and direction brought by the team to bring out just the maximum amount of emotion. And I expect nothing less from season 3 after two strong showings. Kaguya-sama is a contender not to be overlooked.    Runner-up: SPY x FAMILY   Not a rom-com but equally strong AND cute, is the much awaited adaption of the Shonen Jump spy thriller and family comedy, SPY x FAMILY. I've been a fan of this manga since the beginning. Keeping up with the Forgers is always a good time with the cool undercover spy Loid, the powerful assassin Yor, and the precious and precocious psychic-powered daughter, Anya. Together they make up one family of misfits tied together by a common goal to keep the two neighboring countries at peace. Or at least the best a six-year-old can handle!    It's a good read, and one of my favorite currently running manga in Jump, with enough material to make a compelling show. I can't wait to see people watch it! The trailer looks smooth and colorful with animation by Studio Wit and CloverWorks. Just look at Anya's face! Isn't she such a cutie?! . She's full of great reactions that I can't wait to see animated. Yor and Loid look equally good as a power couple, you can tell they adapted the designs well. The action and music also seem promising from what I can see. I'm hoping for everything cool, cute, and comedic to be in full force here. It's a fun time for the whole family with the SPY x FAMILY!

Community score: 2.9                  How would you rate episode 2 of Estab-Life: Great Escape ?                     Community score: 3.0              What is this?   The world population has begun to shrink after reaching its peak. The ""Supernatural Renovation Project"" splits Tokyo with towering walls into several Cluster neighborhoods, each with its own unique genetically modified populations, governed by artificial intelligence. Most people live their lives in their own unique Clusters, blissfully unconcerned with life beyond. However, there are some who seek to escape to the other Clusters. An outfit called Nigashiya helps those who wish to escape.    Estab-Life: Great Escape is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll.      How was the first episode?    Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                You've gotta hand it to Goro Taniguchi. In an industry that always hesitates to release original projects, he's leveraged the success of Code Geass into nearly a decade of making original sci-fi TV series. Granted, none of those creations have managed to be better than “just okay” – a streak that looks to continue with Estab-Life – but you have to respect the hustle. And while I probably won't be watching more of this one, I can at least say I had fun with these introductory episodes.    In a word, Estab-Life is busy. Busy in its aesthetic, with the mishmash of colors and designs that constitute our main characters, the design of the sci-fi world they inhabit, and the occasionally well-executed but largely workmanlike CG animation. Busy in its worldbuilding, as it throws concepts like slime girls and wolf men and “Gun Wizards” at the audience with not a second of exposition to clue you in, while only barely communicating its central conceit of closed-off post-apocalypse cities that our heroes help traffic people in-between. Busy in its tone, as these opening episodes attempt to balance snazzy spy action, goofy comedy, and quiet poignancy in ways that work more than you'd expect, but still not often enough to be effective. There's a lot going on here, and the show is never as graceful about any of it as you'd hope for.    That said, I'm a fan of offbeat sci-fi series, and that's very much the vibe I get from this premiere. The characters are simple archetypes with just enough personality to be likable, and they flit between the high-flying sci-fi action setpieces with just the right amount of energy. That's a good thing to have for what is likely to be an episodic series of missions and character pieces, and if the writing can deliver interesting individual stories it may just be worth keeping up with. I was actually pretty charmed by episode two, with the grizzled yakuza boss who yearns to escape Shinjuku's criminal underbelly and achieve his dream of becoming a magical girl. It's silly and it knows it, but there's an earnest feeling to the comedy that invites you to cheer for him and the other characters rather than trying to laugh at him. There's a central idea that it's ok, important even, to run away when you need to live a better life, and that compassion is a big part of what makes this whole scenario work so far. It's not deep, but it is heartfelt.    All in all this is still a pretty light watch. There's nothing all that compelling, but it has the potential for a fun weekly distraction if nothing else. Its biggest sin is the CG character animation, which isn't terrible but leaves a lot to be desired, especially for any character outside the main cast. I can't decide if the yakuza characters in episode two being identical sunglasses guys in suits is funny on purpose or by accident, but it most definitely saved production resources. But in a time when things like Rusted Armors can come out, I'm not going to complain about largely competent CG. Still, it's enough of a problem that I doubt I'll be sticking around for any more of this.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I feel like Estab-Life is the very definition of “okay.” The plot is contrived and silly, but okay enough to follow, the characters are basically clichés, but okay enough to pay attention to, and the animation isn't EX-ARM levels of bad, but okay enough to watch. It's not quite good enough to be middle-of-the-road, but okay enough to be relatively harmless viewing. The catch is of course that its conceit is on the weirder side of things and that it's animated in the sort of CGI that sends some people running for the hills, especially since “better than EX-ARM and Rusted Armors” isn't exactly a ringing endorsement. Personally, I'm more bothered by Feles' character design; I'd love to take a pair of scissors to that one hunk of hair that hangs over her eye. (Or possibly hedge trimmers; it looks awfully thick.)    While not a lot is explained about the story's world, it is easy enough to put the pieces together, and I do like that we aren't burdened with heavy amounts of exposition. We don't know what happened to break Tokyo up into “clusters,” but it seems to be similar to each ward turning back into its own small town, with the difference being that in the story's dystopian world, moving between them isn't easy and may be outright illegal. That's created the job our heroines do: extracting people from their present lives and moving them into a new one in a different cluster. As a concept, it's neat enough to work, and other bits of world-building thrown in gave it a bit of a fantasy edge from other dystopias, although I'm hoping I'm not the only one who thought of Dragon Half when Martes is revealed to be a slime half. I'm not sure what to make of Ulula the bipedal wolf/furry or some of the other oddball details like the client from the second episode wanting to become a magical girl despite being an old man. Some of them feel like they were just thrown in because they sounded funny to someone rather than having a distinct purpose to fill. (The girls' boss doing low-key dance moves to give them coded messages is another one of those moments.)    I think this may be one of those series that relies on viewer patience for its first third or so before it truly gets moving. The tonal differences between these two episodes, with the first being much more serious than the second, aren't a great sign that it knows what kind of story it wants to tell, and the characters really are pretty cookie-cutter, so if you aren't a fan of their archetypes, that could become an issue. But if you have the patience, I think this may be worth one or two more episodes just to see if it figures out where it's going and what it wants to be – and if the answer to the second question turns out to be something other than “just okay.”       James Beckett  Rating:                A quirk of technology made it so that I accidentally watched the second episode of Estab-Life: Great Escape before the first, and boy howdy, you can probably guess how confused I was when the trio of strange anime girls, their robot, and their anthropomorphic wolf buddy helped an aging yakuza boss shoot himself out of a cannon so he could fulfill his lifelong dream of becoming a magical girl. However, even the actual premiere is very much the kind of episode that is happy to let its audience stew in their confusion for a while as it drip feeds exposition and lore. This isn't a bad thing at all; it just means that even after a double dose of episodes for its premiere, I still don't really know what this show is about. It's pretty fun to watch the weird shenanigans unfold, though.    It also helps that, despite being a fully 3D production, Polygon Pictures has worked hard to ensure that Estab-Life isn't the kind of unholy trash fire that some recent CG anime have been. The facial animations are still plenty awkward, to be sure, and the character animation suffers from a lack of in-betweens to smooth out the transitions between different poses, but it is still a solid effort overall. The direction is efficient and adequately cinematic, and the show's color palette is sufficiently diverse and lush looking. The quality voice acting also livens up the proceedings too; Ekua, Feles, and Martes are all likable and interesting, even if we barely know anything about them yet (except for the fact that Martes is apparently made mostly out of slime, for some reason).    What remains to be seen is if writer Shoji Gatoh's absurd sense of humor is going to mix with the strange sort of pathos that Estab-Life is trying to get from the different clients that the Extractors are helping. Neither the mopey philosophy teacher nor the gung-ho magical girl yakuza boss was terribly interesting, but there's something about the show's nebulous tone that I can't help but find fascinating. I'm definitely willing to give the series another episode or two to see if it can get its hooks into me, but I won't get my hopes up too high, just in case Estab-Life collapses under the weight of its own eccentric ambitions.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                This first episode is a bit of an odd ride. It simply throws us into the middle of things and never really explains itself. And honestly, there is an interesting thought experiment at the center of this: Apparently in the future, Japan is split up into autonomous city-states, each with its own unique laws and varying levels of authoritarianism. In the more controlling states, you can't even decide your own job, much less leave the city-state to join another. Thus, there are “extractors” who illegally help people escape and start new lives elsewhere.    This premise looks primed to be a framework for exploring feelings of entrapment in our daily lives: Sometimes it's in a job we hate. Other times it's in a relationship we know is wrong but just can't seem to leave. Hell, sometimes, it's being trapped in your own skin—feeling the “you” inside doesn't match the outside.    Which is why it's such a shame that Estab-Life fails in every conceivable way to live up to its premise.    For this kind of high-concept story, you need to make the viewer on focus the themes being explored. Bland, one-note, and frankly annoying characters only distract from this. There is no one to really empathize with, not the main characters and not even our disheartened teacher-turned-escapee. (Honestly, if your students aren't taking in your lessons, maybe you need to change how you teach!)    Then there are the visuals. I won't say it looks terrible—we are in the age of EX-ARM and Tesla Note, after all—though they are certainly subpar for what can be done with 3D animation. The real problem is the accidental visual storytelling. Our characters never take cover in gun battles and just stand in the open shooting, implying they are either stupid or invincible. Later we watch a 100 lbs. schoolgirl climb a 10-floor vertical glass face with a 150 lbs. man attached to her back using only her arms. Does she have super strength or is this just bad writing? In the end, it doesn't really matter. What does matter is that it's a distraction from the themes the episode is trying to explore.    To put it as simply as possible: cool ideas, terrible execution.     discuss this in the forum (291 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

The world population has begun to shrink after reaching its peak. The ""Supernatural Renovation Project"" splits Tokyo with towering walls into several Cluster neighborhoods, each with its own unique genetically modified populations, governed by artificial intelligence. Most people live their lives in their own unique Clusters, blissfully unconcerned with life beyond. However, there are some who seek to escape to the other Clusters. An outfit called Nigashiya helps those who wish to escape.    Estab-Life: Great Escape is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll.      How was the first episode?    Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                You've gotta hand it to Goro Taniguchi. In an industry that always hesitates to release original projects, he's leveraged the success of Code Geass into nearly a decade of making original sci-fi TV series.

And while I probably won't be watching more of this one, I can at least say I had fun with these introductory episodes.    In a word, Estab-Life is busy. Busy in its aesthetic, with the mishmash of colors and designs that constitute our main characters, the design of the sci-fi world they inhabit, and the occasionally well-executed but largely workmanlike CG animation. Busy in its worldbuilding, as it throws concepts like slime girls and wolf men and “Gun Wizards” at the audience with not a second of exposition to clue you in, while only barely communicating its central conceit of closed-off post-apocalypse cities that our heroes help traffic people in-between.

(Honestly, if your students aren't taking in your lessons, maybe you need to change how you teach!)    Then there are the visuals. I won't say it looks terrible—we are in the age of EX-ARM and Tesla Note, after all—though they are certainly subpar for what can be done with 3D animation. The real problem is the accidental visual storytelling. Our characters never take cover in gun battles and just stand in the open shooting, implying they are either stupid or invincible. Later we watch a 100 lbs. schoolgirl climb a 10-floor vertical glass face with a 150 lbs. man attached to her back using only her arms. Does she have super strength or is this just bad writing? In the end, it doesn't really matter. What does matter is that it's a distraction from the themes the episode is trying to explore.    To put it as simply as possible: cool ideas, terrible execution.     discuss this in the forum (291 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives    ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

The world population has begun to shrink after reaching its peak. The ""Supernatural Renovation Project"" splits Tokyo with towering walls into several Cluster neighborhoods, each with its own unique genetically modified populations, governed by artificial intelligence. Most people live their lives in their own unique Clusters, blissfully unconcerned with life beyond. However, there are some who seek to escape to the other Clusters. An outfit called Nigashiya helps those who wish to escape.    Estab-Life: Great Escape is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll.      How was the first episode?    Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                You've gotta hand it to Goro Taniguchi. In an industry that always hesitates to release original projects, he's leveraged the success of Code Geass into nearly a decade of making original sci-fi TV series. Granted, none of those creations have managed to be better than “just okay” – a streak that looks to continue with Estab-Life – but you have to respect the hustle. And while I probably won't be watching more of this one, I can at least say I had fun with these introductory episodes.    In a word, Estab-Life is busy. Busy in its aesthetic, with the mishmash of colors and designs that constitute our main characters, the design of the sci-fi world they inhabit, and the occasionally well-executed but largely workmanlike CG animation. Busy in its worldbuilding, as it throws concepts like slime girls and wolf men and “Gun Wizards” at the audience with not a second of exposition to clue you in, while only barely communicating its central conceit of closed-off post-apocalypse cities that our heroes help traffic people in-between. Busy in its tone, as these opening episodes attempt to balance snazzy spy action, goofy comedy, and quiet poignancy in ways that work more than you'd expect, but still not often enough to be effective. There's a lot going on here, and the show is never as graceful about any of it as you'd hope for.    That said, I'm a fan of offbeat sci-fi series, and that's very much the vibe I get from this premiere. The characters are simple archetypes with just enough personality to be likable, and they flit between the high-flying sci-fi action setpieces with just the right amount of energy. That's a good thing to have for what is likely to be an episodic series of missions and character pieces, and if the writing can deliver interesting individual stories it may just be worth keeping up with. I was actually pretty charmed by episode two, with the grizzled yakuza boss who yearns to escape Shinjuku's criminal underbelly and achieve his dream of becoming a magical girl. It's silly and it knows it, but there's an earnest feeling to the comedy that invites you to cheer for him and the other characters rather than trying to laugh at him. There's a central idea that it's ok, important even, to run away when you need to live a better life, and that compassion is a big part of what makes this whole scenario work so far. It's not deep, but it is heartfelt.    All in all this is still a pretty light watch. There's nothing all that compelling, but it has the potential for a fun weekly distraction if nothing else. Its biggest sin is the CG character animation, which isn't terrible but leaves a lot to be desired, especially for any character outside the main cast. I can't decide if the yakuza characters in episode two being identical sunglasses guys in suits is funny on purpose or by accident, but it most definitely saved production resources. But in a time when things like Rusted Armors can come out, I'm not going to complain about largely competent CG. Still, it's enough of a problem that I doubt I'll be sticking around for any more of this.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I feel like Estab-Life is the very definition of “okay.” The plot is contrived and silly, but okay enough to follow, the characters are basically clichés, but okay enough to pay attention to, and the animation isn't EX-ARM levels of bad, but okay enough to watch. It's not quite good enough to be middle-of-the-road, but okay enough to be relatively harmless viewing. The catch is of course that its conceit is on the weirder side of things and that it's animated in the sort of CGI that sends some people running for the hills, especially since “better than EX-ARM and Rusted Armors” isn't exactly a ringing endorsement. Personally, I'm more bothered by Feles' character design; I'd love to take a pair of scissors to that one hunk of hair that hangs over her eye. (Or possibly hedge trimmers; it looks awfully thick.)    While not a lot is explained about the story's world, it is easy enough to put the pieces together, and I do like that we aren't burdened with heavy amounts of exposition. We don't know what happened to break Tokyo up into “clusters,” but it seems to be similar to each ward turning back into its own small town, with the difference being that in the story's dystopian world, moving between them isn't easy and may be outright illegal. That's created the job our heroines do: extracting people from their present lives and moving them into a new one in a different cluster. As a concept, it's neat enough to work, and other bits of world-building thrown in gave it a bit of a fantasy edge from other dystopias, although I'm hoping I'm not the only one who thought of Dragon Half when Martes is revealed to be a slime half. I'm not sure what to make of Ulula the bipedal wolf/furry or some of the other oddball details like the client from the second episode wanting to become a magical girl despite being an old man. Some of them feel like they were just thrown in because they sounded funny to someone rather than having a distinct purpose to fill. (The girls' boss doing low-key dance moves to give them coded messages is another one of those moments.)    I think this may be one of those series that relies on viewer patience for its first third or so before it truly gets moving. The tonal differences between these two episodes, with the first being much more serious than the second, aren't a great sign that it knows what kind of story it wants to tell, and the characters really are pretty cookie-cutter, so if you aren't a fan of their archetypes, that could become an issue. But if you have the patience, I think this may be worth one or two more episodes just to see if it figures out where it's going and what it wants to be – and if the answer to the second question turns out to be something other than “just okay.”       James Beckett  Rating:                A quirk of technology made it so that I accidentally watched the second episode of Estab-Life: Great Escape before the first, and boy howdy, you can probably guess how confused I was when the trio of strange anime girls, their robot, and their anthropomorphic wolf buddy helped an aging yakuza boss shoot himself out of a cannon so he could fulfill his lifelong dream of becoming a magical girl. However, even the actual premiere is very much the kind of episode that is happy to let its audience stew in their confusion for a while as it drip feeds exposition and lore. This isn't a bad thing at all; it just means that even after a double dose of episodes for its premiere, I still don't really know what this show is about. It's pretty fun to watch the weird shenanigans unfold, though.    It also helps that, despite being a fully 3D production, Polygon Pictures has worked hard to ensure that Estab-Life isn't the kind of unholy trash fire that some recent CG anime have been. The facial animations are still plenty awkward, to be sure, and the character animation suffers from a lack of in-betweens to smooth out the transitions between different poses, but it is still a solid effort overall. The direction is efficient and adequately cinematic, and the show's color palette is sufficiently diverse and lush looking. The quality voice acting also livens up the proceedings too; Ekua, Feles, and Martes are all likable and interesting, even if we barely know anything about them yet (except for the fact that Martes is apparently made mostly out of slime, for some reason).    What remains to be seen is if writer Shoji Gatoh's absurd sense of humor is going to mix with the strange sort of pathos that Estab-Life is trying to get from the different clients that the Extractors are helping. Neither the mopey philosophy teacher nor the gung-ho magical girl yakuza boss was terribly interesting, but there's something about the show's nebulous tone that I can't help but find fascinating. I'm definitely willing to give the series another episode or two to see if it can get its hooks into me, but I won't get my hopes up too high, just in case Estab-Life collapses under the weight of its own eccentric ambitions.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                This first episode is a bit of an odd ride. It simply throws us into the middle of things and never really explains itself. And honestly, there is an interesting thought experiment at the center of this: Apparently in the future, Japan is split up into autonomous city-states, each with its own unique laws and varying levels of authoritarianism. In the more controlling states, you can't even decide your own job, much less leave the city-state to join another. Thus, there are “extractors” who illegally help people escape and start new lives elsewhere.    This premise looks primed to be a framework for exploring feelings of entrapment in our daily lives: Sometimes it's in a job we hate. Other times it's in a relationship we know is wrong but just can't seem to leave. Hell, sometimes, it's being trapped in your own skin—feeling the “you” inside doesn't match the outside.    Which is why it's such a shame that Estab-Life fails in every conceivable way to live up to its premise.    For this kind of high-concept story, you need to make the viewer on focus the themes being explored. Bland, one-note, and frankly annoying characters only distract from this. There is no one to really empathize with, not the main characters and not even our disheartened teacher-turned-escapee.

I won't say it looks terrible—we are in the age of EX-ARM and Tesla Note, after all—though they are certainly subpar for what can be done with 3D animation.

But if you have the patience, I think this may be worth one or two more episodes just to see if it figures out where it's going and what it wants to be – and if the answer to the second question turns out to be something other than “just okay.”       James Beckett  Rating:                A quirk of technology made it so that I accidentally watched the second episode of Estab-Life: Great Escape before the first, and boy howdy, you can probably guess how confused I was when the trio of strange anime girls, their robot, and their anthropomorphic wolf buddy helped an aging yakuza boss shoot himself out of a cannon so he could fulfill his lifelong dream of becoming a magical girl. However, even the actual premiere is very much the kind of episode that is happy to let its audience stew in their confusion for a while as it drip feeds exposition and lore. This isn't a bad thing at all; it just means that even after a double dose of episodes for its premiere, I still don't really know what this show is about. It's pretty fun to watch the weird shenanigans unfold, though.    It also helps that, despite being a fully 3D production, Polygon Pictures has worked hard to ensure that Estab-Life isn't the kind of unholy trash fire that some recent CG anime have been. The facial animations are still plenty awkward, to be sure, and the character animation suffers from a lack of in-betweens to smooth out the transitions between different poses, but it is still a solid effort overall. The direction is efficient and adequately cinematic, and the show's color palette is sufficiently diverse and lush looking. The quality voice acting also livens up the proceedings too; Ekua, Feles, and Martes are all likable and interesting, even if we barely know anything about them yet (except for the fact that Martes is apparently made mostly out of slime, for some reason).    What remains to be seen is if writer Shoji Gatoh's absurd sense of humor is going to mix with the strange sort of pathos that Estab-Life is trying to get from the different clients that the Extractors are helping. Neither the mopey philosophy teacher nor the gung-ho magical girl yakuza boss was terribly interesting, but there's something about the show's nebulous tone that I can't help but find fascinating. I'm definitely willing to give the series another episode or two to see if it can get its hooks into me, but I won't get my hopes up too high, just in case Estab-Life collapses under the weight of its own eccentric ambitions.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                This first episode is a bit of an odd ride. It simply throws us into the middle of things and never really explains itself. And honestly, there is an interesting thought experiment at the center of this: Apparently in the future, Japan is split up into autonomous city-states, each with its own unique laws and varying levels of authoritarianism. In the more controlling states, you can't even decide your own job, much less leave the city-state to join another. Thus, there are “extractors” who illegally help people escape and start new lives elsewhere.    This premise looks primed to be a framework for exploring feelings of entrapment in our daily lives: Sometimes it's in a job we hate. Other times it's in a relationship we know is wrong but just can't seem to leave. Hell, sometimes, it's being trapped in your own skin—feeling the “you” inside doesn't match the outside.    Which is why it's such a shame that Estab-Life fails in every conceivable way to live up to its premise.    For this kind of high-concept story, you need to make the viewer on focus the themes being explored. Bland, one-note, and frankly annoying characters only distract from this. There is no one to really empathize with, not the main characters and not even our disheartened teacher-turned-escapee. (Honestly, if your students aren't taking in your lessons, maybe you need to change how you teach!)    Then there are the visuals. I won't say it looks terrible—we are in the age of EX-ARM and Tesla Note, after all—though they are certainly subpar for what can be done with 3D animation. The real problem is the accidental visual storytelling. Our characters never take cover in gun battles and just stand in the open shooting, implying they are either stupid or invincible. Later we watch a 100 lbs. schoolgirl climb a 10-floor vertical glass face with a 150 lbs. man attached to her back using only her arms. Does she have super strength or is this just bad writing? In the end, it doesn't really matter. What does matter is that it's a distraction from the themes the episode is trying to explore.    To put it as simply as possible: cool ideas, terrible execution.

Community score: 4.3           The biggest challenge when basing your entire story around a “genius character” is making them seem like a genius. All too often, being a genius either means having that character know things they couldn't possibly know or just having everyone else in the story be incompetent by comparison. Luckily, neither is the case here.    Over the course of the series, Wein has defeated several enemies on the battlefield despite being massively outnumbered. However, this time, it isn't the overconfident Mardens or a hastily assembled pursuit army from Cavarin. Rather, he faces the full force of Solgest—a country more powerful by far and with a King just as competent as Wein himself. To be frank, it is a war that Natra cannot hope to win and that is the crux of Wein's latest genius plan—well, one of them at least.    What's most interesting in this episode is the fact that Wein actually has several plans running concurrently. The most basic one is to make peace with Delunio—turning Solgest's invasion from a just one into an unjust one. To achieve that peace, he is willing to allow Zeno to give away a large portion of their territory—greatly undermining her hard-won power in the process. Unfortunately, Delunio's leader is having delusions of grandeur, certain that anything Wein could promise will be given freely by Solgest at the end of the war.    Thus, Wein moves on to a much more drastic plan—country-sized blackmail. If Natra falls, so will Delunio. Wein will use his civilian population as a weapon and cause a refugee crisis with the sole purpose of destabilizing Delunio—not only putting an end to any kind of personal ambitions the regent may have but making the country rife for outside invasion as well. What's great about this threat is that it mixes lies and truth. Sure, there is no plague-causing yellow fabric but Falanya did rally an entire population to march (and that wasn't even her own people).    The final nail in the coffin—the reason Delunio betrays Solgest—is thanks to Wein exploiting time-lagged communication and his enemy's morale-boosting propaganda. Delunio's own sources report that Natra is in full retreat. Thus, if Delunio doesn't march immediately, Natra will fall and the refugee crisis will begin.    Bringing Delunio onto his side isn't victory in the war, however. After all, King Solgest is Wein's equal on the battlefield—and his superior in actual combat. There is every possibility he could lead his army to victory despite the appearance of the Delunio army. However, herein lies Solgest's true weakness: without their King, they are nothing—just as Natra is nothing without Wein. The key to winning isn't bringing Delunio into the war but taking out King Solgest. As King Solgest is a man who lives for visceral pleasures—be that food or the thrill of battle—he leads from the front. Wein exploits this to lead the King into a trap where, after using himself as a distraction, his three best soldiers work together to bring the King down and win the day.    All in all, this episode ends The Genius Prince's Guide to Raising a Nation Out of Debt on a high note. We watch Wein face down someone who is his equal or superior in most ways—and win only because he is able to exploit a flaw in that person's personality. And even then, he doesn't come out of it unscathed. Wein is back where he started, the leader of a poor country just barely making ends meet—except now that territory is triple the size and his religious neighbors hate him. It's a fitting end for our arrogant, reluctant hero. At the very least, he won't be able to run away from his responsibilities any times soon.    Rating:                Random Thoughts:   •	Zeno could have so easily blamed Wein for the crisis with Delunio—and not have been entirely wrong to do so. Instead, she took responsibility for it. It just shows her strong character.    •	I couldn't help but notice when Ninym took out King Solgest, she was no longer wearing her disguise. So a Flam very publicly just defeated a ""Holy Elite."" No wonder the religious people are pissed at Natra.    •	It seems Wein didn't intend to kill King Solgest but I wonder what his plans were if he had been killed on accident.    •	Judging from King Solgest's reaction, I'm betting that Wein told him he planned to unify the continent and bring down the church—solely to end the oppression of the Fram people in general and Ninym in specific.    •	I wouldn't be surprised if King Solgest begins having his daughter court Wein aggressively after this. It would not only give him a spy but also a front row seat to Wein's ongoing conquests.    •	I loved that we got one final reminder that Caldmellia is the true big bad of this story and she is still out there and plotting.    •	Welp, thank you all for joining me on this fantastic ride. Let's hope another season gets made so we can do this again!       The Genius Prince's Guide to Raising a Nation Out of Debt is currently streaming on Funimation.

Sure, there is no plague-causing yellow fabric but Falanya did rally an entire population to march (and that wasn't even her own people).    The final nail in the coffin—the reason Delunio betrays Solgest—is thanks to Wein exploiting time-lagged communication and his enemy's morale-boosting propaganda. Delunio's own sources report that Natra is in full retreat. Thus, if Delunio doesn't march immediately, Natra will fall and the refugee crisis will begin.    Bringing Delunio onto his side isn't victory in the war, however. After all, King Solgest is Wein's equal on the battlefield—and his superior in actual combat. There is every possibility he could lead his army to victory despite the appearance of the Delunio army. However, herein lies Solgest's true weakness: without their King, they are nothing—just as Natra is nothing without Wein. The key to winning isn't bringing Delunio into the war but taking out King Solgest. As King Solgest is a man who lives for visceral pleasures—be that food or the thrill of battle—he leads from the front. Wein exploits this to lead the King into a trap where, after using himself as a distraction, his three best soldiers work together to bring the King down and win the day.    All in all, this episode ends The Genius Prince's Guide to Raising a Nation Out of Debt on a high note. We watch Wein face down someone who is his equal or superior in most ways—and win only because he is able to exploit a flaw in that person's personality. And even then, he doesn't come out of it unscathed. Wein is back where he started, the leader of a poor country just barely making ends meet—except now that territory is triple the size and his religious neighbors hate him. It's a fitting end for our arrogant, reluctant hero. At the very least, he won't be able to run away from his responsibilities any times soon.    Rating:                Random Thoughts:   •	Zeno could have so easily blamed Wein for the crisis with Delunio—and not have been entirely wrong to do so. Instead, she took responsibility for it. It just shows her strong character.    •	I couldn't help but notice when Ninym took out King Solgest, she was no longer wearing her disguise. So a Flam very publicly just defeated a ""Holy Elite."" No wonder the religious people are pissed at Natra.    •	It seems Wein didn't intend to kill King Solgest but I wonder what his plans were if he had been killed on accident.    •	Judging from King Solgest's reaction, I'm betting that Wein told him he planned to unify the continent and bring down the church—solely to end the oppression of the Fram people in general and Ninym in specific.    •	I wouldn't be surprised if King Solgest begins having his daughter court Wein aggressively after this. It would not only give him a spy but also a front row seat to Wein's ongoing conquests.    •	I loved that we got one final reminder that Caldmellia is the true big bad of this story and she is still out there and plotting.    •	Welp, thank you all for joining me on this fantastic ride.

Community score: 4.3           The biggest challenge when basing your entire story around a “genius character” is making them seem like a genius. All too often, being a genius either means having that character know things they couldn't possibly know or just having everyone else in the story be incompetent by comparison. Luckily, neither is the case here.    Over the course of the series, Wein has defeated several enemies on the battlefield despite being massively outnumbered. However, this time, it isn't the overconfident Mardens or a hastily assembled pursuit army from Cavarin. Rather, he faces the full force of Solgest—a country more powerful by far and with a King just as competent as Wein himself. To be frank, it is a war that Natra cannot hope to win and that is the crux of Wein's latest genius plan—well, one of them at least.    What's most interesting in this episode is the fact that Wein actually has several plans running concurrently. The most basic one is to make peace with Delunio—turning Solgest's invasion from a just one into an unjust one. To achieve that peace, he is willing to allow Zeno to give away a large portion of their territory—greatly undermining her hard-won power in the process. Unfortunately, Delunio's leader is having delusions of grandeur, certain that anything Wein could promise will be given freely by Solgest at the end of the war.    Thus, Wein moves on to a much more drastic plan—country-sized blackmail. If Natra falls, so will Delunio. Wein will use his civilian population as a weapon and cause a refugee crisis with the sole purpose of destabilizing Delunio—not only putting an end to any kind of personal ambitions the regent may have but making the country rife for outside invasion as well.

The fact that they're casting Yor when the 2nd episode hasn't been released yet makes me wonder if they already have material ahead of time or if they're just casting from, like, the manga...

Community score: 3.7              What is this?   Junpei Murao was fascinated with ballet as a child, but in his second year of middle school, his father passed away and he decided he needed to become more ""masculine,"" and he gave up on his aspirations. While still having an attachment to ballet, he takes up the martial art of Jeet Kune Do, and becomes popular in his class. Then one day, a new transfer student named Miyako Godai arrives in Junpei's class, and her mother runs a ballet studio. Miyako realizes that Junpei is interested in ballet, and invites him to do ballet together.    Dance Dance Danseur is based on George Asakura's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                 Hey, did you know that toxic masculinity really messes people up? It's insidious. It trickles down to others subconsciously, teaching men, even as children, to encourage those who follow the classical male ideal and shame those who do not. Dance Dance Danseur is like a case study showing how these commonly held beliefs can rob a child of his dream and destiny—and how he has to fight against his own ingrained worldview to get them back.    As a child, we see that Junpei was willing and able to follow his dream to become a ballet dancer. He was even willing to fight his friends when they disparaged it. However, what really messed him up was the death of his father. His father was a martial artist and stuntman; in other words, he was about as stereotypical of a manly man as you can get.    When Junpei brings up his dream to his father, his father initially tries to dissuade him and get him to do Jeet Kun Do instead. This is partly due to his own ingrained toxic masculinity, but it's also because he wants a shared interest through which he can connect with his son. But Junpei can't see that second bit. All he can see is that his father wanted him to do something more manly than ballet, an idea that is reinforced when his uncle (a likewise manly man) tells the young boy to be strong for his family after his father's passing. In his own way, he is trying to help Junpei through his grief by giving him a reason to fight on, but Junpei (being a literal child) only hears: manly=good, girly=bad.    Now, years later, Junpei has done everything he can to be the manliest man he can be. He sees it as his way of honoring his father, making his family and friends happy with how great he has become. The only problem is that in doing so, he has forgone his own chance at true happiness. Is it any surprise he's turned out to be such an angry young man? He forced his own desires deep down inside but they keep bubbling up. The loving support of his mother and sister isn't enough for him to accept his true self. What he needs is someone to confront him on a “masculine level”—to aggressively attack him right in the male ego and make doing ballet part of his manly pride. Its only through regaining his own inborn self-worth—by determining for himself what it means to be a man—that Junpei can find happiness. And while in this episode he has taken a step towards that, it is only the first step of many.    Dance Dance Danseur's first episode is a fantastic breakdown of toxic masculinity and the harm it subconsciously inflicts on children. Moreover, it has fantastic animation and a great moral. Honestly, there's not much here to dislike.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This is one of those premieres that's frustrating in good and bad ways. For the good, when this episode ended I seriously wanted the next one right away, which means this premiere did its job. For the bad, part of the reason I wanted another episode is because this one only feels like half a story.    On the one hand, that may be a good decision – plenty of otherwise good shows rush through their premieres in order to get to some kind of climax, sacrificing important character work to reach a suitably big moment to end on. So it may ultimately be good thing that Junpei's story feels like it's still stuck on the tarmac waiting for permission to take off. Because what we do get from him is really interesting, and tells us a lot about who this kid is and what the overall theme of this story will be. We see a kid who clearly wants to follow his passion, but a mixture of grief and toxic masculinity keeps him from pursuing it.    Those combative forces cause him to waffle a lot through this episode, insisting he's left ballet behind as a childhood whim while coming back to Miyako's studio every day once the offer's extended. It can be a little irksome to see him going back and forth like that, but it also builds anticipation for that moment when he'll finally let go of all that baggage and dance the way he so obviously wants to. But that moment is not coming now, and it does feel a little underwhelming when the episode just kind of stops, rather than ending. We've gotten the setup, but no payoff. There's enough good stuff here that I'm confident that payoff will deliver, but having to wait is, well, frustrating.    The other stumbling block for some will probably be the character designs. An admirable job has been done to translate George Asakura's lanky, limpid-eyed designs for animation. The dance scenes are also all-around solid, capturing the grace and precision that can make ballet such a delight to watch. It's everything that isn't a dance sequence that leaves some worries for me – there's a number of awkward still frames and edits that could just be a consequence of the brisk pace of this premiere, or be portents of a looming production collapse from an overburdened MAPPA. I'd like it to be the former, as there's a ton of potential for an anime that can really deliver on honest-to-goodness ballet performances, and it'd suck to see that fall apart.    Hangups aside, there's a lot of good here and it's a unique offering in an already packed season. That will hopefully make it stand out, and if nothing else I'll be hanging around until we get that big moment of catharsis for Junpei. Consider it a hesitant thumbs up.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                If you don't know, until I broke my left ankle in four places, I was a dancer. Primarily modern dance, but ballet as well, and I was serious about it that I would have, as the unpleasantly abrasive dance teacher says in this episode, given up everything else to pursue it. But that's not how life works, and it certainly gives me mixed feelings about Dance Dance Danseur's first episode. On the one hand, I absolutely agree with some of what the teacher says – to really excel in dance on a professional level, you do have to start early and you do have to give up most other things…and even then, it might not work out, as one of my cousins learned when she was told she didn't have the right body type to ever be a prima ballerina. But there are also ways to enjoy being a dancer without putting in that level of commitment, and there's nothing that says that Junpei can't perform and be a dancer while still keeping up with his other activities.    That of course is part of the conflict. Junpei's always wanted to do ballet, but the levels of fragile and toxic masculinity around him are astronomical, preventing him from pursuing what he loves. His dad's comment that people “already think he's a girl” because he plays piano made my skin crawl, because way to randomly gender music and dance, sir. Then when his uncle (who I suspect may be one of those family friend uncles rather than blood related) tells him after his father's death that Jumpei has to be the man in the family now, the damage is complete—Junpei has to be the man, dancing isn't manly, therefore, he can't be a dancer. It's terrible and all too familiar, and the poor kid is still busy lying to himself when he's a second year in middle school, fooling everyone except his older sister and Miyako, the newish girl at school. Miyako knows a dance move when she sees one, no matter what crap Junpei feeds everyone else about martial arts kicks, and she becomes the one person who's willing to support him—or at least to do so without being a jerk about it, like her mother.    Basically this episode was an exercise in frustration begging for relief that will almost certainly come in later episodes. Junpei is clearly working towards accepting himself and what he loves, and he's got a lot to work through, including being a fourteen-year-old boy who can't think of any reason why Miyako would want him to dance besides that she likes him. (More likely the reason is that there are so few male dancers that she's having a hard time finding a partner her age.) It's mostly a good frustration, because it does look to be in service of something rewarding, and the dancing is well enough animated that we can feel the muscles engaging, especially in the opening performance that hooks Jumpei on dance in the first place. Likewise we can see how Jumpei is self-taught in his movements, which is an excellent detail. I'll need to give it a couple more episodes before I decide, because this is a subject I could be very picky about, but since it seems to be as close to a Swan anime (or even getting the rest of the manga in English) as I'm likely to get, I suspect I'll end up taking it.     discuss this in the forum (291 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Dance Dance Danseur is like a case study showing how these commonly held beliefs can rob a child of his dream and destiny—and how he has to fight against his own ingrained worldview to get them back.    As a child, we see that Junpei was willing and able to follow his dream to become a ballet dancer. He was even willing to fight his friends when they disparaged it. However, what really messed him up was the death of his father. His father was a martial artist and stuntman; in other words, he was about as stereotypical of a manly man as you can get.    When Junpei brings up his dream to his father, his father initially tries to dissuade him and get him to do Jeet Kun Do instead. This is partly due to his own ingrained toxic masculinity, but it's also because he wants a shared interest through which he can connect with his son. But Junpei can't see that second bit. All he can see is that his father wanted him to do something more manly than ballet, an idea that is reinforced when his uncle (a likewise manly man) tells the young boy to be strong for his family after his father's passing. In his own way, he is trying to help Junpei through his grief by giving him a reason to fight on, but Junpei (being a literal child) only hears: manly=good, girly=bad.    Now, years later, Junpei has done everything he can to be the manliest man he can be. He sees it as his way of honoring his father, making his family and friends happy with how great he has become. The only problem is that in doing so, he has forgone his own chance at true happiness. Is it any surprise he's turned out to be such an angry young man? He forced his own desires deep down inside but they keep bubbling up. The loving support of his mother and sister isn't enough for him to accept his true self. What he needs is someone to confront him on a “masculine level”—to aggressively attack him right in the male ego and make doing ballet part of his manly pride. Its only through regaining his own inborn self-worth—by determining for himself what it means to be a man—that Junpei can find happiness. And while in this episode he has taken a step towards that, it is only the first step of many.    Dance Dance Danseur's first episode is a fantastic breakdown of toxic masculinity and the harm it subconsciously inflicts on children. Moreover, it has fantastic animation and a great moral. Honestly, there's not much here to dislike.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This is one of those premieres that's frustrating in good and bad ways. For the good, when this episode ended I seriously wanted the next one right away, which means this premiere did its job. For the bad, part of the reason I wanted another episode is because this one only feels like half a story.    On the one hand, that may be a good decision – plenty of otherwise good shows rush through their premieres in order to get to some kind of climax, sacrificing important character work to reach a suitably big moment to end on. So it may ultimately be good thing that Junpei's story feels like it's still stuck on the tarmac waiting for permission to take off. Because what we do get from him is really interesting, and tells us a lot about who this kid is and what the overall theme of this story will be. We see a kid who clearly wants to follow his passion, but a mixture of grief and toxic masculinity keeps him from pursuing it.    Those combative forces cause him to waffle a lot through this episode, insisting he's left ballet behind as a childhood whim while coming back to Miyako's studio every day once the offer's extended. It can be a little irksome to see him going back and forth like that, but it also builds anticipation for that moment when he'll finally let go of all that baggage and dance the way he so obviously wants to. But that moment is not coming now, and it does feel a little underwhelming when the episode just kind of stops, rather than ending. We've gotten the setup, but no payoff. There's enough good stuff here that I'm confident that payoff will deliver, but having to wait is, well, frustrating.    The other stumbling block for some will probably be the character designs. An admirable job has been done to translate George Asakura's lanky, limpid-eyed designs for animation. The dance scenes are also all-around solid, capturing the grace and precision that can make ballet such a delight to watch. It's everything that isn't a dance sequence that leaves some worries for me – there's a number of awkward still frames and edits that could just be a consequence of the brisk pace of this premiere, or be portents of a looming production collapse from an overburdened MAPPA. I'd like it to be the former, as there's a ton of potential for an anime that can really deliver on honest-to-goodness ballet performances, and it'd suck to see that fall apart.    Hangups aside, there's a lot of good here and it's a unique offering in an already packed season. That will hopefully make it stand out, and if nothing else I'll be hanging around until we get that big moment of catharsis for Junpei. Consider it a hesitant thumbs up.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                If you don't know, until I broke my left ankle in four places, I was a dancer. Primarily modern dance, but ballet as well, and I was serious about it that I would have, as the unpleasantly abrasive dance teacher says in this episode, given up everything else to pursue it. But that's not how life works, and it certainly gives me mixed feelings about Dance Dance Danseur's first episode. On the one hand, I absolutely agree with some of what the teacher says – to really excel in dance on a professional level, you do have to start early and you do have to give up most other things…and even then, it might not work out, as one of my cousins learned when she was told she didn't have the right body type to ever be a prima ballerina. But there are also ways to enjoy being a dancer without putting in that level of commitment, and there's nothing that says that Junpei can't perform and be a dancer while still keeping up with his other activities.    That of course is part of the conflict. Junpei's always wanted to do ballet, but the levels of fragile and toxic masculinity around him are astronomical, preventing him from pursuing what he loves. His dad's comment that people “already think he's a girl” because he plays piano made my skin crawl, because way to randomly gender music and dance, sir. Then when his uncle (who I suspect may be one of those family friend uncles rather than blood related) tells him after his father's death that Jumpei has to be the man in the family now, the damage is complete—Junpei has to be the man, dancing isn't manly, therefore, he can't be a dancer. It's terrible and all too familiar, and the poor kid is still busy lying to himself when he's a second year in middle school, fooling everyone except his older sister and Miyako, the newish girl at school. Miyako knows a dance move when she sees one, no matter what crap Junpei feeds everyone else about martial arts kicks, and she becomes the one person who's willing to support him—or at least to do so without being a jerk about it, like her mother.    Basically this episode was an exercise in frustration begging for relief that will almost certainly come in later episodes. Junpei is clearly working towards accepting himself and what he loves, and he's got a lot to work through, including being a fourteen-year-old boy who can't think of any reason why Miyako would want him to dance besides that she likes him. (More likely the reason is that there are so few male dancers that she's having a hard time finding a partner her age.) It's mostly a good frustration, because it does look to be in service of something rewarding, and the dancing is well enough animated that we can feel the muscles engaging, especially in the opening performance that hooks Jumpei on dance in the first place. Likewise we can see how Jumpei is self-taught in his movements, which is an excellent detail. I'll need to give it a couple more episodes before I decide, because this is a subject I could be very picky about, but since it seems to be as close to a Swan anime (or even getting the rest of the manga in English) as I'm likely to get, I suspect I'll end up taking it.     discuss this in the forum (291 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives    ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Its only through regaining his own inborn self-worth—by determining for himself what it means to be a man—that Junpei can find happiness. And while in this episode he has taken a step towards that, it is only the first step of many.    Dance Dance Danseur's first episode is a fantastic breakdown of toxic masculinity and the harm it subconsciously inflicts on children. Moreover, it has fantastic animation and a great moral. Honestly, there's not much here to dislike.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This is one of those premieres that's frustrating in good and bad ways. For the good, when this episode ended I seriously wanted the next one right away, which means this premiere did its job. For the bad, part of the reason I wanted another episode is because this one only feels like half a story.    On the one hand, that may be a good decision – plenty of otherwise good shows rush through their premieres in order to get to some kind of climax, sacrificing important character work to reach a suitably big moment to end on. So it may ultimately be good thing that Junpei's story feels like it's still stuck on the tarmac waiting for permission to take off. Because what we do get from him is really interesting, and tells us a lot about who this kid is and what the overall theme of this story will be. We see a kid who clearly wants to follow his passion, but a mixture of grief and toxic masculinity keeps him from pursuing it.    Those combative forces cause him to waffle a lot through this episode, insisting he's left ballet behind as a childhood whim while coming back to Miyako's studio every day once the offer's extended. It can be a little irksome to see him going back and forth like that, but it also builds anticipation for that moment when he'll finally let go of all that baggage and dance the way he so obviously wants to. But that moment is not coming now, and it does feel a little underwhelming when the episode just kind of stops, rather than ending. We've gotten the setup, but no payoff. There's enough good stuff here that I'm confident that payoff will deliver, but having to wait is, well, frustrating.    The other stumbling block for some will probably be the character designs. An admirable job has been done to translate George Asakura's lanky, limpid-eyed designs for animation. The dance scenes are also all-around solid, capturing the grace and precision that can make ballet such a delight to watch. It's everything that isn't a dance sequence that leaves some worries for me – there's a number of awkward still frames and edits that could just be a consequence of the brisk pace of this premiere, or be portents of a looming production collapse from an overburdened MAPPA. I'd like it to be the former, as there's a ton of potential for an anime that can really deliver on honest-to-goodness ballet performances, and it'd suck to see that fall apart.    Hangups aside, there's a lot of good here and it's a unique offering in an already packed season. That will hopefully make it stand out, and if nothing else I'll be hanging around until we get that big moment of catharsis for Junpei. Consider it a hesitant thumbs up.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                If you don't know, until I broke my left ankle in four places, I was a dancer. Primarily modern dance, but ballet as well, and I was serious about it that I would have, as the unpleasantly abrasive dance teacher says in this episode, given up everything else to pursue it. But that's not how life works, and it certainly gives me mixed feelings about Dance Dance Danseur's first episode. On the one hand, I absolutely agree with some of what the teacher says – to really excel in dance on a professional level, you do have to start early and you do have to give up most other things…and even then, it might not work out, as one of my cousins learned when she was told she didn't have the right body type to ever be a prima ballerina. But there are also ways to enjoy being a dancer without putting in that level of commitment, and there's nothing that says that Junpei can't perform and be a dancer while still keeping up with his other activities.    That of course is part of the conflict. Junpei's always wanted to do ballet, but the levels of fragile and toxic masculinity around him are astronomical, preventing him from pursuing what he loves. His dad's comment that people “already think he's a girl” because he plays piano made my skin crawl, because way to randomly gender music and dance, sir. Then when his uncle (who I suspect may be one of those family friend uncles rather than blood related) tells him after his father's death that Jumpei has to be the man in the family now, the damage is complete—Junpei has to be the man, dancing isn't manly, therefore, he can't be a dancer. It's terrible and all too familiar, and the poor kid is still busy lying to himself when he's a second year in middle school, fooling everyone except his older sister and Miyako, the newish girl at school. Miyako knows a dance move when she sees one, no matter what crap Junpei feeds everyone else about martial arts kicks, and she becomes the one person who's willing to support him—or at least to do so without being a jerk about it, like her mother.    Basically this episode was an exercise in frustration begging for relief that will almost certainly come in later episodes. Junpei is clearly working towards accepting himself and what he loves, and he's got a lot to work through, including being a fourteen-year-old boy who can't think of any reason why Miyako would want him to dance besides that she likes him. (More likely the reason is that there are so few male dancers that she's having a hard time finding a partner her age.) It's mostly a good frustration, because it does look to be in service of something rewarding, and the dancing is well enough animated that we can feel the muscles engaging, especially in the opening performance that hooks Jumpei on dance in the first place. Likewise we can see how Jumpei is self-taught in his movements, which is an excellent detail. I'll need to give it a couple more episodes before I decide, because this is a subject I could be very picky about, but since it seems to be as close to a Swan anime (or even getting the rest of the manga in English) as I'm likely to get, I suspect I'll end up taking it.

Community score: 3.8              What is this?   It is the year 2062, two decades after the failure of a massive workforce automation project. However, Artemis, the artificial intelligence at the core of that project, had decided to attack humanity, and the resulting war laid waste to Earth. A lone girl, Empress, wakes up in an underground laboratory at a base. She is one of three surviving guardians of humanity. However, she has no memories of what came before. All she knows is what a colonel of the peace-building force tells her. Artemis is constructing a space elevator to link the Moon and Earth, and Empress is ordered to destroy the space elevator before its completion. If the elevator is completed, the hordes of giant mechanized forces being mass-produced on the Moon will descend upon Earth.    Black Rock Shooter: Dawn Fall is the latest entry in the Black Rock Shooter franchise and streams on Disney+ in Japan on Sundays.    Note: The series still isn't available for streaming worldwide. Richard Eisenbeis lives in Japan and was able to watch the first episode there, albeit without subtitles.     How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Black Rock Shooter is one of those intellectual properties that I know the name of but little else. Luckily, since Dawn Fall is a reboot set in a completely new universe, that doesn't seem to matter. The setting is one we've all seen before: There's been a robot apocalypse of sorts and now humanity is on its last legs. However, there are a few AI who continue to fight for the human race—including our titular heroine, Black Rock Shooter.    This anime starts with the classic go-to for creating an audience POV character: amnesia. Not only does it allow Black Rock Shooter to ask all the dumb questions that any person living in the fictional world would already know the answers to, it also allows her to be super powerful without any explanation. Of course, the big drawback here is that, without memories, Black Rock Shooter has very little in the way of personality. All she knows is that she has to reach “lighthouse no. 8” and that she's not willing to abandon those in her care regardless of the tactical situation. It's a solid enough starting point, but for the moment she's not much of a character.    Unfortunately, neither are the other three main characters of this episode. We have the stereotypical protective big brother/sick little sister duo and a hardass military commander. Honestly, there's nothing more to them than that—which leaves the action to carry the show.    More than anything else, this first episode is a series of fight scenes. All of them are decently choreographed and show off the above average CG animation used in the show, further bolstered by a surprisingly rocking soundtrack. However, the black, brown, and grey color pallet can make it hard to see what is happening at times—especially during the fights that occur at night.    All in all, I'm not sure what to think of Dawn Fall. So far, it's little more than a pile of clichés—in both setting and characters. Maybe it will turn into something special down the line but this premiere is largely unimpressive.     discuss this in the forum (291 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Fear not, citizens! The recap movie and sequel are on Netflix right now and Jean-Karlo and Nicky are ready to give you the official This Week in Anime™ experience.    These movies are streaming on Netflix   Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the participants in this chatlog are not the views of Anime News Network.Spoiler Warning for discussion of the series ahead.     @Lossthief    @mouse_inhouse    @NickyEnchilada    @vestenet      Nicky  Hey, everybody, it's me and Jean-Karlo here, and today we announce that due to recent changes in upper-management This Week in Anime will include regular shout-outs to sponsors!     Jean-Karlo  This week's This Week in Anime was brought to you by Crab! It all comes crawling back to Crab™!     Crab and very region-specific Pepsi sounds like an interesting flavor combo, NGL. But still not as interesting of a combo as the hero duo Tiger & Bunny!     The original Tiger & Bunny anime came out a bit before the massive influx of superheroes became the mono-culture in the U.S. And weirdly enough, it's taken this long for the series to come back with a new season. Netflix is also streaming two movies for the Tiger & Bunny series, The Beginning and The Rising.   These two films came out in 2012 and 2014 respectively but have just now been re-released for streaming on Netflix in honor of that hot new second season. The Beginning is half re-cap of the early part of the series and serves as a great re-introduction for our Super Hero Buddy Cops, while The Rising takes place after the series proper with entirely new material.     Now, I love me some Japanese superheroes, especially the old blood. Yatterman, Gatchaman, Kamen Rider, Casshern, Ultraman, that stuff. And I was always interested in how Japan would handle a take on more Americanized superheroes. Tiger & Bunny has been beloved by fans since its premiere, and not just because of the wave of heroes the Mouse of House churns out on a daily basis. It's a fascinating show, all the way down to the folks wearing those fancy sponsored CG costumes.   Tiger & Bunny is conceptually rich because it fully breaks down the idea of commercialized heroing as an industry, including real company sponsors (which leads to some funny dissonance). The heroes of Sternbild receive live TV coverage and toe the line between being enforcers, performers, and public motivators, along with everything else that life throws at them, on and off the cameras. The focus on the corporate inner workings is part of what makes it feel more mature. It's not just some kids' fantasy of saving people, but a more detailed look at what would happen if someone really tried to make this their job.   Normally, all the heroes compete for points with each other. But when veteran Wild Tiger, real name Kotetsu Kaburagi, moves to a new company after his previous one folds, he's paired with the young and ambitious Barnaby Brooks Jr., to which he affectionally nicknames Bunny, much to his new partner's annoyance.      What makes Tiger & Bunny work – unlike a lot of ""these heroes are realistic!"" joints like The Boys – is that it's not relentlessly dour. The characters aren't irredeemable louts or psychopaths, they're just people trying to make an honest living while living under the whims of an unfeeling, uncaring management system. These people live or die by their sponsors. It's more Mystery Men than anything else, and that's a damn original place to start from when you're making a superhero movie.   It also leans heavily into the showbiz stuff more than any other cape thing I had watched before, but if anything its core is its ensemble cast of heroes and trying to build the companionship between the two main characters. Like many stories about manly bonds, the two of them start out pretty prickly at first, but both have also suffered severe losses of love in their lives. Kotetsu has a 10-year-old daughter he keeps his work secret from, and has previously lost his wife. Barnaby lost his family to a tragic (extremely plot related) incident that left him traumatized. Just knowing this, you can see how much they could benefit from having someone else to call family in their life. Y'know, assuming you could get one of them to open up.     Kotetsu is a really compelling character, and not just because he's a handsome fail-dad with a stylish outfit. He just needs some loving heart to make him better, or worse, that's a fantasy, too. He's goofy and his sense of heroism really doesn't jive with the mercenary world he's in, but rather than feeling like an idiot he just feels quaint. He's not wrong to want to help people, he's just shouldering more weight than he can carry because he just cares about people that much.     He's definitely meant to appeal to an older audience, a rarity for anime, and he's the the heart of the show despite being a lame guy who struggles to keep up with the younger competition. He constantly lets people down, including his own daughter, but you can tell he really values people's feelings just as much as being a hero.     As if to underline it all: his is the only ""conventional"" superhero outfit among all the other heroes. Everyone else has a fancy suit of armor, but Wild Tiger insists on a cape, a themed cowl, and a strongman suit. Even when he gets his updated power suit, he still wears his old one underneath. You can see him wearing the mask inside his helmet.   Barnaby however is the complete opposite, all suped up in the latest tech and uses his real name and face. He instantly saves Kotetsu's sorry ass and is eager to climb up the ladder. They also both happen to share the same type of power, including the fact that both of them have a time limit to use it.      Where Kotetsu wants to be a hero out of a genuine-to-a-fault desire to help people, Barnaby is wholly self-interested... or so he tells himself. He's convinced that putting his identity out there and acting as a hero can get him the funds and recognition he needs to track down the Oroboros group, the crime ring involved with the  murder of his parents. He may not want to care about other people, but he still cares nevertheless. Not that he'd ever admit it to such an embarrassing dad like Kotetsu.   Also, in a twist of fate, Barnaby Brooks Jr is Kotetsu's daughter's favorite superhero. Not even Wild Tiger. Eesh.      Kotetsu's old school ways doesn't make him popular, even with his own daughter. He was inspired by the King of Old Timers, Mr. Legend, so it makes sense that he clings to those ideals. Many people with super powers in this world – referred to as NEXT – don't always fit in when their powers are fresh and new, and even so, not everyone is fit to be a hero.      This is explored a bit more in The Rising, but a lot of NEXTs have powers that just skirt the line of being useful. Stuff like producing a toxin that just makes you really itchy. Or making your hand grow really, really big. Or, like... being really good at swimming. Kotetsu himself rides that line, partially because of his shtick, partially because his power on its own isn't the best (he can make himself one-hundred times stronger for a short period of time), and partially because he tends to leap before he looks. Like My Hero Academia and its many characters that have wholly-pedestrian Quirks, a lot of heroes in Tiger & Bunny just aren't meant for the big leagues.   When the series begins, Kotetsu is at least doing well enough to stand alongside the biggest heroes in the city: the immovable Rock Bison, the scaredy-cat ninja Origami Cyclone, the thunder-wielding Dragon Kid, the literally-flaming Fire Emblem, the King of Heroes Sky High, and the ice-wielding idol Blue Rose.       And even in The Beginning we really see how Kotetsu helps bring these people together. At first they don't really have much comradery with each other, they might even get in each other's way, something the villain of the first movie actively uses against all of them. But by the time The Rising happens you can really feel how they've grown close.   As always, the villain is capitalism. Because all of the heroes are part of Hero TV, a superhero reality tv show, they're all rated on their actions. You earn points for saving citizens and preventing disasters, but lose points if you fail to capture criminals or if they give you the slip. Getting points is important because you cannot become a hero without a sponsor, and doing well means your sponsor is happy. Happy sponsors, happy network, happy hero. Thus, it's against their best interests to help each other out: each hero scrambles for as many points as they can get.    This is also part of why Kotetsu is such a bomb in the ratings: much to his producer's chagrin, he values people's lives over ratings or network shares, so instead of waiting for a commercial break to let the audience get excited he goes and just tries to save people anyway.      Other than the recap portion of the movie, the plot of The Beginning is that someone nabs the city's very important golden statue of justice and nobody can catch the crook. All the heroes run around, get bamboozled by his power to swap places, and it's really just a fun excuse to allow the cast run around and interact. Anime movies often feel bad for being superfluous, but since Tiger & Bunny the series has quite a few episodes dedicated to just building up the characters, it doesn't really feel out of place for the franchise.     It helps that the other heroes aren't terribly complicated and nevertheless get plenty of scenes to themselves. When the team is called out to arrest thief Robin Baxter, they all go their separate ways... together. Dragon Kid and Blue Rose talk about earrings. Fire Emblem... flirts with Rock Bison. Sky High shows off his wind-control powers to Origami Cyclone, showing an uncharacteristically fun-loving side of himself. It's good stuff that does a good job of letting the cast start to see themselves as more than just competitors.       They each get their moments, whether it's Sky High being a little ""up in the clouds"" even though he's currently the top-rated hero, Rock Bison and Kotetsu being Old Guys together as pals at the bottom of the rankings, or Blue Rose's hilariously cheesy mandated catchphrase.   I also wanna point out that I love the character designs in Tiger & Bunny. It's not just Kotetsu's fancy outfits or Barnaby's flowing locks – everyone in this series looks amazing. Masakazu Katsura was brought onboard to handle character designs; he worked on the superhero-flavored Zetman but he's also known for the romantic comedies D.N.A.², Video Girl Ai, and I''s. His charming character designs are fantastic.   ... Also, he did a manga called Wingman about a toku-themed superhero and I'm dying to see that get brought back someday.    They're also more semi-realistic than most anime even ten years ago and it works better since most of the characters are older. The downside is that it makes them harder to animate too, so expect them to look off-model in places. But I think overall the movies look good even compared to today's standards, including the heavy use of CG for the suits and the action.     As it turns out, the CG is on purpose: because many of the costumes would otherwise have to be redrawn if sponsors for the heroes changed (or if the sponsorship brands had to be removed for foreign markets), it's just easier to render them as CG models. The only one who gets traditional animation is Blue Rose, partly because it's hard to shove a logo on her skimpy outfit, partly because she's T&B's source of T&A.     Which becomes upsetting when you remember she's supposed to be in high school still, for some reason. Why are there no adult female superheroes?!   Nobody said idol culture was healthy... A detail the movies leave out from the series is that Blue Rose might have romantic inclinations towards Kotetsu, who's like... twice her age. Thank goodness. Also, because let's be honest, Kotetsu and Barnaby all the way. A family can be a little girl and her two bickering superhero dads.     That's touched on in the series but I prefer to see it as a ""hero crush"" rather than just being hot for a single dad since she obviously takes Kotetsu's ideals to heart after a point. But it's not strong enough to get in the way of Kotetsu and Barnaby's intense married couple energy. The series very much leans in on the ""partner"" thing in more than just a joke or tongue-in-cheek way; they really are each other's emotional support. Which is why in The Rising the whole plot is just about them breaking up and trying to get back together. It's classic.     I wanna touch on one more thing from The Beginning before we get into The Rising: it ends with a really big show of trust for Barnaby from Kotetsu. Barnaby manages to trick Robin Baxter into imprisoning himself, but later finds that Kotetsu specifically went out of his way not only to let the other heroes allow Barnaby to do this alone, but also made sure to hang in the background to make sure Barnaby's plan went off. As much as Kotetsu chafes at Barnaby's antics, he still wants him to feel like a member of a team.      Oh yeah, it's a great moment of just the way Kotetsu quietly supports people even if they didn't ask for it or he doesn't always know how to show it, and the plan wouldn't have worked if Kotetsu never stuck his neck out to the others the way he did.    I'll also take a moment to shoutout to the dub. I found both language tracks to be pretty good, but Tiger & Bunny has a lot of what I miss in anime dubs. The script is adapted really well and fits the more natural and Americanized feel of the show and the more diverse cast.   Being that I'm more of a fan of older Japanese heroes, I do regret the more-Americanized takes on the recent Japanese superheroes. But this does mean that a lot of life is breathed into them in English dubs.   Anyway, Kotetsu starts The Rising out with his breath beaten out of him. Wild Tiger and Barnaby have sunk in the ratings in the time since The Beginning (it's been a few months and later events from the Tiger & Bunny series have transpired). They're knocked down to the ""Second League"", where a bunch of not-so-great superheroes dwell.      Kotetsu had gotten up in age to the point where he can't use his powers very long and is trying to take a slower pace to accommodate but fears that by doing so he's now drawing down his partner.   The good news is, a mogul named Mark Schneider bought out their old sponsor and pulls the strings needed to get Barnaby back up to the First League, teaming him up with a new hero named Golden Ryan. The bad news is, Schneider had no intention of doing anything for Kotetsu: without a sponsor, he's forced to retire from heroism and take up a job as a cab driver.     Golden Ryan (A pun on ""Golden Lion"" to Kotetsu's Tiger), is also a bit of a huge douchebag.     You think the guys at Banpresto had a laugh about their logo being emblazoned on such a tool of a hero? I can't see him making any Super Robot Wars cameos anytime soon...   At any rate, a series of disasters strikes the city. Barnaby puts the clues together and deduces that the disasters are connected to an old legend from the city's history: a goddess, angered by mankind's greed, sends earthquakes, sleeping sickness and a massive chasm to devour the city. The problem is just trying to convince the higher-ups to let the heroes investigate this.    Also compounding issues is Golden Ryan being concerned with just earning points for just him and Barnaby, instead of collaborating with other heroes--a selfishness helped along with Ryan's gravity-powers.      Barnaby may have been eager in the past, but he sticks to his ideals plenty compared to Ryan, whose dubious methods actively gets in the way of the other heroes, cause collateral damage, and puts citizens in danger just to get racked up on a point sheet.   It's here... that we can finally touch on Fire Emblem, because they're an important part of The Rising's story.   So... Fire Emblem is self-described as a gay superhero (and he's got fire powers, get it?). Being that they own their own company, they're their own sponsor. But like... Fire Emblem feels like a really bad take on a gay person, more akin to The Crying Game and that era of not differentiating gay men from trans-women or the like.    In a lot of ways, Fire Emblem reminds me of Levin from Tekkaman Blade (I'm going somewhere with this, bear with me). Levin was also swishy, flaming, and very flirty with the protagonist--and there's a very touching episode where Levin talks to a woman about living their truth. There's only one Levin in the world, and they live true to themselves, and Levin contains multitudes that just can't be described by simple binary concepts like ""man"" or ""woman."" And in a lot of ways, that's what Fire Emblem is going for: we see in their past that Nathan (Fire Emblem's real name) struggled with their attraction to men or presenting as a woman. Their big climactic moment while stuck in a nightmare of their own worst fears is having a Persona 4 moment and embracing their shadow, celebrating what it means to be themselves. This is really good and genuinely compelling and it does loads to keep Fire Emblem from just being a camp joke... if only Fire Emblem weren't always goosing the other men and touching their butts in what's clearly discomforting. Like, Levin also thirsted for D-Boy, but they kept their hands to themselves.       I'm actually really sweet on Fire Emblem for this type of extremely extra character. Anime doesn't have a good track record of portraying openly queer characters; they're often extremely one note, and while there are elements of Fire Emblem that still aid into negative stereotypes like occasionally making predatory statements or bad touching, there's also a lot of sincerity around the character as well. Fire Emblem regularly proves to be mature, competent, and an emotionally supportive character to others. The other characters never shun Nathan for who they are or who they love, and overall I'm glad that the series' writing does seem to take their character seriously even if it's not perfect.      Nathan's pros definitely outweigh his cons and I don't want to give the impression that I think they're an outright bad character; the phrase ""problematic"" was made for moments like these. They're a great hero, a trusted friend, and honestly the only ding on their journey of acceptance is the fact that they kept goosing the other guys. Nathan is a person of color and that's always a delight to see in anime. Also, I'm using they/them pronouns for Nathan because it's my understanding the new Tiger & Bunny anime is also doing so in the dub.   And once Fire Emblem comes back they lend one heck of an assist to Blue Rose and Dragon Kid... Also, Fire Emblem is sponsored by Domino's. That just amuses me.      Kotetsu also manages to get the go-ahead to jump back in the game while the 2nd League Heroes were helping Fire Emblem recover. It's a good moment for them considering they got canned for not making any company money earlier.    I also loved Rock Bison's little moment of SEND ME FLYING and throwing up the horns after. He was sitting in dead last point-wise and was even desperate enough to start copying other people's bits in order to make himself more likeable to poor results due to how obvious the imitation was.     The Fastball Special is a time-honored tradition in superheroism; I salute Rock Bison in return. It's only a matter of time before the MCU makes it utterly obnoxious.   It also goes into some other themes about imitation, like Kotetsu's daughter trying to figure out how to write a good poem for her assignment but running into a wall when she keeps trying to imitate. Kotetsu surprisingly offers some worldly advice, which gets thrown right back at him.    Everyone keeps trying to live up to what they think they should be doing and not necessarily what they can with their abilities or being true to their feelings.   It turns out that none of the disasters have any kind of divine origin: it's all revenge, baby! A man named Virgil is responsible for organizing the NEXTs that kicked the whole thing off. Using Sternbild's mythology against them, Virgil's goal is revenge against Schneider. Years ago, Schneider took advantage of Virgil's father in a business deal, which led to Virgil's father taking his own life. Virgil teamed up with three other NEXTs whose lives had been ruined by Schneider's wheeling-and-dealing in order to take out their revenge.         Which ties into some stuff in the series. Longtime villain and villain-killer Lunatic shows up to help Virgil to enact his own sense of justice and stand as Kotetsu's ideological opposite while Barnaby stands against Virgil as his mirror and opposite. Both of them state that it's important to be able to center yourself in the present, move on, and not be stuck in the past.      I can't be the only one who thinks Lunatic resembles a weird cross between Purple Haze and King Crimson. Anyway, Virgil becomes a giant robot crab made out of junk metal and fights off Wild Tiger and Barnaby in an attempt at carrying out his own revenge, claiming justification because Barnaby also took his revenge on the man that killed his parents.     Using Kotetsu's only one minute of power they unleash a big show-stopping team-up climax! Sweet.      The fantastic showing reinvigorates the public's desire for the old Wild Tiger/Barnaby team-up too, and even Golden Ryan helps spur them back into teaming up again.     With a nice poem from Kotetsu's daughter, the movie closes with the heroes continuing their duty of protecting Sternbild. It's a really solid ending for a solid pair of movies.     I thought these were both good as a re-introduction but also an epilogue for the series. It doesn't cover everything but it deals with a lot of elements that make Tiger & Bunny stand out.   As a Tiger & Bunny neophyte, I think these movies also serve really well as an introduction to the series. You get just enough of a taste of the other heroes to want to see more, the dynamic between Kotetsu and Barnaby is well-established, and the general feel of Sternbild is introduced. It's a unique world with interesting heroes, and I'm glad it's priming to make a big comeback to the world of anime. I hope Tiger & Bunny reaches a much bigger crowd this time around.   Yeah, I actually missed the initial boat for this one 10 years ago and had to binge the first season shortly before this because I kept putting it off until the second season was just around the corner. But I don't regret a minute of it. I definitely regret the fact that this couldn't be a bigger hit when it came out for a myriad of complicated reasons. That doesn't mean it's too late. Just because it's over a decade now doesn't mean it still can't have its day in the sun!   Nothing would be truer to this fail-dad than being late to his own successful franchise, I tell you what!     Anyways, this is Nicky & Jean-Karlo, over and out!

Jean-Karlo  This week's This Week in Anime was brought to you by Crab! It all comes crawling back to Crab™!     Crab and very region-specific Pepsi sounds like an interesting flavor combo, NGL. But still not as interesting of a combo as the hero duo Tiger & Bunny!     The original Tiger & Bunny anime came out a bit before the massive influx of superheroes became the mono-culture in the U.S. And weirdly enough, it's taken this long for the series to come back with a new season. Netflix is also streaming two movies for the Tiger & Bunny series, The Beginning and The Rising.   These two films came out in 2012 and 2014 respectively but have just now been re-released for streaming on Netflix in honor of that hot new second season. The Beginning is half re-cap of the early part of the series and serves as a great re-introduction for our Super Hero Buddy Cops, while The Rising takes place after the series proper with entirely new material.     Now, I love me some Japanese superheroes, especially the old blood. Yatterman, Gatchaman, Kamen Rider, Casshern, Ultraman, that stuff. And I was always interested in how Japan would handle a take on more Americanized superheroes. Tiger & Bunny has been beloved by fans since its premiere, and not just because of the wave of heroes the Mouse of House churns out on a daily basis. It's a fascinating show, all the way down to the folks wearing those fancy sponsored CG costumes.   Tiger & Bunny is conceptually rich because it fully breaks down the idea of commercialized heroing as an industry, including real company sponsors (which leads to some funny dissonance). The heroes of Sternbild receive live TV coverage and toe the line between being enforcers, performers, and public motivators, along with everything else that life throws at them, on and off the cameras. The focus on the corporate inner workings is part of what makes it feel more mature. It's not just some kids' fantasy of saving people, but a more detailed look at what would happen if someone really tried to make this their job.   Normally, all the heroes compete for points with each other. But when veteran Wild Tiger, real name Kotetsu Kaburagi, moves to a new company after his previous one folds, he's paired with the young and ambitious Barnaby Brooks Jr., to which he affectionally nicknames Bunny, much to his new partner's annoyance.      What makes Tiger & Bunny work – unlike a lot of ""these heroes are realistic!"" joints like The Boys – is that it's not relentlessly dour. The characters aren't irredeemable louts or psychopaths, they're just people trying to make an honest living while living under the whims of an unfeeling, uncaring management system. These people live or die by their sponsors. It's more Mystery Men than anything else, and that's a damn original place to start from when you're making a superhero movie.   It also leans heavily into the showbiz stuff more than any other cape thing I had watched before, but if anything its core is its ensemble cast of heroes and trying to build the companionship between the two main characters. Like many stories about manly bonds, the two of them start out pretty prickly at first, but both have also suffered severe losses of love in their lives. Kotetsu has a 10-year-old daughter he keeps his work secret from, and has previously lost his wife. Barnaby lost his family to a tragic (extremely plot related) incident that left him traumatized. Just knowing this, you can see how much they could benefit from having someone else to call family in their life. Y'know, assuming you could get one of them to open up.     Kotetsu is a really compelling character, and not just because he's a handsome fail-dad with a stylish outfit. He just needs some loving heart to make him better, or worse, that's a fantasy, too. He's goofy and his sense of heroism really doesn't jive with the mercenary world he's in, but rather than feeling like an idiot he just feels quaint. He's not wrong to want to help people, he's just shouldering more weight than he can carry because he just cares about people that much.     He's definitely meant to appeal to an older audience, a rarity for anime, and he's the the heart of the show despite being a lame guy who struggles to keep up with the younger competition. He constantly lets people down, including his own daughter, but you can tell he really values people's feelings just as much as being a hero.     As if to underline it all: his is the only ""conventional"" superhero outfit among all the other heroes. Everyone else has a fancy suit of armor, but Wild Tiger insists on a cape, a themed cowl, and a strongman suit. Even when he gets his updated power suit, he still wears his old one underneath. You can see him wearing the mask inside his helmet.   Barnaby however is the complete opposite, all suped up in the latest tech and uses his real name and face. He instantly saves Kotetsu's sorry ass and is eager to climb up the ladder. They also both happen to share the same type of power, including the fact that both of them have a time limit to use it.      Where Kotetsu wants to be a hero out of a genuine-to-a-fault desire to help people, Barnaby is wholly self-interested... or so he tells himself. He's convinced that putting his identity out there and acting as a hero can get him the funds and recognition he needs to track down the Oroboros group, the crime ring involved with the  murder of his parents. He may not want to care about other people, but he still cares nevertheless. Not that he'd ever admit it to such an embarrassing dad like Kotetsu.   Also, in a twist of fate, Barnaby Brooks Jr is Kotetsu's daughter's favorite superhero. Not even Wild Tiger. Eesh.      Kotetsu's old school ways doesn't make him popular, even with his own daughter. He was inspired by the King of Old Timers, Mr. Legend, so it makes sense that he clings to those ideals. Many people with super powers in this world – referred to as NEXT – don't always fit in when their powers are fresh and new, and even so, not everyone is fit to be a hero.      This is explored a bit more in The Rising, but a lot of NEXTs have powers that just skirt the line of being useful. Stuff like producing a toxin that just makes you really itchy. Or making your hand grow really, really big. Or, like... being really good at swimming. Kotetsu himself rides that line, partially because of his shtick, partially because his power on its own isn't the best (he can make himself one-hundred times stronger for a short period of time), and partially because he tends to leap before he looks. Like My Hero Academia and its many characters that have wholly-pedestrian Quirks, a lot of heroes in Tiger & Bunny just aren't meant for the big leagues.   When the series begins, Kotetsu is at least doing well enough to stand alongside the biggest heroes in the city: the immovable Rock Bison, the scaredy-cat ninja Origami Cyclone, the thunder-wielding Dragon Kid, the literally-flaming Fire Emblem, the King of Heroes Sky High, and the ice-wielding idol Blue Rose.       And even in The Beginning we really see how Kotetsu helps bring these people together. At first they don't really have much comradery with each other, they might even get in each other's way, something the villain of the first movie actively uses against all of them. But by the time The Rising happens you can really feel how they've grown close.   As always, the villain is capitalism. Because all of the heroes are part of Hero TV, a superhero reality tv show, they're all rated on their actions. You earn points for saving citizens and preventing disasters, but lose points if you fail to capture criminals or if they give you the slip. Getting points is important because you cannot become a hero without a sponsor, and doing well means your sponsor is happy. Happy sponsors, happy network, happy hero. Thus, it's against their best interests to help each other out: each hero scrambles for as many points as they can get.    This is also part of why Kotetsu is such a bomb in the ratings: much to his producer's chagrin, he values people's lives over ratings or network shares, so instead of waiting for a commercial break to let the audience get excited he goes and just tries to save people anyway.      Other than the recap portion of the movie, the plot of The Beginning is that someone nabs the city's very important golden statue of justice and nobody can catch the crook. All the heroes run around, get bamboozled by his power to swap places, and it's really just a fun excuse to allow the cast run around and interact. Anime movies often feel bad for being superfluous, but since Tiger & Bunny the series has quite a few episodes dedicated to just building up the characters, it doesn't really feel out of place for the franchise.     It helps that the other heroes aren't terribly complicated and nevertheless get plenty of scenes to themselves. When the team is called out to arrest thief Robin Baxter, they all go their separate ways... together. Dragon Kid and Blue Rose talk about earrings. Fire Emblem... flirts with Rock Bison. Sky High shows off his wind-control powers to Origami Cyclone, showing an uncharacteristically fun-loving side of himself. It's good stuff that does a good job of letting the cast start to see themselves as more than just competitors.       They each get their moments, whether it's Sky High being a little ""up in the clouds"" even though he's currently the top-rated hero, Rock Bison and Kotetsu being Old Guys together as pals at the bottom of the rankings, or Blue Rose's hilariously cheesy mandated catchphrase.   I also wanna point out that I love the character designs in Tiger & Bunny. It's not just Kotetsu's fancy outfits or Barnaby's flowing locks – everyone in this series looks amazing. Masakazu Katsura was brought onboard to handle character designs; he worked on the superhero-flavored Zetman but he's also known for the romantic comedies D.N.A.², Video Girl Ai, and I''s. His charming character designs are fantastic.   ... Also, he did a manga called Wingman about a toku-themed superhero and I'm dying to see that get brought back someday.    They're also more semi-realistic than most anime even ten years ago and it works better since most of the characters are older. The downside is that it makes them harder to animate too, so expect them to look off-model in places. But I think overall the movies look good even compared to today's standards, including the heavy use of CG for the suits and the action.     As it turns out, the CG is on purpose: because many of the costumes would otherwise have to be redrawn if sponsors for the heroes changed (or if the sponsorship brands had to be removed for foreign markets), it's just easier to render them as CG models. The only one who gets traditional animation is Blue Rose, partly because it's hard to shove a logo on her skimpy outfit, partly because she's T&B's source of T&A.     Which becomes upsetting when you remember she's supposed to be in high school still, for some reason. Why are there no adult female superheroes?!   Nobody said idol culture was healthy... A detail the movies leave out from the series is that Blue Rose might have romantic inclinations towards Kotetsu, who's like... twice her age. Thank goodness. Also, because let's be honest, Kotetsu and Barnaby all the way. A family can be a little girl and her two bickering superhero dads.     That's touched on in the series but I prefer to see it as a ""hero crush"" rather than just being hot for a single dad since she obviously takes Kotetsu's ideals to heart after a point. But it's not strong enough to get in the way of Kotetsu and Barnaby's intense married couple energy. The series very much leans in on the ""partner"" thing in more than just a joke or tongue-in-cheek way; they really are each other's emotional support. Which is why in The Rising the whole plot is just about them breaking up and trying to get back together. It's classic.     I wanna touch on one more thing from The Beginning before we get into The Rising: it ends with a really big show of trust for Barnaby from Kotetsu. Barnaby manages to trick Robin Baxter into imprisoning himself, but later finds that Kotetsu specifically went out of his way not only to let the other heroes allow Barnaby to do this alone, but also made sure to hang in the background to make sure Barnaby's plan went off. As much as Kotetsu chafes at Barnaby's antics, he still wants him to feel like a member of a team.      Oh yeah, it's a great moment of just the way Kotetsu quietly supports people even if they didn't ask for it or he doesn't always know how to show it, and the plan wouldn't have worked if Kotetsu never stuck his neck out to the others the way he did.    I'll also take a moment to shoutout to the dub. I found both language tracks to be pretty good, but Tiger & Bunny has a lot of what I miss in anime dubs. The script is adapted really well and fits the more natural and Americanized feel of the show and the more diverse cast.   Being that I'm more of a fan of older Japanese heroes, I do regret the more-Americanized takes on the recent Japanese superheroes. But this does mean that a lot of life is breathed into them in English dubs.   Anyway, Kotetsu starts The Rising out with his breath beaten out of him. Wild Tiger and Barnaby have sunk in the ratings in the time since The Beginning (it's been a few months and later events from the Tiger & Bunny series have transpired). They're knocked down to the ""Second League"", where a bunch of not-so-great superheroes dwell.      Kotetsu had gotten up in age to the point where he can't use his powers very long and is trying to take a slower pace to accommodate but fears that by doing so he's now drawing down his partner.   The good news is, a mogul named Mark Schneider bought out their old sponsor and pulls the strings needed to get Barnaby back up to the First League, teaming him up with a new hero named Golden Ryan. The bad news is, Schneider had no intention of doing anything for Kotetsu: without a sponsor, he's forced to retire from heroism and take up a job as a cab driver.     Golden Ryan (A pun on ""Golden Lion"" to Kotetsu's Tiger), is also a bit of a huge douchebag.     You think the guys at Banpresto had a laugh about their logo being emblazoned on such a tool of a hero? I can't see him making any Super Robot Wars cameos anytime soon...   At any rate, a series of disasters strikes the city. Barnaby puts the clues together and deduces that the disasters are connected to an old legend from the city's history: a goddess, angered by mankind's greed, sends earthquakes, sleeping sickness and a massive chasm to devour the city. The problem is just trying to convince the higher-ups to let the heroes investigate this.    Also compounding issues is Golden Ryan being concerned with just earning points for just him and Barnaby, instead of collaborating with other heroes--a selfishness helped along with Ryan's gravity-powers.      Barnaby may have been eager in the past, but he sticks to his ideals plenty compared to Ryan, whose dubious methods actively gets in the way of the other heroes, cause collateral damage, and puts citizens in danger just to get racked up on a point sheet.   It's here... that we can finally touch on Fire Emblem, because they're an important part of The Rising's story.   So... Fire Emblem is self-described as a gay superhero (and he's got fire powers, get it?). Being that they own their own company, they're their own sponsor. But like... Fire Emblem feels like a really bad take on a gay person, more akin to The Crying Game and that era of not differentiating gay men from trans-women or the like.    In a lot of ways, Fire Emblem reminds me of Levin from Tekkaman Blade (I'm going somewhere with this, bear with me). Levin was also swishy, flaming, and very flirty with the protagonist--and there's a very touching episode where Levin talks to a woman about living their truth. There's only one Levin in the world, and they live true to themselves, and Levin contains multitudes that just can't be described by simple binary concepts like ""man"" or ""woman."" And in a lot of ways, that's what Fire Emblem is going for: we see in their past that Nathan (Fire Emblem's real name) struggled with their attraction to men or presenting as a woman. Their big climactic moment while stuck in a nightmare of their own worst fears is having a Persona 4 moment and embracing their shadow, celebrating what it means to be themselves. This is really good and genuinely compelling and it does loads to keep Fire Emblem from just being a camp joke... if only Fire Emblem weren't always goosing the other men and touching their butts in what's clearly discomforting. Like, Levin also thirsted for D-Boy, but they kept their hands to themselves.       I'm actually really sweet on Fire Emblem for this type of extremely extra character.

Jean-Karlo  This week's This Week in Anime was brought to you by Crab! It all comes crawling back to Crab™!     Crab and very region-specific Pepsi sounds like an interesting flavor combo, NGL. But still not as interesting of a combo as the hero duo Tiger & Bunny!     The original Tiger & Bunny anime came out a bit before the massive influx of superheroes became the mono-culture in the U.S. And weirdly enough, it's taken this long for the series to come back with a new season. Netflix is also streaming two movies for the Tiger & Bunny series, The Beginning and The Rising.   These two films came out in 2012 and 2014 respectively but have just now been re-released for streaming on Netflix in honor of that hot new second season. The Beginning is half re-cap of the early part of the series and serves as a great re-introduction for our Super Hero Buddy Cops, while The Rising takes place after the series proper with entirely new material.     Now, I love me some Japanese superheroes, especially the old blood. Yatterman, Gatchaman, Kamen Rider, Casshern, Ultraman, that stuff. And I was always interested in how Japan would handle a take on more Americanized superheroes. Tiger & Bunny has been beloved by fans since its premiere, and not just because of the wave of heroes the Mouse of House churns out on a daily basis. It's a fascinating show, all the way down to the folks wearing those fancy sponsored CG costumes.   Tiger & Bunny is conceptually rich because it fully breaks down the idea of commercialized heroing as an industry, including real company sponsors (which leads to some funny dissonance). The heroes of Sternbild receive live TV coverage and toe the line between being enforcers, performers, and public motivators, along with everything else that life throws at them, on and off the cameras. The focus on the corporate inner workings is part of what makes it feel more mature. It's not just some kids' fantasy of saving people, but a more detailed look at what would happen if someone really tried to make this their job.   Normally, all the heroes compete for points with each other. But when veteran Wild Tiger, real name Kotetsu Kaburagi, moves to a new company after his previous one folds, he's paired with the young and ambitious Barnaby Brooks Jr., to which he affectionally nicknames Bunny, much to his new partner's annoyance.      What makes Tiger & Bunny work – unlike a lot of ""these heroes are realistic!"" joints like The Boys – is that it's not relentlessly dour. The characters aren't irredeemable louts or psychopaths, they're just people trying to make an honest living while living under the whims of an unfeeling, uncaring management system. These people live or die by their sponsors. It's more Mystery Men than anything else, and that's a damn original place to start from when you're making a superhero movie.   It also leans heavily into the showbiz stuff more than any other cape thing I had watched before, but if anything its core is its ensemble cast of heroes and trying to build the companionship between the two main characters. Like many stories about manly bonds, the two of them start out pretty prickly at first, but both have also suffered severe losses of love in their lives. Kotetsu has a 10-year-old daughter he keeps his work secret from, and has previously lost his wife. Barnaby lost his family to a tragic (extremely plot related) incident that left him traumatized. Just knowing this, you can see how much they could benefit from having someone else to call family in their life. Y'know, assuming you could get one of them to open up.     Kotetsu is a really compelling character, and not just because he's a handsome fail-dad with a stylish outfit. He just needs some loving heart to make him better, or worse, that's a fantasy, too. He's goofy and his sense of heroism really doesn't jive with the mercenary world he's in, but rather than feeling like an idiot he just feels quaint. He's not wrong to want to help people, he's just shouldering more weight than he can carry because he just cares about people that much.     He's definitely meant to appeal to an older audience, a rarity for anime, and he's the the heart of the show despite being a lame guy who struggles to keep up with the younger competition. He constantly lets people down, including his own daughter, but you can tell he really values people's feelings just as much as being a hero.     As if to underline it all: his is the only ""conventional"" superhero outfit among all the other heroes. Everyone else has a fancy suit of armor, but Wild Tiger insists on a cape, a themed cowl, and a strongman suit. Even when he gets his updated power suit, he still wears his old one underneath. You can see him wearing the mask inside his helmet.   Barnaby however is the complete opposite, all suped up in the latest tech and uses his real name and face. He instantly saves Kotetsu's sorry ass and is eager to climb up the ladder. They also both happen to share the same type of power, including the fact that both of them have a time limit to use it.      Where Kotetsu wants to be a hero out of a genuine-to-a-fault desire to help people, Barnaby is wholly self-interested... or so he tells himself. He's convinced that putting his identity out there and acting as a hero can get him the funds and recognition he needs to track down the Oroboros group, the crime ring involved with the  murder of his parents. He may not want to care about other people, but he still cares nevertheless. Not that he'd ever admit it to such an embarrassing dad like Kotetsu.   Also, in a twist of fate, Barnaby Brooks Jr is Kotetsu's daughter's favorite superhero. Not even Wild Tiger. Eesh.      Kotetsu's old school ways doesn't make him popular, even with his own daughter. He was inspired by the King of Old Timers, Mr. Legend, so it makes sense that he clings to those ideals. Many people with super powers in this world – referred to as NEXT – don't always fit in when their powers are fresh and new, and even so, not everyone is fit to be a hero.      This is explored a bit more in The Rising, but a lot of NEXTs have powers that just skirt the line of being useful. Stuff like producing a toxin that just makes you really itchy. Or making your hand grow really, really big. Or, like... being really good at swimming. Kotetsu himself rides that line, partially because of his shtick, partially because his power on its own isn't the best (he can make himself one-hundred times stronger for a short period of time), and partially because he tends to leap before he looks. Like My Hero Academia and its many characters that have wholly-pedestrian Quirks, a lot of heroes in Tiger & Bunny just aren't meant for the big leagues.   When the series begins, Kotetsu is at least doing well enough to stand alongside the biggest heroes in the city: the immovable Rock Bison, the scaredy-cat ninja Origami Cyclone, the thunder-wielding Dragon Kid, the literally-flaming Fire Emblem, the King of Heroes Sky High, and the ice-wielding idol Blue Rose.       And even in The Beginning we really see how Kotetsu helps bring these people together. At first they don't really have much comradery with each other, they might even get in each other's way, something the villain of the first movie actively uses against all of them. But by the time The Rising happens you can really feel how they've grown close.   As always, the villain is capitalism. Because all of the heroes are part of Hero TV, a superhero reality tv show, they're all rated on their actions. You earn points for saving citizens and preventing disasters, but lose points if you fail to capture criminals or if they give you the slip. Getting points is important because you cannot become a hero without a sponsor, and doing well means your sponsor is happy. Happy sponsors, happy network, happy hero. Thus, it's against their best interests to help each other out: each hero scrambles for as many points as they can get.    This is also part of why Kotetsu is such a bomb in the ratings: much to his producer's chagrin, he values people's lives over ratings or network shares, so instead of waiting for a commercial break to let the audience get excited he goes and just tries to save people anyway.      Other than the recap portion of the movie, the plot of The Beginning is that someone nabs the city's very important golden statue of justice and nobody can catch the crook. All the heroes run around, get bamboozled by his power to swap places, and it's really just a fun excuse to allow the cast run around and interact. Anime movies often feel bad for being superfluous, but since Tiger & Bunny the series has quite a few episodes dedicated to just building up the characters, it doesn't really feel out of place for the franchise.     It helps that the other heroes aren't terribly complicated and nevertheless get plenty of scenes to themselves. When the team is called out to arrest thief Robin Baxter, they all go their separate ways... together. Dragon Kid and Blue Rose talk about earrings. Fire Emblem... flirts with Rock Bison. Sky High shows off his wind-control powers to Origami Cyclone, showing an uncharacteristically fun-loving side of himself. It's good stuff that does a good job of letting the cast start to see themselves as more than just competitors.       They each get their moments, whether it's Sky High being a little ""up in the clouds"" even though he's currently the top-rated hero, Rock Bison and Kotetsu being Old Guys together as pals at the bottom of the rankings, or Blue Rose's hilariously cheesy mandated catchphrase.   I also wanna point out that I love the character designs in Tiger & Bunny. It's not just Kotetsu's fancy outfits or Barnaby's flowing locks – everyone in this series looks amazing. Masakazu Katsura was brought onboard to handle character designs; he worked on the superhero-flavored Zetman but he's also known for the romantic comedies D.N.A.², Video Girl Ai, and I''s. His charming character designs are fantastic.   ... Also, he did a manga called Wingman about a toku-themed superhero and I'm dying to see that get brought back someday.    They're also more semi-realistic than most anime even ten years ago and it works better since most of the characters are older. The downside is that it makes them harder to animate too, so expect them to look off-model in places. But I think overall the movies look good even compared to today's standards, including the heavy use of CG for the suits and the action.     As it turns out, the CG is on purpose: because many of the costumes would otherwise have to be redrawn if sponsors for the heroes changed (or if the sponsorship brands had to be removed for foreign markets), it's just easier to render them as CG models. The only one who gets traditional animation is Blue Rose, partly because it's hard to shove a logo on her skimpy outfit, partly because she's T&B's source of T&A.     Which becomes upsetting when you remember she's supposed to be in high school still, for some reason. Why are there no adult female superheroes?!   Nobody said idol culture was healthy... A detail the movies leave out from the series is that Blue Rose might have romantic inclinations towards Kotetsu, who's like... twice her age. Thank goodness. Also, because let's be honest, Kotetsu and Barnaby all the way. A family can be a little girl and her two bickering superhero dads.     That's touched on in the series but I prefer to see it as a ""hero crush"" rather than just being hot for a single dad since she obviously takes Kotetsu's ideals to heart after a point. But it's not strong enough to get in the way of Kotetsu and Barnaby's intense married couple energy. The series very much leans in on the ""partner"" thing in more than just a joke or tongue-in-cheek way; they really are each other's emotional support. Which is why in The Rising the whole plot is just about them breaking up and trying to get back together. It's classic.     I wanna touch on one more thing from The Beginning before we get into The Rising: it ends with a really big show of trust for Barnaby from Kotetsu. Barnaby manages to trick Robin Baxter into imprisoning himself, but later finds that Kotetsu specifically went out of his way not only to let the other heroes allow Barnaby to do this alone, but also made sure to hang in the background to make sure Barnaby's plan went off. As much as Kotetsu chafes at Barnaby's antics, he still wants him to feel like a member of a team.      Oh yeah, it's a great moment of just the way Kotetsu quietly supports people even if they didn't ask for it or he doesn't always know how to show it, and the plan wouldn't have worked if Kotetsu never stuck his neck out to the others the way he did.    I'll also take a moment to shoutout to the dub. I found both language tracks to be pretty good, but Tiger & Bunny has a lot of what I miss in anime dubs. The script is adapted really well and fits the more natural and Americanized feel of the show and the more diverse cast.   Being that I'm more of a fan of older Japanese heroes, I do regret the more-Americanized takes on the recent Japanese superheroes. But this does mean that a lot of life is breathed into them in English dubs.   Anyway, Kotetsu starts The Rising out with his breath beaten out of him. Wild Tiger and Barnaby have sunk in the ratings in the time since The Beginning (it's been a few months and later events from the Tiger & Bunny series have transpired). They're knocked down to the ""Second League"", where a bunch of not-so-great superheroes dwell.      Kotetsu had gotten up in age to the point where he can't use his powers very long and is trying to take a slower pace to accommodate but fears that by doing so he's now drawing down his partner.   The good news is, a mogul named Mark Schneider bought out their old sponsor and pulls the strings needed to get Barnaby back up to the First League, teaming him up with a new hero named Golden Ryan. The bad news is, Schneider had no intention of doing anything for Kotetsu: without a sponsor, he's forced to retire from heroism and take up a job as a cab driver.     Golden Ryan (A pun on ""Golden Lion"" to Kotetsu's Tiger), is also a bit of a huge douchebag.     You think the guys at Banpresto had a laugh about their logo being emblazoned on such a tool of a hero? I can't see him making any Super Robot Wars cameos anytime soon...   At any rate, a series of disasters strikes the city. Barnaby puts the clues together and deduces that the disasters are connected to an old legend from the city's history: a goddess, angered by mankind's greed, sends earthquakes, sleeping sickness and a massive chasm to devour the city. The problem is just trying to convince the higher-ups to let the heroes investigate this.    Also compounding issues is Golden Ryan being concerned with just earning points for just him and Barnaby, instead of collaborating with other heroes--a selfishness helped along with Ryan's gravity-powers.      Barnaby may have been eager in the past, but he sticks to his ideals plenty compared to Ryan, whose dubious methods actively gets in the way of the other heroes, cause collateral damage, and puts citizens in danger just to get racked up on a point sheet.   It's here... that we can finally touch on Fire Emblem, because they're an important part of The Rising's story.   So... Fire Emblem is self-described as a gay superhero (and he's got fire powers, get it?). Being that they own their own company, they're their own sponsor. But like... Fire Emblem feels like a really bad take on a gay person, more akin to The Crying Game and that era of not differentiating gay men from trans-women or the like.    In a lot of ways, Fire Emblem reminds me of Levin from Tekkaman Blade (I'm going somewhere with this, bear with me). Levin was also swishy, flaming, and very flirty with the protagonist--and there's a very touching episode where Levin talks to a woman about living their truth. There's only one Levin in the world, and they live true to themselves, and Levin contains multitudes that just can't be described by simple binary concepts like ""man"" or ""woman."" And in a lot of ways, that's what Fire Emblem is going for: we see in their past that Nathan (Fire Emblem's real name) struggled with their attraction to men or presenting as a woman. Their big climactic moment while stuck in a nightmare of their own worst fears is having a Persona 4 moment and embracing their shadow, celebrating what it means to be themselves. This is really good and genuinely compelling and it does loads to keep Fire Emblem from just being a camp joke... if only Fire Emblem weren't always goosing the other men and touching their butts in what's clearly discomforting. Like, Levin also thirsted for D-Boy, but they kept their hands to themselves.       I'm actually really sweet on Fire Emblem for this type of extremely extra character. Anime doesn't have a good track record of portraying openly queer characters; they're often extremely one note, and while there are elements of Fire Emblem that still aid into negative stereotypes like occasionally making predatory statements or bad touching, there's also a lot of sincerity around the character as well. Fire Emblem regularly proves to be mature, competent, and an emotionally supportive character to others. The other characters never shun Nathan for who they are or who they love, and overall I'm glad that the series' writing does seem to take their character seriously even if it's not perfect.      Nathan's pros definitely outweigh his cons and I don't want to give the impression that I think they're an outright bad character; the phrase ""problematic"" was made for moments like these. They're a great hero, a trusted friend, and honestly the only ding on their journey of acceptance is the fact that they kept goosing the other guys. Nathan is a person of color and that's always a delight to see in anime. Also, I'm using they/them pronouns for Nathan because it's my understanding the new Tiger & Bunny anime is also doing so in the dub.   And once Fire Emblem comes back they lend one heck of an assist to Blue Rose and Dragon Kid... Also, Fire Emblem is sponsored by Domino's. That just amuses me.      Kotetsu also manages to get the go-ahead to jump back in the game while the 2nd League Heroes were helping Fire Emblem recover. It's a good moment for them considering they got canned for not making any company money earlier.    I also loved Rock Bison's little moment of SEND ME FLYING and throwing up the horns after. He was sitting in dead last point-wise and was even desperate enough to start copying other people's bits in order to make himself more likeable to poor results due to how obvious the imitation was.     The Fastball Special is a time-honored tradition in superheroism; I salute Rock Bison in return. It's only a matter of time before the MCU makes it utterly obnoxious.   It also goes into some other themes about imitation, like Kotetsu's daughter trying to figure out how to write a good poem for her assignment but running into a wall when she keeps trying to imitate. Kotetsu surprisingly offers some worldly advice, which gets thrown right back at him.    Everyone keeps trying to live up to what they think they should be doing and not necessarily what they can with their abilities or being true to their feelings.   It turns out that none of the disasters have any kind of divine origin: it's all revenge, baby! A man named Virgil is responsible for organizing the NEXTs that kicked the whole thing off. Using Sternbild's mythology against them, Virgil's goal is revenge against Schneider. Years ago, Schneider took advantage of Virgil's father in a business deal, which led to Virgil's father taking his own life. Virgil teamed up with three other NEXTs whose lives had been ruined by Schneider's wheeling-and-dealing in order to take out their revenge.         Which ties into some stuff in the series. Longtime villain and villain-killer Lunatic shows up to help Virgil to enact his own sense of justice and stand as Kotetsu's ideological opposite while Barnaby stands against Virgil as his mirror and opposite. Both of them state that it's important to be able to center yourself in the present, move on, and not be stuck in the past.      I can't be the only one who thinks Lunatic resembles a weird cross between Purple Haze and King Crimson. Anyway, Virgil becomes a giant robot crab made out of junk metal and fights off Wild Tiger and Barnaby in an attempt at carrying out his own revenge, claiming justification because Barnaby also took his revenge on the man that killed his parents.     Using Kotetsu's only one minute of power they unleash a big show-stopping team-up climax! Sweet.      The fantastic showing reinvigorates the public's desire for the old Wild Tiger/Barnaby team-up too, and even Golden Ryan helps spur them back into teaming up again.     With a nice poem from Kotetsu's daughter, the movie closes with the heroes continuing their duty of protecting Sternbild. It's a really solid ending for a solid pair of movies.     I thought these were both good as a re-introduction but also an epilogue for the series. It doesn't cover everything but it deals with a lot of elements that make Tiger & Bunny stand out.   As a Tiger & Bunny neophyte, I think these movies also serve really well as an introduction to the series. You get just enough of a taste of the other heroes to want to see more, the dynamic between Kotetsu and Barnaby is well-established, and the general feel of Sternbild is introduced. It's a unique world with interesting heroes, and I'm glad it's priming to make a big comeback to the world of anime. I hope Tiger & Bunny reaches a much bigger crowd this time around.   Yeah, I actually missed the initial boat for this one 10 years ago and had to binge the first season shortly before this because I kept putting it off until the second season was just around the corner. But I don't regret a minute of it. I definitely regret the fact that this couldn't be a bigger hit when it came out for a myriad of complicated reasons. That doesn't mean it's too late. Just because it's over a decade now doesn't mean it still can't have its day in the sun!   Nothing would be truer to this fail-dad than being late to his own successful franchise, I tell you what!     Anyways, this is Nicky & Jean-Karlo, over and out!

Thus, it's against their best interests to help each other out: each hero scrambles for as many points as they can get.    This is also part of why Kotetsu is such a bomb in the ratings: much to his producer's chagrin, he values people's lives over ratings or network shares, so instead of waiting for a commercial break to let the audience get excited he goes and just tries to save people anyway.      Other than the recap portion of the movie, the plot of The Beginning is that someone nabs the city's very important golden statue of justice and nobody can catch the crook. All the heroes run around, get bamboozled by his power to swap places, and it's really just a fun excuse to allow the cast run around and interact. Anime movies often feel bad for being superfluous, but since Tiger & Bunny the series has quite a few episodes dedicated to just building up the characters, it doesn't really feel out of place for the franchise.     It helps that the other heroes aren't terribly complicated and nevertheless get plenty of scenes to themselves. When the team is called out to arrest thief Robin Baxter, they all go their separate ways... together. Dragon Kid and Blue Rose talk about earrings. Fire Emblem... flirts with Rock Bison. Sky High shows off his wind-control powers to Origami Cyclone, showing an uncharacteristically fun-loving side of himself. It's good stuff that does a good job of letting the cast start to see themselves as more than just competitors.       They each get their moments, whether it's Sky High being a little ""up in the clouds"" even though he's currently the top-rated hero, Rock Bison and Kotetsu being Old Guys together as pals at the bottom of the rankings, or Blue Rose's hilariously cheesy mandated catchphrase.   I also wanna point out that I love the character designs in Tiger & Bunny. It's not just Kotetsu's fancy outfits or Barnaby's flowing locks – everyone in this series looks amazing. Masakazu Katsura was brought onboard to handle character designs; he worked on the superhero-flavored Zetman but he's also known for the romantic comedies D.N.A.², Video Girl Ai, and I''s. His charming character designs are fantastic.   ... Also, he did a manga called Wingman about a toku-themed superhero and I'm dying to see that get brought back someday.    They're also more semi-realistic than most anime even ten years ago and it works better since most of the characters are older. The downside is that it makes them harder to animate too, so expect them to look off-model in places. But I think overall the movies look good even compared to today's standards, including the heavy use of CG for the suits and the action.     As it turns out, the CG is on purpose: because many of the costumes would otherwise have to be redrawn if sponsors for the heroes changed (or if the sponsorship brands had to be removed for foreign markets), it's just easier to render them as CG models. The only one who gets traditional animation is Blue Rose, partly because it's hard to shove a logo on her skimpy outfit, partly because she's T&B's source of T&A.     Which becomes upsetting when you remember she's supposed to be in high school still, for some reason. Why are there no adult female superheroes?!   Nobody said idol culture was healthy... A detail the movies leave out from the series is that Blue Rose might have romantic inclinations towards Kotetsu, who's like... twice her age. Thank goodness. Also, because let's be honest, Kotetsu and Barnaby all the way. A family can be a little girl and her two bickering superhero dads.     That's touched on in the series but I prefer to see it as a ""hero crush"" rather than just being hot for a single dad since she obviously takes Kotetsu's ideals to heart after a point. But it's not strong enough to get in the way of Kotetsu and Barnaby's intense married couple energy. The series very much leans in on the ""partner"" thing in more than just a joke or tongue-in-cheek way; they really are each other's emotional support. Which is why in The Rising the whole plot is just about them breaking up and trying to get back together. It's classic.     I wanna touch on one more thing from The Beginning before we get into The Rising: it ends with a really big show of trust for Barnaby from Kotetsu. Barnaby manages to trick Robin Baxter into imprisoning himself, but later finds that Kotetsu specifically went out of his way not only to let the other heroes allow Barnaby to do this alone, but also made sure to hang in the background to make sure Barnaby's plan went off. As much as Kotetsu chafes at Barnaby's antics, he still wants him to feel like a member of a team.      Oh yeah, it's a great moment of just the way Kotetsu quietly supports people even if they didn't ask for it or he doesn't always know how to show it, and the plan wouldn't have worked if Kotetsu never stuck his neck out to the others the way he did.    I'll also take a moment to shoutout to the dub. I found both language tracks to be pretty good, but Tiger & Bunny has a lot of what I miss in anime dubs. The script is adapted really well and fits the more natural and Americanized feel of the show and the more diverse cast.   Being that I'm more of a fan of older Japanese heroes, I do regret the more-Americanized takes on the recent Japanese superheroes. But this does mean that a lot of life is breathed into them in English dubs.   Anyway, Kotetsu starts The Rising out with his breath beaten out of him. Wild Tiger and Barnaby have sunk in the ratings in the time since The Beginning (it's been a few months and later events from the Tiger & Bunny series have transpired). They're knocked down to the ""Second League"", where a bunch of not-so-great superheroes dwell.      Kotetsu had gotten up in age to the point where he can't use his powers very long and is trying to take a slower pace to accommodate but fears that by doing so he's now drawing down his partner.   The good news is, a mogul named Mark Schneider bought out their old sponsor and pulls the strings needed to get Barnaby back up to the First League, teaming him up with a new hero named Golden Ryan. The bad news is, Schneider had no intention of doing anything for Kotetsu: without a sponsor, he's forced to retire from heroism and take up a job as a cab driver.     Golden Ryan (A pun on ""Golden Lion"" to Kotetsu's Tiger), is also a bit of a huge douchebag.     You think the guys at Banpresto had a laugh about their logo being emblazoned on such a tool of a hero? I can't see him making any Super Robot Wars cameos anytime soon...   At any rate, a series of disasters strikes the city. Barnaby puts the clues together and deduces that the disasters are connected to an old legend from the city's history: a goddess, angered by mankind's greed, sends earthquakes, sleeping sickness and a massive chasm to devour the city. The problem is just trying to convince the higher-ups to let the heroes investigate this.    Also compounding issues is Golden Ryan being concerned with just earning points for just him and Barnaby, instead of collaborating with other heroes--a selfishness helped along with Ryan's gravity-powers.      Barnaby may have been eager in the past, but he sticks to his ideals plenty compared to Ryan, whose dubious methods actively gets in the way of the other heroes, cause collateral damage, and puts citizens in danger just to get racked up on a point sheet.   It's here... that we can finally touch on Fire Emblem, because they're an important part of The Rising's story.   So... Fire Emblem is self-described as a gay superhero (and he's got fire powers, get it?). Being that they own their own company, they're their own sponsor. But like... Fire Emblem feels like a really bad take on a gay person, more akin to The Crying Game and that era of not differentiating gay men from trans-women or the like.    In a lot of ways, Fire Emblem reminds me of Levin from Tekkaman Blade (I'm going somewhere with this, bear with me). Levin was also swishy, flaming, and very flirty with the protagonist--and there's a very touching episode where Levin talks to a woman about living their truth. There's only one Levin in the world, and they live true to themselves, and Levin contains multitudes that just can't be described by simple binary concepts like ""man"" or ""woman."" And in a lot of ways, that's what Fire Emblem is going for: we see in their past that Nathan (Fire Emblem's real name) struggled with their attraction to men or presenting as a woman. Their big climactic moment while stuck in a nightmare of their own worst fears is having a Persona 4 moment and embracing their shadow, celebrating what it means to be themselves. This is really good and genuinely compelling and it does loads to keep Fire Emblem from just being a camp joke... if only Fire Emblem weren't always goosing the other men and touching their butts in what's clearly discomforting. Like, Levin also thirsted for D-Boy, but they kept their hands to themselves.       I'm actually really sweet on Fire Emblem for this type of extremely extra character. Anime doesn't have a good track record of portraying openly queer characters; they're often extremely one note, and while there are elements of Fire Emblem that still aid into negative stereotypes like occasionally making predatory statements or bad touching, there's also a lot of sincerity around the character as well. Fire Emblem regularly proves to be mature, competent, and an emotionally supportive character to others. The other characters never shun Nathan for who they are or who they love, and overall I'm glad that the series' writing does seem to take their character seriously even if it's not perfect.      Nathan's pros definitely outweigh his cons and I don't want to give the impression that I think they're an outright bad character; the phrase ""problematic"" was made for moments like these. They're a great hero, a trusted friend, and honestly the only ding on their journey of acceptance is the fact that they kept goosing the other guys. Nathan is a person of color and that's always a delight to see in anime. Also, I'm using they/them pronouns for Nathan because it's my understanding the new Tiger & Bunny anime is also doing so in the dub.   And once Fire Emblem comes back they lend one heck of an assist to Blue Rose and Dragon Kid... Also, Fire Emblem is sponsored by Domino's. That just amuses me.      Kotetsu also manages to get the go-ahead to jump back in the game while the 2nd League Heroes were helping Fire Emblem recover. It's a good moment for them considering they got canned for not making any company money earlier.    I also loved Rock Bison's little moment of SEND ME FLYING and throwing up the horns after. He was sitting in dead last point-wise and was even desperate enough to start copying other people's bits in order to make himself more likeable to poor results due to how obvious the imitation was.     The Fastball Special is a time-honored tradition in superheroism; I salute Rock Bison in return. It's only a matter of time before the MCU makes it utterly obnoxious.   It also goes into some other themes about imitation, like Kotetsu's daughter trying to figure out how to write a good poem for her assignment but running into a wall when she keeps trying to imitate. Kotetsu surprisingly offers some worldly advice, which gets thrown right back at him.    Everyone keeps trying to live up to what they think they should be doing and not necessarily what they can with their abilities or being true to their feelings.   It turns out that none of the disasters have any kind of divine origin: it's all revenge, baby! A man named Virgil is responsible for organizing the NEXTs that kicked the whole thing off. Using Sternbild's mythology against them, Virgil's goal is revenge against Schneider. Years ago, Schneider took advantage of Virgil's father in a business deal, which led to Virgil's father taking his own life. Virgil teamed up with three other NEXTs whose lives had been ruined by Schneider's wheeling-and-dealing in order to take out their revenge.         Which ties into some stuff in the series. Longtime villain and villain-killer Lunatic shows up to help Virgil to enact his own sense of justice and stand as Kotetsu's ideological opposite while Barnaby stands against Virgil as his mirror and opposite. Both of them state that it's important to be able to center yourself in the present, move on, and not be stuck in the past.      I can't be the only one who thinks Lunatic resembles a weird cross between Purple Haze and King Crimson. Anyway, Virgil becomes a giant robot crab made out of junk metal and fights off Wild Tiger and Barnaby in an attempt at carrying out his own revenge, claiming justification because Barnaby also took his revenge on the man that killed his parents.     Using Kotetsu's only one minute of power they unleash a big show-stopping team-up climax! Sweet.      The fantastic showing reinvigorates the public's desire for the old Wild Tiger/Barnaby team-up too, and even Golden Ryan helps spur them back into teaming up again.     With a nice poem from Kotetsu's daughter, the movie closes with the heroes continuing their duty of protecting Sternbild. It's a really solid ending for a solid pair of movies.     I thought these were both good as a re-introduction but also an epilogue for the series. It doesn't cover everything but it deals with a lot of elements that make Tiger & Bunny stand out.   As a Tiger & Bunny neophyte, I think these movies also serve really well as an introduction to the series. You get just enough of a taste of the other heroes to want to see more, the dynamic between Kotetsu and Barnaby is well-established, and the general feel of Sternbild is introduced. It's a unique world with interesting heroes, and I'm glad it's priming to make a big comeback to the world of anime. I hope Tiger & Bunny reaches a much bigger crowd this time around.   Yeah, I actually missed the initial boat for this one 10 years ago and had to binge the first season shortly before this because I kept putting it off until the second season was just around the corner. But I don't regret a minute of it. I definitely regret the fact that this couldn't be a bigger hit when it came out for a myriad of complicated reasons. That doesn't mean it's too late. Just because it's over a decade now doesn't mean it still can't have its day in the sun!   Nothing would be truer to this fail-dad than being late to his own successful franchise, I tell you what!     Anyways, this is Nicky & Jean-Karlo, over and out!

Jean-Karlo  This week's This Week in Anime was brought to you by Crab! It all comes crawling back to Crab™!     Crab and very region-specific Pepsi sounds like an interesting flavor combo, NGL. But still not as interesting of a combo as the hero duo Tiger & Bunny!     The original Tiger & Bunny anime came out a bit before the massive influx of superheroes became the mono-culture in the U.S. And weirdly enough, it's taken this long for the series to come back with a new season. Netflix is also streaming two movies for the Tiger & Bunny series, The Beginning and The Rising.   These two films came out in 2012 and 2014 respectively but have just now been re-released for streaming on Netflix in honor of that hot new second season. The Beginning is half re-cap of the early part of the series and serves as a great re-introduction for our Super Hero Buddy Cops, while The Rising takes place after the series proper with entirely new material.     Now, I love me some Japanese superheroes, especially the old blood. Yatterman, Gatchaman, Kamen Rider, Casshern, Ultraman, that stuff. And I was always interested in how Japan would handle a take on more Americanized superheroes. Tiger & Bunny has been beloved by fans since its premiere, and not just because of the wave of heroes the Mouse of House churns out on a daily basis. It's a fascinating show, all the way down to the folks wearing those fancy sponsored CG costumes.   Tiger & Bunny is conceptually rich because it fully breaks down the idea of commercialized heroing as an industry, including real company sponsors (which leads to some funny dissonance). The heroes of Sternbild receive live TV coverage and toe the line between being enforcers, performers, and public motivators, along with everything else that life throws at them, on and off the cameras. The focus on the corporate inner workings is part of what makes it feel more mature. It's not just some kids' fantasy of saving people, but a more detailed look at what would happen if someone really tried to make this their job.   Normally, all the heroes compete for points with each other. But when veteran Wild Tiger, real name Kotetsu Kaburagi, moves to a new company after his previous one folds, he's paired with the young and ambitious Barnaby Brooks Jr., to which he affectionally nicknames Bunny, much to his new partner's annoyance.      What makes Tiger & Bunny work – unlike a lot of ""these heroes are realistic!"" joints like The Boys – is that it's not relentlessly dour. The characters aren't irredeemable louts or psychopaths, they're just people trying to make an honest living while living under the whims of an unfeeling, uncaring management system. These people live or die by their sponsors. It's more Mystery Men than anything else, and that's a damn original place to start from when you're making a superhero movie.   It also leans heavily into the showbiz stuff more than any other cape thing I had watched before, but if anything its core is its ensemble cast of heroes and trying to build the companionship between the two main characters. Like many stories about manly bonds, the two of them start out pretty prickly at first, but both have also suffered severe losses of love in their lives. Kotetsu has a 10-year-old daughter he keeps his work secret from, and has previously lost his wife. Barnaby lost his family to a tragic (extremely plot related) incident that left him traumatized. Just knowing this, you can see how much they could benefit from having someone else to call family in their life. Y'know, assuming you could get one of them to open up.     Kotetsu is a really compelling character, and not just because he's a handsome fail-dad with a stylish outfit. He just needs some loving heart to make him better, or worse, that's a fantasy, too. He's goofy and his sense of heroism really doesn't jive with the mercenary world he's in, but rather than feeling like an idiot he just feels quaint. He's not wrong to want to help people, he's just shouldering more weight than he can carry because he just cares about people that much.     He's definitely meant to appeal to an older audience, a rarity for anime, and he's the the heart of the show despite being a lame guy who struggles to keep up with the younger competition. He constantly lets people down, including his own daughter, but you can tell he really values people's feelings just as much as being a hero.     As if to underline it all: his is the only ""conventional"" superhero outfit among all the other heroes. Everyone else has a fancy suit of armor, but Wild Tiger insists on a cape, a themed cowl, and a strongman suit. Even when he gets his updated power suit, he still wears his old one underneath. You can see him wearing the mask inside his helmet.   Barnaby however is the complete opposite, all suped up in the latest tech and uses his real name and face. He instantly saves Kotetsu's sorry ass and is eager to climb up the ladder. They also both happen to share the same type of power, including the fact that both of them have a time limit to use it.      Where Kotetsu wants to be a hero out of a genuine-to-a-fault desire to help people, Barnaby is wholly self-interested... or so he tells himself. He's convinced that putting his identity out there and acting as a hero can get him the funds and recognition he needs to track down the Oroboros group, the crime ring involved with the  murder of his parents. He may not want to care about other people, but he still cares nevertheless. Not that he'd ever admit it to such an embarrassing dad like Kotetsu.   Also, in a twist of fate, Barnaby Brooks Jr is Kotetsu's daughter's favorite superhero. Not even Wild Tiger. Eesh.      Kotetsu's old school ways doesn't make him popular, even with his own daughter. He was inspired by the King of Old Timers, Mr. Legend, so it makes sense that he clings to those ideals. Many people with super powers in this world – referred to as NEXT – don't always fit in when their powers are fresh and new, and even so, not everyone is fit to be a hero.      This is explored a bit more in The Rising, but a lot of NEXTs have powers that just skirt the line of being useful. Stuff like producing a toxin that just makes you really itchy. Or making your hand grow really, really big. Or, like... being really good at swimming. Kotetsu himself rides that line, partially because of his shtick, partially because his power on its own isn't the best (he can make himself one-hundred times stronger for a short period of time), and partially because he tends to leap before he looks. Like My Hero Academia and its many characters that have wholly-pedestrian Quirks, a lot of heroes in Tiger & Bunny just aren't meant for the big leagues.   When the series begins, Kotetsu is at least doing well enough to stand alongside the biggest heroes in the city: the immovable Rock Bison, the scaredy-cat ninja Origami Cyclone, the thunder-wielding Dragon Kid, the literally-flaming Fire Emblem, the King of Heroes Sky High, and the ice-wielding idol Blue Rose.       And even in The Beginning we really see how Kotetsu helps bring these people together. At first they don't really have much comradery with each other, they might even get in each other's way, something the villain of the first movie actively uses against all of them. But by the time The Rising happens you can really feel how they've grown close.   As always, the villain is capitalism. Because all of the heroes are part of Hero TV, a superhero reality tv show, they're all rated on their actions. You earn points for saving citizens and preventing disasters, but lose points if you fail to capture criminals or if they give you the slip. Getting points is important because you cannot become a hero without a sponsor, and doing well means your sponsor is happy. Happy sponsors, happy network, happy hero. Thus, it's against their best interests to help each other out: each hero scrambles for as many points as they can get.    This is also part of why Kotetsu is such a bomb in the ratings: much to his producer's chagrin, he values people's lives over ratings or network shares, so instead of waiting for a commercial break to let the audience get excited he goes and just tries to save people anyway.      Other than the recap portion of the movie, the plot of The Beginning is that someone nabs the city's very important golden statue of justice and nobody can catch the crook. All the heroes run around, get bamboozled by his power to swap places, and it's really just a fun excuse to allow the cast run around and interact. Anime movies often feel bad for being superfluous, but since Tiger & Bunny the series has quite a few episodes dedicated to just building up the characters, it doesn't really feel out of place for the franchise.     It helps that the other heroes aren't terribly complicated and nevertheless get plenty of scenes to themselves. When the team is called out to arrest thief Robin Baxter, they all go their separate ways... together. Dragon Kid and Blue Rose talk about earrings. Fire Emblem... flirts with Rock Bison. Sky High shows off his wind-control powers to Origami Cyclone, showing an uncharacteristically fun-loving side of himself. It's good stuff that does a good job of letting the cast start to see themselves as more than just competitors.       They each get their moments, whether it's Sky High being a little ""up in the clouds"" even though he's currently the top-rated hero, Rock Bison and Kotetsu being Old Guys together as pals at the bottom of the rankings, or Blue Rose's hilariously cheesy mandated catchphrase.

This is really good and genuinely compelling and it does loads to keep Fire Emblem from just being a camp joke... if only Fire Emblem weren't always goosing the other men and touching their butts in what's clearly discomforting. Like, Levin also thirsted for D-Boy, but they kept their hands to themselves.       I'm actually really sweet on Fire Emblem for this type of extremely extra character. Anime doesn't have a good track record of portraying openly queer characters; they're often extremely one note, and while there are elements of Fire Emblem that still aid into negative stereotypes like occasionally making predatory statements or bad touching, there's also a lot of sincerity around the character as well. Fire Emblem regularly proves to be mature, competent, and an emotionally supportive character to others. The other characters never shun Nathan for who they are or who they love, and overall I'm glad that the series' writing does seem to take their character seriously even if it's not perfect.      Nathan's pros definitely outweigh his cons and I don't want to give the impression that I think they're an outright bad character; the phrase ""problematic"" was made for moments like these. They're a great hero, a trusted friend, and honestly the only ding on their journey of acceptance is the fact that they kept goosing the other guys. Nathan is a person of color and that's always a delight to see in anime. Also, I'm using they/them pronouns for Nathan because it's my understanding the new Tiger & Bunny anime is also doing so in the dub.   And once Fire Emblem comes back they lend one heck of an assist to Blue Rose and Dragon Kid... Also, Fire Emblem is sponsored by Domino's. That just amuses me.      Kotetsu also manages to get the go-ahead to jump back in the game while the 2nd League Heroes were helping Fire Emblem recover. It's a good moment for them considering they got canned for not making any company money earlier.    I also loved Rock Bison's little moment of SEND ME FLYING and throwing up the horns after. He was sitting in dead last point-wise and was even desperate enough to start copying other people's bits in order to make himself more likeable to poor results due to how obvious the imitation was.     The Fastball Special is a time-honored tradition in superheroism; I salute Rock Bison in return. It's only a matter of time before the MCU makes it utterly obnoxious.   It also goes into some other themes about imitation, like Kotetsu's daughter trying to figure out how to write a good poem for her assignment but running into a wall when she keeps trying to imitate. Kotetsu surprisingly offers some worldly advice, which gets thrown right back at him.    Everyone keeps trying to live up to what they think they should be doing and not necessarily what they can with their abilities or being true to their feelings.   It turns out that none of the disasters have any kind of divine origin: it's all revenge, baby! A man named Virgil is responsible for organizing the NEXTs that kicked the whole thing off. Using Sternbild's mythology against them, Virgil's goal is revenge against Schneider. Years ago, Schneider took advantage of Virgil's father in a business deal, which led to Virgil's father taking his own life. Virgil teamed up with three other NEXTs whose lives had been ruined by Schneider's wheeling-and-dealing in order to take out their revenge.         Which ties into some stuff in the series. Longtime villain and villain-killer Lunatic shows up to help Virgil to enact his own sense of justice and stand as Kotetsu's ideological opposite while Barnaby stands against Virgil as his mirror and opposite. Both of them state that it's important to be able to center yourself in the present, move on, and not be stuck in the past.      I can't be the only one who thinks Lunatic resembles a weird cross between Purple Haze and King Crimson. Anyway, Virgil becomes a giant robot crab made out of junk metal and fights off Wild Tiger and Barnaby in an attempt at carrying out his own revenge, claiming justification because Barnaby also took his revenge on the man that killed his parents.     Using Kotetsu's only one minute of power they unleash a big show-stopping team-up climax! Sweet.      The fantastic showing reinvigorates the public's desire for the old Wild Tiger/Barnaby team-up too, and even Golden Ryan helps spur them back into teaming up again.     With a nice poem from Kotetsu's daughter, the movie closes with the heroes continuing their duty of protecting Sternbild. It's a really solid ending for a solid pair of movies.     I thought these were both good as a re-introduction but also an epilogue for the series. It doesn't cover everything but it deals with a lot of elements that make Tiger & Bunny stand out.   As a Tiger & Bunny neophyte, I think these movies also serve really well as an introduction to the series. You get just enough of a taste of the other heroes to want to see more, the dynamic between Kotetsu and Barnaby is well-established, and the general feel of Sternbild is introduced. It's a unique world with interesting heroes, and I'm glad it's priming to make a big comeback to the world of anime. I hope Tiger & Bunny reaches a much bigger crowd this time around.   Yeah, I actually missed the initial boat for this one 10 years ago and had to binge the first season shortly before this because I kept putting it off until the second season was just around the corner. But I don't regret a minute of it. I definitely regret the fact that this couldn't be a bigger hit when it came out for a myriad of complicated reasons. That doesn't mean it's too late. Just because it's over a decade now doesn't mean it still can't have its day in the sun!   Nothing would be truer to this fail-dad than being late to his own successful franchise, I tell you what!     Anyways, this is Nicky & Jean-Karlo, over and out! Til next time.

Fear not, citizens! The recap movie and sequel are on Netflix right now and Jean-Karlo and Nicky are ready to give you the official This Week in Anime™ experience.    These movies are streaming on Netflix   Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the participants in this chatlog are not the views of Anime News Network.Spoiler Warning for discussion of the series ahead.     @Lossthief    @mouse_inhouse    @NickyEnchilada    @vestenet      Nicky  Hey, everybody, it's me and Jean-Karlo here, and today we announce that due to recent changes in upper-management This Week in Anime will include regular shout-outs to sponsors!     Jean-Karlo  This week's This Week in Anime was brought to you by Crab! It all comes crawling back to Crab™!     Crab and very region-specific Pepsi sounds like an interesting flavor combo, NGL. But still not as interesting of a combo as the hero duo Tiger & Bunny!     The original Tiger & Bunny anime came out a bit before the massive influx of superheroes became the mono-culture in the U.S. And weirdly enough, it's taken this long for the series to come back with a new season. Netflix is also streaming two movies for the Tiger & Bunny series, The Beginning and The Rising.   These two films came out in 2012 and 2014 respectively but have just now been re-released for streaming on Netflix in honor of that hot new second season. The Beginning is half re-cap of the early part of the series and serves as a great re-introduction for our Super Hero Buddy Cops, while The Rising takes place after the series proper with entirely new material.     Now, I love me some Japanese superheroes, especially the old blood. Yatterman, Gatchaman, Kamen Rider, Casshern, Ultraman, that stuff. And I was always interested in how Japan would handle a take on more Americanized superheroes. Tiger & Bunny has been beloved by fans since its premiere, and not just because of the wave of heroes the Mouse of House churns out on a daily basis. It's a fascinating show, all the way down to the folks wearing those fancy sponsored CG costumes.   Tiger & Bunny is conceptually rich because it fully breaks down the idea of commercialized heroing as an industry, including real company sponsors (which leads to some funny dissonance). The heroes of Sternbild receive live TV coverage and toe the line between being enforcers, performers, and public motivators, along with everything else that life throws at them, on and off the cameras. The focus on the corporate inner workings is part of what makes it feel more mature. It's not just some kids' fantasy of saving people, but a more detailed look at what would happen if someone really tried to make this their job.   Normally, all the heroes compete for points with each other. But when veteran Wild Tiger, real name Kotetsu Kaburagi, moves to a new company after his previous one folds, he's paired with the young and ambitious Barnaby Brooks Jr., to which he affectionally nicknames Bunny, much to his new partner's annoyance.      What makes Tiger & Bunny work – unlike a lot of ""these heroes are realistic!"" joints like The Boys – is that it's not relentlessly dour. The characters aren't irredeemable louts or psychopaths, they're just people trying to make an honest living while living under the whims of an unfeeling, uncaring management system. These people live or die by their sponsors. It's more Mystery Men than anything else, and that's a damn original place to start from when you're making a superhero movie.   It also leans heavily into the showbiz stuff more than any other cape thing I had watched before, but if anything its core is its ensemble cast of heroes and trying to build the companionship between the two main characters. Like many stories about manly bonds, the two of them start out pretty prickly at first, but both have also suffered severe losses of love in their lives. Kotetsu has a 10-year-old daughter he keeps his work secret from, and has previously lost his wife. Barnaby lost his family to a tragic (extremely plot related) incident that left him traumatized. Just knowing this, you can see how much they could benefit from having someone else to call family in their life. Y'know, assuming you could get one of them to open up.     Kotetsu is a really compelling character, and not just because he's a handsome fail-dad with a stylish outfit. He just needs some loving heart to make him better, or worse, that's a fantasy, too. He's goofy and his sense of heroism really doesn't jive with the mercenary world he's in, but rather than feeling like an idiot he just feels quaint. He's not wrong to want to help people, he's just shouldering more weight than he can carry because he just cares about people that much.     He's definitely meant to appeal to an older audience, a rarity for anime, and he's the the heart of the show despite being a lame guy who struggles to keep up with the younger competition. He constantly lets people down, including his own daughter, but you can tell he really values people's feelings just as much as being a hero.     As if to underline it all: his is the only ""conventional"" superhero outfit among all the other heroes. Everyone else has a fancy suit of armor, but Wild Tiger insists on a cape, a themed cowl, and a strongman suit. Even when he gets his updated power suit, he still wears his old one underneath. You can see him wearing the mask inside his helmet.   Barnaby however is the complete opposite, all suped up in the latest tech and uses his real name and face. He instantly saves Kotetsu's sorry ass and is eager to climb up the ladder. They also both happen to share the same type of power, including the fact that both of them have a time limit to use it.      Where Kotetsu wants to be a hero out of a genuine-to-a-fault desire to help people, Barnaby is wholly self-interested... or so he tells himself. He's convinced that putting his identity out there and acting as a hero can get him the funds and recognition he needs to track down the Oroboros group, the crime ring involved with the  murder of his parents. He may not want to care about other people, but he still cares nevertheless. Not that he'd ever admit it to such an embarrassing dad like Kotetsu.   Also, in a twist of fate, Barnaby Brooks Jr is Kotetsu's daughter's favorite superhero. Not even Wild Tiger. Eesh.      Kotetsu's old school ways doesn't make him popular, even with his own daughter. He was inspired by the King of Old Timers, Mr. Legend, so it makes sense that he clings to those ideals. Many people with super powers in this world – referred to as NEXT – don't always fit in when their powers are fresh and new, and even so, not everyone is fit to be a hero.      This is explored a bit more in The Rising, but a lot of NEXTs have powers that just skirt the line of being useful. Stuff like producing a toxin that just makes you really itchy. Or making your hand grow really, really big. Or, like... being really good at swimming. Kotetsu himself rides that line, partially because of his shtick, partially because his power on its own isn't the best (he can make himself one-hundred times stronger for a short period of time), and partially because he tends to leap before he looks. Like My Hero Academia and its many characters that have wholly-pedestrian Quirks, a lot of heroes in Tiger & Bunny just aren't meant for the big leagues.   When the series begins, Kotetsu is at least doing well enough to stand alongside the biggest heroes in the city: the immovable Rock Bison, the scaredy-cat ninja Origami Cyclone, the thunder-wielding Dragon Kid, the literally-flaming Fire Emblem, the King of Heroes Sky High, and the ice-wielding idol Blue Rose.       And even in The Beginning we really see how Kotetsu helps bring these people together. At first they don't really have much comradery with each other, they might even get in each other's way, something the villain of the first movie actively uses against all of them. But by the time The Rising happens you can really feel how they've grown close.   As always, the villain is capitalism. Because all of the heroes are part of Hero TV, a superhero reality tv show, they're all rated on their actions. You earn points for saving citizens and preventing disasters, but lose points if you fail to capture criminals or if they give you the slip. Getting points is important because you cannot become a hero without a sponsor, and doing well means your sponsor is happy. Happy sponsors, happy network, happy hero. Thus, it's against their best interests to help each other out: each hero scrambles for as many points as they can get.    This is also part of why Kotetsu is such a bomb in the ratings: much to his producer's chagrin, he values people's lives over ratings or network shares, so instead of waiting for a commercial break to let the audience get excited he goes and just tries to save people anyway.      Other than the recap portion of the movie, the plot of The Beginning is that someone nabs the city's very important golden statue of justice and nobody can catch the crook. All the heroes run around, get bamboozled by his power to swap places, and it's really just a fun excuse to allow the cast run around and interact. Anime movies often feel bad for being superfluous, but since Tiger & Bunny the series has quite a few episodes dedicated to just building up the characters, it doesn't really feel out of place for the franchise.     It helps that the other heroes aren't terribly complicated and nevertheless get plenty of scenes to themselves. When the team is called out to arrest thief Robin Baxter, they all go their separate ways... together. Dragon Kid and Blue Rose talk about earrings. Fire Emblem... flirts with Rock Bison. Sky High shows off his wind-control powers to Origami Cyclone, showing an uncharacteristically fun-loving side of himself. It's good stuff that does a good job of letting the cast start to see themselves as more than just competitors.       They each get their moments, whether it's Sky High being a little ""up in the clouds"" even though he's currently the top-rated hero, Rock Bison and Kotetsu being Old Guys together as pals at the bottom of the rankings, or Blue Rose's hilariously cheesy mandated catchphrase.   I also wanna point out that I love the character designs in Tiger & Bunny. It's not just Kotetsu's fancy outfits or Barnaby's flowing locks – everyone in this series looks amazing. Masakazu Katsura was brought onboard to handle character designs; he worked on the superhero-flavored Zetman but he's also known for the romantic comedies D.N.A.², Video Girl Ai, and I''s. His charming character designs are fantastic.   ... Also, he did a manga called Wingman about a toku-themed superhero and I'm dying to see that get brought back someday.    They're also more semi-realistic than most anime even ten years ago and it works better since most of the characters are older. The downside is that it makes them harder to animate too, so expect them to look off-model in places. But I think overall the movies look good even compared to today's standards, including the heavy use of CG for the suits and the action.     As it turns out, the CG is on purpose: because many of the costumes would otherwise have to be redrawn if sponsors for the heroes changed (or if the sponsorship brands had to be removed for foreign markets), it's just easier to render them as CG models. The only one who gets traditional animation is Blue Rose, partly because it's hard to shove a logo on her skimpy outfit, partly because she's T&B's source of T&A.     Which becomes upsetting when you remember she's supposed to be in high school still, for some reason. Why are there no adult female superheroes?!   Nobody said idol culture was healthy... A detail the movies leave out from the series is that Blue Rose might have romantic inclinations towards Kotetsu, who's like... twice her age. Thank goodness. Also, because let's be honest, Kotetsu and Barnaby all the way. A family can be a little girl and her two bickering superhero dads.     That's touched on in the series but I prefer to see it as a ""hero crush"" rather than just being hot for a single dad since she obviously takes Kotetsu's ideals to heart after a point. But it's not strong enough to get in the way of Kotetsu and Barnaby's intense married couple energy. The series very much leans in on the ""partner"" thing in more than just a joke or tongue-in-cheek way; they really are each other's emotional support. Which is why in The Rising the whole plot is just about them breaking up and trying to get back together. It's classic.     I wanna touch on one more thing from The Beginning before we get into The Rising: it ends with a really big show of trust for Barnaby from Kotetsu. Barnaby manages to trick Robin Baxter into imprisoning himself, but later finds that Kotetsu specifically went out of his way not only to let the other heroes allow Barnaby to do this alone, but also made sure to hang in the background to make sure Barnaby's plan went off. As much as Kotetsu chafes at Barnaby's antics, he still wants him to feel like a member of a team.      Oh yeah, it's a great moment of just the way Kotetsu quietly supports people even if they didn't ask for it or he doesn't always know how to show it, and the plan wouldn't have worked if Kotetsu never stuck his neck out to the others the way he did.    I'll also take a moment to shoutout to the dub. I found both language tracks to be pretty good, but Tiger & Bunny has a lot of what I miss in anime dubs. The script is adapted really well and fits the more natural and Americanized feel of the show and the more diverse cast.   Being that I'm more of a fan of older Japanese heroes, I do regret the more-Americanized takes on the recent Japanese superheroes. But this does mean that a lot of life is breathed into them in English dubs.   Anyway, Kotetsu starts The Rising out with his breath beaten out of him. Wild Tiger and Barnaby have sunk in the ratings in the time since The Beginning (it's been a few months and later events from the Tiger & Bunny series have transpired). They're knocked down to the ""Second League"", where a bunch of not-so-great superheroes dwell.      Kotetsu had gotten up in age to the point where he can't use his powers very long and is trying to take a slower pace to accommodate but fears that by doing so he's now drawing down his partner.   The good news is, a mogul named Mark Schneider bought out their old sponsor and pulls the strings needed to get Barnaby back up to the First League, teaming him up with a new hero named Golden Ryan. The bad news is, Schneider had no intention of doing anything for Kotetsu: without a sponsor, he's forced to retire from heroism and take up a job as a cab driver.     Golden Ryan (A pun on ""Golden Lion"" to Kotetsu's Tiger), is also a bit of a huge douchebag.     You think the guys at Banpresto had a laugh about their logo being emblazoned on such a tool of a hero? I can't see him making any Super Robot Wars cameos anytime soon...   At any rate, a series of disasters strikes the city. Barnaby puts the clues together and deduces that the disasters are connected to an old legend from the city's history: a goddess, angered by mankind's greed, sends earthquakes, sleeping sickness and a massive chasm to devour the city. The problem is just trying to convince the higher-ups to let the heroes investigate this.    Also compounding issues is Golden Ryan being concerned with just earning points for just him and Barnaby, instead of collaborating with other heroes--a selfishness helped along with Ryan's gravity-powers.      Barnaby may have been eager in the past, but he sticks to his ideals plenty compared to Ryan, whose dubious methods actively gets in the way of the other heroes, cause collateral damage, and puts citizens in danger just to get racked up on a point sheet.   It's here... that we can finally touch on Fire Emblem, because they're an important part of The Rising's story.   So... Fire Emblem is self-described as a gay superhero (and he's got fire powers, get it?). Being that they own their own company, they're their own sponsor. But like... Fire Emblem feels like a really bad take on a gay person, more akin to The Crying Game and that era of not differentiating gay men from trans-women or the like.    In a lot of ways, Fire Emblem reminds me of Levin from Tekkaman Blade (I'm going somewhere with this, bear with me). Levin was also swishy, flaming, and very flirty with the protagonist--and there's a very touching episode where Levin talks to a woman about living their truth. There's only one Levin in the world, and they live true to themselves, and Levin contains multitudes that just can't be described by simple binary concepts like ""man"" or ""woman."" And in a lot of ways, that's what Fire Emblem is going for: we see in their past that Nathan (Fire Emblem's real name) struggled with their attraction to men or presenting as a woman. Their big climactic moment while stuck in a nightmare of their own worst fears is having a Persona 4 moment and embracing their shadow, celebrating what it means to be themselves. This is really good and genuinely compelling and it does loads to keep Fire Emblem from just being a camp joke... if only Fire Emblem weren't always goosing the other men and touching their butts in what's clearly discomforting. Like, Levin also thirsted for D-Boy, but they kept their hands to themselves.       I'm actually really sweet on Fire Emblem for this type of extremely extra character.

I'll also take a moment to shoutout to the dub. I found both language tracks to be pretty good, but Tiger & Bunny has a lot of what I miss in anime dubs. The script is adapted really well and fits the more natural and Americanized feel of the show and the more diverse cast.

They're a great hero, a trusted friend, and honestly the only ding on their journey of acceptance is the fact that they kept goosing the other guys. Nathan is a person of color and that's always a delight to see in anime. Also, I'm using they/them pronouns for Nathan because it's my understanding the new Tiger & Bunny anime is also doing so in the dub.   And once Fire Emblem comes back they lend one heck of an assist to Blue Rose and Dragon Kid... Also, Fire Emblem is sponsored by Domino's. That just amuses me.

Community score: 4.5              What is this?   Following the resolution of their respective civil wars, the conflict between the Free Planets Alliance and the Galactic Empire has resumed in earnest. Julian Mintz, adopted son of Yang Wen-Li, enlists in the Alliance military and, while being trained during a routine patrol, finds himself caught up in a conflict with a passing Empire fleet. Under the command of Dusty Attenborough, the Alliance soldiers struggle to hold their ground until Yang can send reinforcements, as Julian and his fellow recruits struggle to adapt to the realities of being thrust into real combat for the first time.    Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These Gekitotsu is the third season of the new anime of Yoshiki Tanaka's epic science fiction novel and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?    Christopher Farris  Rating:                Three years later we're back with another set of new Legend of the Galactic Heroes movies, with Crunchyroll once again chopping them up and releasing them as weekly episodes. Granted, it's more likely the other way around, as just with the pacing of the previous 'season', this first episode pretty clearly functions as an isolated half-hour that is connected with a greater whole as any piece of serialized storytelling. And it means there's enough focus in this premiere episode to bring us back into the story of all these Galactic Heroes, with just enough passing remarks on the status quo to remind us of how we got here (Though given the storied history-book density of LOGH, it might not hurt to at least go back and peruse some synopses for the preceding plot. It has been three actual years after all).    Helping to ease us into all that is the fact that this one has a relatively narrower, smaller-scale focus than LOGH adventures previously tended to end up with. The real-world-style march of time in this galaxy sees Yang's young ward Julian formally enlist in the Alliance military, and it's through his eyes that we get back to engaging with the focal conflict of this series. It comes off as a brisk, concentrated re-introduction to things, where instead of focusing on Reinhard or his consolidations in the Empire, we get a bunch of flashbacks to Julian's training and details of what he's been put through up until this first battle he finds himself in. They do also throw in some informational setup for future long-term developments of this arc (there's a reason a class question prompts a whole spiel from Julian about warp technology), but otherwise this is firmly a story about seeing the war through the fresh eyes of a rookie and their feelings of contrast with the various flavors of veteran we know exist in the LOGH ranks.    That's all well and good in terms of directly defining Julian as we follow him in this new stage of his life and the show's plot, but it does also have the side effect of the series feeling given to over-explaining its tones at every turn. There's basically no time to see Julian reflect on his situation on his own; each point has to be punctuated by a conversation with someone else in this establishment. For instance, the episode sends Dusty down to just have this detailed, emotional conversation with Julian in-between fighting where the kid directly exposits all his thoughts and feelings about the battle he was just in. The episode ends with Julian's rookie-in-arms Peter rambling about the complexities of experience and survivor's guilt in relation to the deaths of their more experienced comrades, when the following simple, solemn shot of Julian looking up at his instructor's name on the listing of the deceased communicates that same impact much more effectively in a moment. If you've been keeping up with this LOGH adaptation this long, these kinds of overt sensibilities aren't really surprising, but it's still mildly annoying to see them still in place, even as the series shows inklings of knowing how to do more with less.    Thankfully, a lot of the appreciable little touches of LOGH persist here. I love the bit where Dusty relates a funny anecdote to the bridge crew and they all laugh, despite being in the middle of a heated battle. Similarly, the idea that ostensibly-inexperienced fighter-pilot movements would cause Empire officers to second-guess their approaches because they're used to going up against Yang's galaxy-brain strategies is a fun acknowledgement of how far reputation for the main characters has come at this point in the story. And it's all presented with the now-expected glossy finish of this modern animated adaptation, making the most of the opportunity to open with an episode that features a bunch of zippy space-ship dogfights. Some of its less-welcome adaptational flourishes persist, but this is still recognizably Legend of the Galactic Heroes, and it's still nice to have more of it.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                One of the great things about space operas is the size of their stories. Here we have the start of a new season, with one of our warring protagonists suffering from the tragic death of a close friend and the other having just crushed a rebellion full of people he respected. Yet this episode touches on none of that—our main characters barely even make an appearance. Rather, it is a largely self-contained “boots on the ground” story from the front lines centering on the first deployment of Yang Wen-li's adoptive son, Julian.    Julain is in a unique position. While he is intelligent and brave, he stands in the shadow of the Alliance's greatest hero. Instead of being jealous of this fact, he is humbled and wants to be of use to his adopted father. But how do you support a man like that? By becoming a fighter pilot, Julain has decided to be Yang's eyes on the front. His personal struggle over the episode is one of ego, learning to accept the victories and the losses without letting them go to his head or force him into despair.    At the same time, the whole episode is a graphic example of the futility of war. What we watch is a meaningless battle: two patrolling fleets that run into each other and start fighting.

Community score: 4.5              What is this?   Following the resolution of their respective civil wars, the conflict between the Free Planets Alliance and the Galactic Empire has resumed in earnest. Julian Mintz, adopted son of Yang Wen-Li, enlists in the Alliance military and, while being trained during a routine patrol, finds himself caught up in a conflict with a passing Empire fleet. Under the command of Dusty Attenborough, the Alliance soldiers struggle to hold their ground until Yang can send reinforcements, as Julian and his fellow recruits struggle to adapt to the realities of being thrust into real combat for the first time.    Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These Gekitotsu is the third season of the new anime of Yoshiki Tanaka's epic science fiction novel and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?    Christopher Farris  Rating:                Three years later we're back with another set of new Legend of the Galactic Heroes movies, with Crunchyroll once again chopping them up and releasing them as weekly episodes. Granted, it's more likely the other way around, as just with the pacing of the previous 'season', this first episode pretty clearly functions as an isolated half-hour that is connected with a greater whole as any piece of serialized storytelling. And it means there's enough focus in this premiere episode to bring us back into the story of all these Galactic Heroes, with just enough passing remarks on the status quo to remind us of how we got here (Though given the storied history-book density of LOGH, it might not hurt to at least go back and peruse some synopses for the preceding plot. It has been three actual years after all).    Helping to ease us into all that is the fact that this one has a relatively narrower, smaller-scale focus than LOGH adventures previously tended to end up with. The real-world-style march of time in this galaxy sees Yang's young ward Julian formally enlist in the Alliance military, and it's through his eyes that we get back to engaging with the focal conflict of this series. It comes off as a brisk, concentrated re-introduction to things, where instead of focusing on Reinhard or his consolidations in the Empire, we get a bunch of flashbacks to Julian's training and details of what he's been put through up until this first battle he finds himself in. They do also throw in some informational setup for future long-term developments of this arc (there's a reason a class question prompts a whole spiel from Julian about warp technology), but otherwise this is firmly a story about seeing the war through the fresh eyes of a rookie and their feelings of contrast with the various flavors of veteran we know exist in the LOGH ranks.    That's all well and good in terms of directly defining Julian as we follow him in this new stage of his life and the show's plot, but it does also have the side effect of the series feeling given to over-explaining its tones at every turn. There's basically no time to see Julian reflect on his situation on his own; each point has to be punctuated by a conversation with someone else in this establishment. For instance, the episode sends Dusty down to just have this detailed, emotional conversation with Julian in-between fighting where the kid directly exposits all his thoughts and feelings about the battle he was just in. The episode ends with Julian's rookie-in-arms Peter rambling about the complexities of experience and survivor's guilt in relation to the deaths of their more experienced comrades, when the following simple, solemn shot of Julian looking up at his instructor's name on the listing of the deceased communicates that same impact much more effectively in a moment. If you've been keeping up with this LOGH adaptation this long, these kinds of overt sensibilities aren't really surprising, but it's still mildly annoying to see them still in place, even as the series shows inklings of knowing how to do more with less.    Thankfully, a lot of the appreciable little touches of LOGH persist here. I love the bit where Dusty relates a funny anecdote to the bridge crew and they all laugh, despite being in the middle of a heated battle. Similarly, the idea that ostensibly-inexperienced fighter-pilot movements would cause Empire officers to second-guess their approaches because they're used to going up against Yang's galaxy-brain strategies is a fun acknowledgement of how far reputation for the main characters has come at this point in the story. And it's all presented with the now-expected glossy finish of this modern animated adaptation, making the most of the opportunity to open with an episode that features a bunch of zippy space-ship dogfights. Some of its less-welcome adaptational flourishes persist, but this is still recognizably Legend of the Galactic Heroes, and it's still nice to have more of it.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                One of the great things about space operas is the size of their stories. Here we have the start of a new season, with one of our warring protagonists suffering from the tragic death of a close friend and the other having just crushed a rebellion full of people he respected. Yet this episode touches on none of that—our main characters barely even make an appearance. Rather, it is a largely self-contained “boots on the ground” story from the front lines centering on the first deployment of Yang Wen-li's adoptive son, Julian.    Julain is in a unique position. While he is intelligent and brave, he stands in the shadow of the Alliance's greatest hero. Instead of being jealous of this fact, he is humbled and wants to be of use to his adopted father. But how do you support a man like that? By becoming a fighter pilot, Julain has decided to be Yang's eyes on the front. His personal struggle over the episode is one of ego, learning to accept the victories and the losses without letting them go to his head or force him into despair.    At the same time, the whole episode is a graphic example of the futility of war. What we watch is a meaningless battle: two patrolling fleets that run into each other and start fighting. Then both sides call in reinforcements and it just snowballs. It's a pointless meatgrinder of a battle. Nothing will change based on who wins or loses.

Granted, it's more likely the other way around, as just with the pacing of the previous 'season', this first episode pretty clearly functions as an isolated half-hour that is connected with a greater whole as any piece of serialized storytelling. And it means there's enough focus in this premiere episode to bring us back into the story of all these Galactic Heroes, with just enough passing remarks on the status quo to remind us of how we got here (Though given the storied history-book density of LOGH, it might not hurt to at least go back and peruse some synopses for the preceding plot. It has been three actual years after all).    Helping to ease us into all that is the fact that this one has a relatively narrower, smaller-scale focus than LOGH adventures previously tended to end up with. The real-world-style march of time in this galaxy sees Yang's young ward Julian formally enlist in the Alliance military, and it's through his eyes that we get back to engaging with the focal conflict of this series. It comes off as a brisk, concentrated re-introduction to things, where instead of focusing on Reinhard or his consolidations in the Empire, we get a bunch of flashbacks to Julian's training and details of what he's been put through up until this first battle he finds himself in. They do also throw in some informational setup for future long-term developments of this arc (there's a reason a class question prompts a whole spiel from Julian about warp technology), but otherwise this is firmly a story about seeing the war through the fresh eyes of a rookie and their feelings of contrast with the various flavors of veteran we know exist in the LOGH ranks.    That's all well and good in terms of directly defining Julian as we follow him in this new stage of his life and the show's plot, but it does also have the side effect of the series feeling given to over-explaining its tones at every turn. There's basically no time to see Julian reflect on his situation on his own; each point has to be punctuated by a conversation with someone else in this establishment. For instance, the episode sends Dusty down to just have this detailed, emotional conversation with Julian in-between fighting where the kid directly exposits all his thoughts and feelings about the battle he was just in. The episode ends with Julian's rookie-in-arms Peter rambling about the complexities of experience and survivor's guilt in relation to the deaths of their more experienced comrades, when the following simple, solemn shot of Julian looking up at his instructor's name on the listing of the deceased communicates that same impact much more effectively in a moment. If you've been keeping up with this LOGH adaptation this long, these kinds of overt sensibilities aren't really surprising, but it's still mildly annoying to see them still in place, even as the series shows inklings of knowing how to do more with less.    Thankfully, a lot of the appreciable little touches of LOGH persist here. I love the bit where Dusty relates a funny anecdote to the bridge crew and they all laugh, despite being in the middle of a heated battle. Similarly, the idea that ostensibly-inexperienced fighter-pilot movements would cause Empire officers to second-guess their approaches because they're used to going up against Yang's galaxy-brain strategies is a fun acknowledgement of how far reputation for the main characters has come at this point in the story. And it's all presented with the now-expected glossy finish of this modern animated adaptation, making the most of the opportunity to open with an episode that features a bunch of zippy space-ship dogfights. Some of its less-welcome adaptational flourishes persist, but this is still recognizably Legend of the Galactic Heroes, and it's still nice to have more of it.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                One of the great things about space operas is the size of their stories. Here we have the start of a new season, with one of our warring protagonists suffering from the tragic death of a close friend and the other having just crushed a rebellion full of people he respected. Yet this episode touches on none of that—our main characters barely even make an appearance. Rather, it is a largely self-contained “boots on the ground” story from the front lines centering on the first deployment of Yang Wen-li's adoptive son, Julian.    Julain is in a unique position. While he is intelligent and brave, he stands in the shadow of the Alliance's greatest hero. Instead of being jealous of this fact, he is humbled and wants to be of use to his adopted father. But how do you support a man like that? By becoming a fighter pilot, Julain has decided to be Yang's eyes on the front. His personal struggle over the episode is one of ego, learning to accept the victories and the losses without letting them go to his head or force him into despair.    At the same time, the whole episode is a graphic example of the futility of war. What we watch is a meaningless battle: two patrolling fleets that run into each other and start fighting. Then both sides call in reinforcements and it just snowballs. It's a pointless meatgrinder of a battle. Nothing will change based on who wins or loses. By the time Yang shows up with a fleet so massive that retreat is the only option for the Empire, pretty much every fighter pilot besides Julian is dead—and the one other newbie who made it through is on the edge of a mental break.    It's great stuff full of drama that explores the nature of the human soul—or to put it another way, it's an average episode of The Legend of Galactic Heroes.

Community score: 3.8              What is this?   A youth story centering on two young women golfers named Eve and Aoi Amawashi. The two come from completely different backgrounds, with completely opposite play styles, and together they will shake the world of golf.    Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story- is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    Cailtin Moore  Rating:                People who have been reading my preview guide entries (and maybe premiere reviews for other sites before that) over the last few years are well familiar with how I've been opining that the lack of serious girls' sports anime is a travesty. Most of them are moe-fests about the power of friendship that aim to portray cuteness over athleticism, or jiggly fanservice delivery devices. I wanted the equivalent of Haikyu!! or Run with the Wind: stories that portray the characters as serious competitors, scrappy underdogs scraping by through hard training and camaraderie. That's what I thought I wanted.    But now that I've seen Birdie Wing, I've seen the light. I didn't need a serious story about overcoming the odds and rising through the ranks. I needed a shonen story full of hotblooded rivalry and ridiculously over-the-top superpowered moves, but minus the obsession with bouncing tits. What I needed… was Birdie Wing.    Oh, I was skeptical at first. Like many others who grew up before everyone had their own personal devices, I was tormented by my dad hogging the TV all day on weekends to watch his excruciatingly boring gold matches. I could not have cared less who Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods, or Vijay Singh were, but I learned nonetheless. I thought the trailer for Birdie Wing looked good and the character designs were appealing, but I wasn't sure if that could cut through the trauma of all those weekend afternoons I was forced to read instead of watch syndicated sitcoms.    By the time the ending credits rolled, I was more than ready to take back my misgivings. I wasn't sure how I felt about what I had just watched, but it certainly wasn't boring. And as I processed it, I finally arrived at how I felt: I loved it. It's not particularly well-animated or coherent, but it's wildly off-the-wall in the best possible way, constantly throwing things at the wall to see what sticks without rhyme or reason, and it is incredibly fun. Playing basically the world's most intense game of mini-golf but with actual trains instead of the archetypical windmill and your opponent is a clown mask? Sure. Hitting a tree branch in your way so hard it breaks without the ball completely losing its velocity? Why not! And don't forget the insert song full of black-and-white images of the protagonist Eve posing angstily against graffitied walls in slums that do nothing to advance the story.    It's so much. So much what, you ask? Just… so much. It's stuffed to the gills with the kind of anime bullshit that draw people to the medium, gleefully weird and energetic. It's not going to be a hole in one for everyone, but if you're looking for something that's not just par for the course, this is worth taking a look at.        James Beckett  Rating:               Birdie Wing is a sports anime that dares to break eons of tradition and ask the question that everyone has been to afraid to utter: “What if golf…was actually really cool?” That isn't to imply that golf isn't fun, or interesting, or a worthwhile athletic challenge; of all the less prolific sports for an anime to cover, I'm actually pretty happy to see one that's about golf at all. But I don't think even the hardest of the hardcore devotees of 18-Hole Pilgrimage would ever be shocked to hear me say that golf usually isn't considered one of the “cool” sports. For many folks, golf resides firmly within the realm of middle-aged white men donned in khaki shorts and matching visors who are probably just using a trip out to the greens as an excuse to get day drunk with all of their recently divorced friends.    Birdie Wing, instead, gives us a world of golf where the rich geezers are outnumbered by flashy anime gals and mysterious clown women that all treat golf as nothing less than existential blood sport. This cartoon's version of America is a dichotomy of disparity, where the most desperate and destitute live in the shadow of the wealthy elite (so…basically the exact same thing as the real America, come to think of it). Our scrappy heroine Eve is the equivalent of a jaded ronin for hire, except her katana is a golf club, and instead of bathing in the blood of her enemies, she revels in the meager riches she can accrue for her gal pals and the orphans they're helping to raise. Eve looks like a the frontwoman of a punk band and wields borderline supernatural skills on the links, and her companion Lily is all too happy to patiently explain to their opponents all of the ways in which they are viscerally screwed. Lily also loves Gunpla, which naturally makes here almost as cool as Eve.    Is this an utterly ridiculous premise for a golf anime to tackle? Yes, but damn it, that's what makes it cool. It's like when Calvin and Hobbes put on those dark shades and just stood around, doing nothing. The best sports shows are the ones that take the everyday thrills of athletic achievement and gild them in a shiny layer of Glorious Anime Bullshit, without so much as an ounce of shame. Y'all can keep your “Cute Girls Gently Sharing Common Hobbies,” I'd like to order a double serving of “Vagrant Women Engaging in Spiritual Combat with Suggestive Sports Metaphors,” and pile on the extra cheese if you please.    My only complaint about Birdie Wing is that its modest productions values and flat direction don't always do the funny premise and genuinely likeable characters justice. This is the kind of series that only becomes funnier the more ironically impressive it looks, and some more sakuga would go a long way towards bringing the whole experience together. Still, Birdie Wing is an awful lot of fun, and I'm excited to see where these golf girls go in future episodes.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               I have to hand it to Birdie Wing – it has managed to make one of the most stultifying sports to watch interesting. That's due to a combination of some very nice animation and shot framing and a premise that I can get behind, which is one that stands to challenge the exclusivity of what can be a very snooty sport. (At least in my experience; it's kind of a summer person sport where I'm from.) For Eve and her sister Lily, golf isn't just about winning prestigious tournaments, it's about having money to keep their found family together, because they're all living what appears to be a very precarious life in the slums, and while the oldest sister does her best, it's leveraging Eve's golf skills that keeps body and soul together – or at least that's the implication.    That's something that the episode does a remarkable job of showing us without any clunky exposition. We see a corrupt cop shaking down the family for protection money, we see that Eve's earnings go directly to food, and we see that Eve only plays with three clubs, instead of the vast array that other players have in their bags. When Eve is filling in for an injured player, her caddy is surprised to see her choose what she deems inappropriate clubs for a shot; later we realize that Eve's using the only clubs she's used to playing with – the others just aren't comfortable for her because she's not had the opportunity to use them very often, if ever. When Helene, a girl her age who plays in tournaments, notes that Eve only has the three clubs, it drives home the point without ever explicitly saying, “She's poor and these clubs are all she can afford.”    The episode also takes its time to establish Eve and Lily as characters before bringing us into the fateful meeting that stands to shape Eve's future. It's not until the end of the episode that Eve and Aoi, her probable rival/friend, even meet. We see just enough of Aoi to get the impression that she's intensely competitive and living in a totally different world than Eve – again, through context clues rather than being flat-out told – and it isn't until she approaches Eve that we start to get an idea of how they'll affect each other. Aoi calls golf “sacred;” Eve says that she only plays for money, which is something that Eve can't possibly understand. While I don't give a damn about golf, seeing where this relationship goes looks like it'll be worth putting up with the spectacularly cheesy background music. Both Eve and Aoi have things that could benefit each other. How they'll develop should be worth watching.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               I think golf is pretty much the most boring sport in the world to watch. But as I've said before, sports anime live or die on their characters—the sport itself is nothing more than a catalyst for the show's interpersonal drama. And let me tell you, Birdie Wing has learned this lesson well. Instead of being set around a high school sports team or being about a newbie learning the sport for the first time, Birdie Wing follows Eve, a golf hustler who makes her money by winning underground matches against rich amateurs and moonlighting on the pro-circuit in disguise.    Honestly, it's a welcome change of pace—especially as Eve is a highly sympathetic character. Living in the slums, making money to keep a room over the head of orphans, it's impossible not to root for her as she pockets the money of the rich despite owning only three clubs herself. She's basically the Robin Hood of golf. It also helps that while Eve is no doubt talented, much of her skill comes from countless hours of hard work—despite rarely getting to play on anything as nice as an actual course. It looks like watching her rise to stardom will be a cathartic experience to say the least.    On the visual side of things, the anime looks great. From the shots of the dirty slums and vibrant golf courses to the surreal animation of Eve's Prince of Tennis-style special moves, everything is clear and detailed. (And did anyone else notice that Eve and Aoi look a lot like the transformation scene versions of Panty and Stocking? No? Just me? Okay.) Then we have the music. From surprise Eurobeat to a heartfelt ballad, it was fantastic throughout. It's a score I'd expect in an idol anime, not a sports one.    All in all, it's safe to say that Birdie Wing caught me completely off guard. It is easily the best sport anime we've seen so far this season and with its Megalobox meets Carole & Tuesday vibes, I am 100% here for it.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Let me say up top that you're best off going into this show with as little foreknowledge as possible. If you're at all curious about this series, or were planning to check it out if the reviews were good, or just have 30 minutes to kill, do yourself a favor: go in blind and let this premiere wash over you. That's what I did, and I'm confident saying that's the best way to experience whatever the hell Birdie Wing is doing.    Really, going into this with just a short preview and a key image, I was fully expecting a standard sports anime. Sure there was the novelty of it being a rather rare girls' sports show, but I've been here before. I knew what I was getting into. Then 90 seconds in our heroine peeled off a Lupin-style rubber mask to reveal she was a secret underground golfer who makes her living betting on games against pros and occasionally impersonating other golfers to help them place in tournaments. Then I learned she does all this to support her found family of undocumented immigrants who run a dive bar and take care of three orphaned children. THEN she went off to play a midnight, high-stakes golf match against a woman in a clown mask on a golf course built on top of active train tracks. And right about there I realized I had no clue where this show was going, but I needed to find out.    It's the kind a pure-hearted anime bullshit that gets talked about a lot, but only occasionally pops up for real, and I ate it right up. Every couple of minutes this premiere found some new idea or element to blindside me with, and it pulled me through the entire episode in record time. A moody music video interlude of Eve looking solemnly over the slums of her home town? Osamu Dezaki-esque postcard memories to punctuate our heroine's cool lines about golf? Her rival striking an Obari Pose before showing off her absurdly long driver that powers he own cartoony style of golf? All of that and far more, to the point where it legitimately started to feel like this wasn't a real show, but an elaborate prank laser targeted at me and my online friend circle.    The only real hangup is that I don't know how long this show can keep that kind of energy up. It's already showing some strains in its production, and while the golf sections are conceptually creative, they struggle to deliver that energy in motion. Sk8 the Infinity, this show's closest cousin, managed its bawdy mix of skateboarding and pro-wrestling with fantastic visuals and pulse-pounding races, and I don't think this series has that in its cards. This could all very well fall apart in a few episodes once it runs out of ideas or the drawings start melting, and that would be a huge bummer.    But those are problems for Future Nick to worry about. In the here and now, this was an absolute blast to watch from start to finish. God knows I never expected to say that about a golf anime. If you were coming here looking for a serious and down-to-earth girls' sports show, I'm sorry. There's nothing for you here. But if you're at all intrigued by this nonsense I've been rambling out, give it a shot.     discuss this in the forum (291 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

This is the kind of series that only becomes funnier the more ironically impressive it looks, and some more sakuga would go a long way towards bringing the whole experience together. Still, Birdie Wing is an awful lot of fun, and I'm excited to see where these golf girls go in future episodes.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               I have to hand it to Birdie Wing – it has managed to make one of the most stultifying sports to watch interesting. That's due to a combination of some very nice animation and shot framing and a premise that I can get behind, which is one that stands to challenge the exclusivity of what can be a very snooty sport. (At least in my experience; it's kind of a summer person sport where I'm from.) For Eve and her sister Lily, golf isn't just about winning prestigious tournaments, it's about having money to keep their found family together, because they're all living what appears to be a very precarious life in the slums, and while the oldest sister does her best, it's leveraging Eve's golf skills that keeps body and soul together – or at least that's the implication.    That's something that the episode does a remarkable job of showing us without any clunky exposition. We see a corrupt cop shaking down the family for protection money, we see that Eve's earnings go directly to food, and we see that Eve only plays with three clubs, instead of the vast array that other players have in their bags. When Eve is filling in for an injured player, her caddy is surprised to see her choose what she deems inappropriate clubs for a shot; later we realize that Eve's using the only clubs she's used to playing with – the others just aren't comfortable for her because she's not had the opportunity to use them very often, if ever. When Helene, a girl her age who plays in tournaments, notes that Eve only has the three clubs, it drives home the point without ever explicitly saying, “She's poor and these clubs are all she can afford.”    The episode also takes its time to establish Eve and Lily as characters before bringing us into the fateful meeting that stands to shape Eve's future. It's not until the end of the episode that Eve and Aoi, her probable rival/friend, even meet. We see just enough of Aoi to get the impression that she's intensely competitive and living in a totally different world than Eve – again, through context clues rather than being flat-out told – and it isn't until she approaches Eve that we start to get an idea of how they'll affect each other. Aoi calls golf “sacred;” Eve says that she only plays for money, which is something that Eve can't possibly understand. While I don't give a damn about golf, seeing where this relationship goes looks like it'll be worth putting up with the spectacularly cheesy background music. Both Eve and Aoi have things that could benefit each other. How they'll develop should be worth watching.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               I think golf is pretty much the most boring sport in the world to watch. But as I've said before, sports anime live or die on their characters—the sport itself is nothing more than a catalyst for the show's interpersonal drama. And let me tell you, Birdie Wing has learned this lesson well. Instead of being set around a high school sports team or being about a newbie learning the sport for the first time, Birdie Wing follows Eve, a golf hustler who makes her money by winning underground matches against rich amateurs and moonlighting on the pro-circuit in disguise.    Honestly, it's a welcome change of pace—especially as Eve is a highly sympathetic character. Living in the slums, making money to keep a room over the head of orphans, it's impossible not to root for her as she pockets the money of the rich despite owning only three clubs herself. She's basically the Robin Hood of golf. It also helps that while Eve is no doubt talented, much of her skill comes from countless hours of hard work—despite rarely getting to play on anything as nice as an actual course. It looks like watching her rise to stardom will be a cathartic experience to say the least.    On the visual side of things, the anime looks great. From the shots of the dirty slums and vibrant golf courses to the surreal animation of Eve's Prince of Tennis-style special moves, everything is clear and detailed. (And did anyone else notice that Eve and Aoi look a lot like the transformation scene versions of Panty and Stocking? No? Just me? Okay.) Then we have the music. From surprise Eurobeat to a heartfelt ballad, it was fantastic throughout. It's a score I'd expect in an idol anime, not a sports one.    All in all, it's safe to say that Birdie Wing caught me completely off guard. It is easily the best sport anime we've seen so far this season and with its Megalobox meets Carole & Tuesday vibes, I am 100% here for it.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Let me say up top that you're best off going into this show with as little foreknowledge as possible. If you're at all curious about this series, or were planning to check it out if the reviews were good, or just have 30 minutes to kill, do yourself a favor: go in blind and let this premiere wash over you. That's what I did, and I'm confident saying that's the best way to experience whatever the hell Birdie Wing is doing.    Really, going into this with just a short preview and a key image, I was fully expecting a standard sports anime. Sure there was the novelty of it being a rather rare girls' sports show, but I've been here before. I knew what I was getting into. Then 90 seconds in our heroine peeled off a Lupin-style rubber mask to reveal she was a secret underground golfer who makes her living betting on games against pros and occasionally impersonating other golfers to help them place in tournaments. Then I learned she does all this to support her found family of undocumented immigrants who run a dive bar and take care of three orphaned children. THEN she went off to play a midnight, high-stakes golf match against a woman in a clown mask on a golf course built on top of active train tracks. And right about there I realized I had no clue where this show was going, but I needed to find out.    It's the kind a pure-hearted anime bullshit that gets talked about a lot, but only occasionally pops up for real, and I ate it right up. Every couple of minutes this premiere found some new idea or element to blindside me with, and it pulled me through the entire episode in record time. A moody music video interlude of Eve looking solemnly over the slums of her home town? Osamu Dezaki-esque postcard memories to punctuate our heroine's cool lines about golf? Her rival striking an Obari Pose before showing off her absurdly long driver that powers he own cartoony style of golf? All of that and far more, to the point where it legitimately started to feel like this wasn't a real show, but an elaborate prank laser targeted at me and my online friend circle.    The only real hangup is that I don't know how long this show can keep that kind of energy up. It's already showing some strains in its production, and while the golf sections are conceptually creative, they struggle to deliver that energy in motion. Sk8 the Infinity, this show's closest cousin, managed its bawdy mix of skateboarding and pro-wrestling with fantastic visuals and pulse-pounding races, and I don't think this series has that in its cards. This could all very well fall apart in a few episodes once it runs out of ideas or the drawings start melting, and that would be a huge bummer.    But those are problems for Future Nick to worry about. In the here and now, this was an absolute blast to watch from start to finish. God knows I never expected to say that about a golf anime. If you were coming here looking for a serious and down-to-earth girls' sports show, I'm sorry. There's nothing for you here. But if you're at all intrigued by this nonsense I've been rambling out, give it a shot.     discuss this in the forum (291 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives     ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 3.8              What is this?   A youth story centering on two young women golfers named Eve and Aoi Amawashi. The two come from completely different backgrounds, with completely opposite play styles, and together they will shake the world of golf.    Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story- is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    Cailtin Moore  Rating:                People who have been reading my preview guide entries (and maybe premiere reviews for other sites before that) over the last few years are well familiar with how I've been opining that the lack of serious girls' sports anime is a travesty. Most of them are moe-fests about the power of friendship that aim to portray cuteness over athleticism, or jiggly fanservice delivery devices. I wanted the equivalent of Haikyu!! or Run with the Wind: stories that portray the characters as serious competitors, scrappy underdogs scraping by through hard training and camaraderie. That's what I thought I wanted.    But now that I've seen Birdie Wing, I've seen the light. I didn't need a serious story about overcoming the odds and rising through the ranks. I needed a shonen story full of hotblooded rivalry and ridiculously over-the-top superpowered moves, but minus the obsession with bouncing tits. What I needed… was Birdie Wing.    Oh, I was skeptical at first. Like many others who grew up before everyone had their own personal devices, I was tormented by my dad hogging the TV all day on weekends to watch his excruciatingly boring gold matches. I could not have cared less who Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods, or Vijay Singh were, but I learned nonetheless. I thought the trailer for Birdie Wing looked good and the character designs were appealing, but I wasn't sure if that could cut through the trauma of all those weekend afternoons I was forced to read instead of watch syndicated sitcoms.    By the time the ending credits rolled, I was more than ready to take back my misgivings. I wasn't sure how I felt about what I had just watched, but it certainly wasn't boring. And as I processed it, I finally arrived at how I felt: I loved it. It's not particularly well-animated or coherent, but it's wildly off-the-wall in the best possible way, constantly throwing things at the wall to see what sticks without rhyme or reason, and it is incredibly fun. Playing basically the world's most intense game of mini-golf but with actual trains instead of the archetypical windmill and your opponent is a clown mask? Sure. Hitting a tree branch in your way so hard it breaks without the ball completely losing its velocity? Why not! And don't forget the insert song full of black-and-white images of the protagonist Eve posing angstily against graffitied walls in slums that do nothing to advance the story.    It's so much. So much what, you ask? Just… so much. It's stuffed to the gills with the kind of anime bullshit that draw people to the medium, gleefully weird and energetic. It's not going to be a hole in one for everyone, but if you're looking for something that's not just par for the course, this is worth taking a look at.        James Beckett  Rating:               Birdie Wing is a sports anime that dares to break eons of tradition and ask the question that everyone has been to afraid to utter: “What if golf…was actually really cool?” That isn't to imply that golf isn't fun, or interesting, or a worthwhile athletic challenge; of all the less prolific sports for an anime to cover, I'm actually pretty happy to see one that's about golf at all. But I don't think even the hardest of the hardcore devotees of 18-Hole Pilgrimage would ever be shocked to hear me say that golf usually isn't considered one of the “cool” sports. For many folks, golf resides firmly within the realm of middle-aged white men donned in khaki shorts and matching visors who are probably just using a trip out to the greens as an excuse to get day drunk with all of their recently divorced friends.    Birdie Wing, instead, gives us a world of golf where the rich geezers are outnumbered by flashy anime gals and mysterious clown women that all treat golf as nothing less than existential blood sport. This cartoon's version of America is a dichotomy of disparity, where the most desperate and destitute live in the shadow of the wealthy elite (so…basically the exact same thing as the real America, come to think of it). Our scrappy heroine Eve is the equivalent of a jaded ronin for hire, except her katana is a golf club, and instead of bathing in the blood of her enemies, she revels in the meager riches she can accrue for her gal pals and the orphans they're helping to raise. Eve looks like a the frontwoman of a punk band and wields borderline supernatural skills on the links, and her companion Lily is all too happy to patiently explain to their opponents all of the ways in which they are viscerally screwed. Lily also loves Gunpla, which naturally makes here almost as cool as Eve.    Is this an utterly ridiculous premise for a golf anime to tackle? Yes, but damn it, that's what makes it cool. It's like when Calvin and Hobbes put on those dark shades and just stood around, doing nothing. The best sports shows are the ones that take the everyday thrills of athletic achievement and gild them in a shiny layer of Glorious Anime Bullshit, without so much as an ounce of shame. Y'all can keep your “Cute Girls Gently Sharing Common Hobbies,” I'd like to order a double serving of “Vagrant Women Engaging in Spiritual Combat with Suggestive Sports Metaphors,” and pile on the extra cheese if you please.    My only complaint about Birdie Wing is that its modest productions values and flat direction don't always do the funny premise and genuinely likeable characters justice.

Instead of being set around a high school sports team or being about a newbie learning the sport for the first time, Birdie Wing follows Eve, a golf hustler who makes her money by winning underground matches against rich amateurs and moonlighting on the pro-circuit in disguise.    Honestly, it's a welcome change of pace—especially as Eve is a highly sympathetic character. Living in the slums, making money to keep a room over the head of orphans, it's impossible not to root for her as she pockets the money of the rich despite owning only three clubs herself. She's basically the Robin Hood of golf. It also helps that while Eve is no doubt talented, much of her skill comes from countless hours of hard work—despite rarely getting to play on anything as nice as an actual course. It looks like watching her rise to stardom will be a cathartic experience to say the least.    On the visual side of things, the anime looks great. From the shots of the dirty slums and vibrant golf courses to the surreal animation of Eve's Prince of Tennis-style special moves, everything is clear and detailed. (And did anyone else notice that Eve and Aoi look a lot like the transformation scene versions of Panty and Stocking? No? Just me? Okay.) Then we have the music. From surprise Eurobeat to a heartfelt ballad, it was fantastic throughout. It's a score I'd expect in an idol anime, not a sports one.    All in all, it's safe to say that Birdie Wing caught me completely off guard. It is easily the best sport anime we've seen so far this season and with its Megalobox meets Carole & Tuesday vibes, I am 100% here for it.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Let me say up top that you're best off going into this show with as little foreknowledge as possible. If you're at all curious about this series, or were planning to check it out if the reviews were good, or just have 30 minutes to kill, do yourself a favor: go in blind and let this premiere wash over you. That's what I did, and I'm confident saying that's the best way to experience whatever the hell Birdie Wing is doing.    Really, going into this with just a short preview and a key image, I was fully expecting a standard sports anime. Sure there was the novelty of it being a rather rare girls' sports show, but I've been here before. I knew what I was getting into. Then 90 seconds in our heroine peeled off a Lupin-style rubber mask to reveal she was a secret underground golfer who makes her living betting on games against pros and occasionally impersonating other golfers to help them place in tournaments. Then I learned she does all this to support her found family of undocumented immigrants who run a dive bar and take care of three orphaned children. THEN she went off to play a midnight, high-stakes golf match against a woman in a clown mask on a golf course built on top of active train tracks. And right about there I realized I had no clue where this show was going, but I needed to find out.    It's the kind a pure-hearted anime bullshit that gets talked about a lot, but only occasionally pops up for real, and I ate it right up. Every couple of minutes this premiere found some new idea or element to blindside me with, and it pulled me through the entire episode in record time. A moody music video interlude of Eve looking solemnly over the slums of her home town? Osamu Dezaki-esque postcard memories to punctuate our heroine's cool lines about golf? Her rival striking an Obari Pose before showing off her absurdly long driver that powers he own cartoony style of golf? All of that and far more, to the point where it legitimately started to feel like this wasn't a real show, but an elaborate prank laser targeted at me and my online friend circle.    The only real hangup is that I don't know how long this show can keep that kind of energy up. It's already showing some strains in its production, and while the golf sections are conceptually creative, they struggle to deliver that energy in motion. Sk8 the Infinity, this show's closest cousin, managed its bawdy mix of skateboarding and pro-wrestling with fantastic visuals and pulse-pounding races, and I don't think this series has that in its cards. This could all very well fall apart in a few episodes once it runs out of ideas or the drawings start melting, and that would be a huge bummer.    But those are problems for Future Nick to worry about. In the here and now, this was an absolute blast to watch from start to finish. God knows I never expected to say that about a golf anime. If you were coming here looking for a serious and down-to-earth girls' sports show, I'm sorry. There's nothing for you here. But if you're at all intrigued by this nonsense I've been rambling out, give it a shot.     discuss this in the forum (291 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives   ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 3.8              What is this?   A youth story centering on two young women golfers named Eve and Aoi Amawashi. The two come from completely different backgrounds, with completely opposite play styles, and together they will shake the world of golf.    Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story- is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    Cailtin Moore  Rating:                People who have been reading my preview guide entries (and maybe premiere reviews for other sites before that) over the last few years are well familiar with how I've been opining that the lack of serious girls' sports anime is a travesty. Most of them are moe-fests about the power of friendship that aim to portray cuteness over athleticism, or jiggly fanservice delivery devices. I wanted the equivalent of Haikyu!! or Run with the Wind: stories that portray the characters as serious competitors, scrappy underdogs scraping by through hard training and camaraderie. That's what I thought I wanted.    But now that I've seen Birdie Wing, I've seen the light. I didn't need a serious story about overcoming the odds and rising through the ranks. I needed a shonen story full of hotblooded rivalry and ridiculously over-the-top superpowered moves, but minus the obsession with bouncing tits. What I needed… was Birdie Wing.    Oh, I was skeptical at first. Like many others who grew up before everyone had their own personal devices, I was tormented by my dad hogging the TV all day on weekends to watch his excruciatingly boring gold matches. I could not have cared less who Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods, or Vijay Singh were, but I learned nonetheless. I thought the trailer for Birdie Wing looked good and the character designs were appealing, but I wasn't sure if that could cut through the trauma of all those weekend afternoons I was forced to read instead of watch syndicated sitcoms.    By the time the ending credits rolled, I was more than ready to take back my misgivings. I wasn't sure how I felt about what I had just watched, but it certainly wasn't boring. And as I processed it, I finally arrived at how I felt: I loved it. It's not particularly well-animated or coherent, but it's wildly off-the-wall in the best possible way, constantly throwing things at the wall to see what sticks without rhyme or reason, and it is incredibly fun. Playing basically the world's most intense game of mini-golf but with actual trains instead of the archetypical windmill and your opponent is a clown mask? Sure. Hitting a tree branch in your way so hard it breaks without the ball completely losing its velocity? Why not! And don't forget the insert song full of black-and-white images of the protagonist Eve posing angstily against graffitied walls in slums that do nothing to advance the story.    It's so much. So much what, you ask? Just… so much. It's stuffed to the gills with the kind of anime bullshit that draw people to the medium, gleefully weird and energetic. It's not going to be a hole in one for everyone, but if you're looking for something that's not just par for the course, this is worth taking a look at.        James Beckett  Rating:               Birdie Wing is a sports anime that dares to break eons of tradition and ask the question that everyone has been to afraid to utter: “What if golf…was actually really cool?” That isn't to imply that golf isn't fun, or interesting, or a worthwhile athletic challenge; of all the less prolific sports for an anime to cover, I'm actually pretty happy to see one that's about golf at all. But I don't think even the hardest of the hardcore devotees of 18-Hole Pilgrimage would ever be shocked to hear me say that golf usually isn't considered one of the “cool” sports. For many folks, golf resides firmly within the realm of middle-aged white men donned in khaki shorts and matching visors who are probably just using a trip out to the greens as an excuse to get day drunk with all of their recently divorced friends.    Birdie Wing, instead, gives us a world of golf where the rich geezers are outnumbered by flashy anime gals and mysterious clown women that all treat golf as nothing less than existential blood sport. This cartoon's version of America is a dichotomy of disparity, where the most desperate and destitute live in the shadow of the wealthy elite (so…basically the exact same thing as the real America, come to think of it). Our scrappy heroine Eve is the equivalent of a jaded ronin for hire, except her katana is a golf club, and instead of bathing in the blood of her enemies, she revels in the meager riches she can accrue for her gal pals and the orphans they're helping to raise. Eve looks like a the frontwoman of a punk band and wields borderline supernatural skills on the links, and her companion Lily is all too happy to patiently explain to their opponents all of the ways in which they are viscerally screwed. Lily also loves Gunpla, which naturally makes here almost as cool as Eve.    Is this an utterly ridiculous premise for a golf anime to tackle? Yes, but damn it, that's what makes it cool. It's like when Calvin and Hobbes put on those dark shades and just stood around, doing nothing. The best sports shows are the ones that take the everyday thrills of athletic achievement and gild them in a shiny layer of Glorious Anime Bullshit, without so much as an ounce of shame. Y'all can keep your “Cute Girls Gently Sharing Common Hobbies,” I'd like to order a double serving of “Vagrant Women Engaging in Spiritual Combat with Suggestive Sports Metaphors,” and pile on the extra cheese if you please.    My only complaint about Birdie Wing is that its modest productions values and flat direction don't always do the funny premise and genuinely likeable characters justice. This is the kind of series that only becomes funnier the more ironically impressive it looks, and some more sakuga would go a long way towards bringing the whole experience together. Still, Birdie Wing is an awful lot of fun, and I'm excited to see where these golf girls go in future episodes.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               I have to hand it to Birdie Wing – it has managed to make one of the most stultifying sports to watch interesting. That's due to a combination of some very nice animation and shot framing and a premise that I can get behind, which is one that stands to challenge the exclusivity of what can be a very snooty sport. (At least in my experience; it's kind of a summer person sport where I'm from.) For Eve and her sister Lily, golf isn't just about winning prestigious tournaments, it's about having money to keep their found family together, because they're all living what appears to be a very precarious life in the slums, and while the oldest sister does her best, it's leveraging Eve's golf skills that keeps body and soul together – or at least that's the implication.    That's something that the episode does a remarkable job of showing us without any clunky exposition. We see a corrupt cop shaking down the family for protection money, we see that Eve's earnings go directly to food, and we see that Eve only plays with three clubs, instead of the vast array that other players have in their bags. When Eve is filling in for an injured player, her caddy is surprised to see her choose what she deems inappropriate clubs for a shot; later we realize that Eve's using the only clubs she's used to playing with – the others just aren't comfortable for her because she's not had the opportunity to use them very often, if ever. When Helene, a girl her age who plays in tournaments, notes that Eve only has the three clubs, it drives home the point without ever explicitly saying, “She's poor and these clubs are all she can afford.”    The episode also takes its time to establish Eve and Lily as characters before bringing us into the fateful meeting that stands to shape Eve's future. It's not until the end of the episode that Eve and Aoi, her probable rival/friend, even meet. We see just enough of Aoi to get the impression that she's intensely competitive and living in a totally different world than Eve – again, through context clues rather than being flat-out told – and it isn't until she approaches Eve that we start to get an idea of how they'll affect each other. Aoi calls golf “sacred;” Eve says that she only plays for money, which is something that Eve can't possibly understand. While I don't give a damn about golf, seeing where this relationship goes looks like it'll be worth putting up with the spectacularly cheesy background music. Both Eve and Aoi have things that could benefit each other. How they'll develop should be worth watching.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               I think golf is pretty much the most boring sport in the world to watch.

The only real hangup is that I don't know how long this show can keep that kind of energy up. It's already showing some strains in its production, and while the golf sections are conceptually creative, they struggle to deliver that energy in motion. Sk8 the Infinity, this show's closest cousin, managed its bawdy mix of skateboarding and pro-wrestling with fantastic visuals and pulse-pounding races, and I don't think this series has that in its cards. This could all very well fall apart in a few episodes once it runs out of ideas or the drawings start melting, and that would be a huge bummer.    But those are problems for Future Nick to worry about. In the here and now, this was an absolute blast to watch from start to finish. God knows I never expected to say that about a golf anime. If you were coming here looking for a serious and down-to-earth girls' sports show, I'm sorry. There's nothing for you here. But if you're at all intrigued by this nonsense I've been rambling out, give it a shot.

But SpyXFamily is a late evening show (23:00/11 PM) in Japan, so it's massive.   If you haven't red SpyxFamily, start now.  Do not, repeat, do not start at the lastest episodes at Viz's Shonen Jump or Manga Plus.

Last time I remember reading about a late night show getting such good numbers when Library Wars was pulling in like 4.0s            And while it predates ANN's weekly ratings reports, Akagi's first episode also got itself a 4.0 back in 2005. It's rare, but every once in a while a late-night anime manages to achieve surprisingly strong ratings, despite that not really being the intention of those time slots (they're essentially just treated at as infomercials for the later home video release).

But SpyXFamily is a late evening show (23:00/11 PM) in Japan, so it's massive.   If you haven't red SpyxFamily, start now.  Do not, repeat, do not start at the lastest episodes at Viz's Shonen Jump or Manga Plus.

I'll probably pick up the manga as well, but not until after the 2nd cour to avoid spoiling the fun.

But SpyXFamily is a late evening show (23:00/11 PM) in Japan, so it's massive.   If you haven't red SpyxFamily, start now.  Do not, repeat, do not start at the lastest episodes at Viz's Shonen Jump or Manga Plus.

It's rare, but every once in a while a late-night anime manages to achieve surprisingly strong ratings, despite that not really being the intention of those time slots (they're essentially just treated at as infomercials for the later home video release).

But Iroha Tamaki can't seem to remember her wish. There is a gaping hole in her life. Something important has been lost. But she continues to fight every day, without even knowing why. Then, a rumor begins to spread among Magical Girls. Magical Girls can be saved if they go to Kamihama City, the city where Magical Girls and Uwasa are gathering.    Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story is based on a spinoff game of the Puella Magi Madoka Magica anime and streams on Crunchyroll and Funimation.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                I'm just going to get the full title out of the way up top, since it tells you everything you need to know about the show. This is Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story Final Season -The Dawn of the Ephemeral Dream-, a four-episode mini-season that is meant to conclude the nearly three-year-long odyssey of this messy but ambitious Madoka Magica spinoff. It seems odd to call this a “preview"" since in just this one episode we're covering a full quarter of this long-awaited conclusion, but thems the breaks, I suppose.    Going into -The Dawn of the Ephemeral Dream-, the main question on everyone's mind, including mine, is going to be whether or not a mere four-episode arc will be enough to draw the story of Magia Record to a satisfying conclusion. The thing about “We Failed” is that it's a flashback episode, devoted entirely to explaining the origins of the antagonist cadre of Magical Girls known as the Wings of Magius, so we don't get much in the way of narrative progression here. The good news is that, so far as infodump episodes go, “We Failed” is a doozy, answering many of the long-standing mysteries that Magia Record has been dangling over its viewers' heads for the past few years.    Granted, none of these answers are necessarily revelatory; given everything we learned about Ui, Nemu, and Touka last season, it was easy enough to figure out the broad strokes of this backstory ahead of time. Still, seeing everything laid out in a more traditional narrative fashion sure is satisfying for longtime viewers of the series, and it helps to contextualize a lot of elements of the series as we head into Magia Record's final act. The full scope of Ui's disappearance from the world is explained, we understand how all three of the Hospital Gang ended up as Magical Girls in the first place, and how Touka became the Uwasa creating villain that she was in the first two seasons of the show. We even finally get an explanation for Baby Kyubey, and it's a lot more reasonable than I was expecting!    The second season of the show was also notable for its extreme highs and lows in production quality. A few of its episodes ranked among the best spectacle that the franchise has ever delivered, and at the same time, the final entries of the season were stretched so thin that you could practically see the bubblegum and duct tape that the artists at Studio Shaft were using to hold the production together. “We Failed” is by no means the prettiest episode of Madoka Magica ever produced, but it looks solid, and my biggest hope for this extra-short final season is that the overall aesthetic of the franchise isn't compromised because of scheduling and production errors. Lord knows that the poor crew deserves one hell of a vacation at this point.    All that said, do I think that Magia Record's final season will end up doing the spinoff justice? It's tough to say. I've always had a mixed relationship with Magia Record; at its best, it feels like a genuine and compelling expansion of the entire Madoka Magica universe, but at its worst, it becomes borderline incomprehensible. I think the good of the series generally outweighs the bad, though, and if you're at all a fan of the Madoka Magica franchise, I believe (and I hope) that you'll have a mostly good time with Magia Record. Just, you know, make sure to watch the other two seasons first if you're new to the series.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               This episode might as well have been called “30 Minutes of Answers.” In one self-contained flashback, it lays out every major remaining mystery in the series and thoroughly unravels them. However, the way it does this feels completely natural through yet another story of Madoka Magica-themed suffering.    As it goes with most of these stories, it begins with Kyubey preying on Iroha's fears for Ui and tricking her into becoming a magical girl. What's interesting here is that Ui, Nemu, and Touka are able to see through Kyubey's half-truths and uncover what is really going on. And like Madoka in the main series, the three sickly girls figure out the bunny-cat's biggest weakness: he has to grant wishes. He literally can't stop himself.    This, of course, kicks off their search for the perfect wish—or rather, set of wishes—to break Kyubey's system and allow the remaining magical girls to live normally even after all witches are exterminated. Their solution is basically to become Kyubey themselves—feeding the collected energy back into the magical girls rather than keeping it for themselves. The problem is that they never considered what would happen to the one taking in all the negative magical girl emotions—i.e., that they'd become a witch in seconds.    Basically, this episode is a tragedy centered around hubris. The three girls think that after a bit of research they can game the system and save the world. But instead, they arguably make things worse, leading to almost all of the tragedy we've seen in the series so far.    What's truly heartbreaking, though, is the effect that comes from isolating Ui's fractured soul inside of Kyubey. Like with Madoka at the end of the main series, this places her outside of reality—as if she never existed in the first place. This drastically changes the personalities of those closest to her (namely, Touka) and makes the previous seasons gain yet another layer of tragedy in retrospect. All in all, it's a fantastic amalgamation of lore and character building that has me pumped to see where things will go in our final three episodes.     discuss this in the forum (291 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Then, a rumor begins to spread among Magical Girls. Magical Girls can be saved if they go to Kamihama City, the city where Magical Girls and Uwasa are gathering.    Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story is based on a spinoff game of the Puella Magi Madoka Magica anime and streams on Crunchyroll and Funimation.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                I'm just going to get the full title out of the way up top, since it tells you everything you need to know about the show. This is Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story Final Season -The Dawn of the Ephemeral Dream-, a four-episode mini-season that is meant to conclude the nearly three-year-long odyssey of this messy but ambitious Madoka Magica spinoff. It seems odd to call this a “preview"" since in just this one episode we're covering a full quarter of this long-awaited conclusion, but thems the breaks, I suppose.    Going into -The Dawn of the Ephemeral Dream-, the main question on everyone's mind, including mine, is going to be whether or not a mere four-episode arc will be enough to draw the story of Magia Record to a satisfying conclusion. The thing about “We Failed” is that it's a flashback episode, devoted entirely to explaining the origins of the antagonist cadre of Magical Girls known as the Wings of Magius, so we don't get much in the way of narrative progression here. The good news is that, so far as infodump episodes go, “We Failed” is a doozy, answering many of the long-standing mysteries that Magia Record has been dangling over its viewers' heads for the past few years.    Granted, none of these answers are necessarily revelatory; given everything we learned about Ui, Nemu, and Touka last season, it was easy enough to figure out the broad strokes of this backstory ahead of time. Still, seeing everything laid out in a more traditional narrative fashion sure is satisfying for longtime viewers of the series, and it helps to contextualize a lot of elements of the series as we head into Magia Record's final act. The full scope of Ui's disappearance from the world is explained, we understand how all three of the Hospital Gang ended up as Magical Girls in the first place, and how Touka became the Uwasa creating villain that she was in the first two seasons of the show. We even finally get an explanation for Baby Kyubey, and it's a lot more reasonable than I was expecting!    The second season of the show was also notable for its extreme highs and lows in production quality. A few of its episodes ranked among the best spectacle that the franchise has ever delivered, and at the same time, the final entries of the season were stretched so thin that you could practically see the bubblegum and duct tape that the artists at Studio Shaft were using to hold the production together. “We Failed” is by no means the prettiest episode of Madoka Magica ever produced, but it looks solid, and my biggest hope for this extra-short final season is that the overall aesthetic of the franchise isn't compromised because of scheduling and production errors. Lord knows that the poor crew deserves one hell of a vacation at this point.    All that said, do I think that Magia Record's final season will end up doing the spinoff justice? It's tough to say. I've always had a mixed relationship with Magia Record; at its best, it feels like a genuine and compelling expansion of the entire Madoka Magica universe, but at its worst, it becomes borderline incomprehensible. I think the good of the series generally outweighs the bad, though, and if you're at all a fan of the Madoka Magica franchise, I believe (and I hope) that you'll have a mostly good time with Magia Record. Just, you know, make sure to watch the other two seasons first if you're new to the series.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               This episode might as well have been called “30 Minutes of Answers.” In one self-contained flashback, it lays out every major remaining mystery in the series and thoroughly unravels them. However, the way it does this feels completely natural through yet another story of Madoka Magica-themed suffering.    As it goes with most of these stories, it begins with Kyubey preying on Iroha's fears for Ui and tricking her into becoming a magical girl. What's interesting here is that Ui, Nemu, and Touka are able to see through Kyubey's half-truths and uncover what is really going on. And like Madoka in the main series, the three sickly girls figure out the bunny-cat's biggest weakness: he has to grant wishes. He literally can't stop himself.    This, of course, kicks off their search for the perfect wish—or rather, set of wishes—to break Kyubey's system and allow the remaining magical girls to live normally even after all witches are exterminated. Their solution is basically to become Kyubey themselves—feeding the collected energy back into the magical girls rather than keeping it for themselves. The problem is that they never considered what would happen to the one taking in all the negative magical girl emotions—i.e., that they'd become a witch in seconds.    Basically, this episode is a tragedy centered around hubris. The three girls think that after a bit of research they can game the system and save the world. But instead, they arguably make things worse, leading to almost all of the tragedy we've seen in the series so far.    What's truly heartbreaking, though, is the effect that comes from isolating Ui's fractured soul inside of Kyubey. Like with Madoka at the end of the main series, this places her outside of reality—as if she never existed in the first place. This drastically changes the personalities of those closest to her (namely, Touka) and makes the previous seasons gain yet another layer of tragedy in retrospect. All in all, it's a fantastic amalgamation of lore and character building that has me pumped to see where things will go in our final three episodes.     discuss this in the forum (291 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives   ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

14-04-2022,anime,2,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/preview-guide/2022/spring/shikimori-not-just-a-cutie/.183648,Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie - The Spring 2022 Preview Guide - Anime News Network:SEA,"    The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie   Apr 10th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie ?                     Community score: 3.9              What is this?   Shikimori seems like the perfect girlfriend: cute, fun to be around, sweet when she wants to be, but she has a cool dark side that comes out under the right circumstances. And her boyfriend Izumi loves to be around when that happens.    Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie is based on Keigo Maki's romantic comedy manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                I read the first volume of Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie for an ANN manga preview guide some time ago. I enjoyed it, but it was one of those single joke premises and I didn't really like it enough to spend actual money on it, so I set it aside. Then Doga Kobo announced they'd be producing an anime, and I figured I'd finally get the rest of the story.    Doga Kobo has produced some fantastic comedy adaptations, even with ones that seem like their single joke couldn't possibly stretch to full-length episodes, such as Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun and Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle, so I had high hopes for Shikimori. And the first few minutes of the episode, wherein the titular Shikimori rescues her hapless boyfriend Izumi from getting hit by a truck and looks impossibly cool doing it, I thought I was going to be in for a good time. Since it is impossible for a critic to be wholly objective, I will reveal one of my biases: I have a huge weakness for gender-reversed tough girl/soft boy romances. Probably my favorite kind of heterosexuals. And Shikimori pinning Izumi against the wall and gently chastising him? That's some good fucking food, right there.    Alas, as the episode wore on, I realized it was more of an excellent amuse-bouche preceding a middling meal than a feast. The comic timing is piss-poor, causing things to drag the entire runtime. The episode is divided roughly into three segments, and each one gets maybe one or two jokes while the rest is paced like a slice-of-life series but without the necessary level of personality. Oh, there were still parts I liked, such as Shikimori choosing to discard her friend's advice to lose on purpose because fake incompetence is cute. I could go into full feminist rage mode about gender roles and it irritated me that Shikimori even entertained the idea, but the important thing is she decided to be her amazing self and bowl a perfect game, and Izumi loved it. Girls, get yourself a boy who doesn't want you to cut off bits of yourself to make them feel better, but instead adores everything awesome you are.    Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie gets three stars for having a good core concept and some good moments, but otherwise kind of boring. The adorable rhythm game ending gets it another star. I wonder what Mitsue Yamazaki is working on these days…       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               One thing I've always hated about romantic comedies is how 90% of them end with the couple finally getting together. Admitting you like each other is the first step of a relationship, not the last. I've always found the rare story about a couple dealing with the problems that come up over the course of a relationship to be far more heartfelt and interesting—which brings us to Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie. This episode doesn't even bother to tell us how the two got together—it's that unimportant. What matters is that they are together and are trying to make things work.    Of course, each of the pair has their issues. Shikimori wants to be seen as cute by her boyfriend—so much so that she is embarrassed by the badass athletic powerhouse side of herself. Meanwhile, Izumi hates that he is getting someone he loves caught up in his perpetual bad luck.    But what's great about the two is that they are working on their communication skills—something more than a bit difficult in a couple's first relationship. The last thing Izumi wants is for Shikimori to lessen herself to appease him. He wants her as she is—both her cute side and her badass side. So he makes sure to cheer her on and verbally support her at being the very best she can be.    On the other side of things, Shikimori is not bothered by Izumi's curse. She simply sees it as the price of entry for having such a kindhearted guy in her life. If she has to block the occasional flying newspaper or jump-kick a falling sign to protect the man she loves, so be it. And the fact that she tells him this is what makes them a couple with true lasting power. It's great to see such a healthy relationship in anime.    And while I've been gushing at the way the anime handles its romance, I'd be amiss if I didn't bring up the visuals. Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie is a master class on how changing one single visual detail can completely change a character's impression on the audience. When Shikimori does something awesome, all that changes is the shape of her eyes, turning into something resembling the eyes of a villainess—or of Goku whenever he gets serious in Dragon Ball Z, if you prefer. It's a fantastic shift that I find myself waiting for with bated breath in each scene.    All in all, if you're tired of will-they-won't-they romances and want a light-hearted story about two good people growing up into even better people thanks to their relationship with each other, don't miss out on this one.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Man, of all the shows this season to wind up a big disappointment, I didn't expect it to be this one. Granted, the premise isn't exactly comedic gold, but it was at least a novel dynamic for a romcom anime, and I was hoping that with Doga Kobo's A-team in charge this could be a fun complement to the other romances this season. Instead, I got 20 minutes of dull characters delivering jokes that are conceptually funny, but get totally smothered by lifeless pacing and timing.    There really is just...something missing here. Maybe it's the languid pacing of every scene, where characters seem to need a moment to start up before they start moving and talking. Maybe it's the strangely lifeless use of music that only ever serves to undercut jokes rather than punctuate them. Either way, despite being the world's biggest mark for even the dumbest romcom anime, I sat through this episode stonefaced. I could tell when jokes were happening, and I understood the punchline, could even imagine a version of it where it made me grin, and yet that never happened. It just wasn't funny, which destroys half of the romantic comedy moniker and left this episode a chore to get through.    More than that though, it also undercuts the romance angle of this whole endeavor. Especially poor Izumi, whose whole gimmick is he's got cosmically bad luck that results in pratfalls and comedic accidents for his dashing girlfriend to save him from. So when those jokes fall flat, it leaves him a boring blank slate who mostly exists to tell us how cute and/or cool Shikimori is. That's on top of the friend character who just states the point of any given scene out loud, proclaiming “It seems we're going to become better friends” when they all go out bowling. Shikimori herself is easily the most interesting character, both because she's the most active, and that she obviously has a secret side she's trying to hide from her boyfriend. The closest this episode comes to compelling is when she wholeheartedly reassures her hapless bae that he doesn't need to worry about being worthy of her – she likes him and wants to stay by his side, and that's all that matters. That's a nice sentiment, but it also gives half our central couple permission to not be interesting, and that hinders any chance of the romance being engaging.    That could maybe work if we got more of a look at “Cool” Shikimori, or if the jokes landed with anything besides a deafening thud. But as-is, this is easily the least entertaining romcom of the season. Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is similarly low-key, but its jokes are built for that delivery. Love After World Domination has a way stronger premise with a more active central couple. And even with a great production this show is not going to out-direct Kaguya-sama. In a weaker season I might continue with this one, but there's way too much competition to bother with a disappointing also-ran.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               This is a bit of a tricky one for me to (p)review, because I know that the story gets so much better from here. Not that this is bad, mind you – Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie is, even in this first episode, about the absolute cutest couple in all of anime, and while it does have a bit of a lather-rinse-repeat feel, once the characters become more than their stock selves as the plot develops, it simply becomes more – and this is coming from someone who felt that the first volume of the manga was intensely boring. The problem is, knowing what I know about later events, I'm not sure if I'm more kindly disposed to the anime's first episode than I otherwise would have been.    But my own probable bias aside, this is still pretty darn cute. Izumi and Shikimori are already a couple when we meet them, and very much an established one. It's nice that their initial meeting and going out were omitted from the episode, because we don't necessarily need to know how this whole thing started – what's important is that they clearly care a lot about each other. And believe me, Izumi needs someone who loves him as much as Shikimori around, because he's a danger magnet the likes of which cannot be overstated. If not for her quick actions this could have devolved into an isekai (thanks to a run-in with everyone's favorite motor vehicle on their walk to school) to say nothing of him taking a chalkboard eraser to the face and getting strangled by a stray page of a wind-borne newspaper. Essentially Izumi is the damsel in distress to Shikimori's prince charming, something that she's at times a little bit uncomfortable with.    Not that she has any intention of stopping. Izumi's continued presence in her life appears to be something she's willing to do anything to protect, as we see demonstrated over the course of the episode; it's just that she also wants him to think that she's “cute.” Fortunately she's not so foolish as to take her friend Neko's advice to fake being bad at bowling, because I think a piece of her does realize that Izumi likes her no matter whether she's “cute” or “cool.” The opening theme implies that she has a past that makes her worry more about it than she needs to, but it also makes her a bit more human – she's not a superhero, just someone with less of a danger magnet and with better motor coordination than Izumi.    Although the almost aggressively pastel colors can feel a little too precious at times, this is basically just a nice episode. Izumi and Shikimori aren't joined at the hip despite their mutual adoration and maintain friendships with other people, the story is gentle, and the ending theme, with Shikimori trying to protect Izumi is framed as an obstacle game, is a great way to sum things up. It's not exciting, but it is sweet, and it should only get more so from here.       James Beckett  Rating:               The blurb on Crunchyroll described our boy Izumi as “naturally unlucky”, but that's underselling it a bit. This poor kid is straight up cursed by the universe itself; his entire life is like if the Grim Reaper from Final Destination made it his life's purpose to dunk on a sweet-natured Japanese boy for years on end, and the boy just kind of learned to deal with how reality itself will seemingly warp and defy all logic or reason simply to embarrass him in front of every human on earth. Thankfully for us, this is the kind of comedy cliché that really never gets old. Charlie Chaplin was making bank off of the same material a hundred years ago, and now Izumi's casual suffering can provide us oodles of comic joy here in the second round of the Roaring 20s.    That's not the whole shtick of Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie, though, and it's the title character that transforms the anime from a solid premise to a bonafide hit. Izumi's too meek and resigned to mind his cruel fate, but the show would honestly lose a lot of its charm if it was nothing but watching this nice kid have a bad day, every day, for a whole season. That's where Shikimori comes in. You see, Izumi may be a living punchline to the universe's running joke, but his consolation prize is that he has literally the coolest girlfriend in all of anime. That isn't me just being hyperbolic, either; that's canon. Shikimori is the kind of idealized cartoon love interest that actually works because she still feels like a real person, despite being gifted superhuman reflexes and genuinely terrifying levels of charm and charisma (not to mention some wicked bowling skills). This girl loves her boyfriend so freaking much, and since Izumi also feels like a genuine character instead of a bland self-insert, their relationship is as wholesome as it is amusing.    Seriously, who among us hasn't dreamed of having a partner who kicks ass, is hot as hell, has a sweet side that melts your heart whenever it comes out, and is yet still vulnerable and empathetic enough to make her love for you apparant in every way she possibly can? I mean, I already found that—my wife is literally the coolest woman alive, after all, and I may have to investigate Keigo Maki for ripping off her life's story—but that means that everyone else on Earth could only imagine how awesome it is to have a Shikimori for a girlfriend. Until now, that is!    The Spring of 2022 seems to be the Season of Rom-Coms, as our collective cup runneth over with the likes of Kaguya-sama, Love After World Domination, and now we have Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie to add to the roster. Drink deep from the well of “Dawwwwwws”, my friends, and revel in the cuteness of it all.

Community score: 3.9              What is this?   Shikimori seems like the perfect girlfriend: cute, fun to be around, sweet when she wants to be, but she has a cool dark side that comes out under the right circumstances. And her boyfriend Izumi loves to be around when that happens.    Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie is based on Keigo Maki's romantic comedy manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                I read the first volume of Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie for an ANN manga preview guide some time ago. I enjoyed it, but it was one of those single joke premises and I didn't really like it enough to spend actual money on it, so I set it aside. Then Doga Kobo announced they'd be producing an anime, and I figured I'd finally get the rest of the story.    Doga Kobo has produced some fantastic comedy adaptations, even with ones that seem like their single joke couldn't possibly stretch to full-length episodes, such as Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun and Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle, so I had high hopes for Shikimori. And the first few minutes of the episode, wherein the titular Shikimori rescues her hapless boyfriend Izumi from getting hit by a truck and looks impossibly cool doing it, I thought I was going to be in for a good time. Since it is impossible for a critic to be wholly objective, I will reveal one of my biases: I have a huge weakness for gender-reversed tough girl/soft boy romances. Probably my favorite kind of heterosexuals. And Shikimori pinning Izumi against the wall and gently chastising him? That's some good fucking food, right there.    Alas, as the episode wore on, I realized it was more of an excellent amuse-bouche preceding a middling meal than a feast. The comic timing is piss-poor, causing things to drag the entire runtime. The episode is divided roughly into three segments, and each one gets maybe one or two jokes while the rest is paced like a slice-of-life series but without the necessary level of personality. Oh, there were still parts I liked, such as Shikimori choosing to discard her friend's advice to lose on purpose because fake incompetence is cute. I could go into full feminist rage mode about gender roles and it irritated me that Shikimori even entertained the idea, but the important thing is she decided to be her amazing self and bowl a perfect game, and Izumi loved it. Girls, get yourself a boy who doesn't want you to cut off bits of yourself to make them feel better, but instead adores everything awesome you are.    Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie gets three stars for having a good core concept and some good moments, but otherwise kind of boring. The adorable rhythm game ending gets it another star. I wonder what Mitsue Yamazaki is working on these days…       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               One thing I've always hated about romantic comedies is how 90% of them end with the couple finally getting together. Admitting you like each other is the first step of a relationship, not the last. I've always found the rare story about a couple dealing with the problems that come up over the course of a relationship to be far more heartfelt and interesting—which brings us to Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie. This episode doesn't even bother to tell us how the two got together—it's that unimportant. What matters is that they are together and are trying to make things work.    Of course, each of the pair has their issues. Shikimori wants to be seen as cute by her boyfriend—so much so that she is embarrassed by the badass athletic powerhouse side of herself. Meanwhile, Izumi hates that he is getting someone he loves caught up in his perpetual bad luck.    But what's great about the two is that they are working on their communication skills—something more than a bit difficult in a couple's first relationship. The last thing Izumi wants is for Shikimori to lessen herself to appease him. He wants her as she is—both her cute side and her badass side. So he makes sure to cheer her on and verbally support her at being the very best she can be.    On the other side of things, Shikimori is not bothered by Izumi's curse. She simply sees it as the price of entry for having such a kindhearted guy in her life. If she has to block the occasional flying newspaper or jump-kick a falling sign to protect the man she loves, so be it. And the fact that she tells him this is what makes them a couple with true lasting power. It's great to see such a healthy relationship in anime.    And while I've been gushing at the way the anime handles its romance, I'd be amiss if I didn't bring up the visuals. Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie is a master class on how changing one single visual detail can completely change a character's impression on the audience. When Shikimori does something awesome, all that changes is the shape of her eyes, turning into something resembling the eyes of a villainess—or of Goku whenever he gets serious in Dragon Ball Z, if you prefer. It's a fantastic shift that I find myself waiting for with bated breath in each scene.    All in all, if you're tired of will-they-won't-they romances and want a light-hearted story about two good people growing up into even better people thanks to their relationship with each other, don't miss out on this one.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Man, of all the shows this season to wind up a big disappointment, I didn't expect it to be this one. Granted, the premise isn't exactly comedic gold, but it was at least a novel dynamic for a romcom anime, and I was hoping that with Doga Kobo's A-team in charge this could be a fun complement to the other romances this season. Instead, I got 20 minutes of dull characters delivering jokes that are conceptually funny, but get totally smothered by lifeless pacing and timing.    There really is just...something missing here. Maybe it's the languid pacing of every scene, where characters seem to need a moment to start up before they start moving and talking. Maybe it's the strangely lifeless use of music that only ever serves to undercut jokes rather than punctuate them. Either way, despite being the world's biggest mark for even the dumbest romcom anime, I sat through this episode stonefaced. I could tell when jokes were happening, and I understood the punchline, could even imagine a version of it where it made me grin, and yet that never happened. It just wasn't funny, which destroys half of the romantic comedy moniker and left this episode a chore to get through.    More than that though, it also undercuts the romance angle of this whole endeavor. Especially poor Izumi, whose whole gimmick is he's got cosmically bad luck that results in pratfalls and comedic accidents for his dashing girlfriend to save him from. So when those jokes fall flat, it leaves him a boring blank slate who mostly exists to tell us how cute and/or cool Shikimori is. That's on top of the friend character who just states the point of any given scene out loud, proclaiming “It seems we're going to become better friends” when they all go out bowling. Shikimori herself is easily the most interesting character, both because she's the most active, and that she obviously has a secret side she's trying to hide from her boyfriend. The closest this episode comes to compelling is when she wholeheartedly reassures her hapless bae that he doesn't need to worry about being worthy of her – she likes him and wants to stay by his side, and that's all that matters.

Izumi's continued presence in her life appears to be something she's willing to do anything to protect, as we see demonstrated over the course of the episode; it's just that she also wants him to think that she's “cute.” Fortunately she's not so foolish as to take her friend Neko's advice to fake being bad at bowling, because I think a piece of her does realize that Izumi likes her no matter whether she's “cute” or “cool.” The opening theme implies that she has a past that makes her worry more about it than she needs to, but it also makes her a bit more human – she's not a superhero, just someone with less of a danger magnet and with better motor coordination than Izumi.    Although the almost aggressively pastel colors can feel a little too precious at times, this is basically just a nice episode. Izumi and Shikimori aren't joined at the hip despite their mutual adoration and maintain friendships with other people, the story is gentle, and the ending theme, with Shikimori trying to protect Izumi is framed as an obstacle game, is a great way to sum things up. It's not exciting, but it is sweet, and it should only get more so from here.       James Beckett  Rating:               The blurb on Crunchyroll described our boy Izumi as “naturally unlucky”, but that's underselling it a bit. This poor kid is straight up cursed by the universe itself; his entire life is like if the Grim Reaper from Final Destination made it his life's purpose to dunk on a sweet-natured Japanese boy for years on end, and the boy just kind of learned to deal with how reality itself will seemingly warp and defy all logic or reason simply to embarrass him in front of every human on earth. Thankfully for us, this is the kind of comedy cliché that really never gets old. Charlie Chaplin was making bank off of the same material a hundred years ago, and now Izumi's casual suffering can provide us oodles of comic joy here in the second round of the Roaring 20s.    That's not the whole shtick of Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie, though, and it's the title character that transforms the anime from a solid premise to a bonafide hit. Izumi's too meek and resigned to mind his cruel fate, but the show would honestly lose a lot of its charm if it was nothing but watching this nice kid have a bad day, every day, for a whole season. That's where Shikimori comes in. You see, Izumi may be a living punchline to the universe's running joke, but his consolation prize is that he has literally the coolest girlfriend in all of anime. That isn't me just being hyperbolic, either; that's canon. Shikimori is the kind of idealized cartoon love interest that actually works because she still feels like a real person, despite being gifted superhuman reflexes and genuinely terrifying levels of charm and charisma (not to mention some wicked bowling skills). This girl loves her boyfriend so freaking much, and since Izumi also feels like a genuine character instead of a bland self-insert, their relationship is as wholesome as it is amusing.    Seriously, who among us hasn't dreamed of having a partner who kicks ass, is hot as hell, has a sweet side that melts your heart whenever it comes out, and is yet still vulnerable and empathetic enough to make her love for you apparant in every way she possibly can? I mean, I already found that—my wife is literally the coolest woman alive, after all, and I may have to investigate Keigo Maki for ripping off her life's story—but that means that everyone else on Earth could only imagine how awesome it is to have a Shikimori for a girlfriend. Until now, that is!    The Spring of 2022 seems to be the Season of Rom-Coms, as our collective cup runneth over with the likes of Kaguya-sama, Love After World Domination, and now we have Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie to add to the roster. Drink deep from the well of “Dawwwwwws”, my friends, and revel in the cuteness of it all.

Community score: 3.9              What is this?   Shikimori seems like the perfect girlfriend: cute, fun to be around, sweet when she wants to be, but she has a cool dark side that comes out under the right circumstances. And her boyfriend Izumi loves to be around when that happens.    Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie is based on Keigo Maki's romantic comedy manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                I read the first volume of Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie for an ANN manga preview guide some time ago. I enjoyed it, but it was one of those single joke premises and I didn't really like it enough to spend actual money on it, so I set it aside. Then Doga Kobo announced they'd be producing an anime, and I figured I'd finally get the rest of the story.    Doga Kobo has produced some fantastic comedy adaptations, even with ones that seem like their single joke couldn't possibly stretch to full-length episodes, such as Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun and Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle, so I had high hopes for Shikimori. And the first few minutes of the episode, wherein the titular Shikimori rescues her hapless boyfriend Izumi from getting hit by a truck and looks impossibly cool doing it, I thought I was going to be in for a good time. Since it is impossible for a critic to be wholly objective, I will reveal one of my biases: I have a huge weakness for gender-reversed tough girl/soft boy romances. Probably my favorite kind of heterosexuals. And Shikimori pinning Izumi against the wall and gently chastising him? That's some good fucking food, right there.    Alas, as the episode wore on, I realized it was more of an excellent amuse-bouche preceding a middling meal than a feast. The comic timing is piss-poor, causing things to drag the entire runtime. The episode is divided roughly into three segments, and each one gets maybe one or two jokes while the rest is paced like a slice-of-life series but without the necessary level of personality. Oh, there were still parts I liked, such as Shikimori choosing to discard her friend's advice to lose on purpose because fake incompetence is cute. I could go into full feminist rage mode about gender roles and it irritated me that Shikimori even entertained the idea, but the important thing is she decided to be her amazing self and bowl a perfect game, and Izumi loved it. Girls, get yourself a boy who doesn't want you to cut off bits of yourself to make them feel better, but instead adores everything awesome you are.    Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie gets three stars for having a good core concept and some good moments, but otherwise kind of boring. The adorable rhythm game ending gets it another star. I wonder what Mitsue Yamazaki is working on these days…       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               One thing I've always hated about romantic comedies is how 90% of them end with the couple finally getting together. Admitting you like each other is the first step of a relationship, not the last. I've always found the rare story about a couple dealing with the problems that come up over the course of a relationship to be far more heartfelt and interesting—which brings us to Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie. This episode doesn't even bother to tell us how the two got together—it's that unimportant. What matters is that they are together and are trying to make things work.    Of course, each of the pair has their issues. Shikimori wants to be seen as cute by her boyfriend—so much so that she is embarrassed by the badass athletic powerhouse side of herself. Meanwhile, Izumi hates that he is getting someone he loves caught up in his perpetual bad luck.    But what's great about the two is that they are working on their communication skills—something more than a bit difficult in a couple's first relationship. The last thing Izumi wants is for Shikimori to lessen herself to appease him. He wants her as she is—both her cute side and her badass side. So he makes sure to cheer her on and verbally support her at being the very best she can be.    On the other side of things, Shikimori is not bothered by Izumi's curse. She simply sees it as the price of entry for having such a kindhearted guy in her life. If she has to block the occasional flying newspaper or jump-kick a falling sign to protect the man she loves, so be it. And the fact that she tells him this is what makes them a couple with true lasting power. It's great to see such a healthy relationship in anime.    And while I've been gushing at the way the anime handles its romance, I'd be amiss if I didn't bring up the visuals. Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie is a master class on how changing one single visual detail can completely change a character's impression on the audience. When Shikimori does something awesome, all that changes is the shape of her eyes, turning into something resembling the eyes of a villainess—or of Goku whenever he gets serious in Dragon Ball Z, if you prefer. It's a fantastic shift that I find myself waiting for with bated breath in each scene.    All in all, if you're tired of will-they-won't-they romances and want a light-hearted story about two good people growing up into even better people thanks to their relationship with each other, don't miss out on this one.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Man, of all the shows this season to wind up a big disappointment, I didn't expect it to be this one. Granted, the premise isn't exactly comedic gold, but it was at least a novel dynamic for a romcom anime, and I was hoping that with Doga Kobo's A-team in charge this could be a fun complement to the other romances this season. Instead, I got 20 minutes of dull characters delivering jokes that are conceptually funny, but get totally smothered by lifeless pacing and timing.    There really is just...something missing here. Maybe it's the languid pacing of every scene, where characters seem to need a moment to start up before they start moving and talking. Maybe it's the strangely lifeless use of music that only ever serves to undercut jokes rather than punctuate them. Either way, despite being the world's biggest mark for even the dumbest romcom anime, I sat through this episode stonefaced. I could tell when jokes were happening, and I understood the punchline, could even imagine a version of it where it made me grin, and yet that never happened. It just wasn't funny, which destroys half of the romantic comedy moniker and left this episode a chore to get through.    More than that though, it also undercuts the romance angle of this whole endeavor. Especially poor Izumi, whose whole gimmick is he's got cosmically bad luck that results in pratfalls and comedic accidents for his dashing girlfriend to save him from. So when those jokes fall flat, it leaves him a boring blank slate who mostly exists to tell us how cute and/or cool Shikimori is. That's on top of the friend character who just states the point of any given scene out loud, proclaiming “It seems we're going to become better friends” when they all go out bowling. Shikimori herself is easily the most interesting character, both because she's the most active, and that she obviously has a secret side she's trying to hide from her boyfriend. The closest this episode comes to compelling is when she wholeheartedly reassures her hapless bae that he doesn't need to worry about being worthy of her – she likes him and wants to stay by his side, and that's all that matters. That's a nice sentiment, but it also gives half our central couple permission to not be interesting, and that hinders any chance of the romance being engaging.    That could maybe work if we got more of a look at “Cool” Shikimori, or if the jokes landed with anything besides a deafening thud. But as-is, this is easily the least entertaining romcom of the season. Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is similarly low-key, but its jokes are built for that delivery. Love After World Domination has a way stronger premise with a more active central couple. And even with a great production this show is not going to out-direct Kaguya-sama. In a weaker season I might continue with this one, but there's way too much competition to bother with a disappointing also-ran.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               This is a bit of a tricky one for me to (p)review, because I know that the story gets so much better from here. Not that this is bad, mind you – Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie is, even in this first episode, about the absolute cutest couple in all of anime, and while it does have a bit of a lather-rinse-repeat feel, once the characters become more than their stock selves as the plot develops, it simply becomes more – and this is coming from someone who felt that the first volume of the manga was intensely boring. The problem is, knowing what I know about later events, I'm not sure if I'm more kindly disposed to the anime's first episode than I otherwise would have been.    But my own probable bias aside, this is still pretty darn cute. Izumi and Shikimori are already a couple when we meet them, and very much an established one. It's nice that their initial meeting and going out were omitted from the episode, because we don't necessarily need to know how this whole thing started – what's important is that they clearly care a lot about each other. And believe me, Izumi needs someone who loves him as much as Shikimori around, because he's a danger magnet the likes of which cannot be overstated. If not for her quick actions this could have devolved into an isekai (thanks to a run-in with everyone's favorite motor vehicle on their walk to school) to say nothing of him taking a chalkboard eraser to the face and getting strangled by a stray page of a wind-borne newspaper.

That's where Shikimori comes in. You see, Izumi may be a living punchline to the universe's running joke, but his consolation prize is that he has literally the coolest girlfriend in all of anime. That isn't me just being hyperbolic, either; that's canon. Shikimori is the kind of idealized cartoon love interest that actually works because she still feels like a real person, despite being gifted superhuman reflexes and genuinely terrifying levels of charm and charisma (not to mention some wicked bowling skills). This girl loves her boyfriend so freaking much, and since Izumi also feels like a genuine character instead of a bland self-insert, their relationship is as wholesome as it is amusing.    Seriously, who among us hasn't dreamed of having a partner who kicks ass, is hot as hell, has a sweet side that melts your heart whenever it comes out, and is yet still vulnerable and empathetic enough to make her love for you apparant in every way she possibly can? I mean, I already found that—my wife is literally the coolest woman alive, after all, and I may have to investigate Keigo Maki for ripping off her life's story—but that means that everyone else on Earth could only imagine how awesome it is to have a Shikimori for a girlfriend. Until now, that is!    The Spring of 2022 seems to be the Season of Rom-Coms, as our collective cup runneth over with the likes of Kaguya-sama, Love After World Domination, and now we have Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie to add to the roster. Drink deep from the well of “Dawwwwwws”, my friends, and revel in the cuteness of it all. This show looks like another keeper, indeed.

Community score: 3.9              What is this?   Shikimori seems like the perfect girlfriend: cute, fun to be around, sweet when she wants to be, but she has a cool dark side that comes out under the right circumstances. And her boyfriend Izumi loves to be around when that happens.    Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie is based on Keigo Maki's romantic comedy manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                I read the first volume of Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie for an ANN manga preview guide some time ago. I enjoyed it, but it was one of those single joke premises and I didn't really like it enough to spend actual money on it, so I set it aside. Then Doga Kobo announced they'd be producing an anime, and I figured I'd finally get the rest of the story.    Doga Kobo has produced some fantastic comedy adaptations, even with ones that seem like their single joke couldn't possibly stretch to full-length episodes, such as Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun and Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle, so I had high hopes for Shikimori. And the first few minutes of the episode, wherein the titular Shikimori rescues her hapless boyfriend Izumi from getting hit by a truck and looks impossibly cool doing it, I thought I was going to be in for a good time. Since it is impossible for a critic to be wholly objective, I will reveal one of my biases: I have a huge weakness for gender-reversed tough girl/soft boy romances. Probably my favorite kind of heterosexuals. And Shikimori pinning Izumi against the wall and gently chastising him? That's some good fucking food, right there.    Alas, as the episode wore on, I realized it was more of an excellent amuse-bouche preceding a middling meal than a feast. The comic timing is piss-poor, causing things to drag the entire runtime. The episode is divided roughly into three segments, and each one gets maybe one or two jokes while the rest is paced like a slice-of-life series but without the necessary level of personality. Oh, there were still parts I liked, such as Shikimori choosing to discard her friend's advice to lose on purpose because fake incompetence is cute. I could go into full feminist rage mode about gender roles and it irritated me that Shikimori even entertained the idea, but the important thing is she decided to be her amazing self and bowl a perfect game, and Izumi loved it. Girls, get yourself a boy who doesn't want you to cut off bits of yourself to make them feel better, but instead adores everything awesome you are.    Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie gets three stars for having a good core concept and some good moments, but otherwise kind of boring. The adorable rhythm game ending gets it another star. I wonder what Mitsue Yamazaki is working on these days…       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               One thing I've always hated about romantic comedies is how 90% of them end with the couple finally getting together. Admitting you like each other is the first step of a relationship, not the last. I've always found the rare story about a couple dealing with the problems that come up over the course of a relationship to be far more heartfelt and interesting—which brings us to Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie. This episode doesn't even bother to tell us how the two got together—it's that unimportant. What matters is that they are together and are trying to make things work.    Of course, each of the pair has their issues. Shikimori wants to be seen as cute by her boyfriend—so much so that she is embarrassed by the badass athletic powerhouse side of herself. Meanwhile, Izumi hates that he is getting someone he loves caught up in his perpetual bad luck.    But what's great about the two is that they are working on their communication skills—something more than a bit difficult in a couple's first relationship. The last thing Izumi wants is for Shikimori to lessen herself to appease him. He wants her as she is—both her cute side and her badass side. So he makes sure to cheer her on and verbally support her at being the very best she can be.    On the other side of things, Shikimori is not bothered by Izumi's curse. She simply sees it as the price of entry for having such a kindhearted guy in her life. If she has to block the occasional flying newspaper or jump-kick a falling sign to protect the man she loves, so be it. And the fact that she tells him this is what makes them a couple with true lasting power. It's great to see such a healthy relationship in anime.    And while I've been gushing at the way the anime handles its romance, I'd be amiss if I didn't bring up the visuals. Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie is a master class on how changing one single visual detail can completely change a character's impression on the audience. When Shikimori does something awesome, all that changes is the shape of her eyes, turning into something resembling the eyes of a villainess—or of Goku whenever he gets serious in Dragon Ball Z, if you prefer. It's a fantastic shift that I find myself waiting for with bated breath in each scene.    All in all, if you're tired of will-they-won't-they romances and want a light-hearted story about two good people growing up into even better people thanks to their relationship with each other, don't miss out on this one.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Man, of all the shows this season to wind up a big disappointment, I didn't expect it to be this one. Granted, the premise isn't exactly comedic gold, but it was at least a novel dynamic for a romcom anime, and I was hoping that with Doga Kobo's A-team in charge this could be a fun complement to the other romances this season. Instead, I got 20 minutes of dull characters delivering jokes that are conceptually funny, but get totally smothered by lifeless pacing and timing.    There really is just...something missing here. Maybe it's the languid pacing of every scene, where characters seem to need a moment to start up before they start moving and talking. Maybe it's the strangely lifeless use of music that only ever serves to undercut jokes rather than punctuate them. Either way, despite being the world's biggest mark for even the dumbest romcom anime, I sat through this episode stonefaced. I could tell when jokes were happening, and I understood the punchline, could even imagine a version of it where it made me grin, and yet that never happened. It just wasn't funny, which destroys half of the romantic comedy moniker and left this episode a chore to get through.    More than that though, it also undercuts the romance angle of this whole endeavor. Especially poor Izumi, whose whole gimmick is he's got cosmically bad luck that results in pratfalls and comedic accidents for his dashing girlfriend to save him from. So when those jokes fall flat, it leaves him a boring blank slate who mostly exists to tell us how cute and/or cool Shikimori is. That's on top of the friend character who just states the point of any given scene out loud, proclaiming “It seems we're going to become better friends” when they all go out bowling. Shikimori herself is easily the most interesting character, both because she's the most active, and that she obviously has a secret side she's trying to hide from her boyfriend. The closest this episode comes to compelling is when she wholeheartedly reassures her hapless bae that he doesn't need to worry about being worthy of her – she likes him and wants to stay by his side, and that's all that matters. That's a nice sentiment, but it also gives half our central couple permission to not be interesting, and that hinders any chance of the romance being engaging.    That could maybe work if we got more of a look at “Cool” Shikimori, or if the jokes landed with anything besides a deafening thud. But as-is, this is easily the least entertaining romcom of the season. Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is similarly low-key, but its jokes are built for that delivery. Love After World Domination has a way stronger premise with a more active central couple. And even with a great production this show is not going to out-direct Kaguya-sama. In a weaker season I might continue with this one, but there's way too much competition to bother with a disappointing also-ran.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               This is a bit of a tricky one for me to (p)review, because I know that the story gets so much better from here. Not that this is bad, mind you – Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie is, even in this first episode, about the absolute cutest couple in all of anime, and while it does have a bit of a lather-rinse-repeat feel, once the characters become more than their stock selves as the plot develops, it simply becomes more – and this is coming from someone who felt that the first volume of the manga was intensely boring. The problem is, knowing what I know about later events, I'm not sure if I'm more kindly disposed to the anime's first episode than I otherwise would have been.    But my own probable bias aside, this is still pretty darn cute. Izumi and Shikimori are already a couple when we meet them, and very much an established one. It's nice that their initial meeting and going out were omitted from the episode, because we don't necessarily need to know how this whole thing started – what's important is that they clearly care a lot about each other. And believe me, Izumi needs someone who loves him as much as Shikimori around, because he's a danger magnet the likes of which cannot be overstated. If not for her quick actions this could have devolved into an isekai (thanks to a run-in with everyone's favorite motor vehicle on their walk to school) to say nothing of him taking a chalkboard eraser to the face and getting strangled by a stray page of a wind-borne newspaper. Essentially Izumi is the damsel in distress to Shikimori's prince charming, something that she's at times a little bit uncomfortable with.    Not that she has any intention of stopping. Izumi's continued presence in her life appears to be something she's willing to do anything to protect, as we see demonstrated over the course of the episode; it's just that she also wants him to think that she's “cute.” Fortunately she's not so foolish as to take her friend Neko's advice to fake being bad at bowling, because I think a piece of her does realize that Izumi likes her no matter whether she's “cute” or “cool.” The opening theme implies that she has a past that makes her worry more about it than she needs to, but it also makes her a bit more human – she's not a superhero, just someone with less of a danger magnet and with better motor coordination than Izumi.    Although the almost aggressively pastel colors can feel a little too precious at times, this is basically just a nice episode. Izumi and Shikimori aren't joined at the hip despite their mutual adoration and maintain friendships with other people, the story is gentle, and the ending theme, with Shikimori trying to protect Izumi is framed as an obstacle game, is a great way to sum things up. It's not exciting, but it is sweet, and it should only get more so from here.       James Beckett  Rating:               The blurb on Crunchyroll described our boy Izumi as “naturally unlucky”, but that's underselling it a bit. This poor kid is straight up cursed by the universe itself; his entire life is like if the Grim Reaper from Final Destination made it his life's purpose to dunk on a sweet-natured Japanese boy for years on end, and the boy just kind of learned to deal with how reality itself will seemingly warp and defy all logic or reason simply to embarrass him in front of every human on earth. Thankfully for us, this is the kind of comedy cliché that really never gets old. Charlie Chaplin was making bank off of the same material a hundred years ago, and now Izumi's casual suffering can provide us oodles of comic joy here in the second round of the Roaring 20s.    That's not the whole shtick of Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie, though, and it's the title character that transforms the anime from a solid premise to a bonafide hit. Izumi's too meek and resigned to mind his cruel fate, but the show would honestly lose a lot of its charm if it was nothing but watching this nice kid have a bad day, every day, for a whole season.
