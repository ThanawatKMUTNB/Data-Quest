Community score: 3.1              What is this?   In Hadrian Rome, Lucius was a Roman architect whose designs often got rejected by builders. To cheer him up a friend of his invited him to relax at a thermae (public bath). Inside the bath Lucius was accidentally trapped in an underwater hole by suction; when he finally managed to emerge on the surface he found himself in a very different bath: in 20th century Japan.    Thermae Romae Novae is based on Mari Yamazaki's manga and is currently streaming on Netflix.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                One of the things that comes with having major ADHD is learning how to manage constantly shifting hyperfixations, which is to say that I can totally understand how something like Thermae Romae Novae could come into existence. I've spent a frankly embarrassing amount of hours obsessing over kaiju movies, tokusatsu shows, Gunpla models, and The Muppets (and that's just the stuff I've gotten into over the last five years or so), so I'm not all surprised to learn that there exists at least one person in the world whose love for ancient history, architecture, and public bathhouses intersected with such ferocity that an entire multi-media franchise was born.    Here's my main issue with Thermae Romae Novae: While I'm certainly always down to dig into some history and culture lessons, I myself don't particularly care about architecture, and I've never even stepped foot inside of a public bathhouse. Our main character, Lucius, has precisely two personality traits: He freaking loves architecture, and his dream in life is to—and I quote—“Build bathhouses that make everyone smile!” Even when you include the series' novel time-travel angle (which doesn't really impact the first episode of the show at all), the core of Thermae Romae Novae's appeal lies in its unapologetic obsession with bathhouse cultures past and present.    What that means is that, outside of the very specific niche appeal of the bathhouses themselves, I'm not finding much else to latch onto with this story. The historical drama isn't well-written enough to hold up on its own, and there's not much humor to be found outside of that. In short, while the material here is perfectly fine for an educational documentary, I'm not sure it makes for the kind of anime that I want to sit down and watch on a regular basis.    Heck, the anime actually comes with live-action documentary segments that close out its episodes, and I find those much more compelling than the rest of the show that they're attached to. The segments that follow author Mari Yamazaki's quest to “rediscover Japanese bathhouse culture” are genuinely interesting and feature some lovely footage of real-world bathhouse settings, and the anime's relatively drab and uninspired visuals simply don't hold up in comparison. It doesn't help that, in all of the scenes set inside the thermae themselves (of which there are many), the show slaps this hideous and cheap looking steam filter on top of the screen.    I've heard that Thermae Romae has a sizeable fan-base, so it's quite possible that future episodes of the show would give me more of a reason to stick around and get invested in the bathhouse mania of it all. As it stands, though, I don't think Thermae Romae Novae is for me; at the very least, if I ever do come back to the show, I can easily imagine skipping all of the anime parts to get to the documentary bits. That's apparently where the real bathhouse action is at.        Caitlin Moore  Rating:               The manga of Thermae Romae is a critically-acclaimed award winner. The first anime adaptation was a low-budget short that developed a cult following for its quirky humor. The new series that just premiered on Netflix, Thermae Romae Novae, has a TV run's worth of full-length episodes, complete with attempts at pathos and backstory, and has the same director as the critically-panned Africa Salaryman. It is also boring.    For a series with a concept as weird as “Roman architect time travels through a portal in a bath for inspiration,” you really don't need to put a lot of effort into building up character motivation. Yet for some reason, they felt the need to give Lucius a reason to really love baths and a tragic childhood involving a dead father and bullies. Can't he just be a dude who loves soaking in hot water and designing new ways to do it? The first episode has no jokes and just feels long, drawn-out, and pointless.    Yet somehow, that's not the most baffling decision the anime staff made. You see, the people in togas and marble buildings with columns aren't enough to make us realize this shit all happened a long time ago. We couldn't possibly manage to figure that out on our own. The distant past was all sepia-toned, right? They didn't invent bright colors until the '50s! Everything up until then was muddy and dim. Unfortunately, the half-assed color design, along with the pen-and-ink style shading, makes it look like everything has been rubbed with dirt. In a series about bathing and cleanliness. It's silly.    Maybe Thermae Romae Novae picks up after this. I hear it has Kenjiro Tsuda yelling in Latin, so that's something.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                It's funny, Thermae Romae is so mainstream here in Japan that despite never having read a page of the manga nor having seen the live-action film, I already knew the basic setup through cultural osmosis alone—which is why watching this threw me for a bit of a loop. What I was expecting was a time-traveling Roman being awed by some facet of Japanese hot spring culture over and over again. And while that may be what the series turns into, this first episode was most certainly not.    Rather, this episode gives us the backstory for our series' protagonist Lucius, showing why he became a bathhouse architect and where his philosophy on bathing came from. But more than that, this episode is about how blue-collar workers find importance and pride in their daily toil. For a mason, it's knowing that their work will record the past and inspire the future. For Lucius' father and grandfather, it's about creating a place where people can be purged of stress and be ready to face a new day. In other words, they may be cogs in Roman society, but they know that they are vital to its functioning.    It makes for a solid setup to the series, even if it's ultimately not representative of the rest of the show. It's just a shame that the animation doesn't really hold up. In wide shots there is a noticeable drop in detail and in scenes with any kind of quick movement, it looks choppy to say the least. And the live-action ending with the author of the manga is pretty much Japanese TV in a nutshell—i.e., a person traveling around Japan talking about how cool some aspect of Japanese culture (usually food) really is.    All in all, I don't know if it's my cup of tea but it certainly wasn't bad.     discuss this in the forum (291 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 3.1              What is this?   In Hadrian Rome, Lucius was a Roman architect whose designs often got rejected by builders. To cheer him up a friend of his invited him to relax at a thermae (public bath). Inside the bath Lucius was accidentally trapped in an underwater hole by suction; when he finally managed to emerge on the surface he found himself in a very different bath: in 20th century Japan.    Thermae Romae Novae is based on Mari Yamazaki's manga and is currently streaming on Netflix.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                One of the things that comes with having major ADHD is learning how to manage constantly shifting hyperfixations, which is to say that I can totally understand how something like Thermae Romae Novae could come into existence. I've spent a frankly embarrassing amount of hours obsessing over kaiju movies, tokusatsu shows, Gunpla models, and The Muppets (and that's just the stuff I've gotten into over the last five years or so), so I'm not all surprised to learn that there exists at least one person in the world whose love for ancient history, architecture, and public bathhouses intersected with such ferocity that an entire multi-media franchise was born.    Here's my main issue with Thermae Romae Novae: While I'm certainly always down to dig into some history and culture lessons, I myself don't particularly care about architecture, and I've never even stepped foot inside of a public bathhouse. Our main character, Lucius, has precisely two personality traits: He freaking loves architecture, and his dream in life is to—and I quote—“Build bathhouses that make everyone smile!” Even when you include the series' novel time-travel angle (which doesn't really impact the first episode of the show at all), the core of Thermae Romae Novae's appeal lies in its unapologetic obsession with bathhouse cultures past and present.    What that means is that, outside of the very specific niche appeal of the bathhouses themselves, I'm not finding much else to latch onto with this story. The historical drama isn't well-written enough to hold up on its own, and there's not much humor to be found outside of that. In short, while the material here is perfectly fine for an educational documentary, I'm not sure it makes for the kind of anime that I want to sit down and watch on a regular basis.    Heck, the anime actually comes with live-action documentary segments that close out its episodes, and I find those much more compelling than the rest of the show that they're attached to. The segments that follow author Mari Yamazaki's quest to “rediscover Japanese bathhouse culture” are genuinely interesting and feature some lovely footage of real-world bathhouse settings, and the anime's relatively drab and uninspired visuals simply don't hold up in comparison. It doesn't help that, in all of the scenes set inside the thermae themselves (of which there are many), the show slaps this hideous and cheap looking steam filter on top of the screen.    I've heard that Thermae Romae has a sizeable fan-base, so it's quite possible that future episodes of the show would give me more of a reason to stick around and get invested in the bathhouse mania of it all. As it stands, though, I don't think Thermae Romae Novae is for me; at the very least, if I ever do come back to the show, I can easily imagine skipping all of the anime parts to get to the documentary bits. That's apparently where the real bathhouse action is at.        Caitlin Moore  Rating:               The manga of Thermae Romae is a critically-acclaimed award winner. The first anime adaptation was a low-budget short that developed a cult following for its quirky humor. The new series that just premiered on Netflix, Thermae Romae Novae, has a TV run's worth of full-length episodes, complete with attempts at pathos and backstory, and has the same director as the critically-panned Africa Salaryman. It is also boring.    For a series with a concept as weird as “Roman architect time travels through a portal in a bath for inspiration,” you really don't need to put a lot of effort into building up character motivation. Yet for some reason, they felt the need to give Lucius a reason to really love baths and a tragic childhood involving a dead father and bullies. Can't he just be a dude who loves soaking in hot water and designing new ways to do it? The first episode has no jokes and just feels long, drawn-out, and pointless.    Yet somehow, that's not the most baffling decision the anime staff made. You see, the people in togas and marble buildings with columns aren't enough to make us realize this shit all happened a long time ago. We couldn't possibly manage to figure that out on our own. The distant past was all sepia-toned, right? They didn't invent bright colors until the '50s! Everything up until then was muddy and dim. Unfortunately, the half-assed color design, along with the pen-and-ink style shading, makes it look like everything has been rubbed with dirt. In a series about bathing and cleanliness. It's silly.    Maybe Thermae Romae Novae picks up after this. I hear it has Kenjiro Tsuda yelling in Latin, so that's something.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                It's funny, Thermae Romae is so mainstream here in Japan that despite never having read a page of the manga nor having seen the live-action film, I already knew the basic setup through cultural osmosis alone—which is why watching this threw me for a bit of a loop. What I was expecting was a time-traveling Roman being awed by some facet of Japanese hot spring culture over and over again. And while that may be what the series turns into, this first episode was most certainly not.    Rather, this episode gives us the backstory for our series' protagonist Lucius, showing why he became a bathhouse architect and where his philosophy on bathing came from. But more than that, this episode is about how blue-collar workers find importance and pride in their daily toil. For a mason, it's knowing that their work will record the past and inspire the future. For Lucius' father and grandfather, it's about creating a place where people can be purged of stress and be ready to face a new day. In other words, they may be cogs in Roman society, but they know that they are vital to its functioning.    It makes for a solid setup to the series, even if it's ultimately not representative of the rest of the show. It's just a shame that the animation doesn't really hold up.

I like the story so far, but I felt like too much happened in the first two episodes, so I checked out the beginning of the source material, and it turns out the show has already covered 1 and a half manga volume. I guess it means they intend to adapt all 17 volumes in just two cours. Well, at least it means the show will have a definite ending.

The use of color and pattern is what's making me think it's deliberate.            If the terrible animation and painfully lackluster visuals in general are intentional, then it's all the worse, to be honest. If you look at the manga it has strong contrasts even on color illustrations, and all-around striking and dramatic visuals, in the good old dramatic shoujo manga way. Compared to that, the anime looks like it was made on a shoestring budget by someone who had no creative vision whatsoever, no ideas what to do with this adaptation other than adding some ""dark colors"" to the manga panels, because hey it's a dark story, and then slapping it on the screen. Which I think is actually the case.    If I had my way shoujo manga like this would never be adapted unless it was in the hands of someone who can prove they can re-create the drama and dynamics on screen.

I'm still hoping they slow down a bit once they're more into the Richard III storyline.           Honestly, I wouldn't hope for that. As someone who had been reading this manga from the day the first chapter was published in Princess, the Henry VI arc is the best part of it all, and I think the anime is doing it an unforgivable injustice. Without any spoilers I was really, really disappointed in the (frankly, unexpected) turn it did shortly after reaching Richard III territory.

I‘m not sure if I’ll stick around for the entire season. I’ll definitely read the manga at some point.    Yeah, I agree that there were some cool scenes in this episode.

It feels like the production team doesn't really want to work on this- I'm not seeing the passion in this project. Or maybe I'm just spoiled rotten after marathoning Mob Psycho 100.

Back to top                  AQuin1904    Joined: 13 Nov 2021 		    Posts: 22       Posted: Tue Jan 25, 2022 3:29 pm            The biggest surprise for me was realizing just how much Shakespeare there is in Rose King. York and Margaret, in particular have a lot of their speeches intact (although some of York's lines are shifted to Warwick to make him more of an instigator, and Margaret gets lines from several other Lancastrian commanders). Henry's shepherd and sundial lines in episode 1 comes from a later scene, while the insults Richard trades with Prince Edward come from the end of 2 Henry VI. Edward has a lot of lines paraphrased in episode 3 as well. I think it's particularly interesting how his interpretation of the sun omen is undercut because he now delivers it while using brotherly bonds as cover for his affair. It's hard not to read that as a comment on his priorities.   As far as the adaptation goes, I like a lot of the more painterly backgrounds and even some of the still shots. What really bother me is all the faceless people. The blank ""extras,"" especially the CGI ones, are distracting and take away the brief moments of humanizing common soldiers that you get in the manga's battle scenes. It's even less excusable how often named characters just don't have their facial features drawn, sometimes even while they speak. Also not a fan of the CGI banners. The color pallet works well for some things, but I worry how the dark tones will work for some later sequences from the manga. They also tend to make everything a little washed out, which is disappointing because the manga makes great use of harsh contrast.     Quote:    the Neville sisters' ages appear to have been reversed. In real life, Anne was the younger sister of Isabel, but here Isabel can be heard addressing Anne as if she were the elder sibling.           Iirc, their ages are mixed up in 3 Henry VI, although Anne is correctly identified as the younger sister in Richard III. I'm guessing Kanno decided to follow the earlier play, although she depicts the Plantagenet boys' ages more accurately than Shakespeare (apart from cutting out Edmund, who Shakespeare made the youngest, and their two sisters who survived to adulthood).

That's right, I forgot that one's on Shakespeare. I was disappointed that Kanno chose to cut the Plantagenet sisters in the manga; removing Edmund makes a bit more sense in terms of her portrayal of Richard as the unloved youngest child, but I feel like she could have done some interesting things with the sisters. Oh well, at least we get Jane Shore.

So I thought I'd watch the anime and see if it inspires me to keep buying, but... Sounds like the anime is not a great adaptation and not a good thing to base my decision off of.  I already felt the first volume was a bit rushed (I had a little trouble following it but then I'm not a history buff for this era nor a Shakespeare fan), but if the anime is rushing it even more, I can only imagine how hard it is for people to follow and get invested in the series.

I like the story so far, but I felt like too much happened in the first two episodes, so I checked out the beginning of the source material, and it turns out the show has already covered 1 and a half manga volume.

The use of color and pattern is what's making me think it's deliberate.            If the terrible animation and painfully lackluster visuals in general are intentional, then it's all the worse, to be honest. If you look at the manga it has strong contrasts even on color illustrations, and all-around striking and dramatic visuals, in the good old dramatic shoujo manga way. Compared to that, the anime looks like it was made on a shoestring budget by someone who had no creative vision whatsoever, no ideas what to do with this adaptation other than adding some ""dark colors"" to the manga panels, because hey it's a dark story, and then slapping it on the screen. Which I think is actually the case.    If I had my way shoujo manga like this would never be adapted unless it was in the hands of someone who can prove they can re-create the drama and dynamics on screen.

As someone who had been reading this manga from the day the first chapter was published in Princess, the Henry VI arc is the best part of it all, and I think the anime is doing it an unforgivable injustice. Without any spoilers I was really, really disappointed in the (frankly, unexpected) turn it did shortly after reaching Richard III territory.

York and Margaret, in particular have a lot of their speeches intact (although some of York's lines are shifted to Warwick to make him more of an instigator, and Margaret gets lines from several other Lancastrian commanders). Henry's shepherd and sundial lines in episode 1 comes from a later scene, while the insults Richard trades with Prince Edward come from the end of 2 Henry VI. Edward has a lot of lines paraphrased in episode 3 as well. I think it's particularly interesting how his interpretation of the sun omen is undercut because he now delivers it while using brotherly bonds as cover for his affair. It's hard not to read that as a comment on his priorities.   As far as the adaptation goes, I like a lot of the more painterly backgrounds and even some of the still shots. What really bother me is all the faceless people. The blank ""extras,"" especially the CGI ones, are distracting and take away the brief moments of humanizing common soldiers that you get in the manga's battle scenes. It's even less excusable how often named characters just don't have their facial features drawn, sometimes even while they speak. Also not a fan of the CGI banners. The color pallet works well for some things, but I worry how the dark tones will work for some later sequences from the manga. They also tend to make everything a little washed out, which is disappointing because the manga makes great use of harsh contrast.     Quote:    the Neville sisters' ages appear to have been reversed. In real life, Anne was the younger sister of Isabel, but here Isabel can be heard addressing Anne as if she were the elder sibling.           Iirc, their ages are mixed up in 3 Henry VI, although Anne is correctly identified as the younger sister in Richard III. I'm guessing Kanno decided to follow the earlier play, although she depicts the Plantagenet boys' ages more accurately than Shakespeare (apart from cutting out Edmund, who Shakespeare made the youngest, and their two sisters who survived to adulthood).

That's right, I forgot that one's on Shakespeare. I was disappointed that Kanno chose to cut the Plantagenet sisters in the manga; removing Edmund makes a bit more sense in terms of her portrayal of Richard as the unloved youngest child, but I feel like she could have done some interesting things with the sisters.

So I thought I'd watch the anime and see if it inspires me to keep buying, but... Sounds like the anime is not a great adaptation and not a good thing to base my decision off of.  I already felt the first volume was a bit rushed (I had a little trouble following it but then I'm not a history buff for this era nor a Shakespeare fan), but if the anime is rushing it even more, I can only imagine how hard it is for people to follow and get invested in the series.

I‘m not sure if I’ll stick around for the entire season. I’ll definitely read the manga at some point.    Yeah, I agree that there were some cool scenes in this episode. It’s a shame that the cool scenes can’t make up for everything else…      Back to top                  Blood-   Bargain Hunter   Joined: 07 Mar 2009 		    Posts: 21463       Posted: Tue Jan 25, 2022 1:18 pm            My biggest complaints so far are that the lead character is a tedious mope, the visual look is often quite dreamlike which has a distancing effect on my emotional engagement and the story is relentlessly joyless.

It feels like the production team doesn't really want to work on this- I'm not seeing the passion in this project. Or maybe I'm just spoiled rotten after marathoning Mob Psycho 100.

York and Margaret, in particular have a lot of their speeches intact (although some of York's lines are shifted to Warwick to make him more of an instigator, and Margaret gets lines from several other Lancastrian commanders). Henry's shepherd and sundial lines in episode 1 comes from a later scene, while the insults Richard trades with Prince Edward come from the end of 2 Henry VI. Edward has a lot of lines paraphrased in episode 3 as well. I think it's particularly interesting how his interpretation of the sun omen is undercut because he now delivers it while using brotherly bonds as cover for his affair. It's hard not to read that as a comment on his priorities.   As far as the adaptation goes, I like a lot of the more painterly backgrounds and even some of the still shots. What really bother me is all the faceless people. The blank ""extras,"" especially the CGI ones, are distracting and take away the brief moments of humanizing common soldiers that you get in the manga's battle scenes. It's even less excusable how often named characters just don't have their facial features drawn, sometimes even while they speak. Also not a fan of the CGI banners. The color pallet works well for some things, but I worry how the dark tones will work for some later sequences from the manga. They also tend to make everything a little washed out, which is disappointing because the manga makes great use of harsh contrast.     Quote:    the Neville sisters' ages appear to have been reversed. In real life, Anne was the younger sister of Isabel, but here Isabel can be heard addressing Anne as if she were the elder sibling.           Iirc, their ages are mixed up in 3 Henry VI, although Anne is correctly identified as the younger sister in Richard III. I'm guessing Kanno decided to follow the earlier play, although she depicts the Plantagenet boys' ages more accurately than Shakespeare (apart from cutting out Edmund, who Shakespeare made the youngest, and their two sisters who survived to adulthood).

That's right, I forgot that one's on Shakespeare. I was disappointed that Kanno chose to cut the Plantagenet sisters in the manga; removing Edmund makes a bit more sense in terms of her portrayal of Richard as the unloved youngest child, but I feel like she could have done some interesting things with the sisters. Oh well, at least we get Jane Shore.

So I thought I'd watch the anime and see if it inspires me to keep buying, but... Sounds like the anime is not a great adaptation and not a good thing to base my decision off of.

The nighttime programming block had fallen into the routine of airing The Room—a legendary 2003 independent film (which has been called “the Citizen Kane of bad movies”) spearheaded by cinematic Swiss army knife Tommy Wiseau. By midnight of April 1, 2012, nobody had any reason to believe that this year would be any different. The (excruciatingly long) opening credits sequence began, and for almost 30 whole seconds everything was the way it had been in the years before—until, that is, the movie faded to black for a moment, revealing that a dark blue robot was watching the movie. “Oh hi, Adult Swim,” the robot with Steve Blum's voice said, “I got the results of the test back. I definitely have April Fools.” The robot, as many anime fans instantly recognized, was TOM: the host of a beloved anime programming block called Toonami that aired on Cartoon Network between 1997 and 2008. A brief animation played after TOM made his quip, the Toonami logo appeared on-screen, and an episode of Bleach began to play. Without any warning, Toonami was airing on television for the first time in almost four years—and anime fans across the U.S. lost their collective mind.      To understand how this happened and why it was such a big deal, we first need to rewind back to the 2000s. Originally, the anime-and-action-cartoon programming block aired on weekday afternoons, but in 2004 it got moved to Saturday nights. It's hard to understate how massive a role Toonami played in anime's burst of popularity in the West throughout the 90s by shaping tastes and making anime more accessible in its heyday. Such was its success that within a few years, even Cartoon Network started airing some anime as well (the only anime it had ever aired before the debut of Toonami was Speed Racer). Furthermore, an adult-oriented nighttime programming block on the same channel called Adult Swim started up in 2001, and an anime called Cowboy Bebop was included in its original lineup. Over the years, both Cartoon Network and Adult Swim would continue to air more anime outside of Toonami (and in fact, Adult Swim even started its own anime-centric block called Adult Swim Action in 2002, which featured some anime that had previously aired on Toonami). But even then, Toonami still felt different. It had its own host (a robot named TOM, though he reincarnated a few times), its own lore, the occasional game review, and unlike Cartoon Network and Adult Swim, anime was a foremost part of Toonami's identity—it felt lovingly tailored specifically for anime fans in a way Cartoon Network and Adult Swim never would be. Dragon Ball Z, Sailor Moon, Naruto, and Gundam Wing are only a few of the anime that found massive success airing on Toonami, and dominated Western anime fan culture for several years.    But by 2008, Toonami had become a shadow of its former self. Once four-hours-long, it spent most of the year with its time cut in half and saturated with Naruto episodes—a far cry from the gateway to discovering a variety of new anime that it once was. The kids who grew up with Toonami's biggest hits like Dragon Ball Z and Sailor Moon were now older and looking for anime that felt a little more dark or mature. And while Toonami had the extremely popular Naruto, Adult Swim had the likes of InuYasha, Bleach, Fullmetal Alchemist, and Cowboy Bebop among plenty of other immensely successful anime that fit the bill—quality and quantity. While anime was never Adult Swim's primary focus, it had nonetheless become an anime powerhouse in its own right, and seemed to take over Toonami's status as the U.S.'s largest anime tastemaker in the mid and late 2000s. Factoring in the massive recession happening on top of all this, and the only thing shocking about Cartoon Network's announcing the cancellation of Toonami at Anime Weekend Atlanta 2008 (they cited declining viewership as the reason why) was how Toonami managed to last as long as it did. The final Toonami block would air the same evening the announcement was made: September 20, 2008.    Much to the disappointment of longtime fans, Toonami didn't go out with so much as a fizzle. Its time wasn't extended, it didn't re-run any of its classic hits—nothing was out of the ordinary. It was the same two-hour block it had been for some time, half of which was spent airing Naruto (the other half was an episode of Ben 10: Alien Force, followed by an episode of Samurai Jack). If not for a clip of TOM saying goodbye at the end, then that evening's block wouldn't have felt like an ending for anything—let alone a once-great programming block that managed to stay on the air for 11 years. While saddened by it, most fans discussing the announcement online seemed to be understanding of the decision, and accepted it pretty quickly. In Memoriam-style posts and content looking back fondly on Toonami's glory days and wondering where it all went wrong (when Toonami got moved to Saturday nights probably marked the beginning of the end, many agreed) seemed to outnumber petitions to undo the cancellation and outraged posts by a landslide. Thus quietly ended Toonami.      In the years following Toonami's cancellation, any lingering conversations about it amongst fans were usually less about bringing it back, and more about being nostalgic for its late 90s/early 2000s lineups. People missed Toonami, that much was clear, but they missed a certain type of Toonami. They missed the anime-centric block that was chock-loaded with a variety of iconic hits—not the glorified Naruto block it eventually became. But with Cartoon Network airing fewer and fewer anime, the idea that Toonami would ever come back seemed less likely than ever.    Enter fellow-programming block Adult Swim in the early months of 2012.    “Usually Adult Swim has a brainstorm about what we might do for April Fools Day on any given year, where everyone throws out ideas and we see what sticks,” recalled Toonami co-creator Jason DeMarco, “Mike Lazzo tossed out “what if we just brought Toonami back for a night, just switched over and it was suddenly like you were in 1999 and watching Cartoon Network?” Everyone loved the idea immediately, and the conversation very quickly moved on to “how the heck can we pull this off?””    Considering the dilapidated state of Toonami at the time of its cancellation, it comes as little shock that—per DeMarco—there hadn't been any meaningful conversations about getting it back on the air prior to this meeting. (“Previous to the April Fools conversation we had, I swear, never ONCE talked in any serious way about bringing Toonami back. We just didn't think it was possible.”) This idea to bring Toonami back for a night must've felt as sudden and out-of-the-blue as any idea possibly could've been—but this speed bump wasn't enough to stop the April Fools Toonami revival from happening.    With only a few months to plan everything, Adult Swim's work was cut out for them. “We made a list of what we thought were the definitive Toonami shows,” said DeMarco. “Then we strategized with Kim Manning, our head of programming, how best to approach distributors to see who might be willing to give us a one time license for, like, one episode of a show. We had no idea at all if any of them would work with us on such a weird request.”    Just like the original vision for this idea, the lineup Adult Swim ultimately ended up with was one that mostly felt like it could've pulled straight out of a schedule from 1999: Bleach, Dragon Ball Z, Gundam Wing, Tenchi Muyo!, Outlaw Star, The Big O, Yu-Yu Hakusho, Blue Submarine No. 6, Trigun, Astro Boy, and ending the night with Gigantor. Bleach was a particularly interesting addition to this lineup, not only because it was the only show that came out after 2000 (with the partial exceptions of The Big O and Blue Submarine No. 6, which began in late 90s but didn't finish til after the turn of the millennium), but also because it was the only show on the lineup that was an Adult Swim show, as opposed to a Toonami show. But it was, nonetheless, part of Toonami tonight. And even though Bleach wasn't traditional Toonami fare, TOM's appearance, Steve Blum's familiar voice, and the fact that any anime was airing at all was more than enough to signal to the viewers that at least for tonight, the Toonami people missed was back.     An image that started circulating at the time  As the night went on and viewers saw how increasingly nostalgic the lineup became, the reminiscent fans couldn't help but express their excitement on social media—which, importantly, also helped to rapidly spread the word that this was happening. Searching for tweets and posts with words like “Toonami” or “Dragon Ball Z” during the night of March 31-April 1, 2012 showcases the elated thoughts of countless anime fans, intent to watch Toonami until its final moments—whatever plans they had for the upcoming morning be damned. So abundant were the tweets about it that “Toonami” (and some adjacent words/phrases like “Outlaw Star”, “Gundam Wing”, etc) quickly became one of the top trending topics on Twitter that evening. Said DeMarco about the fan reactions, “It was incredible, one of the first experiences of my life where I really saw the power of social media to create a collective experience around a particular event as it unfolds. Seeing it blow up on Twitter and watching the mentions just grow, and keep growing, was amazing. All of us were texting each other that night as the event unfolded, and we all stayed up all night having a blast reading the reactions. Just a super great experience for all of us. We came in to work the following Monday still excited and talking about how amazing the response was.”    The outpouring of love from fans was so immense that while the idea of bringing Toonami back began as a joke, it suddenly no longer felt like one to Adult Swim by that next day back at work. Thus, they tweeted that fans could let them know how badly they wanted Toonami to return permanently with the hashtag #BringBackToonami. Not only did this tweet itself garner well over 10,000 retweets (and get the hashtag trending in a matter of hours), but several voice actors and prominent entities in the anime industry even made their own posts featuring the hashtag. Fan made videos, Facebook pages, and petitions dedicated to supporting the hashtag began to appear one after the other. Nerdcore rapper Richie Branson even made a rap about it (which would later be used in an Adult Swim bumper). If it wasn't already abundantly obvious (which it was), then it was now: Now that they knew what Toonami was capable of (once again) being, and that it could air on Adult Swim rather than Cartoon Network, people wanted Toonami back for real.    After a little over a month of cheers to bring back Toonami, Adult Swim finally announced on May 16 with the hashtag  #ToonamisBackBitches that it would be back on Adult Swim (presumably indefinitely) in just a few days, the late night between May 26 and 27. The lineup, it was soon announced after a few days of speculation, would be three hours long and would then repeat itself (meaning it would be on air for a total of 6 hours) and would mostly be anime that had previously aired on Adult Swim such as Bleach and Cowboy Bebop, but also the new-to-U.S.-TV titles Casshern Sins and Deadman Wonderland (shows like Naruto and Dragon Ball Z, DeMarco tweeted, were simply too expensive).    Following the announcement, exuberant forum threads, blog posts, tweets, and videos about the hashtag's success and Toonami's confirmed revival plastered the walls of every online anime community. Richie Branson even made another rap about it to celebrate. In many ways, this marriage of Toonami and Adult Swim felt like a fitting one–they were already both on the same channel, both aired in the evening/at night, and a lot of anime fans spent their younger years in a Toonami to Adult Swim pipeline anyways. This felt perfect.     Despite all the anticipation and fanfare that led up to it, whether or not the night between May 26 and 27 was more than just moderately successful for Toonami depends on who you ask. While its revival made plenty of headlines, many fans lost interest when they saw its mostly-recycled lineup (many were hoping for a higher concentration of shows that either hadn't previously aired in the U.S. or aired in the 90s) which was largely the result of time and money constraints.    “Basically the reaction to [the April Fools] event, combined with the responses to [the Adult Swim tweet about bringing back Toonami], allowed us to come to Lazzo with a request to bring it back for real,” recalled DeMarco, “Gill and I had a plan within a week and brought him a way to do it CHEAP and FAST. And thankfully he said yes. We set a target launch date, and started sprinted towards that date immediately.""    Nonetheless, when ratings came to light a few days later, while they seemed good to many (Deadman Wonderland, for example, ranked #1 in its time slot among adults age 18-24), DeMarco would describe the Toonami revival's inaugural weekend as having gone, “OKAY. Not bad but not measurably better than the week before. We need to do better. Hopefully we will!”    Encouraged by better ratings the following week, (“We're doing well! I'm encouraged.” DeMarco tweeted about it) Toonami marched on—its impact on anime, while not as large as it once was, still tangible. A few weeks prior to its airing on Adult Swim, Deadman Wonderland was on 59,860 user's lists on MyAnimeList. A month into Toonami's revival (June 26), it went up to appearing on 66,110 lists even though it had long since finished airing in Japan (April-July 2011). Casshern Sins—which originally aired in Japan between 2008 and 2009—went from being on 26,671 user's lists on May 4, 2012, to 28,852 on June 28, 2012. These numbers neither 100% definitively prove how many people continually tuned in to this new Toonami, nor are they even particularly earth-shattering, but they do help to further illustrate the influence Toonami was having in the early days of its revival.    Despite the perilous times Adult Swim, like a lot of broadcast television, is currently trying to navigate, Toonami has remained a fixture of Adult Swim in the ten years since its revival began. It's since aired the wildly popular likes of My Hero Academia, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, One-Punch Man, The Promised Neverland, among plenty of other such anime. While it's less of the trendsetter it once was and more of a trend reaffirmer, it still feels much more like the generation-shaping Toonami people knew and loved in the 90s/early 2000s again (as opposed to the zombified state it was in throughout 2008). And Steve Blum, by the way, is still voicing TOM. Adult Swim has also since become more involved in anime than ever by way of producing a few projects (including, but not limited to, the recently announced Housing Complex C and two new seasons of FLCL).    2022 is a unique year for Toonami, as it gets to celebrate not only the 25th anniversary of its original airing, but also the 10th anniversary of its revival. “It's just amazing to me that this is the tenth year of the Adult Swim iteration of Toonami. It's very rare that a person gets to have a second chance at creative work once it's been cancelled or wrapped up by the rights holders,” reflected DeMarco, “It's something that in our case, only happened with the unique combination of fan love and network freedom that Toonami and Adult Swim have. It's been an amazing experience for all of us at Toonami, and one that never ceases to give us joy. We just hope we are giving that joy back.”    Below is the full interview that I had with DeMarco about how Toonami got brought back from the grave:    On April 1, 2012, Toonami once again aired as an April Fools Day joke, despite its 2008 cancellation. How involved were you in the process of making this happen?   Very much so. I believe it was actually Mike Lazzo's idea in one of our brainstorming meetings we had about April Fools. He brought it up as a lark, and Gill Austin and I immediately walked out of that meeting beginning to try to figure out how to pull it off with no time and no money.    What made you (and/or Adult Swim) want to bring Toonami back after its 2008 cancellation?   Well those of us who had worked on Toonami had made our peace with its cancellation. But when we were offered a small chance to bring it back we knew we had to try. It had become clear to us in the years after it was cancelled in 2008 that there were people who WANTED it back.    How (and when) did plans to bring Toonami back start?   I believe it was two and a half months before April Fools Day 2012. Usually Adult Swim has a brainstorm about what we might do for April Fools Day on any given year, where everyone throws out ideas and we see what sticks. Mike Lazzo tossed out “what if we just brought Toonami back for a night, just switched over and it was suddenly like you were in 1999 and watching Cartoon Network?” Everyone loved the idea immediately, and the conversation very quickly moved on to “how the heck can we pull this off?”    Was the plan always to bring it back via an April Fools Day joke? If not, how did that happen?   Previous to the April Fools conversation we had, I swear, never ONCE talked in any serious way about bringing Toonami back. We just didn't think it was possible.    How did the shows that aired for this get picked?   We made a list of what we thought were the definitive Toonami shows. Then we strategized with Kim Manning, our head of programming, how best to approach distributors to see who might be willing to give us a one time license for, like, one episode of a show. We had no idea at all if any of them would work with us on such a weird request.    How was the reception to the April Fools Day joke? Any particularly memorable reactions?   It was incredible, one of the first experiences of my life where I really saw the power of social media to create a collective experience around a particular event as it unfolds. Seeing it blow up on Twitter and watching the mentions just grow, and keep growing, was amazing. All of us were texting each other that night as the event unfolded, and we all stayed up all night having a blast reading the reactions. Just a super great experience for all of us. We came in to work the following Monday still excited and talking about how amazing the response was.    The call from fans to bring back Toonami after this April Fools Day joke was pretty much immediate, and the next day Adult Swim tweeted, ""Want it back? Let us know. #BringBackToonami""--did all this directly contribute to Toonami's full revival a few months later?   Very much so. Basically the reaction to the event, combined with the responses to that Tweet, allowed us to come to Lazzo with a request to bring it back for real. Gill and I had a plan within a week and brought him a way to do it CHEAP and FAST. And thankfully he said yes. We set a target launch date, and started sprinted towards that date immediately.    10 years later, and Adult Swim is more involved in anime production than ever, such as through 2 new seasons of FLCL, Housing Complex C, and Uzumaki. How important has the revival of Toonami been to all this?   It's interesting. Obviously, anime and action have been a part of Adult Swim's DNA since the network's beginning. And even without Toonami returning, it's highly likely that Adult Swim would still be airing anime. Whether or not they would air AS MUCH anime or action, and move into original productions… I don't know. I'm gonna say that would be unlikely without a weekly Toonami block.    Any other thoughts/reflections/fun facts about Toonami's 2012 April Fools Day joke?   Refection-wise, it's just amazing to me that this is the tenth year of the Adult Swim iteration of Toonami. It's very rare that a person gets to have a second chance at creative work once it's been cancelled or wrapped up by the rights holders. It's something that in our case,  only happened with the unique combination of fan love and network freedom that Toonami and Adult Swim have. It's been an amazing experience for all of us at Toonami, and one that never ceases to give us joy. We just hope we are giving that joy back.     discuss this in the forum (7 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Feature homepage / archives      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4, 'https://ew.com/article/2008/12/12/crazy-cult-room/': 1, 'https://twitter.com/adultswim/status/187004036824834049': 1, 'https://twitter.com/blumspew/status/188501360331857921': 1, 'https://twitter.com/LauraBaileyVO/status/191621438317404160': 1, 'https://twitter.com/VoiceOfOBrien/status/187017191344963585': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/funimation/posts/adult-swim-just-asked-on-twitter-tonight-adultswim-want-it-back-let-us-know-brin/378737742158052/': 1, 'https://twitter.com/WeAreAKon/status/187337710481047552': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlbbLFgiVQk': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNEsz347UBU': 1, 'https://twitter.com/adultswim/status/202866436597743616': 1, 'https://twitter.com/Clarknova1/status/204614840298385410': 1, 'https://twitter.com/Clarknova1/status/207971067497676800': 1, 'https://twitter.com/Clarknova1/status/212721465743781888': 1, 'https://web.archive.org/web/20120512015148/https://myanimelist.net/anime/6880/Deadman_Wonderland': 1, 'https://web.archive.org/web/20120626184052/https://myanimelist.net/anime/6880/Deadman_Wonderland': 1, 'https://web.archive.org/web/20120504115441/https://myanimelist.net/anime/4981/Casshern_Sins': 1, 'https://web.archive.org/web/20120628163229/https://myanimelist.net/anime/4981/Casshern_Sins': 1}"

The nighttime programming block had fallen into the routine of airing The Room—a legendary 2003 independent film (which has been called “the Citizen Kane of bad movies”) spearheaded by cinematic Swiss army knife Tommy Wiseau. By midnight of April 1, 2012, nobody had any reason to believe that this year would be any different. The (excruciatingly long) opening credits sequence began, and for almost 30 whole seconds everything was the way it had been in the years before—until, that is, the movie faded to black for a moment, revealing that a dark blue robot was watching the movie. “Oh hi, Adult Swim,” the robot with Steve Blum's voice said, “I got the results of the test back. I definitely have April Fools.” The robot, as many anime fans instantly recognized, was TOM: the host of a beloved anime programming block called Toonami that aired on Cartoon Network between 1997 and 2008. A brief animation played after TOM made his quip, the Toonami logo appeared on-screen, and an episode of Bleach began to play. Without any warning, Toonami was airing on television for the first time in almost four years—and anime fans across the U.S. lost their collective mind.      To understand how this happened and why it was such a big deal, we first need to rewind back to the 2000s. Originally, the anime-and-action-cartoon programming block aired on weekday afternoons, but in 2004 it got moved to Saturday nights. It's hard to understate how massive a role Toonami played in anime's burst of popularity in the West throughout the 90s by shaping tastes and making anime more accessible in its heyday. Such was its success that within a few years, even Cartoon Network started airing some anime as well (the only anime it had ever aired before the debut of Toonami was Speed Racer). Furthermore, an adult-oriented nighttime programming block on the same channel called Adult Swim started up in 2001, and an anime called Cowboy Bebop was included in its original lineup. Over the years, both Cartoon Network and Adult Swim would continue to air more anime outside of Toonami (and in fact, Adult Swim even started its own anime-centric block called Adult Swim Action in 2002, which featured some anime that had previously aired on Toonami). But even then, Toonami still felt different. It had its own host (a robot named TOM, though he reincarnated a few times), its own lore, the occasional game review, and unlike Cartoon Network and Adult Swim, anime was a foremost part of Toonami's identity—it felt lovingly tailored specifically for anime fans in a way Cartoon Network and Adult Swim never would be. Dragon Ball Z, Sailor Moon, Naruto, and Gundam Wing are only a few of the anime that found massive success airing on Toonami, and dominated Western anime fan culture for several years.    But by 2008, Toonami had become a shadow of its former self. Once four-hours-long, it spent most of the year with its time cut in half and saturated with Naruto episodes—a far cry from the gateway to discovering a variety of new anime that it once was. The kids who grew up with Toonami's biggest hits like Dragon Ball Z and Sailor Moon were now older and looking for anime that felt a little more dark or mature. And while Toonami had the extremely popular Naruto, Adult Swim had the likes of InuYasha, Bleach, Fullmetal Alchemist, and Cowboy Bebop among plenty of other immensely successful anime that fit the bill—quality and quantity. While anime was never Adult Swim's primary focus, it had nonetheless become an anime powerhouse in its own right, and seemed to take over Toonami's status as the U.S.'s largest anime tastemaker in the mid and late 2000s. Factoring in the massive recession happening on top of all this, and the only thing shocking about Cartoon Network's announcing the cancellation of Toonami at Anime Weekend Atlanta 2008 (they cited declining viewership as the reason why) was how Toonami managed to last as long as it did. The final Toonami block would air the same evening the announcement was made: September 20, 2008.    Much to the disappointment of longtime fans, Toonami didn't go out with so much as a fizzle. Its time wasn't extended, it didn't re-run any of its classic hits—nothing was out of the ordinary. It was the same two-hour block it had been for some time, half of which was spent airing Naruto (the other half was an episode of Ben 10: Alien Force, followed by an episode of Samurai Jack). If not for a clip of TOM saying goodbye at the end, then that evening's block wouldn't have felt like an ending for anything—let alone a once-great programming block that managed to stay on the air for 11 years. While saddened by it, most fans discussing the announcement online seemed to be understanding of the decision, and accepted it pretty quickly. In Memoriam-style posts and content looking back fondly on Toonami's glory days and wondering where it all went wrong (when Toonami got moved to Saturday nights probably marked the beginning of the end, many agreed) seemed to outnumber petitions to undo the cancellation and outraged posts by a landslide. Thus quietly ended Toonami.      In the years following Toonami's cancellation, any lingering conversations about it amongst fans were usually less about bringing it back, and more about being nostalgic for its late 90s/early 2000s lineups. People missed Toonami, that much was clear, but they missed a certain type of Toonami. They missed the anime-centric block that was chock-loaded with a variety of iconic hits—not the glorified Naruto block it eventually became. But with Cartoon Network airing fewer and fewer anime, the idea that Toonami would ever come back seemed less likely than ever.    Enter fellow-programming block Adult Swim in the early months of 2012.    “Usually Adult Swim has a brainstorm about what we might do for April Fools Day on any given year, where everyone throws out ideas and we see what sticks,” recalled Toonami co-creator Jason DeMarco, “Mike Lazzo tossed out “what if we just brought Toonami back for a night, just switched over and it was suddenly like you were in 1999 and watching Cartoon Network?” Everyone loved the idea immediately, and the conversation very quickly moved on to “how the heck can we pull this off?””    Considering the dilapidated state of Toonami at the time of its cancellation, it comes as little shock that—per DeMarco—there hadn't been any meaningful conversations about getting it back on the air prior to this meeting. (“Previous to the April Fools conversation we had, I swear, never ONCE talked in any serious way about bringing Toonami back.

Bleach was a particularly interesting addition to this lineup, not only because it was the only show that came out after 2000 (with the partial exceptions of The Big O and Blue Submarine No. 6, which began in late 90s but didn't finish til after the turn of the millennium), but also because it was the only show on the lineup that was an Adult Swim show, as opposed to a Toonami show.

Adult Swim has also since become more involved in anime than ever by way of producing a few projects (including, but not limited to, the recently announced Housing Complex C and two new seasons of FLCL).    2022 is a unique year for Toonami, as it gets to celebrate not only the 25th anniversary of its original airing, but also the 10th anniversary of its revival. “It's just amazing to me that this is the tenth year of the Adult Swim iteration of Toonami. It's very rare that a person gets to have a second chance at creative work once it's been cancelled or wrapped up by the rights holders,” reflected DeMarco, “It's something that in our case, only happened with the unique combination of fan love and network freedom that Toonami and Adult Swim have. It's been an amazing experience for all of us at Toonami, and one that never ceases to give us joy. We just hope we are giving that joy back.”    Below is the full interview that I had with DeMarco about how Toonami got brought back from the grave:    On April 1, 2012, Toonami once again aired as an April Fools Day joke, despite its 2008 cancellation. How involved were you in the process of making this happen?   Very much so. I believe it was actually Mike Lazzo's idea in one of our brainstorming meetings we had about April Fools. He brought it up as a lark, and Gill Austin and I immediately walked out of that meeting beginning to try to figure out how to pull it off with no time and no money.    What made you (and/or Adult Swim) want to bring Toonami back after its 2008 cancellation?   Well those of us who had worked on Toonami had made our peace with its cancellation. But when we were offered a small chance to bring it back we knew we had to try. It had become clear to us in the years after it was cancelled in 2008 that there were people who WANTED it back.    How (and when) did plans to bring Toonami back start?   I believe it was two and a half months before April Fools Day 2012. Usually Adult Swim has a brainstorm about what we might do for April Fools Day on any given year, where everyone throws out ideas and we see what sticks. Mike Lazzo tossed out “what if we just brought Toonami back for a night, just switched over and it was suddenly like you were in 1999 and watching Cartoon Network?” Everyone loved the idea immediately, and the conversation very quickly moved on to “how the heck can we pull this off?”    Was the plan always to bring it back via an April Fools Day joke? If not, how did that happen?   Previous to the April Fools conversation we had, I swear, never ONCE talked in any serious way about bringing Toonami back. We just didn't think it was possible.    How did the shows that aired for this get picked?   We made a list of what we thought were the definitive Toonami shows. Then we strategized with Kim Manning, our head of programming, how best to approach distributors to see who might be willing to give us a one time license for, like, one episode of a show. We had no idea at all if any of them would work with us on such a weird request.    How was the reception to the April Fools Day joke? Any particularly memorable reactions?   It was incredible, one of the first experiences of my life where I really saw the power of social media to create a collective experience around a particular event as it unfolds. Seeing it blow up on Twitter and watching the mentions just grow, and keep growing, was amazing. All of us were texting each other that night as the event unfolded, and we all stayed up all night having a blast reading the reactions. Just a super great experience for all of us. We came in to work the following Monday still excited and talking about how amazing the response was.    The call from fans to bring back Toonami after this April Fools Day joke was pretty much immediate, and the next day Adult Swim tweeted, ""Want it back? Let us know. #BringBackToonami""--did all this directly contribute to Toonami's full revival a few months later?   Very much so. Basically the reaction to the event, combined with the responses to that Tweet, allowed us to come to Lazzo with a request to bring it back for real. Gill and I had a plan within a week and brought him a way to do it CHEAP and FAST. And thankfully he said yes. We set a target launch date, and started sprinted towards that date immediately.    10 years later, and Adult Swim is more involved in anime production than ever, such as through 2 new seasons of FLCL, Housing Complex C, and Uzumaki. How important has the revival of Toonami been to all this?   It's interesting. Obviously, anime and action have been a part of Adult Swim's DNA since the network's beginning. And even without Toonami returning, it's highly likely that Adult Swim would still be airing anime. Whether or not they would air AS MUCH anime or action, and move into original productions… I don't know. I'm gonna say that would be unlikely without a weekly Toonami block.    Any other thoughts/reflections/fun facts about Toonami's 2012 April Fools Day joke?   Refection-wise, it's just amazing to me that this is the tenth year of the Adult Swim iteration of Toonami. It's very rare that a person gets to have a second chance at creative work once it's been cancelled or wrapped up by the rights holders. It's something that in our case,  only happened with the unique combination of fan love and network freedom that Toonami and Adult Swim have. It's been an amazing experience for all of us at Toonami, and one that never ceases to give us joy. We just hope we are giving that joy back.     discuss this in the forum (7 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Feature homepage / archives     ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4, 'https://ew.com/article/2008/12/12/crazy-cult-room/': 1, 'https://twitter.com/adultswim/status/187004036824834049': 1, 'https://twitter.com/blumspew/status/188501360331857921': 1, 'https://twitter.com/LauraBaileyVO/status/191621438317404160': 1, 'https://twitter.com/VoiceOfOBrien/status/187017191344963585': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/funimation/posts/adult-swim-just-asked-on-twitter-tonight-adultswim-want-it-back-let-us-know-brin/378737742158052/': 1, 'https://twitter.com/WeAreAKon/status/187337710481047552': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlbbLFgiVQk': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNEsz347UBU': 1, 'https://twitter.com/adultswim/status/202866436597743616': 1, 'https://twitter.com/Clarknova1/status/204614840298385410': 1, 'https://twitter.com/Clarknova1/status/207971067497676800': 1, 'https://twitter.com/Clarknova1/status/212721465743781888': 1, 'https://web.archive.org/web/20120512015148/https://myanimelist.net/anime/6880/Deadman_Wonderland': 1, 'https://web.archive.org/web/20120626184052/https://myanimelist.net/anime/6880/Deadman_Wonderland': 1, 'https://web.archive.org/web/20120504115441/https://myanimelist.net/anime/4981/Casshern_Sins': 1, 'https://web.archive.org/web/20120628163229/https://myanimelist.net/anime/4981/Casshern_Sins': 1}"
14-04-2022,animation,1,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2022-04-01/how-an-april-fools-day-joke-revived-toonami/.184015,How an April Fools Day Joke Revived Toonami - Anime News Network:SEA,"        By 2012, April Fools Day on Adult Swim had become a fun, albeit predictable, event. The nighttime programming block had fallen into the routine of airing The Room—a legendary 2003 independent film (which has been called “the Citizen Kane of bad movies”) spearheaded by cinematic Swiss army knife Tommy Wiseau. By midnight of April 1, 2012, nobody had any reason to believe that this year would be any different. The (excruciatingly long) opening credits sequence began, and for almost 30 whole seconds everything was the way it had been in the years before—until, that is, the movie faded to black for a moment, revealing that a dark blue robot was watching the movie. “Oh hi, Adult Swim,” the robot with Steve Blum's voice said, “I got the results of the test back. I definitely have April Fools.” The robot, as many anime fans instantly recognized, was TOM: the host of a beloved anime programming block called Toonami that aired on Cartoon Network between 1997 and 2008. A brief animation played after TOM made his quip, the Toonami logo appeared on-screen, and an episode of Bleach began to play. Without any warning, Toonami was airing on television for the first time in almost four years—and anime fans across the U.S. lost their collective mind.      To understand how this happened and why it was such a big deal, we first need to rewind back to the 2000s. Originally, the anime-and-action-cartoon programming block aired on weekday afternoons, but in 2004 it got moved to Saturday nights. It's hard to understate how massive a role Toonami played in anime's burst of popularity in the West throughout the 90s by shaping tastes and making anime more accessible in its heyday. Such was its success that within a few years, even Cartoon Network started airing some anime as well (the only anime it had ever aired before the debut of Toonami was Speed Racer). Furthermore, an adult-oriented nighttime programming block on the same channel called Adult Swim started up in 2001, and an anime called Cowboy Bebop was included in its original lineup. Over the years, both Cartoon Network and Adult Swim would continue to air more anime outside of Toonami (and in fact, Adult Swim even started its own anime-centric block called Adult Swim Action in 2002, which featured some anime that had previously aired on Toonami). But even then, Toonami still felt different. It had its own host (a robot named TOM, though he reincarnated a few times), its own lore, the occasional game review, and unlike Cartoon Network and Adult Swim, anime was a foremost part of Toonami's identity—it felt lovingly tailored specifically for anime fans in a way Cartoon Network and Adult Swim never would be. Dragon Ball Z, Sailor Moon, Naruto, and Gundam Wing are only a few of the anime that found massive success airing on Toonami, and dominated Western anime fan culture for several years.    But by 2008, Toonami had become a shadow of its former self. Once four-hours-long, it spent most of the year with its time cut in half and saturated with Naruto episodes—a far cry from the gateway to discovering a variety of new anime that it once was. The kids who grew up with Toonami's biggest hits like Dragon Ball Z and Sailor Moon were now older and looking for anime that felt a little more dark or mature. And while Toonami had the extremely popular Naruto, Adult Swim had the likes of InuYasha, Bleach, Fullmetal Alchemist, and Cowboy Bebop among plenty of other immensely successful anime that fit the bill—quality and quantity. While anime was never Adult Swim's primary focus, it had nonetheless become an anime powerhouse in its own right, and seemed to take over Toonami's status as the U.S.'s largest anime tastemaker in the mid and late 2000s. Factoring in the massive recession happening on top of all this, and the only thing shocking about Cartoon Network's announcing the cancellation of Toonami at Anime Weekend Atlanta 2008 (they cited declining viewership as the reason why) was how Toonami managed to last as long as it did. The final Toonami block would air the same evening the announcement was made: September 20, 2008.    Much to the disappointment of longtime fans, Toonami didn't go out with so much as a fizzle. Its time wasn't extended, it didn't re-run any of its classic hits—nothing was out of the ordinary. It was the same two-hour block it had been for some time, half of which was spent airing Naruto (the other half was an episode of Ben 10: Alien Force, followed by an episode of Samurai Jack). If not for a clip of TOM saying goodbye at the end, then that evening's block wouldn't have felt like an ending for anything—let alone a once-great programming block that managed to stay on the air for 11 years. While saddened by it, most fans discussing the announcement online seemed to be understanding of the decision, and accepted it pretty quickly. In Memoriam-style posts and content looking back fondly on Toonami's glory days and wondering where it all went wrong (when Toonami got moved to Saturday nights probably marked the beginning of the end, many agreed) seemed to outnumber petitions to undo the cancellation and outraged posts by a landslide. Thus quietly ended Toonami.      In the years following Toonami's cancellation, any lingering conversations about it amongst fans were usually less about bringing it back, and more about being nostalgic for its late 90s/early 2000s lineups. People missed Toonami, that much was clear, but they missed a certain type of Toonami. They missed the anime-centric block that was chock-loaded with a variety of iconic hits—not the glorified Naruto block it eventually became. But with Cartoon Network airing fewer and fewer anime, the idea that Toonami would ever come back seemed less likely than ever.    Enter fellow-programming block Adult Swim in the early months of 2012.    “Usually Adult Swim has a brainstorm about what we might do for April Fools Day on any given year, where everyone throws out ideas and we see what sticks,” recalled Toonami co-creator Jason DeMarco, “Mike Lazzo tossed out “what if we just brought Toonami back for a night, just switched over and it was suddenly like you were in 1999 and watching Cartoon Network?” Everyone loved the idea immediately, and the conversation very quickly moved on to “how the heck can we pull this off?””    Considering the dilapidated state of Toonami at the time of its cancellation, it comes as little shock that—per DeMarco—there hadn't been any meaningful conversations about getting it back on the air prior to this meeting. (“Previous to the April Fools conversation we had, I swear, never ONCE talked in any serious way about bringing Toonami back. We just didn't think it was possible.”) This idea to bring Toonami back for a night must've felt as sudden and out-of-the-blue as any idea possibly could've been—but this speed bump wasn't enough to stop the April Fools Toonami revival from happening.    With only a few months to plan everything, Adult Swim's work was cut out for them. “We made a list of what we thought were the definitive Toonami shows,” said DeMarco. “Then we strategized with Kim Manning, our head of programming, how best to approach distributors to see who might be willing to give us a one time license for, like, one episode of a show. We had no idea at all if any of them would work with us on such a weird request.”    Just like the original vision for this idea, the lineup Adult Swim ultimately ended up with was one that mostly felt like it could've pulled straight out of a schedule from 1999: Bleach, Dragon Ball Z, Gundam Wing, Tenchi Muyo!, Outlaw Star, The Big O, Yu-Yu Hakusho, Blue Submarine No. 6, Trigun, Astro Boy, and ending the night with Gigantor. Bleach was a particularly interesting addition to this lineup, not only because it was the only show that came out after 2000 (with the partial exceptions of The Big O and Blue Submarine No. 6, which began in late 90s but didn't finish til after the turn of the millennium), but also because it was the only show on the lineup that was an Adult Swim show, as opposed to a Toonami show. But it was, nonetheless, part of Toonami tonight. And even though Bleach wasn't traditional Toonami fare, TOM's appearance, Steve Blum's familiar voice, and the fact that any anime was airing at all was more than enough to signal to the viewers that at least for tonight, the Toonami people missed was back.     An image that started circulating at the time  As the night went on and viewers saw how increasingly nostalgic the lineup became, the reminiscent fans couldn't help but express their excitement on social media—which, importantly, also helped to rapidly spread the word that this was happening. Searching for tweets and posts with words like “Toonami” or “Dragon Ball Z” during the night of March 31-April 1, 2012 showcases the elated thoughts of countless anime fans, intent to watch Toonami until its final moments—whatever plans they had for the upcoming morning be damned. So abundant were the tweets about it that “Toonami” (and some adjacent words/phrases like “Outlaw Star”, “Gundam Wing”, etc) quickly became one of the top trending topics on Twitter that evening. Said DeMarco about the fan reactions, “It was incredible, one of the first experiences of my life where I really saw the power of social media to create a collective experience around a particular event as it unfolds. Seeing it blow up on Twitter and watching the mentions just grow, and keep growing, was amazing. All of us were texting each other that night as the event unfolded, and we all stayed up all night having a blast reading the reactions. Just a super great experience for all of us. We came in to work the following Monday still excited and talking about how amazing the response was.”    The outpouring of love from fans was so immense that while the idea of bringing Toonami back began as a joke, it suddenly no longer felt like one to Adult Swim by that next day back at work. Thus, they tweeted that fans could let them know how badly they wanted Toonami to return permanently with the hashtag #BringBackToonami. Not only did this tweet itself garner well over 10,000 retweets (and get the hashtag trending in a matter of hours), but several voice actors and prominent entities in the anime industry even made their own posts featuring the hashtag. Fan made videos, Facebook pages, and petitions dedicated to supporting the hashtag began to appear one after the other. Nerdcore rapper Richie Branson even made a rap about it (which would later be used in an Adult Swim bumper). If it wasn't already abundantly obvious (which it was), then it was now: Now that they knew what Toonami was capable of (once again) being, and that it could air on Adult Swim rather than Cartoon Network, people wanted Toonami back for real.    After a little over a month of cheers to bring back Toonami, Adult Swim finally announced on May 16 with the hashtag  #ToonamisBackBitches that it would be back on Adult Swim (presumably indefinitely) in just a few days, the late night between May 26 and 27. The lineup, it was soon announced after a few days of speculation, would be three hours long and would then repeat itself (meaning it would be on air for a total of 6 hours) and would mostly be anime that had previously aired on Adult Swim such as Bleach and Cowboy Bebop, but also the new-to-U.S.-TV titles Casshern Sins and Deadman Wonderland (shows like Naruto and Dragon Ball Z, DeMarco tweeted, were simply too expensive).    Following the announcement, exuberant forum threads, blog posts, tweets, and videos about the hashtag's success and Toonami's confirmed revival plastered the walls of every online anime community. Richie Branson even made another rap about it to celebrate. In many ways, this marriage of Toonami and Adult Swim felt like a fitting one–they were already both on the same channel, both aired in the evening/at night, and a lot of anime fans spent their younger years in a Toonami to Adult Swim pipeline anyways. This felt perfect.     Despite all the anticipation and fanfare that led up to it, whether or not the night between May 26 and 27 was more than just moderately successful for Toonami depends on who you ask. While its revival made plenty of headlines, many fans lost interest when they saw its mostly-recycled lineup (many were hoping for a higher concentration of shows that either hadn't previously aired in the U.S. or aired in the 90s) which was largely the result of time and money constraints.    “Basically the reaction to [the April Fools] event, combined with the responses to [the Adult Swim tweet about bringing back Toonami], allowed us to come to Lazzo with a request to bring it back for real,” recalled DeMarco, “Gill and I had a plan within a week and brought him a way to do it CHEAP and FAST. And thankfully he said yes. We set a target launch date, and started sprinted towards that date immediately.""    Nonetheless, when ratings came to light a few days later, while they seemed good to many (Deadman Wonderland, for example, ranked #1 in its time slot among adults age 18-24), DeMarco would describe the Toonami revival's inaugural weekend as having gone, “OKAY. Not bad but not measurably better than the week before. We need to do better. Hopefully we will!”    Encouraged by better ratings the following week, (“We're doing well! I'm encouraged.” DeMarco tweeted about it) Toonami marched on—its impact on anime, while not as large as it once was, still tangible. A few weeks prior to its airing on Adult Swim, Deadman Wonderland was on 59,860 user's lists on MyAnimeList. A month into Toonami's revival (June 26), it went up to appearing on 66,110 lists even though it had long since finished airing in Japan (April-July 2011). Casshern Sins—which originally aired in Japan between 2008 and 2009—went from being on 26,671 user's lists on May 4, 2012, to 28,852 on June 28, 2012. These numbers neither 100% definitively prove how many people continually tuned in to this new Toonami, nor are they even particularly earth-shattering, but they do help to further illustrate the influence Toonami was having in the early days of its revival.    Despite the perilous times Adult Swim, like a lot of broadcast television, is currently trying to navigate, Toonami has remained a fixture of Adult Swim in the ten years since its revival began. It's since aired the wildly popular likes of My Hero Academia, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, One-Punch Man, The Promised Neverland, among plenty of other such anime. While it's less of the trendsetter it once was and more of a trend reaffirmer, it still feels much more like the generation-shaping Toonami people knew and loved in the 90s/early 2000s again (as opposed to the zombified state it was in throughout 2008). And Steve Blum, by the way, is still voicing TOM. Adult Swim has also since become more involved in anime than ever by way of producing a few projects (including, but not limited to, the recently announced Housing Complex C and two new seasons of FLCL).    2022 is a unique year for Toonami, as it gets to celebrate not only the 25th anniversary of its original airing, but also the 10th anniversary of its revival. “It's just amazing to me that this is the tenth year of the Adult Swim iteration of Toonami. It's very rare that a person gets to have a second chance at creative work once it's been cancelled or wrapped up by the rights holders,” reflected DeMarco, “It's something that in our case, only happened with the unique combination of fan love and network freedom that Toonami and Adult Swim have. It's been an amazing experience for all of us at Toonami, and one that never ceases to give us joy. We just hope we are giving that joy back.”    Below is the full interview that I had with DeMarco about how Toonami got brought back from the grave:    On April 1, 2012, Toonami once again aired as an April Fools Day joke, despite its 2008 cancellation.

The nighttime programming block had fallen into the routine of airing The Room—a legendary 2003 independent film (which has been called “the Citizen Kane of bad movies”) spearheaded by cinematic Swiss army knife Tommy Wiseau. By midnight of April 1, 2012, nobody had any reason to believe that this year would be any different. The (excruciatingly long) opening credits sequence began, and for almost 30 whole seconds everything was the way it had been in the years before—until, that is, the movie faded to black for a moment, revealing that a dark blue robot was watching the movie. “Oh hi, Adult Swim,” the robot with Steve Blum's voice said, “I got the results of the test back. I definitely have April Fools.” The robot, as many anime fans instantly recognized, was TOM: the host of a beloved anime programming block called Toonami that aired on Cartoon Network between 1997 and 2008. A brief animation played after TOM made his quip, the Toonami logo appeared on-screen, and an episode of Bleach began to play. Without any warning, Toonami was airing on television for the first time in almost four years—and anime fans across the U.S. lost their collective mind.      To understand how this happened and why it was such a big deal, we first need to rewind back to the 2000s. Originally, the anime-and-action-cartoon programming block aired on weekday afternoons, but in 2004 it got moved to Saturday nights. It's hard to understate how massive a role Toonami played in anime's burst of popularity in the West throughout the 90s by shaping tastes and making anime more accessible in its heyday. Such was its success that within a few years, even Cartoon Network started airing some anime as well (the only anime it had ever aired before the debut of Toonami was Speed Racer). Furthermore, an adult-oriented nighttime programming block on the same channel called Adult Swim started up in 2001, and an anime called Cowboy Bebop was included in its original lineup. Over the years, both Cartoon Network and Adult Swim would continue to air more anime outside of Toonami (and in fact, Adult Swim even started its own anime-centric block called Adult Swim Action in 2002, which featured some anime that had previously aired on Toonami). But even then, Toonami still felt different. It had its own host (a robot named TOM, though he reincarnated a few times), its own lore, the occasional game review, and unlike Cartoon Network and Adult Swim, anime was a foremost part of Toonami's identity—it felt lovingly tailored specifically for anime fans in a way Cartoon Network and Adult Swim never would be. Dragon Ball Z, Sailor Moon, Naruto, and Gundam Wing are only a few of the anime that found massive success airing on Toonami, and dominated Western anime fan culture for several years.    But by 2008, Toonami had become a shadow of its former self. Once four-hours-long, it spent most of the year with its time cut in half and saturated with Naruto episodes—a far cry from the gateway to discovering a variety of new anime that it once was. The kids who grew up with Toonami's biggest hits like Dragon Ball Z and Sailor Moon were now older and looking for anime that felt a little more dark or mature. And while Toonami had the extremely popular Naruto, Adult Swim had the likes of InuYasha, Bleach, Fullmetal Alchemist, and Cowboy Bebop among plenty of other immensely successful anime that fit the bill—quality and quantity. While anime was never Adult Swim's primary focus, it had nonetheless become an anime powerhouse in its own right, and seemed to take over Toonami's status as the U.S.'s largest anime tastemaker in the mid and late 2000s. Factoring in the massive recession happening on top of all this, and the only thing shocking about Cartoon Network's announcing the cancellation of Toonami at Anime Weekend Atlanta 2008 (they cited declining viewership as the reason why) was how Toonami managed to last as long as it did. The final Toonami block would air the same evening the announcement was made: September 20, 2008.    Much to the disappointment of longtime fans, Toonami didn't go out with so much as a fizzle. Its time wasn't extended, it didn't re-run any of its classic hits—nothing was out of the ordinary. It was the same two-hour block it had been for some time, half of which was spent airing Naruto (the other half was an episode of Ben 10: Alien Force, followed by an episode of Samurai Jack). If not for a clip of TOM saying goodbye at the end, then that evening's block wouldn't have felt like an ending for anything—let alone a once-great programming block that managed to stay on the air for 11 years. While saddened by it, most fans discussing the announcement online seemed to be understanding of the decision, and accepted it pretty quickly. In Memoriam-style posts and content looking back fondly on Toonami's glory days and wondering where it all went wrong (when Toonami got moved to Saturday nights probably marked the beginning of the end, many agreed) seemed to outnumber petitions to undo the cancellation and outraged posts by a landslide. Thus quietly ended Toonami.      In the years following Toonami's cancellation, any lingering conversations about it amongst fans were usually less about bringing it back, and more about being nostalgic for its late 90s/early 2000s lineups. People missed Toonami, that much was clear, but they missed a certain type of Toonami. They missed the anime-centric block that was chock-loaded with a variety of iconic hits—not the glorified Naruto block it eventually became. But with Cartoon Network airing fewer and fewer anime, the idea that Toonami would ever come back seemed less likely than ever.    Enter fellow-programming block Adult Swim in the early months of 2012.    “Usually Adult Swim has a brainstorm about what we might do for April Fools Day on any given year, where everyone throws out ideas and we see what sticks,” recalled Toonami co-creator Jason DeMarco, “Mike Lazzo tossed out “what if we just brought Toonami back for a night, just switched over and it was suddenly like you were in 1999 and watching Cartoon Network?” Everyone loved the idea immediately, and the conversation very quickly moved on to “how the heck can we pull this off?””    Considering the dilapidated state of Toonami at the time of its cancellation, it comes as little shock that—per DeMarco—there hadn't been any meaningful conversations about getting it back on the air prior to this meeting. (“Previous to the April Fools conversation we had, I swear, never ONCE talked in any serious way about bringing Toonami back. We just didn't think it was possible.”) This idea to bring Toonami back for a night must've felt as sudden and out-of-the-blue as any idea possibly could've been—but this speed bump wasn't enough to stop the April Fools Toonami revival from happening.    With only a few months to plan everything, Adult Swim's work was cut out for them. “We made a list of what we thought were the definitive Toonami shows,” said DeMarco. “Then we strategized with Kim Manning, our head of programming, how best to approach distributors to see who might be willing to give us a one time license for, like, one episode of a show. We had no idea at all if any of them would work with us on such a weird request.”    Just like the original vision for this idea, the lineup Adult Swim ultimately ended up with was one that mostly felt like it could've pulled straight out of a schedule from 1999: Bleach, Dragon Ball Z, Gundam Wing, Tenchi Muyo!, Outlaw Star, The Big O, Yu-Yu Hakusho, Blue Submarine No. 6, Trigun, Astro Boy, and ending the night with Gigantor. Bleach was a particularly interesting addition to this lineup, not only because it was the only show that came out after 2000 (with the partial exceptions of The Big O and Blue Submarine No. 6, which began in late 90s but didn't finish til after the turn of the millennium), but also because it was the only show on the lineup that was an Adult Swim show, as opposed to a Toonami show. But it was, nonetheless, part of Toonami tonight. And even though Bleach wasn't traditional Toonami fare, TOM's appearance, Steve Blum's familiar voice, and the fact that any anime was airing at all was more than enough to signal to the viewers that at least for tonight, the Toonami people missed was back.     An image that started circulating at the time  As the night went on and viewers saw how increasingly nostalgic the lineup became, the reminiscent fans couldn't help but express their excitement on social media—which, importantly, also helped to rapidly spread the word that this was happening. Searching for tweets and posts with words like “Toonami” or “Dragon Ball Z” during the night of March 31-April 1, 2012 showcases the elated thoughts of countless anime fans, intent to watch Toonami until its final moments—whatever plans they had for the upcoming morning be damned. So abundant were the tweets about it that “Toonami” (and some adjacent words/phrases like “Outlaw Star”, “Gundam Wing”, etc) quickly became one of the top trending topics on Twitter that evening. Said DeMarco about the fan reactions, “It was incredible, one of the first experiences of my life where I really saw the power of social media to create a collective experience around a particular event as it unfolds. Seeing it blow up on Twitter and watching the mentions just grow, and keep growing, was amazing. All of us were texting each other that night as the event unfolded, and we all stayed up all night having a blast reading the reactions. Just a super great experience for all of us. We came in to work the following Monday still excited and talking about how amazing the response was.”    The outpouring of love from fans was so immense that while the idea of bringing Toonami back began as a joke, it suddenly no longer felt like one to Adult Swim by that next day back at work. Thus, they tweeted that fans could let them know how badly they wanted Toonami to return permanently with the hashtag #BringBackToonami. Not only did this tweet itself garner well over 10,000 retweets (and get the hashtag trending in a matter of hours), but several voice actors and prominent entities in the anime industry even made their own posts featuring the hashtag. Fan made videos, Facebook pages, and petitions dedicated to supporting the hashtag began to appear one after the other. Nerdcore rapper Richie Branson even made a rap about it (which would later be used in an Adult Swim bumper). If it wasn't already abundantly obvious (which it was), then it was now: Now that they knew what Toonami was capable of (once again) being, and that it could air on Adult Swim rather than Cartoon Network, people wanted Toonami back for real.    After a little over a month of cheers to bring back Toonami, Adult Swim finally announced on May 16 with the hashtag  #ToonamisBackBitches that it would be back on Adult Swim (presumably indefinitely) in just a few days, the late night between May 26 and 27. The lineup, it was soon announced after a few days of speculation, would be three hours long and would then repeat itself (meaning it would be on air for a total of 6 hours) and would mostly be anime that had previously aired on Adult Swim such as Bleach and Cowboy Bebop, but also the new-to-U.S.-TV titles Casshern Sins and Deadman Wonderland (shows like Naruto and Dragon Ball Z, DeMarco tweeted, were simply too expensive).    Following the announcement, exuberant forum threads, blog posts, tweets, and videos about the hashtag's success and Toonami's confirmed revival plastered the walls of every online anime community. Richie Branson even made another rap about it to celebrate. In many ways, this marriage of Toonami and Adult Swim felt like a fitting one–they were already both on the same channel, both aired in the evening/at night, and a lot of anime fans spent their younger years in a Toonami to Adult Swim pipeline anyways. This felt perfect.     Despite all the anticipation and fanfare that led up to it, whether or not the night between May 26 and 27 was more than just moderately successful for Toonami depends on who you ask. While its revival made plenty of headlines, many fans lost interest when they saw its mostly-recycled lineup (many were hoping for a higher concentration of shows that either hadn't previously aired in the U.S. or aired in the 90s) which was largely the result of time and money constraints.    “Basically the reaction to [the April Fools] event, combined with the responses to [the Adult Swim tweet about bringing back Toonami], allowed us to come to Lazzo with a request to bring it back for real,” recalled DeMarco, “Gill and I had a plan within a week and brought him a way to do it CHEAP and FAST. And thankfully he said yes. We set a target launch date, and started sprinted towards that date immediately.""    Nonetheless, when ratings came to light a few days later, while they seemed good to many (Deadman Wonderland, for example, ranked #1 in its time slot among adults age 18-24), DeMarco would describe the Toonami revival's inaugural weekend as having gone, “OKAY. Not bad but not measurably better than the week before. We need to do better. Hopefully we will!”    Encouraged by better ratings the following week, (“We're doing well! I'm encouraged.” DeMarco tweeted about it) Toonami marched on—its impact on anime, while not as large as it once was, still tangible. A few weeks prior to its airing on Adult Swim, Deadman Wonderland was on 59,860 user's lists on MyAnimeList. A month into Toonami's revival (June 26), it went up to appearing on 66,110 lists even though it had long since finished airing in Japan (April-July 2011). Casshern Sins—which originally aired in Japan between 2008 and 2009—went from being on 26,671 user's lists on May 4, 2012, to 28,852 on June 28, 2012. These numbers neither 100% definitively prove how many people continually tuned in to this new Toonami, nor are they even particularly earth-shattering, but they do help to further illustrate the influence Toonami was having in the early days of its revival.    Despite the perilous times Adult Swim, like a lot of broadcast television, is currently trying to navigate, Toonami has remained a fixture of Adult Swim in the ten years since its revival began. It's since aired the wildly popular likes of My Hero Academia, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, One-Punch Man, The Promised Neverland, among plenty of other such anime. While it's less of the trendsetter it once was and more of a trend reaffirmer, it still feels much more like the generation-shaping Toonami people knew and loved in the 90s/early 2000s again (as opposed to the zombified state it was in throughout 2008). And Steve Blum, by the way, is still voicing TOM. Adult Swim has also since become more involved in anime than ever by way of producing a few projects (including, but not limited to, the recently announced Housing Complex C and two new seasons of FLCL).    2022 is a unique year for Toonami, as it gets to celebrate not only the 25th anniversary of its original airing, but also the 10th anniversary of its revival. “It's just amazing to me that this is the tenth year of the Adult Swim iteration of Toonami. It's very rare that a person gets to have a second chance at creative work once it's been cancelled or wrapped up by the rights holders,” reflected DeMarco, “It's something that in our case, only happened with the unique combination of fan love and network freedom that Toonami and Adult Swim have. It's been an amazing experience for all of us at Toonami, and one that never ceases to give us joy. We just hope we are giving that joy back.”    Below is the full interview that I had with DeMarco about how Toonami got brought back from the grave:    On April 1, 2012, Toonami once again aired as an April Fools Day joke, despite its 2008 cancellation. How involved were you in the process of making this happen?   Very much so. I believe it was actually Mike Lazzo's idea in one of our brainstorming meetings we had about April Fools. He brought it up as a lark, and Gill Austin and I immediately walked out of that meeting beginning to try to figure out how to pull it off with no time and no money.    What made you (and/or Adult Swim) want to bring Toonami back after its 2008 cancellation?   Well those of us who had worked on Toonami had made our peace with its cancellation. But when we were offered a small chance to bring it back we knew we had to try. It had become clear to us in the years after it was cancelled in 2008 that there were people who WANTED it back.    How (and when) did plans to bring Toonami back start?   I believe it was two and a half months before April Fools Day 2012. Usually Adult Swim has a brainstorm about what we might do for April Fools Day on any given year, where everyone throws out ideas and we see what sticks. Mike Lazzo tossed out “what if we just brought Toonami back for a night, just switched over and it was suddenly like you were in 1999 and watching Cartoon Network?” Everyone loved the idea immediately, and the conversation very quickly moved on to “how the heck can we pull this off?”    Was the plan always to bring it back via an April Fools Day joke? If not, how did that happen?   Previous to the April Fools conversation we had, I swear, never ONCE talked in any serious way about bringing Toonami back. We just didn't think it was possible.    How did the shows that aired for this get picked?   We made a list of what we thought were the definitive Toonami shows. Then we strategized with Kim Manning, our head of programming, how best to approach distributors to see who might be willing to give us a one time license for, like, one episode of a show. We had no idea at all if any of them would work with us on such a weird request.    How was the reception to the April Fools Day joke? Any particularly memorable reactions?   It was incredible, one of the first experiences of my life where I really saw the power of social media to create a collective experience around a particular event as it unfolds. Seeing it blow up on Twitter and watching the mentions just grow, and keep growing, was amazing. All of us were texting each other that night as the event unfolded, and we all stayed up all night having a blast reading the reactions. Just a super great experience for all of us. We came in to work the following Monday still excited and talking about how amazing the response was.    The call from fans to bring back Toonami after this April Fools Day joke was pretty much immediate, and the next day Adult Swim tweeted, ""Want it back? Let us know. #BringBackToonami""--did all this directly contribute to Toonami's full revival a few months later?   Very much so. Basically the reaction to the event, combined with the responses to that Tweet, allowed us to come to Lazzo with a request to bring it back for real. Gill and I had a plan within a week and brought him a way to do it CHEAP and FAST. And thankfully he said yes. We set a target launch date, and started sprinted towards that date immediately.    10 years later, and Adult Swim is more involved in anime production than ever, such as through 2 new seasons of FLCL, Housing Complex C, and Uzumaki. How important has the revival of Toonami been to all this?   It's interesting. Obviously, anime and action have been a part of Adult Swim's DNA since the network's beginning. And even without Toonami returning, it's highly likely that Adult Swim would still be airing anime. Whether or not they would air AS MUCH anime or action, and move into original productions… I don't know. I'm gonna say that would be unlikely without a weekly Toonami block.    Any other thoughts/reflections/fun facts about Toonami's 2012 April Fools Day joke?   Refection-wise, it's just amazing to me that this is the tenth year of the Adult Swim iteration of Toonami. It's very rare that a person gets to have a second chance at creative work once it's been cancelled or wrapped up by the rights holders. It's something that in our case,  only happened with the unique combination of fan love and network freedom that Toonami and Adult Swim have. It's been an amazing experience for all of us at Toonami, and one that never ceases to give us joy. We just hope we are giving that joy back.     discuss this in the forum (7 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Feature homepage / archives   ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4, 'https://ew.com/article/2008/12/12/crazy-cult-room/': 1, 'https://twitter.com/adultswim/status/187004036824834049': 1, 'https://twitter.com/blumspew/status/188501360331857921': 1, 'https://twitter.com/LauraBaileyVO/status/191621438317404160': 1, 'https://twitter.com/VoiceOfOBrien/status/187017191344963585': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/funimation/posts/adult-swim-just-asked-on-twitter-tonight-adultswim-want-it-back-let-us-know-brin/378737742158052/': 1, 'https://twitter.com/WeAreAKon/status/187337710481047552': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlbbLFgiVQk': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNEsz347UBU': 1, 'https://twitter.com/adultswim/status/202866436597743616': 1, 'https://twitter.com/Clarknova1/status/204614840298385410': 1, 'https://twitter.com/Clarknova1/status/207971067497676800': 1, 'https://twitter.com/Clarknova1/status/212721465743781888': 1, 'https://web.archive.org/web/20120512015148/https://myanimelist.net/anime/6880/Deadman_Wonderland': 1, 'https://web.archive.org/web/20120626184052/https://myanimelist.net/anime/6880/Deadman_Wonderland': 1, 'https://web.archive.org/web/20120504115441/https://myanimelist.net/anime/4981/Casshern_Sins': 1, 'https://web.archive.org/web/20120628163229/https://myanimelist.net/anime/4981/Casshern_Sins': 1}"

Enter fellow-programming block Adult Swim in the early months of 2012.    “Usually Adult Swim has a brainstorm about what we might do for April Fools Day on any given year, where everyone throws out ideas and we see what sticks,” recalled Toonami co-creator Jason DeMarco, “Mike Lazzo tossed out “what if we just brought Toonami back for a night, just switched over and it was suddenly like you were in 1999 and watching Cartoon Network?” Everyone loved the idea immediately, and the conversation very quickly moved on to “how the heck can we pull this off?””    Considering the dilapidated state of Toonami at the time of its cancellation, it comes as little shock that—per DeMarco—there hadn't been any meaningful conversations about getting it back on the air prior to this meeting. (“Previous to the April Fools conversation we had, I swear, never ONCE talked in any serious way about bringing Toonami back. We just didn't think it was possible.”) This idea to bring Toonami back for a night must've felt as sudden and out-of-the-blue as any idea possibly could've been—but this speed bump wasn't enough to stop the April Fools Toonami revival from happening.    With only a few months to plan everything, Adult Swim's work was cut out for them. “We made a list of what we thought were the definitive Toonami shows,” said DeMarco. “Then we strategized with Kim Manning, our head of programming, how best to approach distributors to see who might be willing to give us a one time license for, like, one episode of a show. We had no idea at all if any of them would work with us on such a weird request.”    Just like the original vision for this idea, the lineup Adult Swim ultimately ended up with was one that mostly felt like it could've pulled straight out of a schedule from 1999: Bleach, Dragon Ball Z, Gundam Wing, Tenchi Muyo!, Outlaw Star, The Big O, Yu-Yu Hakusho, Blue Submarine No. 6, Trigun, Astro Boy, and ending the night with Gigantor. Bleach was a particularly interesting addition to this lineup, not only because it was the only show that came out after 2000 (with the partial exceptions of The Big O and Blue Submarine No. 6, which began in late 90s but didn't finish til after the turn of the millennium), but also because it was the only show on the lineup that was an Adult Swim show, as opposed to a Toonami show. But it was, nonetheless, part of Toonami tonight. And even though Bleach wasn't traditional Toonami fare, TOM's appearance, Steve Blum's familiar voice, and the fact that any anime was airing at all was more than enough to signal to the viewers that at least for tonight, the Toonami people missed was back.     An image that started circulating at the time  As the night went on and viewers saw how increasingly nostalgic the lineup became, the reminiscent fans couldn't help but express their excitement on social media—which, importantly, also helped to rapidly spread the word that this was happening. Searching for tweets and posts with words like “Toonami” or “Dragon Ball Z” during the night of March 31-April 1, 2012 showcases the elated thoughts of countless anime fans, intent to watch Toonami until its final moments—whatever plans they had for the upcoming morning be damned. So abundant were the tweets about it that “Toonami” (and some adjacent words/phrases like “Outlaw Star”, “Gundam Wing”, etc) quickly became one of the top trending topics on Twitter that evening. Said DeMarco about the fan reactions, “It was incredible, one of the first experiences of my life where I really saw the power of social media to create a collective experience around a particular event as it unfolds. Seeing it blow up on Twitter and watching the mentions just grow, and keep growing, was amazing. All of us were texting each other that night as the event unfolded, and we all stayed up all night having a blast reading the reactions. Just a super great experience for all of us. We came in to work the following Monday still excited and talking about how amazing the response was.”    The outpouring of love from fans was so immense that while the idea of bringing Toonami back began as a joke, it suddenly no longer felt like one to Adult Swim by that next day back at work. Thus, they tweeted that fans could let them know how badly they wanted Toonami to return permanently with the hashtag #BringBackToonami. Not only did this tweet itself garner well over 10,000 retweets (and get the hashtag trending in a matter of hours), but several voice actors and prominent entities in the anime industry even made their own posts featuring the hashtag. Fan made videos, Facebook pages, and petitions dedicated to supporting the hashtag began to appear one after the other. Nerdcore rapper Richie Branson even made a rap about it (which would later be used in an Adult Swim bumper). If it wasn't already abundantly obvious (which it was), then it was now: Now that they knew what Toonami was capable of (once again) being, and that it could air on Adult Swim rather than Cartoon Network, people wanted Toonami back for real.    After a little over a month of cheers to bring back Toonami, Adult Swim finally announced on May 16 with the hashtag  #ToonamisBackBitches that it would be back on Adult Swim (presumably indefinitely) in just a few days, the late night between May 26 and 27. The lineup, it was soon announced after a few days of speculation, would be three hours long and would then repeat itself (meaning it would be on air for a total of 6 hours) and would mostly be anime that had previously aired on Adult Swim such as Bleach and Cowboy Bebop, but also the new-to-U.S.-TV titles Casshern Sins and Deadman Wonderland (shows like Naruto and Dragon Ball Z, DeMarco tweeted, were simply too expensive).    Following the announcement, exuberant forum threads, blog posts, tweets, and videos about the hashtag's success and Toonami's confirmed revival plastered the walls of every online anime community. Richie Branson even made another rap about it to celebrate. In many ways, this marriage of Toonami and Adult Swim felt like a fitting one–they were already both on the same channel, both aired in the evening/at night, and a lot of anime fans spent their younger years in a Toonami to Adult Swim pipeline anyways. This felt perfect.     Despite all the anticipation and fanfare that led up to it, whether or not the night between May 26 and 27 was more than just moderately successful for Toonami depends on who you ask. While its revival made plenty of headlines, many fans lost interest when they saw its mostly-recycled lineup (many were hoping for a higher concentration of shows that either hadn't previously aired in the U.S. or aired in the 90s) which was largely the result of time and money constraints.    “Basically the reaction to [the April Fools] event, combined with the responses to [the Adult Swim tweet about bringing back Toonami], allowed us to come to Lazzo with a request to bring it back for real,” recalled DeMarco, “Gill and I had a plan within a week and brought him a way to do it CHEAP and FAST. And thankfully he said yes. We set a target launch date, and started sprinted towards that date immediately.""    Nonetheless, when ratings came to light a few days later, while they seemed good to many (Deadman Wonderland, for example, ranked #1 in its time slot among adults age 18-24), DeMarco would describe the Toonami revival's inaugural weekend as having gone, “OKAY. Not bad but not measurably better than the week before. We need to do better. Hopefully we will!”    Encouraged by better ratings the following week, (“We're doing well! I'm encouraged.” DeMarco tweeted about it) Toonami marched on—its impact on anime, while not as large as it once was, still tangible. A few weeks prior to its airing on Adult Swim, Deadman Wonderland was on 59,860 user's lists on MyAnimeList. A month into Toonami's revival (June 26), it went up to appearing on 66,110 lists even though it had long since finished airing in Japan (April-July 2011). Casshern Sins—which originally aired in Japan between 2008 and 2009—went from being on 26,671 user's lists on May 4, 2012, to 28,852 on June 28, 2012. These numbers neither 100% definitively prove how many people continually tuned in to this new Toonami, nor are they even particularly earth-shattering, but they do help to further illustrate the influence Toonami was having in the early days of its revival.    Despite the perilous times Adult Swim, like a lot of broadcast television, is currently trying to navigate, Toonami has remained a fixture of Adult Swim in the ten years since its revival began. It's since aired the wildly popular likes of My Hero Academia, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, One-Punch Man, The Promised Neverland, among plenty of other such anime. While it's less of the trendsetter it once was and more of a trend reaffirmer, it still feels much more like the generation-shaping Toonami people knew and loved in the 90s/early 2000s again (as opposed to the zombified state it was in throughout 2008). And Steve Blum, by the way, is still voicing TOM. Adult Swim has also since become more involved in anime than ever by way of producing a few projects (including, but not limited to, the recently announced Housing Complex C and two new seasons of FLCL).    2022 is a unique year for Toonami, as it gets to celebrate not only the 25th anniversary of its original airing, but also the 10th anniversary of its revival. “It's just amazing to me that this is the tenth year of the Adult Swim iteration of Toonami. It's very rare that a person gets to have a second chance at creative work once it's been cancelled or wrapped up by the rights holders,” reflected DeMarco, “It's something that in our case, only happened with the unique combination of fan love and network freedom that Toonami and Adult Swim have. It's been an amazing experience for all of us at Toonami, and one that never ceases to give us joy. We just hope we are giving that joy back.”    Below is the full interview that I had with DeMarco about how Toonami got brought back from the grave:    On April 1, 2012, Toonami once again aired as an April Fools Day joke, despite its 2008 cancellation. How involved were you in the process of making this happen?   Very much so. I believe it was actually Mike Lazzo's idea in one of our brainstorming meetings we had about April Fools. He brought it up as a lark, and Gill Austin and I immediately walked out of that meeting beginning to try to figure out how to pull it off with no time and no money.    What made you (and/or Adult Swim) want to bring Toonami back after its 2008 cancellation?   Well those of us who had worked on Toonami had made our peace with its cancellation. But when we were offered a small chance to bring it back we knew we had to try. It had become clear to us in the years after it was cancelled in 2008 that there were people who WANTED it back.    How (and when) did plans to bring Toonami back start?   I believe it was two and a half months before April Fools Day 2012. Usually Adult Swim has a brainstorm about what we might do for April Fools Day on any given year, where everyone throws out ideas and we see what sticks. Mike Lazzo tossed out “what if we just brought Toonami back for a night, just switched over and it was suddenly like you were in 1999 and watching Cartoon Network?” Everyone loved the idea immediately, and the conversation very quickly moved on to “how the heck can we pull this off?”    Was the plan always to bring it back via an April Fools Day joke? If not, how did that happen?   Previous to the April Fools conversation we had, I swear, never ONCE talked in any serious way about bringing Toonami back. We just didn't think it was possible.    How did the shows that aired for this get picked?   We made a list of what we thought were the definitive Toonami shows. Then we strategized with Kim Manning, our head of programming, how best to approach distributors to see who might be willing to give us a one time license for, like, one episode of a show. We had no idea at all if any of them would work with us on such a weird request.    How was the reception to the April Fools Day joke? Any particularly memorable reactions?   It was incredible, one of the first experiences of my life where I really saw the power of social media to create a collective experience around a particular event as it unfolds. Seeing it blow up on Twitter and watching the mentions just grow, and keep growing, was amazing. All of us were texting each other that night as the event unfolded, and we all stayed up all night having a blast reading the reactions. Just a super great experience for all of us. We came in to work the following Monday still excited and talking about how amazing the response was.    The call from fans to bring back Toonami after this April Fools Day joke was pretty much immediate, and the next day Adult Swim tweeted, ""Want it back? Let us know. #BringBackToonami""--did all this directly contribute to Toonami's full revival a few months later?   Very much so. Basically the reaction to the event, combined with the responses to that Tweet, allowed us to come to Lazzo with a request to bring it back for real. Gill and I had a plan within a week and brought him a way to do it CHEAP and FAST. And thankfully he said yes. We set a target launch date, and started sprinted towards that date immediately.    10 years later, and Adult Swim is more involved in anime production than ever, such as through 2 new seasons of FLCL, Housing Complex C, and Uzumaki. How important has the revival of Toonami been to all this?   It's interesting. Obviously, anime and action have been a part of Adult Swim's DNA since the network's beginning. And even without Toonami returning, it's highly likely that Adult Swim would still be airing anime. Whether or not they would air AS MUCH anime or action, and move into original productions… I don't know. I'm gonna say that would be unlikely without a weekly Toonami block.    Any other thoughts/reflections/fun facts about Toonami's 2012 April Fools Day joke?   Refection-wise, it's just amazing to me that this is the tenth year of the Adult Swim iteration of Toonami. It's very rare that a person gets to have a second chance at creative work once it's been cancelled or wrapped up by the rights holders. It's something that in our case,  only happened with the unique combination of fan love and network freedom that Toonami and Adult Swim have. It's been an amazing experience for all of us at Toonami, and one that never ceases to give us joy. We just hope we are giving that joy back.

14-04-2022,animation,1,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2022-04-01/how-an-april-fools-day-joke-revived-toonami/.184015,How an April Fools Day Joke Revived Toonami - Anime News Network:SEA,"   By 2012, April Fools Day on Adult Swim had become a fun, albeit predictable, event. The nighttime programming block had fallen into the routine of airing The Room—a legendary 2003 independent film (which has been called “the Citizen Kane of bad movies”) spearheaded by cinematic Swiss army knife Tommy Wiseau. By midnight of April 1, 2012, nobody had any reason to believe that this year would be any different. The (excruciatingly long) opening credits sequence began, and for almost 30 whole seconds everything was the way it had been in the years before—until, that is, the movie faded to black for a moment, revealing that a dark blue robot was watching the movie. “Oh hi, Adult Swim,” the robot with Steve Blum's voice said, “I got the results of the test back. I definitely have April Fools.” The robot, as many anime fans instantly recognized, was TOM: the host of a beloved anime programming block called Toonami that aired on Cartoon Network between 1997 and 2008. A brief animation played after TOM made his quip, the Toonami logo appeared on-screen, and an episode of Bleach began to play. Without any warning, Toonami was airing on television for the first time in almost four years—and anime fans across the U.S. lost their collective mind.      To understand how this happened and why it was such a big deal, we first need to rewind back to the 2000s. Originally, the anime-and-action-cartoon programming block aired on weekday afternoons, but in 2004 it got moved to Saturday nights. It's hard to understate how massive a role Toonami played in anime's burst of popularity in the West throughout the 90s by shaping tastes and making anime more accessible in its heyday. Such was its success that within a few years, even Cartoon Network started airing some anime as well (the only anime it had ever aired before the debut of Toonami was Speed Racer). Furthermore, an adult-oriented nighttime programming block on the same channel called Adult Swim started up in 2001, and an anime called Cowboy Bebop was included in its original lineup. Over the years, both Cartoon Network and Adult Swim would continue to air more anime outside of Toonami (and in fact, Adult Swim even started its own anime-centric block called Adult Swim Action in 2002, which featured some anime that had previously aired on Toonami). But even then, Toonami still felt different. It had its own host (a robot named TOM, though he reincarnated a few times), its own lore, the occasional game review, and unlike Cartoon Network and Adult Swim, anime was a foremost part of Toonami's identity—it felt lovingly tailored specifically for anime fans in a way Cartoon Network and Adult Swim never would be. Dragon Ball Z, Sailor Moon, Naruto, and Gundam Wing are only a few of the anime that found massive success airing on Toonami, and dominated Western anime fan culture for several years.    But by 2008, Toonami had become a shadow of its former self. Once four-hours-long, it spent most of the year with its time cut in half and saturated with Naruto episodes—a far cry from the gateway to discovering a variety of new anime that it once was. The kids who grew up with Toonami's biggest hits like Dragon Ball Z and Sailor Moon were now older and looking for anime that felt a little more dark or mature. And while Toonami had the extremely popular Naruto, Adult Swim had the likes of InuYasha, Bleach, Fullmetal Alchemist, and Cowboy Bebop among plenty of other immensely successful anime that fit the bill—quality and quantity. While anime was never Adult Swim's primary focus, it had nonetheless become an anime powerhouse in its own right, and seemed to take over Toonami's status as the U.S.'s largest anime tastemaker in the mid and late 2000s. Factoring in the massive recession happening on top of all this, and the only thing shocking about Cartoon Network's announcing the cancellation of Toonami at Anime Weekend Atlanta 2008 (they cited declining viewership as the reason why) was how Toonami managed to last as long as it did. The final Toonami block would air the same evening the announcement was made: September 20, 2008.    Much to the disappointment of longtime fans, Toonami didn't go out with so much as a fizzle. Its time wasn't extended, it didn't re-run any of its classic hits—nothing was out of the ordinary. It was the same two-hour block it had been for some time, half of which was spent airing Naruto (the other half was an episode of Ben 10: Alien Force, followed by an episode of Samurai Jack). If not for a clip of TOM saying goodbye at the end, then that evening's block wouldn't have felt like an ending for anything—let alone a once-great programming block that managed to stay on the air for 11 years. While saddened by it, most fans discussing the announcement online seemed to be understanding of the decision, and accepted it pretty quickly. In Memoriam-style posts and content looking back fondly on Toonami's glory days and wondering where it all went wrong (when Toonami got moved to Saturday nights probably marked the beginning of the end, many agreed) seemed to outnumber petitions to undo the cancellation and outraged posts by a landslide. Thus quietly ended Toonami.      In the years following Toonami's cancellation, any lingering conversations about it amongst fans were usually less about bringing it back, and more about being nostalgic for its late 90s/early 2000s lineups. People missed Toonami, that much was clear, but they missed a certain type of Toonami. They missed the anime-centric block that was chock-loaded with a variety of iconic hits—not the glorified Naruto block it eventually became. But with Cartoon Network airing fewer and fewer anime, the idea that Toonami would ever come back seemed less likely than ever.    Enter fellow-programming block Adult Swim in the early months of 2012.    “Usually Adult Swim has a brainstorm about what we might do for April Fools Day on any given year, where everyone throws out ideas and we see what sticks,” recalled Toonami co-creator Jason DeMarco, “Mike Lazzo tossed out “what if we just brought Toonami back for a night, just switched over and it was suddenly like you were in 1999 and watching Cartoon Network?” Everyone loved the idea immediately, and the conversation very quickly moved on to “how the heck can we pull this off?””    Considering the dilapidated state of Toonami at the time of its cancellation, it comes as little shock that—per DeMarco—there hadn't been any meaningful conversations about getting it back on the air prior to this meeting. (“Previous to the April Fools conversation we had, I swear, never ONCE talked in any serious way about bringing Toonami back. We just didn't think it was possible.”) This idea to bring Toonami back for a night must've felt as sudden and out-of-the-blue as any idea possibly could've been—but this speed bump wasn't enough to stop the April Fools Toonami revival from happening.    With only a few months to plan everything, Adult Swim's work was cut out for them. “We made a list of what we thought were the definitive Toonami shows,” said DeMarco. “Then we strategized with Kim Manning, our head of programming, how best to approach distributors to see who might be willing to give us a one time license for, like, one episode of a show.

Bleach was a particularly interesting addition to this lineup, not only because it was the only show that came out after 2000 (with the partial exceptions of The Big O and Blue Submarine No. 6, which began in late 90s but didn't finish til after the turn of the millennium), but also because it was the only show on the lineup that was an Adult Swim show, as opposed to a Toonami show.

It's very rare that a person gets to have a second chance at creative work once it's been cancelled or wrapped up by the rights holders,” reflected DeMarco, “It's something that in our case, only happened with the unique combination of fan love and network freedom that Toonami and Adult Swim have. It's been an amazing experience for all of us at Toonami, and one that never ceases to give us joy. We just hope we are giving that joy back.”    Below is the full interview that I had with DeMarco about how Toonami got brought back from the grave:    On April 1, 2012, Toonami once again aired as an April Fools Day joke, despite its 2008 cancellation. How involved were you in the process of making this happen?   Very much so. I believe it was actually Mike Lazzo's idea in one of our brainstorming meetings we had about April Fools. He brought it up as a lark, and Gill Austin and I immediately walked out of that meeting beginning to try to figure out how to pull it off with no time and no money.    What made you (and/or Adult Swim) want to bring Toonami back after its 2008 cancellation?   Well those of us who had worked on Toonami had made our peace with its cancellation. But when we were offered a small chance to bring it back we knew we had to try. It had become clear to us in the years after it was cancelled in 2008 that there were people who WANTED it back.    How (and when) did plans to bring Toonami back start?   I believe it was two and a half months before April Fools Day 2012. Usually Adult Swim has a brainstorm about what we might do for April Fools Day on any given year, where everyone throws out ideas and we see what sticks. Mike Lazzo tossed out “what if we just brought Toonami back for a night, just switched over and it was suddenly like you were in 1999 and watching Cartoon Network?” Everyone loved the idea immediately, and the conversation very quickly moved on to “how the heck can we pull this off?”    Was the plan always to bring it back via an April Fools Day joke? If not, how did that happen?   Previous to the April Fools conversation we had, I swear, never ONCE talked in any serious way about bringing Toonami back. We just didn't think it was possible.    How did the shows that aired for this get picked?   We made a list of what we thought were the definitive Toonami shows. Then we strategized with Kim Manning, our head of programming, how best to approach distributors to see who might be willing to give us a one time license for, like, one episode of a show. We had no idea at all if any of them would work with us on such a weird request.    How was the reception to the April Fools Day joke? Any particularly memorable reactions?   It was incredible, one of the first experiences of my life where I really saw the power of social media to create a collective experience around a particular event as it unfolds. Seeing it blow up on Twitter and watching the mentions just grow, and keep growing, was amazing. All of us were texting each other that night as the event unfolded, and we all stayed up all night having a blast reading the reactions. Just a super great experience for all of us. We came in to work the following Monday still excited and talking about how amazing the response was.    The call from fans to bring back Toonami after this April Fools Day joke was pretty much immediate, and the next day Adult Swim tweeted, ""Want it back? Let us know. #BringBackToonami""--did all this directly contribute to Toonami's full revival a few months later?   Very much so. Basically the reaction to the event, combined with the responses to that Tweet, allowed us to come to Lazzo with a request to bring it back for real. Gill and I had a plan within a week and brought him a way to do it CHEAP and FAST. And thankfully he said yes. We set a target launch date, and started sprinted towards that date immediately.    10 years later, and Adult Swim is more involved in anime production than ever, such as through 2 new seasons of FLCL, Housing Complex C, and Uzumaki. How important has the revival of Toonami been to all this?   It's interesting. Obviously, anime and action have been a part of Adult Swim's DNA since the network's beginning. And even without Toonami returning, it's highly likely that Adult Swim would still be airing anime. Whether or not they would air AS MUCH anime or action, and move into original productions… I don't know. I'm gonna say that would be unlikely without a weekly Toonami block.    Any other thoughts/reflections/fun facts about Toonami's 2012 April Fools Day joke?   Refection-wise, it's just amazing to me that this is the tenth year of the Adult Swim iteration of Toonami. It's very rare that a person gets to have a second chance at creative work once it's been cancelled or wrapped up by the rights holders. It's something that in our case,  only happened with the unique combination of fan love and network freedom that Toonami and Adult Swim have. It's been an amazing experience for all of us at Toonami, and one that never ceases to give us joy. We just hope we are giving that joy back.

Community score: 4.8             Wow. Given how absolutely wonderful this third season of Teasing Master Takagi-san has been, I was trying to keep my expectations as low-key as possible going into this finale. There's a shiny new theatrical release on its way, after all, so I figured that the show would save its biggest romantic revelations for the big screen. Now, it's true that we don't technically get a confession this week, so that Takagi-san movie still has some ammo left in its pocket to work with, but that doesn't prevent “March 14th” from being one of the most sweet and satisfying finales that I've ever seen in a romance anime. Even if we didn't have a movie to look forward to, and this final episode of Season 3 was the last we were ever going to see of Nishikata and Takagi, I would have walked away from Teasing Master Takagi-san feeling completely satisfied. To steal a phrase from New Girl's Schmidt: “No notes!” First of all, it is impossible to understate how gosh darned adorable it is to see Nishikata slowly-but-surely piece together his own feelings for Takagi after Hamaguchi tries to pressure him into confessing to Takagi. At first, of course, Nishikata feels like there is no way that he feels anything other than a friendly (but fierce) rivalry towards the girl who teases him so much, and his elaborately designed “Nishikata Quest” is going to be the ultimate test of Takagi's mental fortitude against his. It's just pure, platonic friendship that is fueling Nishikata's urge to spend inordinate amounts of time arranging elaborate scavenger hunts for the girl he spends nearly every minute of his free time with…right? Sure, he does like hanging out with Takagi, and he can admit that she's pretty cute…and his heart starts to sink when he realizes she's not around to play the usual games with him in class…and he was so excited to see her face when she discovered the game-to-end-all-games that he made just for her… That alone would have been enough to dial my heart's Melt-o-Meter™ to dangerously high levels, but then the show actually goes out of its way to bring back the sneaky love confession that Takagi gave with that book she was teasing Nishikata with all the way back in Episode 2. Nishikata learns that there certainly wasn't an oddly specific and direct love confession for Takagi to read in the text of the book, and if that was Takagi trying to stealthily communicate her true feelings for Nishikata, then maybe the dozens of other times she's pulled similar stunts have also been…. (Dear readers, let me tell you that watching the truth of it all slowly dawn on our precious idiot's face has been one of the anime highlights of the past who-knows-how-long for me. I can only thank the Anime Gods that text reviews are incapable of transmitting the embarrassing noises I was making for half of this episode).  Also, can we talk for a moment about how incredible of a boyfriend Nishikata is going to be once he realizes that he's already been dating Takagi for, like, two years now? Nishikata may have been able to fool himself into thinking that “Nishikata Quest” was nothing more than an attempt to finally one-up his lifelong rival, but you and I (and the Girl Squad!) all know that his insanely elaborate scavenger hunt is one of the most romantic gestures imaginable, and if I had just one completely petty complaint to make about “March 14th”, it is that we have to settle for watching Mina and Co. solve all of the puzzles instead of Takagi herself. Yes, I am fully aware that the sight of Takagi falling in love with Nishikata all over again as she played Nishikata Quest would likely have fully killed me, or at the very least sent me into a shock-induced coma, but dammit, that's a risk I'm willing to take! I need this, Takagi-san! Ah well. I suppose I'll just have to settle for the utterly delightful ending scene that sees Nishikata racing after Takagi's car to make sure he can get her the traditional White Day gift on time. Could I maybe nitpick a little about how some of the running animation looks a little off, or how the general timing of the scene feels just a little bit stretched out? Sure, I could…if I was a monster that hated love and art. I am not a monster, though, so instead I will simply revel in the simple joy that comes from watching two sweet kids get one step closer to expressing how much they love each other. Sure, Nishikata might not say “I love you” in this finale, but he doesn't need to. All Takagi needs to hear is that the boy of her dreams wanted nothing more than to see her, and to give her a small token of appreciation, because she really does mean the world to him.  That's more than enough for me. Whatever comes next for Teasing Master Takagi-san is just icing on the cake.

I suppose I'll just have to settle for the utterly delightful ending scene that sees Nishikata racing after Takagi's car to make sure he can get her the traditional White Day gift on time. Could I maybe nitpick a little about how some of the running animation looks a little off, or how the general timing of the scene feels just a little bit stretched out? Sure, I could…if I was a monster that hated love and art. I am not a monster, though, so instead I will simply revel in the simple joy that comes from watching two sweet kids get one step closer to expressing how much they love each other. Sure, Nishikata might not say “I love you” in this finale, but he doesn't need to. All Takagi needs to hear is that the boy of her dreams wanted nothing more than to see her, and to give her a small token of appreciation, because she really does mean the world to him.  That's more than enough for me. Whatever comes next for Teasing Master Takagi-san is just icing on the cake.

Community score: 4.8             Wow. Given how absolutely wonderful this third season of Teasing Master Takagi-san has been, I was trying to keep my expectations as low-key as possible going into this finale. There's a shiny new theatrical release on its way, after all, so I figured that the show would save its biggest romantic revelations for the big screen. Now, it's true that we don't technically get a confession this week, so that Takagi-san movie still has some ammo left in its pocket to work with, but that doesn't prevent “March 14th” from being one of the most sweet and satisfying finales that I've ever seen in a romance anime. Even if we didn't have a movie to look forward to, and this final episode of Season 3 was the last we were ever going to see of Nishikata and Takagi, I would have walked away from Teasing Master Takagi-san feeling completely satisfied. To steal a phrase from New Girl's Schmidt: “No notes!” First of all, it is impossible to understate how gosh darned adorable it is to see Nishikata slowly-but-surely piece together his own feelings for Takagi after Hamaguchi tries to pressure him into confessing to Takagi. At first, of course, Nishikata feels like there is no way that he feels anything other than a friendly (but fierce) rivalry towards the girl who teases him so much, and his elaborately designed “Nishikata Quest” is going to be the ultimate test of Takagi's mental fortitude against his. It's just pure, platonic friendship that is fueling Nishikata's urge to spend inordinate amounts of time arranging elaborate scavenger hunts for the girl he spends nearly every minute of his free time with…right? Sure, he does like hanging out with Takagi, and he can admit that she's pretty cute…and his heart starts to sink when he realizes she's not around to play the usual games with him in class…and he was so excited to see her face when she discovered the game-to-end-all-games that he made just for her… That alone would have been enough to dial my heart's Melt-o-Meter™ to dangerously high levels, but then the show actually goes out of its way to bring back the sneaky love confession that Takagi gave with that book she was teasing Nishikata with all the way back in Episode 2. Nishikata learns that there certainly wasn't an oddly specific and direct love confession for Takagi to read in the text of the book, and if that was Takagi trying to stealthily communicate her true feelings for Nishikata, then maybe the dozens of other times she's pulled similar stunts have also been…. (Dear readers, let me tell you that watching the truth of it all slowly dawn on our precious idiot's face has been one of the anime highlights of the past who-knows-how-long for me. I can only thank the Anime Gods that text reviews are incapable of transmitting the embarrassing noises I was making for half of this episode).  Also, can we talk for a moment about how incredible of a boyfriend Nishikata is going to be once he realizes that he's already been dating Takagi for, like, two years now? Nishikata may have been able to fool himself into thinking that “Nishikata Quest” was nothing more than an attempt to finally one-up his lifelong rival, but you and I (and the Girl Squad!) all know that his insanely elaborate scavenger hunt is one of the most romantic gestures imaginable, and if I had just one completely petty complaint to make about “March 14th”, it is that we have to settle for watching Mina and Co. solve all of the puzzles instead of Takagi herself.

Last year's Crunchyroll Expo revealed the series was green-lit for second and third season, and after today the wait is over. Season two will premiere sometime in 2021, and the third season won't be as long of a wait.    This year's panel for Shield Hero features Keigo Koyanagi (series composition), Masahiro Suwa (character design and chief animation director), Junichiro Tamura (producer from Kadokawa), and MC'd by voice actress Sarah Emi Bridcutt.    Following up on the excitement of last year, the panel began with a Q&A focused on reflection and production. Tamura shared he was surprised to see a variety of languages and support from fans around the world commenting on the Shield Hero videos. Regarding what episode drove the most excitement, Koyanagi confidently claimed episode 21, aka Myne's “execution.” As reference, Crunchyroll's post of that scene has 2.8M views on YouTube, making it the most popular clip from the series.    On a more relaxed note, character designer Suwa voiced his surprise at how popular Raphtalia was, but he thought she and Naofumi make a “great combo.” Conversely, his favorite character to design was The Pope because of how hard it was to pin down. Otherwise, Suwa tried to keep the designs relatively simple to make it easier for others to draw.    The next set of questions focused on the care and level of detail taken in terms of the script and the character designs. Although Koyanagi said it was difficult to convince the audience to keep watching and build excitement for the following episodes, Bridcutt assured that he did a great job based on the sheer volume of reactions from Twitter and streams of the show.    When asked if there was anything memorable from the voice recording sessions, Tamura said his impressions of the characters had changed once he heard the voice auditions. In addition to the main cast, he had help picked the candidates that fit characters that show up later in the series. Looking back at last year, the panelists voiced how encouraged and motivated they were after interacting with fans overseas. Although the autograph sessions were more than what they expected, they all thoroughly enjoyed their time seeing fans face to face and receiving words of appreciation and fanart. They wish they had more to show last year, but luckily they have more to reveal.    Unfortunately, they couldn't reveal all their secrets for what's to come, but what they could talk about was how production for season two is rolling along. Producer Tamura divulged how the script and other parts of anime production were proceeding, but there was no information on how much of the story the next season would cover. Of course, the question that many fans—and Sarah Emi Bridcutt herself—had on their mind was, “Will Myne be back?” No clear answer was given, but Tamura encouraged people to stay tuned for characters who might return.  Auditions for the upcoming season are underway.    In the meantime, because Masato Jinbo had replaced Takao Abo as director for season two, Tamura reiterated that there are many surprises to look forward to. Before closing off the panel entirely, surprise guests Kaito Ishikawa (Naofumi), Asami Seto (Raphtalia), and Rina Hidaka (Firo) all separately shared their reflection of season one and their characters through audio. Even though there was no video recording accompanying their audio, all three actors couldn't hold back their tension and excitement to reprise their roles. For those who can't wait for next year, Rina Hidaka puts it best: “Season two will be here soon!”     discuss this in the forum (2 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Convention homepage / archives      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Last year's Crunchyroll Expo revealed the series was green-lit for second and third season, and after today the wait is over. Season two will premiere sometime in 2021, and the third season won't be as long of a wait.    This year's panel for Shield Hero features Keigo Koyanagi (series composition), Masahiro Suwa (character design and chief animation director), Junichiro Tamura (producer from Kadokawa), and MC'd by voice actress Sarah Emi Bridcutt.    Following up on the excitement of last year, the panel began with a Q&A focused on reflection and production. Tamura shared he was surprised to see a variety of languages and support from fans around the world commenting on the Shield Hero videos. Regarding what episode drove the most excitement, Koyanagi confidently claimed episode 21, aka Myne's “execution.” As reference, Crunchyroll's post of that scene has 2.8M views on YouTube, making it the most popular clip from the series.    On a more relaxed note, character designer Suwa voiced his surprise at how popular Raphtalia was, but he thought she and Naofumi make a “great combo.” Conversely, his favorite character to design was The Pope because of how hard it was to pin down. Otherwise, Suwa tried to keep the designs relatively simple to make it easier for others to draw.    The next set of questions focused on the care and level of detail taken in terms of the script and the character designs. Although Koyanagi said it was difficult to convince the audience to keep watching and build excitement for the following episodes, Bridcutt assured that he did a great job based on the sheer volume of reactions from Twitter and streams of the show.    When asked if there was anything memorable from the voice recording sessions, Tamura said his impressions of the characters had changed once he heard the voice auditions. In addition to the main cast, he had help picked the candidates that fit characters that show up later in the series. Looking back at last year, the panelists voiced how encouraged and motivated they were after interacting with fans overseas. Although the autograph sessions were more than what they expected, they all thoroughly enjoyed their time seeing fans face to face and receiving words of appreciation and fanart. They wish they had more to show last year, but luckily they have more to reveal.    Unfortunately, they couldn't reveal all their secrets for what's to come, but what they could talk about was how production for season two is rolling along. Producer Tamura divulged how the script and other parts of anime production were proceeding, but there was no information on how much of the story the next season would cover. Of course, the question that many fans—and Sarah Emi Bridcutt herself—had on their mind was, “Will Myne be back?” No clear answer was given, but Tamura encouraged people to stay tuned for characters who might return.  Auditions for the upcoming season are underway.    In the meantime, because Masato Jinbo had replaced Takao Abo as director for season two, Tamura reiterated that there are many surprises to look forward to.

14-04-2022,animation,1,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/watch/2022-04-01/gundam-build-fighters-and-the-power-of-toy-anime/.184235,Gundam Build Fighters and the Power of Toy Anime - Anime News Network:SEA,"       Gundam Build Fighters and the Power of Toy Anime   by The Cartoon Cipher, Apr  1st 2022          Gundam is a mecha franchise that's been going strong for decades with amazing entries in all kinds of styles. Gunpla is a contraction of “Gundam plastic” and refers to the plastic model kits based on the mechs that appear in the anime. It's been a prominent part of Gundam merchandise and the fandom for a while, and it's easy to see why. A lot of these designs look damn impressive and bring back memories of their iconic stories. Who wouldn't want a detailed, customizable, poseable statue of them that you can assemble piece by piece? The anime we'll be talking about today though is about the plastic toys themselves rather than the giant mechs, so it's a toy show through and through. It also just happens to be some of the most fun we had with an anime in a long time! This is The Cartoon Cipher here with Anime News Network to reminisce about Gundam Build Fighters.      Before Build Fighters came Model Suit Gunpla Builders Beginning G. This was a short and sweet 3-part OVA produced to celebrate the 30th anniversary of gunpla, and is set in a variation of the real world where you can put the Gunpla you've made into a scanner then use VR to actually pilot it and battle others. The protagonist Haru is on a journey to be worthy of challenging a mysterious yet skilled rival, and along the way discovers how expansive and creative Gunpla can be.    These are essentially toy fights without grave stakes, however the passion behind what it means to build the Gunpla is put front-and-center, and a lot of key moments felt like “the heart of the cards” but for Gunpla. I think a lot of Western fans my age grew up with shows like Yu Gi Oh!, Beyblade or Pokémon, and the way Beginning G delivers these positive morals aimed at children will really hit that nostalgic sweet spot. The battle scenes are about giving things your all and the importance of new challenges, so by the end the fights escalate into absolute insanity with all manner of Gundam weapons and strategies deployed at once for an incredible spectacle. Meanwhile the building scenes show you how being passionate about Gunpla can create new friendships as you all strive to hold each other up. Beginning G also made sure to show how accessible Gunpla is for beginners, including some of the tools you'll need and basic customization. Overall however, the storyline was nothing ambitious and the characters were honestly pretty forgettable outside the one who looks like Quattro Bajeena. Maybe this was down to the limited runtime, but Sunrise would soon revisit this concept in anime form a few years later, with room for many more interesting ideas…    Gundam Build Fighters season 1 began airing in fall 2013. Instead of VR, scientists in this world have developed special particles called Plavsky Particles which seem to react to the kind of plastic Gunpla is made of. With this, the model kits can be brought to life and fight just like the mechs in the Gundam anime. The protagonist Sei Iori hopes to be a legendary Gunpla battler like his father, but while he is an expert at creating and customizing Gunpla, he's not so great at controlling them. Suddenly, a boy named Reiji mysteriously appears from another world (don't worry, that's not a plot twist) and it turns out that he's great at controlling Sei's Gunpla in battle. The two boys decide to team up and take on the world of Gunpla together, facing opponents from all over the world, making plenty of friends, rivals, and even love interests along the way. Obviously this is nothing like the war stories and space adventures of the main Gundam shows, including the more lighthearted ones. You could compare it to the tournaments in G-Gundam but even then there aren't any political stakes this time. Though keep G-Gundam in the back of your mind, as it will become relevant later.    Being a giant homage to Gundam's legacy there's obviously tons of references and inside jokes scattered throughout both seasons, such as background cameos, lines of dialogue, or Ramba Ral straight-up being a prominent character in this story. He acts as the mentor to the protagonists, always dispensing words of wisdom and generally being a lovable Gouf-ball. The series has a nice even mix of characters who know all there is to know about Gundam, and total newcomers who wouldn't get a Char reference if it hit them in the face at three-times the normal speed. Build Fighters has fun lamp shading that disconnect, but is still committed to the idea that Gunpla can and does bring all kinds of people together. It's just as fun watching some characters get bamboozled by the references as it is watching the Gundam junkies go full-otaku at a moment's notice, and because of the variety you're bound to find characters to relate to no matter how much Gundam you've seen.    Likewise, it's just plain cool to see so many different Gundam elements from different series united in one place and playing off each other. There's the Trans-Am System, funnels, backpacks, transforming, combining, any weapon you can imagine but as a laser beam, a whole different style for the SD Gundams, and that's not even getting into how different environments can be used to your advantage! A variety of strategies and formats also keeps things fresh so that it's not always possible to blast your way out of a problem. Some fighters stay hidden for the majority of the fight, some go into battle with no guns at all, and some people… straight-up cheat. If you're in a race, you need to optimize your Gunpla for speed. If you have a unique ability, all the other fighters are going to start adjusting their strategies against it. If you're on the ropes then you need to weigh surrendering versus fighting on because remember, the plastic models are fighting for real so any damage they take is also for real and you'll have to repair it yourself afterwards. The show truly believes that Gunpla is freedom and is committed to show you as many possibilities as it can squeeze in, no matter how out-there.    Build Fighters season 1 was directed by Kenji Nagasaki, written by Yosuke Kuroda, with music by Yuki Hayashi, and if that combination of names sounds familiar it's because they've worked together before and since, most notably on a little show called My Hero Academia. Particular mention needs to go to the soundtrack by Yuki Hayashi. While Beginning G's music felt like a more straightforward film score, Hayashi's music is incredibly hype-inducing, with energetic beats and the occasional fusion of genres in certain tracks. If you remember our video on the Bastard!! anime you'll know Kuroda has been a writer on many great anime adaptations but he's also no stranger to Gundam, having written for the popular Gundam 00 series in the mid-2000s.    The journey of Sei and Reiji is a classic of polar-opposite protagonists who complete each other. Sei is so passionate about his Gunpla that it hurts his piloting because he subconsciously doesn't want to damage his creation, and his time with Reiji is what helps him become a more complete person by the end. Meanwhile Reiji is pretty inconsiderate at the start of the show, but his time with Gunpla teaches him a great deal of respect for those around him. Much like the story, the characters are each quite straightforward but executed incredibly well. The relationships they share are the true highlight, whether it be Sei and Reiji completing each other and covering each other's weakness, or the lighthearted comedy and especially the romantic teases elsewhere in the show. Both seasons invest a lot in the romance department and it's always either hilarious or wholesome, never bogging the story down either. It's usually fairly obvious who will win any given fight in this show, but in the best of matches I always found myself feeling for the rival who couldn't win because they're still so likable. Even side characters who aren't that involved in the actual battles come across as really charming in a way that enriches the optimism of the anime. The main villain is also evil in a fun way, essentially being a giant baby who you can't help but laugh at despite his plans being corrupt and going against what the protagonists stand for.    So then what does the show stand for? This may sound contradictory, but it's about the freedom to have fun… by taking things seriously. I feel like that's an important theme to get right, and it makes Build Fighters a great, emotionally-healthy show for kids (if you're older like me though it will still speak to your inner child). Despite all the battles and conflicts the show is just incredibly uplifting, with the main goal simply being to have as much fun as possible. Most of the antagonists are usually fighting for ulterior motives such as business moves, or just winning by any means necessary. Like Beginning G before it, there's a lot of “heart of the Gunpla”-esque moments about competing for the right reasons, not taking the easy way out, respecting your opponent, and everything else that made me feel like I was a kid watching Yu Gi Oh! for the first time, and loving every second. A big takeaway from each match is that winning or losing doesn't matter as long as you're having a good time. That doesn't mean slack off and do things lazily by any means though.  And its that idea of getting serious for fun that solidifies so many of the best relationships in this show from romances to rivalries, whether it's through building together, training together, cheering together and yes, fighting together.    Obviously the show is doing all this to get people to buy more model kits, but the expansive nature of Gunpla and exploring new relationships through the hobby can be a good message about life in general. Not only is it for everyone but there's all sorts of things you can do with it. Some people enjoy Gunpla battling and as we've seen there's plenty of ways to go about that, but others prefer to be more artistic, creating displays based on scenes from Gundam stories. With this being a world with Gunpla at the center, we got to see a lot of custom designs that take the pre-existing ones from the show and build upon them. These both look awesome while adding twists to the battles, and Build Fighters doesn't stop there. The freedom of Gunpla is expressed all over society and culture as well: there's Gunpla in the arts, Gunpla idols and rock stars, fashion models who do shoots with Gunpla, you can even flirt and settle property disputes with Gunpla!    The battles themselves are all flashy and fast-paced, with most of them actually getting wrapped up within a single episode. This not only keeps the action exciting but also stops things from dragging too much. This allows the show to have plenty of down time for comedy and character arcs to build, with the battles essentially being the big climaxes of those arcs, complete with hype music and hype animation. Whether it was on the battlefield or on the shelf, all the Gunpla in this anime looked vibrant and sharp. Only one machine in both seasons was done in CG, and the effects animation does a lot to make the action scenes pop. In fact, the entire show both in and outside the arena is full of vibrant colors which really adds to the fun and lively vibe of the overarching story. The character designs are striking, the environments are vivid, even the explosions of defeated Gunpla look fun!    With such an enjoyable 25 episode run coming to an end in 2014, Gundam Build Fighters Try would come along in fall of that year to add some new twists. This sequel season is set seven years later at Sei Iori's school. At first, Fumina Hoshino is just trying to save her beloved Gunpla Battle Club from being shut down. But with the help of her childhood friend Yuuma, and a hot-headed kenpo fighter called Sekai (who may look familiar to Build Fighters fans), she puts together Team Try Fighters to compete in the Japanese Under-19 division. It retains a lot of the strengths and themes of season one however Kenji Nagasaki wasn't the director this time, with an at-the-time newer director by the name of Shinya Watada taking up that role. Try still has homages to various Gundam anime but it leans into G-Gundam's influence in particular, not just with direct references but with the overall bombastic tone and greater focus on martial arts.    A big shake-up to the Build Fighters comes in the form of battlers having to form teams of three, making teamwork a more prominent theme this time around. Each member of Try Fighter has a distinct relationship with each other as well as having their own, more personal character arcs: Yuuma with his identity crisis, Fumina finding her own strength while also supporting her friends, and Sekai needing to appreciate this brand new world he's stepped into. Their personalities are also well reflected in their fighting styles and signature colors, making for a very robust dynamic. As a consequence of this focus on teamwork though, many side members of opponent teams weren't as fleshed out as the rivals in season 1. Either their team leader would take most of the focus, or all three of them would only show up very briefly, being tied together by an identifiable design theme, which would still be neat on its own. That isn't to say Try Fighters are the only decent characters though, as the rivalries and romances this time were just as good if not better than in season 1.    The motto of the show is still very much “Gunpla is freedom” however this time it's also expressed through the idea of constantly breaking limits. The episodes are always building up bigger and bigger rivals for Try Fighters in the background, because if Gunpla is freedom then like the first OP song says… “There are no limits.”  Unlike season 1 there was no overarching villain working against the main characters, however this was made up for by certain rivals having especially twisted dispositions which lead to enough dark moments to keep things interesting. The escalating skill of the rivals also drives home the notion that there's always a bigger fish out there, which sometimes hits our protagonists hard. But that in itself leads to another important message of getting back up when you fall. And with the characters constantly breaking their limits, the intensity and absurdity of the fights escalates with them. The sheer concept of what was happening in some of these fights was delightful, and it all kept building and building right up till the final battle where the hype absolutely exploded. I don't want to give too much away because it truly was that good, but suffice to say it was a perfect resolution to the main rival AND team dynamics in an amazingly animated package. Even if some of the Build Fighters from other teams weren't as developed as season one's cast, the sheer hype made up for that in spades. Speaking of which, there were quite a few season one cameos in Try and all of them felt very rewarding. However looking back on Try almost 8 years later, it is a bit disappointing that what those cameos brought to the table never went anywhere.    After Try ended, both it and season 1 eventually received a longer-than-usual OVA set after their respective events, those being Island Wars and GM's Counterattack. They have elements that made their respective seasons shine, but are both essentially scenarios set up so that the good guys can deploy all their Gunpla at once for a huge battle. There was also Gundam Build Fighters: Battlogue which was a series of five short episodes exploring different parts of the Build Fighters world. I found a couple of them fun, but less so for the other three. There's a spin-off manga called Gundam Build Fighters Amazing about Tatsuya Yuuki's childhood, as well some light novel series' called Honoo and Honno Try that are also side stories from what I can gather. So while we have gotten more, so far it hasn't been substantial enough to match my hopes for a third season tying everything together. Without spoiling Try, certain promises were made about exciting future battles that we never got to see. Then there's the mysterious nature of Reiji, his connection to Sekai, and the parallel world he comes from. I imagine not everyone's gonna feel the same about this in particular; this is a show about magic fighting toys after all so a boy traveling from a kingdom in a parallel world doesn't seem that farfetched. What we got from Build Fighters was pretty much all excellent so while I can't criticize it for not having more, it's because it was so good that I wanted more. I don't play that many video games but at the very least, perhaps the Gundam Vs. or Super Robot Wars video games are satisfying fans' desires to see mechs from different series' duking it out.    Then there's the next spin-off Gundam Build Divers, which personally I never got very far into. While Shinya Watada stayed on from Try to direct Divers, the writing and musical staff are different. Maybe the reason I couldn't get into Divers was because of the departure of those key staff members, maybe it's because I wasn't up for yet another cast change after Try, or maybe it's because the technology of Divers was so different. Regardless, if we want to discuss Divers, we're gonna have to do it another time because we've been talking about fighting Gundam toys for way too long. It's unknown where the series will go from here but here's hoping that it never loses that kinetic fun and optimism!  Gundam Build Fighters and the first season of Divers are available right here on the Gundam.info YouTube channel for free, although unfortunately both Try and the second season of Divers have recently been taken down from there.     discuss this in the forum (8 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Watch homepage / archives      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

If you remember our video on the Bastard!! anime you'll know Kuroda has been a writer on many great anime adaptations but he's also no stranger to Gundam, having written for the popular Gundam 00 series in the mid-2000s.    The journey of Sei and Reiji is a classic of polar-opposite protagonists who complete each other. Sei is so passionate about his Gunpla that it hurts his piloting because he subconsciously doesn't want to damage his creation, and his time with Reiji is what helps him become a more complete person by the end. Meanwhile Reiji is pretty inconsiderate at the start of the show, but his time with Gunpla teaches him a great deal of respect for those around him. Much like the story, the characters are each quite straightforward but executed incredibly well. The relationships they share are the true highlight, whether it be Sei and Reiji completing each other and covering each other's weakness, or the lighthearted comedy and especially the romantic teases elsewhere in the show. Both seasons invest a lot in the romance department and it's always either hilarious or wholesome, never bogging the story down either. It's usually fairly obvious who will win any given fight in this show, but in the best of matches I always found myself feeling for the rival who couldn't win because they're still so likable. Even side characters who aren't that involved in the actual battles come across as really charming in a way that enriches the optimism of the anime. The main villain is also evil in a fun way, essentially being a giant baby who you can't help but laugh at despite his plans being corrupt and going against what the protagonists stand for.    So then what does the show stand for? This may sound contradictory, but it's about the freedom to have fun… by taking things seriously. I feel like that's an important theme to get right, and it makes Build Fighters a great, emotionally-healthy show for kids (if you're older like me though it will still speak to your inner child). Despite all the battles and conflicts the show is just incredibly uplifting, with the main goal simply being to have as much fun as possible. Most of the antagonists are usually fighting for ulterior motives such as business moves, or just winning by any means necessary. Like Beginning G before it, there's a lot of “heart of the Gunpla”-esque moments about competing for the right reasons, not taking the easy way out, respecting your opponent, and everything else that made me feel like I was a kid watching Yu Gi Oh! for the first time, and loving every second. A big takeaway from each match is that winning or losing doesn't matter as long as you're having a good time. That doesn't mean slack off and do things lazily by any means though.  And its that idea of getting serious for fun that solidifies so many of the best relationships in this show from romances to rivalries, whether it's through building together, training together, cheering together and yes, fighting together.    Obviously the show is doing all this to get people to buy more model kits, but the expansive nature of Gunpla and exploring new relationships through the hobby can be a good message about life in general. Not only is it for everyone but there's all sorts of things you can do with it. Some people enjoy Gunpla battling and as we've seen there's plenty of ways to go about that, but others prefer to be more artistic, creating displays based on scenes from Gundam stories. With this being a world with Gunpla at the center, we got to see a lot of custom designs that take the pre-existing ones from the show and build upon them. These both look awesome while adding twists to the battles, and Build Fighters doesn't stop there. The freedom of Gunpla is expressed all over society and culture as well: there's Gunpla in the arts, Gunpla idols and rock stars, fashion models who do shoots with Gunpla, you can even flirt and settle property disputes with Gunpla!    The battles themselves are all flashy and fast-paced, with most of them actually getting wrapped up within a single episode. This not only keeps the action exciting but also stops things from dragging too much. This allows the show to have plenty of down time for comedy and character arcs to build, with the battles essentially being the big climaxes of those arcs, complete with hype music and hype animation. Whether it was on the battlefield or on the shelf, all the Gunpla in this anime looked vibrant and sharp. Only one machine in both seasons was done in CG, and the effects animation does a lot to make the action scenes pop. In fact, the entire show both in and outside the arena is full of vibrant colors which really adds to the fun and lively vibe of the overarching story. The character designs are striking, the environments are vivid, even the explosions of defeated Gunpla look fun!    With such an enjoyable 25 episode run coming to an end in 2014, Gundam Build Fighters Try would come along in fall of that year to add some new twists. This sequel season is set seven years later at Sei Iori's school. At first, Fumina Hoshino is just trying to save her beloved Gunpla Battle Club from being shut down. But with the help of her childhood friend Yuuma, and a hot-headed kenpo fighter called Sekai (who may look familiar to Build Fighters fans), she puts together Team Try Fighters to compete in the Japanese Under-19 division. It retains a lot of the strengths and themes of season one however Kenji Nagasaki wasn't the director this time, with an at-the-time newer director by the name of Shinya Watada taking up that role. Try still has homages to various Gundam anime but it leans into G-Gundam's influence in particular, not just with direct references but with the overall bombastic tone and greater focus on martial arts.    A big shake-up to the Build Fighters comes in the form of battlers having to form teams of three, making teamwork a more prominent theme this time around. Each member of Try Fighter has a distinct relationship with each other as well as having their own, more personal character arcs: Yuuma with his identity crisis, Fumina finding her own strength while also supporting her friends, and Sekai needing to appreciate this brand new world he's stepped into. Their personalities are also well reflected in their fighting styles and signature colors, making for a very robust dynamic. As a consequence of this focus on teamwork though, many side members of opponent teams weren't as fleshed out as the rivals in season 1. Either their team leader would take most of the focus, or all three of them would only show up very briefly, being tied together by an identifiable design theme, which would still be neat on its own. That isn't to say Try Fighters are the only decent characters though, as the rivalries and romances this time were just as good if not better than in season 1.    The motto of the show is still very much “Gunpla is freedom” however this time it's also expressed through the idea of constantly breaking limits. The episodes are always building up bigger and bigger rivals for Try Fighters in the background, because if Gunpla is freedom then like the first OP song says… “There are no limits.”  Unlike season 1 there was no overarching villain working against the main characters, however this was made up for by certain rivals having especially twisted dispositions which lead to enough dark moments to keep things interesting. The escalating skill of the rivals also drives home the notion that there's always a bigger fish out there, which sometimes hits our protagonists hard. But that in itself leads to another important message of getting back up when you fall. And with the characters constantly breaking their limits, the intensity and absurdity of the fights escalates with them. The sheer concept of what was happening in some of these fights was delightful, and it all kept building and building right up till the final battle where the hype absolutely exploded. I don't want to give too much away because it truly was that good, but suffice to say it was a perfect resolution to the main rival AND team dynamics in an amazingly animated package. Even if some of the Build Fighters from other teams weren't as developed as season one's cast, the sheer hype made up for that in spades. Speaking of which, there were quite a few season one cameos in Try and all of them felt very rewarding. However looking back on Try almost 8 years later, it is a bit disappointing that what those cameos brought to the table never went anywhere.    After Try ended, both it and season 1 eventually received a longer-than-usual OVA set after their respective events, those being Island Wars and GM's Counterattack. They have elements that made their respective seasons shine, but are both essentially scenarios set up so that the good guys can deploy all their Gunpla at once for a huge battle. There was also Gundam Build Fighters: Battlogue which was a series of five short episodes exploring different parts of the Build Fighters world. I found a couple of them fun, but less so for the other three. There's a spin-off manga called Gundam Build Fighters Amazing about Tatsuya Yuuki's childhood, as well some light novel series' called Honoo and Honno Try that are also side stories from what I can gather. So while we have gotten more, so far it hasn't been substantial enough to match my hopes for a third season tying everything together. Without spoiling Try, certain promises were made about exciting future battles that we never got to see. Then there's the mysterious nature of Reiji, his connection to Sekai, and the parallel world he comes from. I imagine not everyone's gonna feel the same about this in particular; this is a show about magic fighting toys after all so a boy traveling from a kingdom in a parallel world doesn't seem that farfetched. What we got from Build Fighters was pretty much all excellent so while I can't criticize it for not having more, it's because it was so good that I wanted more. I don't play that many video games but at the very least, perhaps the Gundam Vs. or Super Robot Wars video games are satisfying fans' desires to see mechs from different series' duking it out.    Then there's the next spin-off Gundam Build Divers, which personally I never got very far into. While Shinya Watada stayed on from Try to direct Divers, the writing and musical staff are different. Maybe the reason I couldn't get into Divers was because of the departure of those key staff members, maybe it's because I wasn't up for yet another cast change after Try, or maybe it's because the technology of Divers was so different. Regardless, if we want to discuss Divers, we're gonna have to do it another time because we've been talking about fighting Gundam toys for way too long. It's unknown where the series will go from here but here's hoping that it never loses that kinetic fun and optimism!  Gundam Build Fighters and the first season of Divers are available right here on the Gundam.info YouTube channel for free, although unfortunately both Try and the second season of Divers have recently been taken down from there.     discuss this in the forum (8 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Watch homepage / archives     ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"
14-04-2022,animation,1,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/watch/2022-04-01/gundam-build-fighters-and-the-power-of-toy-anime/.184235,Gundam Build Fighters and the Power of Toy Anime - Anime News Network:SEA,"        Gundam is a mecha franchise that's been going strong for decades with amazing entries in all kinds of styles. Gunpla is a contraction of “Gundam plastic” and refers to the plastic model kits based on the mechs that appear in the anime. It's been a prominent part of Gundam merchandise and the fandom for a while, and it's easy to see why. A lot of these designs look damn impressive and bring back memories of their iconic stories. Who wouldn't want a detailed, customizable, poseable statue of them that you can assemble piece by piece? The anime we'll be talking about today though is about the plastic toys themselves rather than the giant mechs, so it's a toy show through and through. It also just happens to be some of the most fun we had with an anime in a long time! This is The Cartoon Cipher here with Anime News Network to reminisce about Gundam Build Fighters.      Before Build Fighters came Model Suit Gunpla Builders Beginning G. This was a short and sweet 3-part OVA produced to celebrate the 30th anniversary of gunpla, and is set in a variation of the real world where you can put the Gunpla you've made into a scanner then use VR to actually pilot it and battle others. The protagonist Haru is on a journey to be worthy of challenging a mysterious yet skilled rival, and along the way discovers how expansive and creative Gunpla can be.    These are essentially toy fights without grave stakes, however the passion behind what it means to build the Gunpla is put front-and-center, and a lot of key moments felt like “the heart of the cards” but for Gunpla. I think a lot of Western fans my age grew up with shows like Yu Gi Oh!, Beyblade or Pokémon, and the way Beginning G delivers these positive morals aimed at children will really hit that nostalgic sweet spot. The battle scenes are about giving things your all and the importance of new challenges, so by the end the fights escalate into absolute insanity with all manner of Gundam weapons and strategies deployed at once for an incredible spectacle. Meanwhile the building scenes show you how being passionate about Gunpla can create new friendships as you all strive to hold each other up. Beginning G also made sure to show how accessible Gunpla is for beginners, including some of the tools you'll need and basic customization. Overall however, the storyline was nothing ambitious and the characters were honestly pretty forgettable outside the one who looks like Quattro Bajeena. Maybe this was down to the limited runtime, but Sunrise would soon revisit this concept in anime form a few years later, with room for many more interesting ideas…    Gundam Build Fighters season 1 began airing in fall 2013. Instead of VR, scientists in this world have developed special particles called Plavsky Particles which seem to react to the kind of plastic Gunpla is made of. With this, the model kits can be brought to life and fight just like the mechs in the Gundam anime. The protagonist Sei Iori hopes to be a legendary Gunpla battler like his father, but while he is an expert at creating and customizing Gunpla, he's not so great at controlling them. Suddenly, a boy named Reiji mysteriously appears from another world (don't worry, that's not a plot twist) and it turns out that he's great at controlling Sei's Gunpla in battle. The two boys decide to team up and take on the world of Gunpla together, facing opponents from all over the world, making plenty of friends, rivals, and even love interests along the way. Obviously this is nothing like the war stories and space adventures of the main Gundam shows, including the more lighthearted ones. You could compare it to the tournaments in G-Gundam but even then there aren't any political stakes this time. Though keep G-Gundam in the back of your mind, as it will become relevant later.    Being a giant homage to Gundam's legacy there's obviously tons of references and inside jokes scattered throughout both seasons, such as background cameos, lines of dialogue, or Ramba Ral straight-up being a prominent character in this story. He acts as the mentor to the protagonists, always dispensing words of wisdom and generally being a lovable Gouf-ball. The series has a nice even mix of characters who know all there is to know about Gundam, and total newcomers who wouldn't get a Char reference if it hit them in the face at three-times the normal speed. Build Fighters has fun lamp shading that disconnect, but is still committed to the idea that Gunpla can and does bring all kinds of people together. It's just as fun watching some characters get bamboozled by the references as it is watching the Gundam junkies go full-otaku at a moment's notice, and because of the variety you're bound to find characters to relate to no matter how much Gundam you've seen.    Likewise, it's just plain cool to see so many different Gundam elements from different series united in one place and playing off each other. There's the Trans-Am System, funnels, backpacks, transforming, combining, any weapon you can imagine but as a laser beam, a whole different style for the SD Gundams, and that's not even getting into how different environments can be used to your advantage! A variety of strategies and formats also keeps things fresh so that it's not always possible to blast your way out of a problem. Some fighters stay hidden for the majority of the fight, some go into battle with no guns at all, and some people… straight-up cheat. If you're in a race, you need to optimize your Gunpla for speed. If you have a unique ability, all the other fighters are going to start adjusting their strategies against it. If you're on the ropes then you need to weigh surrendering versus fighting on because remember, the plastic models are fighting for real so any damage they take is also for real and you'll have to repair it yourself afterwards. The show truly believes that Gunpla is freedom and is committed to show you as many possibilities as it can squeeze in, no matter how out-there.    Build Fighters season 1 was directed by Kenji Nagasaki, written by Yosuke Kuroda, with music by Yuki Hayashi, and if that combination of names sounds familiar it's because they've worked together before and since, most notably on a little show called My Hero Academia. Particular mention needs to go to the soundtrack by Yuki Hayashi. While Beginning G's music felt like a more straightforward film score, Hayashi's music is incredibly hype-inducing, with energetic beats and the occasional fusion of genres in certain tracks. If you remember our video on the Bastard!! anime you'll know Kuroda has been a writer on many great anime adaptations but he's also no stranger to Gundam, having written for the popular Gundam 00 series in the mid-2000s.

There's the Trans-Am System, funnels, backpacks, transforming, combining, any weapon you can imagine but as a laser beam, a whole different style for the SD Gundams, and that's not even getting into how different environments can be used to your advantage! A variety of strategies and formats also keeps things fresh so that it's not always possible to blast your way out of a problem. Some fighters stay hidden for the majority of the fight, some go into battle with no guns at all, and some people… straight-up cheat. If you're in a race, you need to optimize your Gunpla for speed. If you have a unique ability, all the other fighters are going to start adjusting their strategies against it. If you're on the ropes then you need to weigh surrendering versus fighting on because remember, the plastic models are fighting for real so any damage they take is also for real and you'll have to repair it yourself afterwards. The show truly believes that Gunpla is freedom and is committed to show you as many possibilities as it can squeeze in, no matter how out-there.    Build Fighters season 1 was directed by Kenji Nagasaki, written by Yosuke Kuroda, with music by Yuki Hayashi, and if that combination of names sounds familiar it's because they've worked together before and since, most notably on a little show called My Hero Academia. Particular mention needs to go to the soundtrack by Yuki Hayashi. While Beginning G's music felt like a more straightforward film score, Hayashi's music is incredibly hype-inducing, with energetic beats and the occasional fusion of genres in certain tracks. If you remember our video on the Bastard!! anime you'll know Kuroda has been a writer on many great anime adaptations but he's also no stranger to Gundam, having written for the popular Gundam 00 series in the mid-2000s.    The journey of Sei and Reiji is a classic of polar-opposite protagonists who complete each other. Sei is so passionate about his Gunpla that it hurts his piloting because he subconsciously doesn't want to damage his creation, and his time with Reiji is what helps him become a more complete person by the end. Meanwhile Reiji is pretty inconsiderate at the start of the show, but his time with Gunpla teaches him a great deal of respect for those around him. Much like the story, the characters are each quite straightforward but executed incredibly well. The relationships they share are the true highlight, whether it be Sei and Reiji completing each other and covering each other's weakness, or the lighthearted comedy and especially the romantic teases elsewhere in the show. Both seasons invest a lot in the romance department and it's always either hilarious or wholesome, never bogging the story down either. It's usually fairly obvious who will win any given fight in this show, but in the best of matches I always found myself feeling for the rival who couldn't win because they're still so likable. Even side characters who aren't that involved in the actual battles come across as really charming in a way that enriches the optimism of the anime. The main villain is also evil in a fun way, essentially being a giant baby who you can't help but laugh at despite his plans being corrupt and going against what the protagonists stand for.    So then what does the show stand for? This may sound contradictory, but it's about the freedom to have fun… by taking things seriously. I feel like that's an important theme to get right, and it makes Build Fighters a great, emotionally-healthy show for kids (if you're older like me though it will still speak to your inner child). Despite all the battles and conflicts the show is just incredibly uplifting, with the main goal simply being to have as much fun as possible. Most of the antagonists are usually fighting for ulterior motives such as business moves, or just winning by any means necessary. Like Beginning G before it, there's a lot of “heart of the Gunpla”-esque moments about competing for the right reasons, not taking the easy way out, respecting your opponent, and everything else that made me feel like I was a kid watching Yu Gi Oh! for the first time, and loving every second. A big takeaway from each match is that winning or losing doesn't matter as long as you're having a good time. That doesn't mean slack off and do things lazily by any means though.  And its that idea of getting serious for fun that solidifies so many of the best relationships in this show from romances to rivalries, whether it's through building together, training together, cheering together and yes, fighting together.    Obviously the show is doing all this to get people to buy more model kits, but the expansive nature of Gunpla and exploring new relationships through the hobby can be a good message about life in general. Not only is it for everyone but there's all sorts of things you can do with it. Some people enjoy Gunpla battling and as we've seen there's plenty of ways to go about that, but others prefer to be more artistic, creating displays based on scenes from Gundam stories. With this being a world with Gunpla at the center, we got to see a lot of custom designs that take the pre-existing ones from the show and build upon them. These both look awesome while adding twists to the battles, and Build Fighters doesn't stop there. The freedom of Gunpla is expressed all over society and culture as well: there's Gunpla in the arts, Gunpla idols and rock stars, fashion models who do shoots with Gunpla, you can even flirt and settle property disputes with Gunpla!    The battles themselves are all flashy and fast-paced, with most of them actually getting wrapped up within a single episode. This not only keeps the action exciting but also stops things from dragging too much. This allows the show to have plenty of down time for comedy and character arcs to build, with the battles essentially being the big climaxes of those arcs, complete with hype music and hype animation. Whether it was on the battlefield or on the shelf, all the Gunpla in this anime looked vibrant and sharp. Only one machine in both seasons was done in CG, and the effects animation does a lot to make the action scenes pop. In fact, the entire show both in and outside the arena is full of vibrant colors which really adds to the fun and lively vibe of the overarching story. The character designs are striking, the environments are vivid, even the explosions of defeated Gunpla look fun!    With such an enjoyable 25 episode run coming to an end in 2014, Gundam Build Fighters Try would come along in fall of that year to add some new twists. This sequel season is set seven years later at Sei Iori's school. At first, Fumina Hoshino is just trying to save her beloved Gunpla Battle Club from being shut down. But with the help of her childhood friend Yuuma, and a hot-headed kenpo fighter called Sekai (who may look familiar to Build Fighters fans), she puts together Team Try Fighters to compete in the Japanese Under-19 division. It retains a lot of the strengths and themes of season one however Kenji Nagasaki wasn't the director this time, with an at-the-time newer director by the name of Shinya Watada taking up that role. Try still has homages to various Gundam anime but it leans into G-Gundam's influence in particular, not just with direct references but with the overall bombastic tone and greater focus on martial arts.    A big shake-up to the Build Fighters comes in the form of battlers having to form teams of three, making teamwork a more prominent theme this time around. Each member of Try Fighter has a distinct relationship with each other as well as having their own, more personal character arcs: Yuuma with his identity crisis, Fumina finding her own strength while also supporting her friends, and Sekai needing to appreciate this brand new world he's stepped into. Their personalities are also well reflected in their fighting styles and signature colors, making for a very robust dynamic. As a consequence of this focus on teamwork though, many side members of opponent teams weren't as fleshed out as the rivals in season 1. Either their team leader would take most of the focus, or all three of them would only show up very briefly, being tied together by an identifiable design theme, which would still be neat on its own. That isn't to say Try Fighters are the only decent characters though, as the rivalries and romances this time were just as good if not better than in season 1.    The motto of the show is still very much “Gunpla is freedom” however this time it's also expressed through the idea of constantly breaking limits. The episodes are always building up bigger and bigger rivals for Try Fighters in the background, because if Gunpla is freedom then like the first OP song says… “There are no limits.”  Unlike season 1 there was no overarching villain working against the main characters, however this was made up for by certain rivals having especially twisted dispositions which lead to enough dark moments to keep things interesting. The escalating skill of the rivals also drives home the notion that there's always a bigger fish out there, which sometimes hits our protagonists hard. But that in itself leads to another important message of getting back up when you fall. And with the characters constantly breaking their limits, the intensity and absurdity of the fights escalates with them. The sheer concept of what was happening in some of these fights was delightful, and it all kept building and building right up till the final battle where the hype absolutely exploded. I don't want to give too much away because it truly was that good, but suffice to say it was a perfect resolution to the main rival AND team dynamics in an amazingly animated package. Even if some of the Build Fighters from other teams weren't as developed as season one's cast, the sheer hype made up for that in spades. Speaking of which, there were quite a few season one cameos in Try and all of them felt very rewarding. However looking back on Try almost 8 years later, it is a bit disappointing that what those cameos brought to the table never went anywhere.    After Try ended, both it and season 1 eventually received a longer-than-usual OVA set after their respective events, those being Island Wars and GM's Counterattack. They have elements that made their respective seasons shine, but are both essentially scenarios set up so that the good guys can deploy all their Gunpla at once for a huge battle. There was also Gundam Build Fighters: Battlogue which was a series of five short episodes exploring different parts of the Build Fighters world. I found a couple of them fun, but less so for the other three. There's a spin-off manga called Gundam Build Fighters Amazing about Tatsuya Yuuki's childhood, as well some light novel series' called Honoo and Honno Try that are also side stories from what I can gather. So while we have gotten more, so far it hasn't been substantial enough to match my hopes for a third season tying everything together. Without spoiling Try, certain promises were made about exciting future battles that we never got to see. Then there's the mysterious nature of Reiji, his connection to Sekai, and the parallel world he comes from. I imagine not everyone's gonna feel the same about this in particular; this is a show about magic fighting toys after all so a boy traveling from a kingdom in a parallel world doesn't seem that farfetched. What we got from Build Fighters was pretty much all excellent so while I can't criticize it for not having more, it's because it was so good that I wanted more. I don't play that many video games but at the very least, perhaps the Gundam Vs. or Super Robot Wars video games are satisfying fans' desires to see mechs from different series' duking it out.    Then there's the next spin-off Gundam Build Divers, which personally I never got very far into. While Shinya Watada stayed on from Try to direct Divers, the writing and musical staff are different. Maybe the reason I couldn't get into Divers was because of the departure of those key staff members, maybe it's because I wasn't up for yet another cast change after Try, or maybe it's because the technology of Divers was so different. Regardless, if we want to discuss Divers, we're gonna have to do it another time because we've been talking about fighting Gundam toys for way too long. It's unknown where the series will go from here but here's hoping that it never loses that kinetic fun and optimism!  Gundam Build Fighters and the first season of Divers are available right here on the Gundam.info YouTube channel for free, although unfortunately both Try and the second season of Divers have recently been taken down from there.     discuss this in the forum (8 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Watch homepage / archives   ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"
14-04-2022,animation,1,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/watch/2022-04-01/gundam-build-fighters-and-the-power-of-toy-anime/.184235,Gundam Build Fighters and the Power of Toy Anime - Anime News Network:SEA,"    Gundam is a mecha franchise that's been going strong for decades with amazing entries in all kinds of styles. Gunpla is a contraction of “Gundam plastic” and refers to the plastic model kits based on the mechs that appear in the anime. It's been a prominent part of Gundam merchandise and the fandom for a while, and it's easy to see why. A lot of these designs look damn impressive and bring back memories of their iconic stories. Who wouldn't want a detailed, customizable, poseable statue of them that you can assemble piece by piece? The anime we'll be talking about today though is about the plastic toys themselves rather than the giant mechs, so it's a toy show through and through. It also just happens to be some of the most fun we had with an anime in a long time! This is The Cartoon Cipher here with Anime News Network to reminisce about Gundam Build Fighters.      Before Build Fighters came Model Suit Gunpla Builders Beginning G. This was a short and sweet 3-part OVA produced to celebrate the 30th anniversary of gunpla, and is set in a variation of the real world where you can put the Gunpla you've made into a scanner then use VR to actually pilot it and battle others. The protagonist Haru is on a journey to be worthy of challenging a mysterious yet skilled rival, and along the way discovers how expansive and creative Gunpla can be.    These are essentially toy fights without grave stakes, however the passion behind what it means to build the Gunpla is put front-and-center, and a lot of key moments felt like “the heart of the cards” but for Gunpla. I think a lot of Western fans my age grew up with shows like Yu Gi Oh!, Beyblade or Pokémon, and the way Beginning G delivers these positive morals aimed at children will really hit that nostalgic sweet spot. The battle scenes are about giving things your all and the importance of new challenges, so by the end the fights escalate into absolute insanity with all manner of Gundam weapons and strategies deployed at once for an incredible spectacle. Meanwhile the building scenes show you how being passionate about Gunpla can create new friendships as you all strive to hold each other up. Beginning G also made sure to show how accessible Gunpla is for beginners, including some of the tools you'll need and basic customization. Overall however, the storyline was nothing ambitious and the characters were honestly pretty forgettable outside the one who looks like Quattro Bajeena. Maybe this was down to the limited runtime, but Sunrise would soon revisit this concept in anime form a few years later, with room for many more interesting ideas…    Gundam Build Fighters season 1 began airing in fall 2013. Instead of VR, scientists in this world have developed special particles called Plavsky Particles which seem to react to the kind of plastic Gunpla is made of. With this, the model kits can be brought to life and fight just like the mechs in the Gundam anime. The protagonist Sei Iori hopes to be a legendary Gunpla battler like his father, but while he is an expert at creating and customizing Gunpla, he's not so great at controlling them. Suddenly, a boy named Reiji mysteriously appears from another world (don't worry, that's not a plot twist) and it turns out that he's great at controlling Sei's Gunpla in battle. The two boys decide to team up and take on the world of Gunpla together, facing opponents from all over the world, making plenty of friends, rivals, and even love interests along the way. Obviously this is nothing like the war stories and space adventures of the main Gundam shows, including the more lighthearted ones. You could compare it to the tournaments in G-Gundam but even then there aren't any political stakes this time. Though keep G-Gundam in the back of your mind, as it will become relevant later.    Being a giant homage to Gundam's legacy there's obviously tons of references and inside jokes scattered throughout both seasons, such as background cameos, lines of dialogue, or Ramba Ral straight-up being a prominent character in this story. He acts as the mentor to the protagonists, always dispensing words of wisdom and generally being a lovable Gouf-ball. The series has a nice even mix of characters who know all there is to know about Gundam, and total newcomers who wouldn't get a Char reference if it hit them in the face at three-times the normal speed. Build Fighters has fun lamp shading that disconnect, but is still committed to the idea that Gunpla can and does bring all kinds of people together. It's just as fun watching some characters get bamboozled by the references as it is watching the Gundam junkies go full-otaku at a moment's notice, and because of the variety you're bound to find characters to relate to no matter how much Gundam you've seen.    Likewise, it's just plain cool to see so many different Gundam elements from different series united in one place and playing off each other. There's the Trans-Am System, funnels, backpacks, transforming, combining, any weapon you can imagine but as a laser beam, a whole different style for the SD Gundams, and that's not even getting into how different environments can be used to your advantage! A variety of strategies and formats also keeps things fresh so that it's not always possible to blast your way out of a problem. Some fighters stay hidden for the majority of the fight, some go into battle with no guns at all, and some people… straight-up cheat. If you're in a race, you need to optimize your Gunpla for speed.

You could compare it to the tournaments in G-Gundam but even then there aren't any political stakes this time. Though keep G-Gundam in the back of your mind, as it will become relevant later.    Being a giant homage to Gundam's legacy there's obviously tons of references and inside jokes scattered throughout both seasons, such as background cameos, lines of dialogue, or Ramba Ral straight-up being a prominent character in this story. He acts as the mentor to the protagonists, always dispensing words of wisdom and generally being a lovable Gouf-ball. The series has a nice even mix of characters who know all there is to know about Gundam, and total newcomers who wouldn't get a Char reference if it hit them in the face at three-times the normal speed. Build Fighters has fun lamp shading that disconnect, but is still committed to the idea that Gunpla can and does bring all kinds of people together. It's just as fun watching some characters get bamboozled by the references as it is watching the Gundam junkies go full-otaku at a moment's notice, and because of the variety you're bound to find characters to relate to no matter how much Gundam you've seen.    Likewise, it's just plain cool to see so many different Gundam elements from different series united in one place and playing off each other. There's the Trans-Am System, funnels, backpacks, transforming, combining, any weapon you can imagine but as a laser beam, a whole different style for the SD Gundams, and that's not even getting into how different environments can be used to your advantage! A variety of strategies and formats also keeps things fresh so that it's not always possible to blast your way out of a problem. Some fighters stay hidden for the majority of the fight, some go into battle with no guns at all, and some people… straight-up cheat. If you're in a race, you need to optimize your Gunpla for speed. If you have a unique ability, all the other fighters are going to start adjusting their strategies against it. If you're on the ropes then you need to weigh surrendering versus fighting on because remember, the plastic models are fighting for real so any damage they take is also for real and you'll have to repair it yourself afterwards. The show truly believes that Gunpla is freedom and is committed to show you as many possibilities as it can squeeze in, no matter how out-there.    Build Fighters season 1 was directed by Kenji Nagasaki, written by Yosuke Kuroda, with music by Yuki Hayashi, and if that combination of names sounds familiar it's because they've worked together before and since, most notably on a little show called My Hero Academia. Particular mention needs to go to the soundtrack by Yuki Hayashi. While Beginning G's music felt like a more straightforward film score, Hayashi's music is incredibly hype-inducing, with energetic beats and the occasional fusion of genres in certain tracks. If you remember our video on the Bastard!! anime you'll know Kuroda has been a writer on many great anime adaptations but he's also no stranger to Gundam, having written for the popular Gundam 00 series in the mid-2000s.    The journey of Sei and Reiji is a classic of polar-opposite protagonists who complete each other. Sei is so passionate about his Gunpla that it hurts his piloting because he subconsciously doesn't want to damage his creation, and his time with Reiji is what helps him become a more complete person by the end. Meanwhile Reiji is pretty inconsiderate at the start of the show, but his time with Gunpla teaches him a great deal of respect for those around him. Much like the story, the characters are each quite straightforward but executed incredibly well. The relationships they share are the true highlight, whether it be Sei and Reiji completing each other and covering each other's weakness, or the lighthearted comedy and especially the romantic teases elsewhere in the show. Both seasons invest a lot in the romance department and it's always either hilarious or wholesome, never bogging the story down either. It's usually fairly obvious who will win any given fight in this show, but in the best of matches I always found myself feeling for the rival who couldn't win because they're still so likable. Even side characters who aren't that involved in the actual battles come across as really charming in a way that enriches the optimism of the anime. The main villain is also evil in a fun way, essentially being a giant baby who you can't help but laugh at despite his plans being corrupt and going against what the protagonists stand for.    So then what does the show stand for? This may sound contradictory, but it's about the freedom to have fun… by taking things seriously. I feel like that's an important theme to get right, and it makes Build Fighters a great, emotionally-healthy show for kids (if you're older like me though it will still speak to your inner child). Despite all the battles and conflicts the show is just incredibly uplifting, with the main goal simply being to have as much fun as possible. Most of the antagonists are usually fighting for ulterior motives such as business moves, or just winning by any means necessary. Like Beginning G before it, there's a lot of “heart of the Gunpla”-esque moments about competing for the right reasons, not taking the easy way out, respecting your opponent, and everything else that made me feel like I was a kid watching Yu Gi Oh! for the first time, and loving every second. A big takeaway from each match is that winning or losing doesn't matter as long as you're having a good time. That doesn't mean slack off and do things lazily by any means though.  And its that idea of getting serious for fun that solidifies so many of the best relationships in this show from romances to rivalries, whether it's through building together, training together, cheering together and yes, fighting together.    Obviously the show is doing all this to get people to buy more model kits, but the expansive nature of Gunpla and exploring new relationships through the hobby can be a good message about life in general. Not only is it for everyone but there's all sorts of things you can do with it. Some people enjoy Gunpla battling and as we've seen there's plenty of ways to go about that, but others prefer to be more artistic, creating displays based on scenes from Gundam stories. With this being a world with Gunpla at the center, we got to see a lot of custom designs that take the pre-existing ones from the show and build upon them. These both look awesome while adding twists to the battles, and Build Fighters doesn't stop there. The freedom of Gunpla is expressed all over society and culture as well: there's Gunpla in the arts, Gunpla idols and rock stars, fashion models who do shoots with Gunpla, you can even flirt and settle property disputes with Gunpla!    The battles themselves are all flashy and fast-paced, with most of them actually getting wrapped up within a single episode. This not only keeps the action exciting but also stops things from dragging too much. This allows the show to have plenty of down time for comedy and character arcs to build, with the battles essentially being the big climaxes of those arcs, complete with hype music and hype animation. Whether it was on the battlefield or on the shelf, all the Gunpla in this anime looked vibrant and sharp. Only one machine in both seasons was done in CG, and the effects animation does a lot to make the action scenes pop. In fact, the entire show both in and outside the arena is full of vibrant colors which really adds to the fun and lively vibe of the overarching story. The character designs are striking, the environments are vivid, even the explosions of defeated Gunpla look fun!    With such an enjoyable 25 episode run coming to an end in 2014, Gundam Build Fighters Try would come along in fall of that year to add some new twists. This sequel season is set seven years later at Sei Iori's school. At first, Fumina Hoshino is just trying to save her beloved Gunpla Battle Club from being shut down. But with the help of her childhood friend Yuuma, and a hot-headed kenpo fighter called Sekai (who may look familiar to Build Fighters fans), she puts together Team Try Fighters to compete in the Japanese Under-19 division. It retains a lot of the strengths and themes of season one however Kenji Nagasaki wasn't the director this time, with an at-the-time newer director by the name of Shinya Watada taking up that role. Try still has homages to various Gundam anime but it leans into G-Gundam's influence in particular, not just with direct references but with the overall bombastic tone and greater focus on martial arts.    A big shake-up to the Build Fighters comes in the form of battlers having to form teams of three, making teamwork a more prominent theme this time around. Each member of Try Fighter has a distinct relationship with each other as well as having their own, more personal character arcs: Yuuma with his identity crisis, Fumina finding her own strength while also supporting her friends, and Sekai needing to appreciate this brand new world he's stepped into. Their personalities are also well reflected in their fighting styles and signature colors, making for a very robust dynamic. As a consequence of this focus on teamwork though, many side members of opponent teams weren't as fleshed out as the rivals in season 1. Either their team leader would take most of the focus, or all three of them would only show up very briefly, being tied together by an identifiable design theme, which would still be neat on its own. That isn't to say Try Fighters are the only decent characters though, as the rivalries and romances this time were just as good if not better than in season 1.    The motto of the show is still very much “Gunpla is freedom” however this time it's also expressed through the idea of constantly breaking limits. The episodes are always building up bigger and bigger rivals for Try Fighters in the background, because if Gunpla is freedom then like the first OP song says… “There are no limits.”  Unlike season 1 there was no overarching villain working against the main characters, however this was made up for by certain rivals having especially twisted dispositions which lead to enough dark moments to keep things interesting. The escalating skill of the rivals also drives home the notion that there's always a bigger fish out there, which sometimes hits our protagonists hard. But that in itself leads to another important message of getting back up when you fall. And with the characters constantly breaking their limits, the intensity and absurdity of the fights escalates with them. The sheer concept of what was happening in some of these fights was delightful, and it all kept building and building right up till the final battle where the hype absolutely exploded. I don't want to give too much away because it truly was that good, but suffice to say it was a perfect resolution to the main rival AND team dynamics in an amazingly animated package. Even if some of the Build Fighters from other teams weren't as developed as season one's cast, the sheer hype made up for that in spades. Speaking of which, there were quite a few season one cameos in Try and all of them felt very rewarding. However looking back on Try almost 8 years later, it is a bit disappointing that what those cameos brought to the table never went anywhere.    After Try ended, both it and season 1 eventually received a longer-than-usual OVA set after their respective events, those being Island Wars and GM's Counterattack. They have elements that made their respective seasons shine, but are both essentially scenarios set up so that the good guys can deploy all their Gunpla at once for a huge battle. There was also Gundam Build Fighters: Battlogue which was a series of five short episodes exploring different parts of the Build Fighters world. I found a couple of them fun, but less so for the other three. There's a spin-off manga called Gundam Build Fighters Amazing about Tatsuya Yuuki's childhood, as well some light novel series' called Honoo and Honno Try that are also side stories from what I can gather. So while we have gotten more, so far it hasn't been substantial enough to match my hopes for a third season tying everything together. Without spoiling Try, certain promises were made about exciting future battles that we never got to see. Then there's the mysterious nature of Reiji, his connection to Sekai, and the parallel world he comes from. I imagine not everyone's gonna feel the same about this in particular; this is a show about magic fighting toys after all so a boy traveling from a kingdom in a parallel world doesn't seem that farfetched. What we got from Build Fighters was pretty much all excellent so while I can't criticize it for not having more, it's because it was so good that I wanted more. I don't play that many video games but at the very least, perhaps the Gundam Vs. or Super Robot Wars video games are satisfying fans' desires to see mechs from different series' duking it out.    Then there's the next spin-off Gundam Build Divers, which personally I never got very far into. While Shinya Watada stayed on from Try to direct Divers, the writing and musical staff are different. Maybe the reason I couldn't get into Divers was because of the departure of those key staff members, maybe it's because I wasn't up for yet another cast change after Try, or maybe it's because the technology of Divers was so different. Regardless, if we want to discuss Divers, we're gonna have to do it another time because we've been talking about fighting Gundam toys for way too long. It's unknown where the series will go from here but here's hoping that it never loses that kinetic fun and optimism!  Gundam Build Fighters and the first season of Divers are available right here on the Gundam.info YouTube channel for free, although unfortunately both Try and the second season of Divers have recently been taken down from there.

Below you'll find our editorial team's top (tentative) picks from the 46-odd shows slated to premiere in January. What are your favorite picks? Head on over to our poll and pick your top five. We'll publish the results before preview guide launches on April 1. Also, if you're still having a hard time choosing what to add to your queue, or you're just down for a good time, do check out Anime News Network's Spring 2022 Trailer Watch Party with YouTube personality Geoff Thew (Mother's Basement)!          Most Anticipated: Love After World Domination  Yeah yeah, I know this is likely interrupting a lengthy sweep of SPY x FAMILY top spots, but I'm more than happy to play the spoiler for this adorable-looking Super Sentai RomCom. There's nothing that I enjoy more than a good romantic comedy anime, and this looks like a total treat. The premise is great, the character designs are wonderful, and based on the trailers the animation looks strong all-around. Like this past season's Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department there's the risk of it playing a little too much inside baseball with the tokusatsu angle, but that's a small hurdle to clear for what looks like an absolutely adorable setup.    Runner-Up: SPY x FAMILY   That being said, yeah, I'm hyped for SPY x FAMILY a whole lot too. I've been reading the manga since it began, loving it just as long, and waiting for its inevitable anime adaptation to bring as many people as possible in for this wonderful, funny, and endlessly charming series. And going by the promos the production is seriously on-point. The secret sauce of this story is how it can effortlessly balance intense action and gut-busting humor without sweating a drop, and the trailers look ridiculously great at both. You probably don't need me to tell you this one's worth watching, but it's good enough that I feel compelled to do it anyway.    Alongside those, I am going to be feasting this season. Kaguya-sama is coming back, and as one of the greatest modern romcoms ever made it stands to reason I'm going to devour it. In fact, there's a whole block of romance-tinged series this season for me to chow down on between Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie, Aharen-san wa Hakarenai, and the potential disasterpiece of A Couple of Cuckoos. While I don't know if it'll actually have any romance, just the fact that In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki is from the creator of Teasing Master Takagi-san is enough for me to check it out. There's even some fantasy series of different varieties that look appealing like Healer Girl and The Dawn of the Witch. And of course, this spring marks the beginning of back-to-back seasons of Love Live!, which means I've automatically won for the next six months.          Most Anticipated: SPY X FAMILY  I love a good comedy anime, and some of my favorite comedies of all time are those that revolve around character misunderstandings – shows like Gamers!, School Rumble, and Yamada's First Time that are able to push misunderstandings to absurd lengths through unique circumstances for the sake of comedic payoff. So when I heard that SPY x FAMILY was basically that but with a spy, an assassin, and a telepath, you end up getting more than just my curiosity… you get my full, undivided attention. I marathoned the first six volumes of the manga and it is impressive how deftly the author is able to juggle all the unique abilities and over-the-top characters in such a serious setting. After watching some of the previews and being impressed by the above-average presentation for what is extensively a reactionary type of comedy, I look forward to seeing how some of these classic situations where the characters completely misjudge each other end up playing out.    Runner-Up: Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic    I will admit that I wasn't the biggest fan of Kaguya Sama: Love Is War at first. While the show definitely seemed to fall into my wheelhouse of comedy anime, I initially found it a bit too cynical for its own good. However, as time went on and the show managed to find its emotional foothold, I began to appreciate both its comedy and character writing a lot more. Season two especially allowed me to better appreciate these characters by giving us a better look at where that rather cynical worldview can sometimes come from. I have read a bit of the manga after season two and there's a good chance that season three will feature even more of those intense character moments. Either way, I think there will definitely be a lot of good material to appreciate and I definitely can't wait for another snazzy anime opening!          Most Anticipated: Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs   In 2020's My Next Life as a Villainess: All Routes Lead to Doom!, a young woman is reincarnated as the villainess in a stereotypical girl's dating sim. The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs takes the same general idea and twists it. Instead of a young woman, it's a young man. Instead of becoming the villainess, he is a random background character. Instead of a kind dunce, he's a bit of a self-serving asshole. But that's just the start of things.    As it's based on the setting of a D-grade reverse-harem romance, the fantasy world is full of plot holes, most notably the absurd level of misandry that permeates society. Noblewomen have several lovers beyond their husbands (who are little more than slaves making money for their wives). Second and third sons are married off to elderly women, only to then be sent off to the front lines for an easy life insurance payout. Our hero wants to avoid this fate and is willing to do whatever it takes to do so. His plan is simply to have enough money and power to secure his own independence—too bad he somehow catches the eye of both the heroine and the villainess. It's a hilarious ride where you can both cheer for the hero fighting against this half-baked world and laugh whenever karma smacks him upside the head.    Runner-Up: Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie    So many stories end with the main couple getting together. However, this is where Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie begins. Shikimori is cute and popular, athletic and intelligent. But her boyfriend, Izumi, is none of these things; worse still, he is unlucky and accident-prone to a dangerous degree. However, because of this, he is one of the few to see the other side of his girlfriend. Whenever he is in trouble, be that physical or emotional, her cute veneer fades away and she becomes a suave badass that oozes coolness from every pore.    What I love about this change is that it's accompanied by a shift in Shikimori's character design—her chin becomes sharper, as do her eyes. She looks elegant and dangerous, capable of sweeping anyone off their feet. And while there is an obvious swapping of stereotypical gender roles between Shikimori and Izumi in this story, it's important to remember that Shikimori isn't just the cute girl or the badass; she's both. Shikimori and Izumi simply bring out the best in each other across the board, as any good couple should.          Most Anticipated: Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie  You can blame My Dress-Up Darling for rekindling my romcom torch just in time for Kaguya-sama season 3 and Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie. Since I like to highlight non-sequels here, however, I'll defer my focus to Shikimori, which comes with the blue-ribbon premise of “what if Utena Tenjou was your girlfriend?” If romcoms live or die by their gimmicks, then I can hardly think of one more ripe for virality than the one about a handsome tomboy coolly kabedon-ing her doe-eyed boy squeeze. Online wasn't quite ready for Witch Craft Works and its perpetually princess-carried male protagonist—a fact towards which I will forever be bitter, because that show rules—but I hope, in 2022, Shikimori can at least find some justice. Plus, the previews are bursting with color, and Doga Kobo know how to put together a good-looking anime. Maybe this will be the year of sakuga-rich romcom supremacy.    Beyond that, I have my eye on Vampire in the Garden. No doubt this looks and sounds pretty generic at first blush, but its staff has a good pedigree, and more importantly, I like vampires. Vanitas is nearly over, and Call of the Night doesn't air until the summer, so perhaps Studio Wit can slake my spring bloodthirst. Bubble, also on Wit's docket, will be premiering this season, and I will be heartbroken if the chaotic dream team alignment of Gen Urobuchi, Tetsuro Araki, and Takeshi Obata somehow manages to be boring. I couldn't care less about it being good or not, but it had better be loud. Finally, the only thing I know about SPY x FAMILY is that there's a funny-faced little gremlin girl, and that's good enough for me.          Most Anticipated: Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic  Some ongoing shows can struggle with diminishing returns as they accumulate more seasons, but Kaguya-sama: Love is War seems just a bit more ambitious than that. It's still probably the funniest, most laugh-out-loud anime comedy of the modern era, yes, but recall all the other stuff its second season was able to get up to. The series showed an impressive penchant for pulling off dramatic turns too, which is no small feat when you consider how most of these characters are necessarily stupid as hell. That's the trick though, that this series has endeared these doofuses to me. They're idiots, but they're my idiots, and that even includes Ishigami. Plus, I can't not admire the stones on this series to announce its third season by putting out a whole bonus episode, featuring the characters joking about the very notion of third seasons! Now that's confidence, and if you, like me, have been won over by Kaguya-sama this far along, you know it's earned confidence.    Runner-up: Love Live! Nijigasaki High School Idol Club 2nd Season   There are actually a fair amount of returning faces in this forthcoming Spring season, some more surprising than others. A new Black Rock Shooter? A new Ikki Tousen?! What year is it?! But the other follow-up I'm really looking forward to is the return of those girls in the Nijigasaki High School Idol Club, coming back for another go at what was one of Love Live!'s more atypical iterations. I'm specifically hopeful for this second round since, after the first season necessarily loaded itself up with specific character-focus episodes, having all those now covered means the opportunity for some more complex or ambitious plot-lines featuring all these girls. Of course, I already know that several new members are going to be added to the club this season as well, but given that I'm not a devotee of the mobile game they spawned from, I'm looking forward to getting to know them on my own time. And seeing how they get wrangled into things by the unstoppable swag of that sentient can of Monster Energy known as Yu Takasaki.          Most Anticipated: SPY x FAMILY  This was a no brainer – one of my current favorite manga titles getting an adaptation? Yes, please! Not that that's really any different from my usual criteria for whether I'm anticipating a show or not, but it really felt even easier this time around. That's because the Cold War-set spy spoof is the kind of story that I could see making excellent use of the additional elements anime can provide – music and movement could really work to enhance the way the humor works in the story of the Forger family's semi-secret missions, and giving Anya specifically a voice could help to make her an even more delightful character. Since she's arguably the beating heart of the series, that's especially important. Anya's the only person who knows what's actually going on with pretty much everyone else, because the little dear's a psychic…which no one else has the least clue about. So her adoptive father Loid has no idea that she knows that he's really the master spy Twilight and her adoptive mother Yor is in the dark about the fact that Anya knows she's actually an elite assassin. Mostly poor Anya uses her power to ensure that she gets to keep her happy family without getting sent back to the orphanage, but while this does add an element of pathos, it never overwhelms the zanier aspects of the story. SPY x FAMILY in manga form is a near-perfect blend of goofy spy parody and heartfelt family tale with one of my favorite dog characters (Bond could easily be this season's best boy), and unlike with other manga-to-anime transitions, I have very few worries that this one won't make the leap to anime very well.    And while I'm hoping that those aren't going to be famous last words, I'm also harboring hopes for two other favorite manga titles to make a successful transition: Love After World Domination, which should appeal to fans of Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department, and Ya Boy Kongming!, and not just because it brings my poetry-was-the-rap-battle-of-the-ancient-world teaching method to life. (But okay, mostly because of that.) But my true second pick for most anticipated show this spring is Dance Dance Danseur, surprising precisely no one. While it isn't likely to be Swan or Princess Tutu, the angle of a male dancer in classical ballet isn't one we see all that often, and done well, there's a lot of room for an exploration of the stigma boys face for taking up ballet and the beauty (and pain) of the art form. If the animation lives up to it, this could be a treat.          Most Anticipated: Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic  This year so far has been a relatively strong contender for romantic comedy anime. Komi-san, My Dress-Up Darling, Sasaki and Miyano, hell even a show like Fantasy Knockout really surprised me. And this new season seems to be shaping up to continue to the streak with Kanamori's Not Just a Cutie already piquing my interest.    There's a lot of top contenders, but when this anime walks in the room everyone else needs to step aside and let the real champion do the fighting. It's time for the big guns, it's not just love, it's war! Kaguya-sama is back baby and she's ready to throw down!! Season 1 was filled with belly-laughing over-the-top punchlines as we watched the two smartest idiots in the room tip-toe-tango around their mutual bludgeoning feelings for each other. Then season 2 delivered a real wallop while being able include the same hilarious jokes and teasing heart pounders, with some real drama! For a character most people didn't even like at first, no less! I was laughing and sobbing, and it's all thanks to the wonderful animation and direction brought by the team to bring out just the maximum amount of emotion. And I expect nothing less from season 3 after two strong showings. Kaguya-sama is a contender not to be overlooked.    Runner-up: SPY x FAMILY   Not a rom-com but equally strong AND cute, is the much awaited adaption of the Shonen Jump spy thriller and family comedy, SPY x FAMILY. I've been a fan of this manga since the beginning. Keeping up with the Forgers is always a good time with the cool undercover spy Loid, the powerful assassin Yor, and the precious and precocious psychic-powered daughter, Anya. Together they make up one family of misfits tied together by a common goal to keep the two neighboring countries at peace. Or at least the best a six-year-old can handle!    It's a good read, and one of my favorite currently running manga in Jump, with enough material to make a compelling show. I can't wait to see people watch it! The trailer looks smooth and colorful with animation by Studio Wit and CloverWorks. Just look at Anya's face! Isn't she such a cutie?! . She's full of great reactions that I can't wait to see animated. Yor and Loid look equally good as a power couple, you can tell they adapted the designs well. The action and music also seem promising from what I can see. I'm hoping for everything cool, cute, and comedic to be in full force here. It's a fun time for the whole family with the SPY x FAMILY!     discuss this in the forum (34 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Feature homepage / archives      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4, 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgxHxRAm8Xs': 1}"

Kaguya-sama is coming back, and as one of the greatest modern romcoms ever made it stands to reason I'm going to devour it. In fact, there's a whole block of romance-tinged series this season for me to chow down on between Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie, Aharen-san wa Hakarenai, and the potential disasterpiece of A Couple of Cuckoos. While I don't know if it'll actually have any romance, just the fact that In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki is from the creator of Teasing Master Takagi-san is enough for me to check it out. There's even some fantasy series of different varieties that look appealing like Healer Girl and The Dawn of the Witch. And of course, this spring marks the beginning of back-to-back seasons of Love Live!, which means I've automatically won for the next six months.          Most Anticipated: SPY X FAMILY  I love a good comedy anime, and some of my favorite comedies of all time are those that revolve around character misunderstandings – shows like Gamers!, School Rumble, and Yamada's First Time that are able to push misunderstandings to absurd lengths through unique circumstances for the sake of comedic payoff. So when I heard that SPY x FAMILY was basically that but with a spy, an assassin, and a telepath, you end up getting more than just my curiosity… you get my full, undivided attention. I marathoned the first six volumes of the manga and it is impressive how deftly the author is able to juggle all the unique abilities and over-the-top characters in such a serious setting. After watching some of the previews and being impressed by the above-average presentation for what is extensively a reactionary type of comedy, I look forward to seeing how some of these classic situations where the characters completely misjudge each other end up playing out.    Runner-Up: Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic    I will admit that I wasn't the biggest fan of Kaguya Sama: Love Is War at first. While the show definitely seemed to fall into my wheelhouse of comedy anime, I initially found it a bit too cynical for its own good. However, as time went on and the show managed to find its emotional foothold, I began to appreciate both its comedy and character writing a lot more. Season two especially allowed me to better appreciate these characters by giving us a better look at where that rather cynical worldview can sometimes come from. I have read a bit of the manga after season two and there's a good chance that season three will feature even more of those intense character moments. Either way, I think there will definitely be a lot of good material to appreciate and I definitely can't wait for another snazzy anime opening!          Most Anticipated: Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs   In 2020's My Next Life as a Villainess: All Routes Lead to Doom!, a young woman is reincarnated as the villainess in a stereotypical girl's dating sim. The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs takes the same general idea and twists it. Instead of a young woman, it's a young man. Instead of becoming the villainess, he is a random background character. Instead of a kind dunce, he's a bit of a self-serving asshole. But that's just the start of things.    As it's based on the setting of a D-grade reverse-harem romance, the fantasy world is full of plot holes, most notably the absurd level of misandry that permeates society. Noblewomen have several lovers beyond their husbands (who are little more than slaves making money for their wives). Second and third sons are married off to elderly women, only to then be sent off to the front lines for an easy life insurance payout. Our hero wants to avoid this fate and is willing to do whatever it takes to do so. His plan is simply to have enough money and power to secure his own independence—too bad he somehow catches the eye of both the heroine and the villainess. It's a hilarious ride where you can both cheer for the hero fighting against this half-baked world and laugh whenever karma smacks him upside the head.    Runner-Up: Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie    So many stories end with the main couple getting together. However, this is where Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie begins. Shikimori is cute and popular, athletic and intelligent. But her boyfriend, Izumi, is none of these things; worse still, he is unlucky and accident-prone to a dangerous degree. However, because of this, he is one of the few to see the other side of his girlfriend. Whenever he is in trouble, be that physical or emotional, her cute veneer fades away and she becomes a suave badass that oozes coolness from every pore.    What I love about this change is that it's accompanied by a shift in Shikimori's character design—her chin becomes sharper, as do her eyes. She looks elegant and dangerous, capable of sweeping anyone off their feet. And while there is an obvious swapping of stereotypical gender roles between Shikimori and Izumi in this story, it's important to remember that Shikimori isn't just the cute girl or the badass; she's both. Shikimori and Izumi simply bring out the best in each other across the board, as any good couple should.          Most Anticipated: Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie  You can blame My Dress-Up Darling for rekindling my romcom torch just in time for Kaguya-sama season 3 and Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie. Since I like to highlight non-sequels here, however, I'll defer my focus to Shikimori, which comes with the blue-ribbon premise of “what if Utena Tenjou was your girlfriend?” If romcoms live or die by their gimmicks, then I can hardly think of one more ripe for virality than the one about a handsome tomboy coolly kabedon-ing her doe-eyed boy squeeze. Online wasn't quite ready for Witch Craft Works and its perpetually princess-carried male protagonist—a fact towards which I will forever be bitter, because that show rules—but I hope, in 2022, Shikimori can at least find some justice. Plus, the previews are bursting with color, and Doga Kobo know how to put together a good-looking anime. Maybe this will be the year of sakuga-rich romcom supremacy.    Beyond that, I have my eye on Vampire in the Garden. No doubt this looks and sounds pretty generic at first blush, but its staff has a good pedigree, and more importantly, I like vampires. Vanitas is nearly over, and Call of the Night doesn't air until the summer, so perhaps Studio Wit can slake my spring bloodthirst. Bubble, also on Wit's docket, will be premiering this season, and I will be heartbroken if the chaotic dream team alignment of Gen Urobuchi, Tetsuro Araki, and Takeshi Obata somehow manages to be boring. I couldn't care less about it being good or not, but it had better be loud. Finally, the only thing I know about SPY x FAMILY is that there's a funny-faced little gremlin girl, and that's good enough for me.          Most Anticipated: Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic  Some ongoing shows can struggle with diminishing returns as they accumulate more seasons, but Kaguya-sama: Love is War seems just a bit more ambitious than that. It's still probably the funniest, most laugh-out-loud anime comedy of the modern era, yes, but recall all the other stuff its second season was able to get up to. The series showed an impressive penchant for pulling off dramatic turns too, which is no small feat when you consider how most of these characters are necessarily stupid as hell. That's the trick though, that this series has endeared these doofuses to me. They're idiots, but they're my idiots, and that even includes Ishigami. Plus, I can't not admire the stones on this series to announce its third season by putting out a whole bonus episode, featuring the characters joking about the very notion of third seasons! Now that's confidence, and if you, like me, have been won over by Kaguya-sama this far along, you know it's earned confidence.    Runner-up: Love Live! Nijigasaki High School Idol Club 2nd Season   There are actually a fair amount of returning faces in this forthcoming Spring season, some more surprising than others. A new Black Rock Shooter? A new Ikki Tousen?! What year is it?! But the other follow-up I'm really looking forward to is the return of those girls in the Nijigasaki High School Idol Club, coming back for another go at what was one of Love Live!'s more atypical iterations. I'm specifically hopeful for this second round since, after the first season necessarily loaded itself up with specific character-focus episodes, having all those now covered means the opportunity for some more complex or ambitious plot-lines featuring all these girls. Of course, I already know that several new members are going to be added to the club this season as well, but given that I'm not a devotee of the mobile game they spawned from, I'm looking forward to getting to know them on my own time. And seeing how they get wrangled into things by the unstoppable swag of that sentient can of Monster Energy known as Yu Takasaki.          Most Anticipated: SPY x FAMILY  This was a no brainer – one of my current favorite manga titles getting an adaptation? Yes, please! Not that that's really any different from my usual criteria for whether I'm anticipating a show or not, but it really felt even easier this time around. That's because the Cold War-set spy spoof is the kind of story that I could see making excellent use of the additional elements anime can provide – music and movement could really work to enhance the way the humor works in the story of the Forger family's semi-secret missions, and giving Anya specifically a voice could help to make her an even more delightful character. Since she's arguably the beating heart of the series, that's especially important. Anya's the only person who knows what's actually going on with pretty much everyone else, because the little dear's a psychic…which no one else has the least clue about. So her adoptive father Loid has no idea that she knows that he's really the master spy Twilight and her adoptive mother Yor is in the dark about the fact that Anya knows she's actually an elite assassin. Mostly poor Anya uses her power to ensure that she gets to keep her happy family without getting sent back to the orphanage, but while this does add an element of pathos, it never overwhelms the zanier aspects of the story. SPY x FAMILY in manga form is a near-perfect blend of goofy spy parody and heartfelt family tale with one of my favorite dog characters (Bond could easily be this season's best boy), and unlike with other manga-to-anime transitions, I have very few worries that this one won't make the leap to anime very well.    And while I'm hoping that those aren't going to be famous last words, I'm also harboring hopes for two other favorite manga titles to make a successful transition: Love After World Domination, which should appeal to fans of Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department, and Ya Boy Kongming!, and not just because it brings my poetry-was-the-rap-battle-of-the-ancient-world teaching method to life. (But okay, mostly because of that.) But my true second pick for most anticipated show this spring is Dance Dance Danseur, surprising precisely no one. While it isn't likely to be Swan or Princess Tutu, the angle of a male dancer in classical ballet isn't one we see all that often, and done well, there's a lot of room for an exploration of the stigma boys face for taking up ballet and the beauty (and pain) of the art form. If the animation lives up to it, this could be a treat.          Most Anticipated: Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic  This year so far has been a relatively strong contender for romantic comedy anime. Komi-san, My Dress-Up Darling, Sasaki and Miyano, hell even a show like Fantasy Knockout really surprised me. And this new season seems to be shaping up to continue to the streak with Kanamori's Not Just a Cutie already piquing my interest.    There's a lot of top contenders, but when this anime walks in the room everyone else needs to step aside and let the real champion do the fighting. It's time for the big guns, it's not just love, it's war! Kaguya-sama is back baby and she's ready to throw down!! Season 1 was filled with belly-laughing over-the-top punchlines as we watched the two smartest idiots in the room tip-toe-tango around their mutual bludgeoning feelings for each other. Then season 2 delivered a real wallop while being able include the same hilarious jokes and teasing heart pounders, with some real drama! For a character most people didn't even like at first, no less! I was laughing and sobbing, and it's all thanks to the wonderful animation and direction brought by the team to bring out just the maximum amount of emotion. And I expect nothing less from season 3 after two strong showings. Kaguya-sama is a contender not to be overlooked.    Runner-up: SPY x FAMILY   Not a rom-com but equally strong AND cute, is the much awaited adaption of the Shonen Jump spy thriller and family comedy, SPY x FAMILY. I've been a fan of this manga since the beginning. Keeping up with the Forgers is always a good time with the cool undercover spy Loid, the powerful assassin Yor, and the precious and precocious psychic-powered daughter, Anya. Together they make up one family of misfits tied together by a common goal to keep the two neighboring countries at peace. Or at least the best a six-year-old can handle!    It's a good read, and one of my favorite currently running manga in Jump, with enough material to make a compelling show. I can't wait to see people watch it! The trailer looks smooth and colorful with animation by Studio Wit and CloverWorks. Just look at Anya's face! Isn't she such a cutie?! . She's full of great reactions that I can't wait to see animated. Yor and Loid look equally good as a power couple, you can tell they adapted the designs well. The action and music also seem promising from what I can see. I'm hoping for everything cool, cute, and comedic to be in full force here. It's a fun time for the whole family with the SPY x FAMILY!     discuss this in the forum (34 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Feature homepage / archives     ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4, 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgxHxRAm8Xs': 1}"

Below you'll find our editorial team's top (tentative) picks from the 46-odd shows slated to premiere in January. What are your favorite picks? Head on over to our poll and pick your top five. We'll publish the results before preview guide launches on April 1. Also, if you're still having a hard time choosing what to add to your queue, or you're just down for a good time, do check out Anime News Network's Spring 2022 Trailer Watch Party with YouTube personality Geoff Thew (Mother's Basement)!          Most Anticipated: Love After World Domination  Yeah yeah, I know this is likely interrupting a lengthy sweep of SPY x FAMILY top spots, but I'm more than happy to play the spoiler for this adorable-looking Super Sentai RomCom. There's nothing that I enjoy more than a good romantic comedy anime, and this looks like a total treat. The premise is great, the character designs are wonderful, and based on the trailers the animation looks strong all-around. Like this past season's Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department there's the risk of it playing a little too much inside baseball with the tokusatsu angle, but that's a small hurdle to clear for what looks like an absolutely adorable setup.    Runner-Up: SPY x FAMILY   That being said, yeah, I'm hyped for SPY x FAMILY a whole lot too. I've been reading the manga since it began, loving it just as long, and waiting for its inevitable anime adaptation to bring as many people as possible in for this wonderful, funny, and endlessly charming series. And going by the promos the production is seriously on-point. The secret sauce of this story is how it can effortlessly balance intense action and gut-busting humor without sweating a drop, and the trailers look ridiculously great at both. You probably don't need me to tell you this one's worth watching, but it's good enough that I feel compelled to do it anyway.    Alongside those, I am going to be feasting this season. Kaguya-sama is coming back, and as one of the greatest modern romcoms ever made it stands to reason I'm going to devour it.

The premise is great, the character designs are wonderful, and based on the trailers the animation looks strong all-around. Like this past season's Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department there's the risk of it playing a little too much inside baseball with the tokusatsu angle, but that's a small hurdle to clear for what looks like an absolutely adorable setup.    Runner-Up: SPY x FAMILY   That being said, yeah, I'm hyped for SPY x FAMILY a whole lot too. I've been reading the manga since it began, loving it just as long, and waiting for its inevitable anime adaptation to bring as many people as possible in for this wonderful, funny, and endlessly charming series. And going by the promos the production is seriously on-point. The secret sauce of this story is how it can effortlessly balance intense action and gut-busting humor without sweating a drop, and the trailers look ridiculously great at both. You probably don't need me to tell you this one's worth watching, but it's good enough that I feel compelled to do it anyway.    Alongside those, I am going to be feasting this season. Kaguya-sama is coming back, and as one of the greatest modern romcoms ever made it stands to reason I'm going to devour it. In fact, there's a whole block of romance-tinged series this season for me to chow down on between Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie, Aharen-san wa Hakarenai, and the potential disasterpiece of A Couple of Cuckoos. While I don't know if it'll actually have any romance, just the fact that In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki is from the creator of Teasing Master Takagi-san is enough for me to check it out. There's even some fantasy series of different varieties that look appealing like Healer Girl and The Dawn of the Witch. And of course, this spring marks the beginning of back-to-back seasons of Love Live!, which means I've automatically won for the next six months.          Most Anticipated: SPY X FAMILY  I love a good comedy anime, and some of my favorite comedies of all time are those that revolve around character misunderstandings – shows like Gamers!, School Rumble, and Yamada's First Time that are able to push misunderstandings to absurd lengths through unique circumstances for the sake of comedic payoff. So when I heard that SPY x FAMILY was basically that but with a spy, an assassin, and a telepath, you end up getting more than just my curiosity… you get my full, undivided attention. I marathoned the first six volumes of the manga and it is impressive how deftly the author is able to juggle all the unique abilities and over-the-top characters in such a serious setting. After watching some of the previews and being impressed by the above-average presentation for what is extensively a reactionary type of comedy, I look forward to seeing how some of these classic situations where the characters completely misjudge each other end up playing out.    Runner-Up: Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic    I will admit that I wasn't the biggest fan of Kaguya Sama: Love Is War at first. While the show definitely seemed to fall into my wheelhouse of comedy anime, I initially found it a bit too cynical for its own good. However, as time went on and the show managed to find its emotional foothold, I began to appreciate both its comedy and character writing a lot more. Season two especially allowed me to better appreciate these characters by giving us a better look at where that rather cynical worldview can sometimes come from. I have read a bit of the manga after season two and there's a good chance that season three will feature even more of those intense character moments. Either way, I think there will definitely be a lot of good material to appreciate and I definitely can't wait for another snazzy anime opening!          Most Anticipated: Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs   In 2020's My Next Life as a Villainess: All Routes Lead to Doom!, a young woman is reincarnated as the villainess in a stereotypical girl's dating sim. The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs takes the same general idea and twists it. Instead of a young woman, it's a young man. Instead of becoming the villainess, he is a random background character. Instead of a kind dunce, he's a bit of a self-serving asshole. But that's just the start of things.    As it's based on the setting of a D-grade reverse-harem romance, the fantasy world is full of plot holes, most notably the absurd level of misandry that permeates society. Noblewomen have several lovers beyond their husbands (who are little more than slaves making money for their wives). Second and third sons are married off to elderly women, only to then be sent off to the front lines for an easy life insurance payout. Our hero wants to avoid this fate and is willing to do whatever it takes to do so. His plan is simply to have enough money and power to secure his own independence—too bad he somehow catches the eye of both the heroine and the villainess. It's a hilarious ride where you can both cheer for the hero fighting against this half-baked world and laugh whenever karma smacks him upside the head.    Runner-Up: Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie    So many stories end with the main couple getting together. However, this is where Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie begins. Shikimori is cute and popular, athletic and intelligent. But her boyfriend, Izumi, is none of these things; worse still, he is unlucky and accident-prone to a dangerous degree. However, because of this, he is one of the few to see the other side of his girlfriend. Whenever he is in trouble, be that physical or emotional, her cute veneer fades away and she becomes a suave badass that oozes coolness from every pore.    What I love about this change is that it's accompanied by a shift in Shikimori's character design—her chin becomes sharper, as do her eyes. She looks elegant and dangerous, capable of sweeping anyone off their feet. And while there is an obvious swapping of stereotypical gender roles between Shikimori and Izumi in this story, it's important to remember that Shikimori isn't just the cute girl or the badass; she's both. Shikimori and Izumi simply bring out the best in each other across the board, as any good couple should.          Most Anticipated: Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie  You can blame My Dress-Up Darling for rekindling my romcom torch just in time for Kaguya-sama season 3 and Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie. Since I like to highlight non-sequels here, however, I'll defer my focus to Shikimori, which comes with the blue-ribbon premise of “what if Utena Tenjou was your girlfriend?” If romcoms live or die by their gimmicks, then I can hardly think of one more ripe for virality than the one about a handsome tomboy coolly kabedon-ing her doe-eyed boy squeeze. Online wasn't quite ready for Witch Craft Works and its perpetually princess-carried male protagonist—a fact towards which I will forever be bitter, because that show rules—but I hope, in 2022, Shikimori can at least find some justice. Plus, the previews are bursting with color, and Doga Kobo know how to put together a good-looking anime. Maybe this will be the year of sakuga-rich romcom supremacy.    Beyond that, I have my eye on Vampire in the Garden. No doubt this looks and sounds pretty generic at first blush, but its staff has a good pedigree, and more importantly, I like vampires. Vanitas is nearly over, and Call of the Night doesn't air until the summer, so perhaps Studio Wit can slake my spring bloodthirst. Bubble, also on Wit's docket, will be premiering this season, and I will be heartbroken if the chaotic dream team alignment of Gen Urobuchi, Tetsuro Araki, and Takeshi Obata somehow manages to be boring. I couldn't care less about it being good or not, but it had better be loud. Finally, the only thing I know about SPY x FAMILY is that there's a funny-faced little gremlin girl, and that's good enough for me.          Most Anticipated: Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic  Some ongoing shows can struggle with diminishing returns as they accumulate more seasons, but Kaguya-sama: Love is War seems just a bit more ambitious than that. It's still probably the funniest, most laugh-out-loud anime comedy of the modern era, yes, but recall all the other stuff its second season was able to get up to. The series showed an impressive penchant for pulling off dramatic turns too, which is no small feat when you consider how most of these characters are necessarily stupid as hell. That's the trick though, that this series has endeared these doofuses to me. They're idiots, but they're my idiots, and that even includes Ishigami. Plus, I can't not admire the stones on this series to announce its third season by putting out a whole bonus episode, featuring the characters joking about the very notion of third seasons! Now that's confidence, and if you, like me, have been won over by Kaguya-sama this far along, you know it's earned confidence.    Runner-up: Love Live! Nijigasaki High School Idol Club 2nd Season   There are actually a fair amount of returning faces in this forthcoming Spring season, some more surprising than others. A new Black Rock Shooter? A new Ikki Tousen?! What year is it?! But the other follow-up I'm really looking forward to is the return of those girls in the Nijigasaki High School Idol Club, coming back for another go at what was one of Love Live!'s more atypical iterations. I'm specifically hopeful for this second round since, after the first season necessarily loaded itself up with specific character-focus episodes, having all those now covered means the opportunity for some more complex or ambitious plot-lines featuring all these girls. Of course, I already know that several new members are going to be added to the club this season as well, but given that I'm not a devotee of the mobile game they spawned from, I'm looking forward to getting to know them on my own time. And seeing how they get wrangled into things by the unstoppable swag of that sentient can of Monster Energy known as Yu Takasaki.          Most Anticipated: SPY x FAMILY  This was a no brainer – one of my current favorite manga titles getting an adaptation? Yes, please! Not that that's really any different from my usual criteria for whether I'm anticipating a show or not, but it really felt even easier this time around. That's because the Cold War-set spy spoof is the kind of story that I could see making excellent use of the additional elements anime can provide – music and movement could really work to enhance the way the humor works in the story of the Forger family's semi-secret missions, and giving Anya specifically a voice could help to make her an even more delightful character. Since she's arguably the beating heart of the series, that's especially important. Anya's the only person who knows what's actually going on with pretty much everyone else, because the little dear's a psychic…which no one else has the least clue about. So her adoptive father Loid has no idea that she knows that he's really the master spy Twilight and her adoptive mother Yor is in the dark about the fact that Anya knows she's actually an elite assassin. Mostly poor Anya uses her power to ensure that she gets to keep her happy family without getting sent back to the orphanage, but while this does add an element of pathos, it never overwhelms the zanier aspects of the story. SPY x FAMILY in manga form is a near-perfect blend of goofy spy parody and heartfelt family tale with one of my favorite dog characters (Bond could easily be this season's best boy), and unlike with other manga-to-anime transitions, I have very few worries that this one won't make the leap to anime very well.    And while I'm hoping that those aren't going to be famous last words, I'm also harboring hopes for two other favorite manga titles to make a successful transition: Love After World Domination, which should appeal to fans of Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department, and Ya Boy Kongming!, and not just because it brings my poetry-was-the-rap-battle-of-the-ancient-world teaching method to life. (But okay, mostly because of that.) But my true second pick for most anticipated show this spring is Dance Dance Danseur, surprising precisely no one. While it isn't likely to be Swan or Princess Tutu, the angle of a male dancer in classical ballet isn't one we see all that often, and done well, there's a lot of room for an exploration of the stigma boys face for taking up ballet and the beauty (and pain) of the art form. If the animation lives up to it, this could be a treat.          Most Anticipated: Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic  This year so far has been a relatively strong contender for romantic comedy anime. Komi-san, My Dress-Up Darling, Sasaki and Miyano, hell even a show like Fantasy Knockout really surprised me. And this new season seems to be shaping up to continue to the streak with Kanamori's Not Just a Cutie already piquing my interest.    There's a lot of top contenders, but when this anime walks in the room everyone else needs to step aside and let the real champion do the fighting. It's time for the big guns, it's not just love, it's war! Kaguya-sama is back baby and she's ready to throw down!! Season 1 was filled with belly-laughing over-the-top punchlines as we watched the two smartest idiots in the room tip-toe-tango around their mutual bludgeoning feelings for each other. Then season 2 delivered a real wallop while being able include the same hilarious jokes and teasing heart pounders, with some real drama! For a character most people didn't even like at first, no less! I was laughing and sobbing, and it's all thanks to the wonderful animation and direction brought by the team to bring out just the maximum amount of emotion. And I expect nothing less from season 3 after two strong showings. Kaguya-sama is a contender not to be overlooked.    Runner-up: SPY x FAMILY   Not a rom-com but equally strong AND cute, is the much awaited adaption of the Shonen Jump spy thriller and family comedy, SPY x FAMILY. I've been a fan of this manga since the beginning. Keeping up with the Forgers is always a good time with the cool undercover spy Loid, the powerful assassin Yor, and the precious and precocious psychic-powered daughter, Anya. Together they make up one family of misfits tied together by a common goal to keep the two neighboring countries at peace. Or at least the best a six-year-old can handle!    It's a good read, and one of my favorite currently running manga in Jump, with enough material to make a compelling show. I can't wait to see people watch it! The trailer looks smooth and colorful with animation by Studio Wit and CloverWorks. Just look at Anya's face! Isn't she such a cutie?! . She's full of great reactions that I can't wait to see animated. Yor and Loid look equally good as a power couple, you can tell they adapted the designs well. The action and music also seem promising from what I can see. I'm hoping for everything cool, cute, and comedic to be in full force here. It's a fun time for the whole family with the SPY x FAMILY!     discuss this in the forum (34 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Feature homepage / archives   ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4, 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgxHxRAm8Xs': 1}"

Below you'll find our editorial team's top (tentative) picks from the 46-odd shows slated to premiere in January. What are your favorite picks? Head on over to our poll and pick your top five. We'll publish the results before preview guide launches on April 1. Also, if you're still having a hard time choosing what to add to your queue, or you're just down for a good time, do check out Anime News Network's Spring 2022 Trailer Watch Party with YouTube personality Geoff Thew (Mother's Basement)!          Most Anticipated: Love After World Domination  Yeah yeah, I know this is likely interrupting a lengthy sweep of SPY x FAMILY top spots, but I'm more than happy to play the spoiler for this adorable-looking Super Sentai RomCom. There's nothing that I enjoy more than a good romantic comedy anime, and this looks like a total treat. The premise is great, the character designs are wonderful, and based on the trailers the animation looks strong all-around. Like this past season's Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department there's the risk of it playing a little too much inside baseball with the tokusatsu angle, but that's a small hurdle to clear for what looks like an absolutely adorable setup.    Runner-Up: SPY x FAMILY   That being said, yeah, I'm hyped for SPY x FAMILY a whole lot too. I've been reading the manga since it began, loving it just as long, and waiting for its inevitable anime adaptation to bring as many people as possible in for this wonderful, funny, and endlessly charming series. And going by the promos the production is seriously on-point. The secret sauce of this story is how it can effortlessly balance intense action and gut-busting humor without sweating a drop, and the trailers look ridiculously great at both. You probably don't need me to tell you this one's worth watching, but it's good enough that I feel compelled to do it anyway.    Alongside those, I am going to be feasting this season. Kaguya-sama is coming back, and as one of the greatest modern romcoms ever made it stands to reason I'm going to devour it. In fact, there's a whole block of romance-tinged series this season for me to chow down on between Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie, Aharen-san wa Hakarenai, and the potential disasterpiece of A Couple of Cuckoos. While I don't know if it'll actually have any romance, just the fact that In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki is from the creator of Teasing Master Takagi-san is enough for me to check it out. There's even some fantasy series of different varieties that look appealing like Healer Girl and The Dawn of the Witch. And of course, this spring marks the beginning of back-to-back seasons of Love Live!, which means I've automatically won for the next six months.          Most Anticipated: SPY X FAMILY  I love a good comedy anime, and some of my favorite comedies of all time are those that revolve around character misunderstandings – shows like Gamers!, School Rumble, and Yamada's First Time that are able to push misunderstandings to absurd lengths through unique circumstances for the sake of comedic payoff. So when I heard that SPY x FAMILY was basically that but with a spy, an assassin, and a telepath, you end up getting more than just my curiosity… you get my full, undivided attention. I marathoned the first six volumes of the manga and it is impressive how deftly the author is able to juggle all the unique abilities and over-the-top characters in such a serious setting. After watching some of the previews and being impressed by the above-average presentation for what is extensively a reactionary type of comedy, I look forward to seeing how some of these classic situations where the characters completely misjudge each other end up playing out.    Runner-Up: Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic    I will admit that I wasn't the biggest fan of Kaguya Sama: Love Is War at first. While the show definitely seemed to fall into my wheelhouse of comedy anime, I initially found it a bit too cynical for its own good. However, as time went on and the show managed to find its emotional foothold, I began to appreciate both its comedy and character writing a lot more. Season two especially allowed me to better appreciate these characters by giving us a better look at where that rather cynical worldview can sometimes come from. I have read a bit of the manga after season two and there's a good chance that season three will feature even more of those intense character moments. Either way, I think there will definitely be a lot of good material to appreciate and I definitely can't wait for another snazzy anime opening!          Most Anticipated: Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs   In 2020's My Next Life as a Villainess: All Routes Lead to Doom!, a young woman is reincarnated as the villainess in a stereotypical girl's dating sim. The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs takes the same general idea and twists it. Instead of a young woman, it's a young man. Instead of becoming the villainess, he is a random background character. Instead of a kind dunce, he's a bit of a self-serving asshole. But that's just the start of things.    As it's based on the setting of a D-grade reverse-harem romance, the fantasy world is full of plot holes, most notably the absurd level of misandry that permeates society. Noblewomen have several lovers beyond their husbands (who are little more than slaves making money for their wives). Second and third sons are married off to elderly women, only to then be sent off to the front lines for an easy life insurance payout. Our hero wants to avoid this fate and is willing to do whatever it takes to do so. His plan is simply to have enough money and power to secure his own independence—too bad he somehow catches the eye of both the heroine and the villainess. It's a hilarious ride where you can both cheer for the hero fighting against this half-baked world and laugh whenever karma smacks him upside the head.    Runner-Up: Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie    So many stories end with the main couple getting together. However, this is where Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie begins. Shikimori is cute and popular, athletic and intelligent. But her boyfriend, Izumi, is none of these things; worse still, he is unlucky and accident-prone to a dangerous degree. However, because of this, he is one of the few to see the other side of his girlfriend. Whenever he is in trouble, be that physical or emotional, her cute veneer fades away and she becomes a suave badass that oozes coolness from every pore.    What I love about this change is that it's accompanied by a shift in Shikimori's character design—her chin becomes sharper, as do her eyes. She looks elegant and dangerous, capable of sweeping anyone off their feet. And while there is an obvious swapping of stereotypical gender roles between Shikimori and Izumi in this story, it's important to remember that Shikimori isn't just the cute girl or the badass; she's both. Shikimori and Izumi simply bring out the best in each other across the board, as any good couple should.          Most Anticipated: Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie  You can blame My Dress-Up Darling for rekindling my romcom torch just in time for Kaguya-sama season 3 and Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie. Since I like to highlight non-sequels here, however, I'll defer my focus to Shikimori, which comes with the blue-ribbon premise of “what if Utena Tenjou was your girlfriend?” If romcoms live or die by their gimmicks, then I can hardly think of one more ripe for virality than the one about a handsome tomboy coolly kabedon-ing her doe-eyed boy squeeze. Online wasn't quite ready for Witch Craft Works and its perpetually princess-carried male protagonist—a fact towards which I will forever be bitter, because that show rules—but I hope, in 2022, Shikimori can at least find some justice. Plus, the previews are bursting with color, and Doga Kobo know how to put together a good-looking anime. Maybe this will be the year of sakuga-rich romcom supremacy.    Beyond that, I have my eye on Vampire in the Garden. No doubt this looks and sounds pretty generic at first blush, but its staff has a good pedigree, and more importantly, I like vampires. Vanitas is nearly over, and Call of the Night doesn't air until the summer, so perhaps Studio Wit can slake my spring bloodthirst. Bubble, also on Wit's docket, will be premiering this season, and I will be heartbroken if the chaotic dream team alignment of Gen Urobuchi, Tetsuro Araki, and Takeshi Obata somehow manages to be boring. I couldn't care less about it being good or not, but it had better be loud. Finally, the only thing I know about SPY x FAMILY is that there's a funny-faced little gremlin girl, and that's good enough for me.          Most Anticipated: Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic  Some ongoing shows can struggle with diminishing returns as they accumulate more seasons, but Kaguya-sama: Love is War seems just a bit more ambitious than that. It's still probably the funniest, most laugh-out-loud anime comedy of the modern era, yes, but recall all the other stuff its second season was able to get up to. The series showed an impressive penchant for pulling off dramatic turns too, which is no small feat when you consider how most of these characters are necessarily stupid as hell. That's the trick though, that this series has endeared these doofuses to me. They're idiots, but they're my idiots, and that even includes Ishigami. Plus, I can't not admire the stones on this series to announce its third season by putting out a whole bonus episode, featuring the characters joking about the very notion of third seasons! Now that's confidence, and if you, like me, have been won over by Kaguya-sama this far along, you know it's earned confidence.    Runner-up: Love Live! Nijigasaki High School Idol Club 2nd Season   There are actually a fair amount of returning faces in this forthcoming Spring season, some more surprising than others. A new Black Rock Shooter? A new Ikki Tousen?! What year is it?! But the other follow-up I'm really looking forward to is the return of those girls in the Nijigasaki High School Idol Club, coming back for another go at what was one of Love Live!'s more atypical iterations. I'm specifically hopeful for this second round since, after the first season necessarily loaded itself up with specific character-focus episodes, having all those now covered means the opportunity for some more complex or ambitious plot-lines featuring all these girls. Of course, I already know that several new members are going to be added to the club this season as well, but given that I'm not a devotee of the mobile game they spawned from, I'm looking forward to getting to know them on my own time. And seeing how they get wrangled into things by the unstoppable swag of that sentient can of Monster Energy known as Yu Takasaki.          Most Anticipated: SPY x FAMILY  This was a no brainer – one of my current favorite manga titles getting an adaptation? Yes, please! Not that that's really any different from my usual criteria for whether I'm anticipating a show or not, but it really felt even easier this time around. That's because the Cold War-set spy spoof is the kind of story that I could see making excellent use of the additional elements anime can provide – music and movement could really work to enhance the way the humor works in the story of the Forger family's semi-secret missions, and giving Anya specifically a voice could help to make her an even more delightful character. Since she's arguably the beating heart of the series, that's especially important. Anya's the only person who knows what's actually going on with pretty much everyone else, because the little dear's a psychic…which no one else has the least clue about. So her adoptive father Loid has no idea that she knows that he's really the master spy Twilight and her adoptive mother Yor is in the dark about the fact that Anya knows she's actually an elite assassin. Mostly poor Anya uses her power to ensure that she gets to keep her happy family without getting sent back to the orphanage, but while this does add an element of pathos, it never overwhelms the zanier aspects of the story. SPY x FAMILY in manga form is a near-perfect blend of goofy spy parody and heartfelt family tale with one of my favorite dog characters (Bond could easily be this season's best boy), and unlike with other manga-to-anime transitions, I have very few worries that this one won't make the leap to anime very well.    And while I'm hoping that those aren't going to be famous last words, I'm also harboring hopes for two other favorite manga titles to make a successful transition: Love After World Domination, which should appeal to fans of Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department, and Ya Boy Kongming!, and not just because it brings my poetry-was-the-rap-battle-of-the-ancient-world teaching method to life. (But okay, mostly because of that.) But my true second pick for most anticipated show this spring is Dance Dance Danseur, surprising precisely no one. While it isn't likely to be Swan or Princess Tutu, the angle of a male dancer in classical ballet isn't one we see all that often, and done well, there's a lot of room for an exploration of the stigma boys face for taking up ballet and the beauty (and pain) of the art form. If the animation lives up to it, this could be a treat.          Most Anticipated: Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic  This year so far has been a relatively strong contender for romantic comedy anime. Komi-san, My Dress-Up Darling, Sasaki and Miyano, hell even a show like Fantasy Knockout really surprised me. And this new season seems to be shaping up to continue to the streak with Kanamori's Not Just a Cutie already piquing my interest.    There's a lot of top contenders, but when this anime walks in the room everyone else needs to step aside and let the real champion do the fighting. It's time for the big guns, it's not just love, it's war! Kaguya-sama is back baby and she's ready to throw down!! Season 1 was filled with belly-laughing over-the-top punchlines as we watched the two smartest idiots in the room tip-toe-tango around their mutual bludgeoning feelings for each other. Then season 2 delivered a real wallop while being able include the same hilarious jokes and teasing heart pounders, with some real drama! For a character most people didn't even like at first, no less! I was laughing and sobbing, and it's all thanks to the wonderful animation and direction brought by the team to bring out just the maximum amount of emotion. And I expect nothing less from season 3 after two strong showings. Kaguya-sama is a contender not to be overlooked.    Runner-up: SPY x FAMILY   Not a rom-com but equally strong AND cute, is the much awaited adaption of the Shonen Jump spy thriller and family comedy, SPY x FAMILY. I've been a fan of this manga since the beginning. Keeping up with the Forgers is always a good time with the cool undercover spy Loid, the powerful assassin Yor, and the precious and precocious psychic-powered daughter, Anya. Together they make up one family of misfits tied together by a common goal to keep the two neighboring countries at peace. Or at least the best a six-year-old can handle!    It's a good read, and one of my favorite currently running manga in Jump, with enough material to make a compelling show. I can't wait to see people watch it! The trailer looks smooth and colorful with animation by Studio Wit and CloverWorks. Just look at Anya's face! Isn't she such a cutie?! . She's full of great reactions that I can't wait to see animated. Yor and Loid look equally good as a power couple, you can tell they adapted the designs well. The action and music also seem promising from what I can see. I'm hoping for everything cool, cute, and comedic to be in full force here. It's a fun time for the whole family with the SPY x FAMILY!

14-04-2022,animation,2,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/preview-guide/2022/spring/estab-life-great-escape/.183655,Estab-Life: Great Escape - The Spring 2022 Preview Guide - Anime News Network:SEA,"    The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Estab-Life: Great Escape   Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Estab-Life: Great Escape ?                     Community score: 2.9                  How would you rate episode 2 of Estab-Life: Great Escape ?                     Community score: 3.0              What is this?   The world population has begun to shrink after reaching its peak. The ""Supernatural Renovation Project"" splits Tokyo with towering walls into several Cluster neighborhoods, each with its own unique genetically modified populations, governed by artificial intelligence. Most people live their lives in their own unique Clusters, blissfully unconcerned with life beyond. However, there are some who seek to escape to the other Clusters. An outfit called Nigashiya helps those who wish to escape.    Estab-Life: Great Escape is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll.      How was the first episode?    Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                You've gotta hand it to Goro Taniguchi. In an industry that always hesitates to release original projects, he's leveraged the success of Code Geass into nearly a decade of making original sci-fi TV series. Granted, none of those creations have managed to be better than “just okay” – a streak that looks to continue with Estab-Life – but you have to respect the hustle. And while I probably won't be watching more of this one, I can at least say I had fun with these introductory episodes.    In a word, Estab-Life is busy. Busy in its aesthetic, with the mishmash of colors and designs that constitute our main characters, the design of the sci-fi world they inhabit, and the occasionally well-executed but largely workmanlike CG animation. Busy in its worldbuilding, as it throws concepts like slime girls and wolf men and “Gun Wizards” at the audience with not a second of exposition to clue you in, while only barely communicating its central conceit of closed-off post-apocalypse cities that our heroes help traffic people in-between. Busy in its tone, as these opening episodes attempt to balance snazzy spy action, goofy comedy, and quiet poignancy in ways that work more than you'd expect, but still not often enough to be effective. There's a lot going on here, and the show is never as graceful about any of it as you'd hope for.    That said, I'm a fan of offbeat sci-fi series, and that's very much the vibe I get from this premiere. The characters are simple archetypes with just enough personality to be likable, and they flit between the high-flying sci-fi action setpieces with just the right amount of energy. That's a good thing to have for what is likely to be an episodic series of missions and character pieces, and if the writing can deliver interesting individual stories it may just be worth keeping up with. I was actually pretty charmed by episode two, with the grizzled yakuza boss who yearns to escape Shinjuku's criminal underbelly and achieve his dream of becoming a magical girl. It's silly and it knows it, but there's an earnest feeling to the comedy that invites you to cheer for him and the other characters rather than trying to laugh at him. There's a central idea that it's ok, important even, to run away when you need to live a better life, and that compassion is a big part of what makes this whole scenario work so far. It's not deep, but it is heartfelt.    All in all this is still a pretty light watch. There's nothing all that compelling, but it has the potential for a fun weekly distraction if nothing else. Its biggest sin is the CG character animation, which isn't terrible but leaves a lot to be desired, especially for any character outside the main cast. I can't decide if the yakuza characters in episode two being identical sunglasses guys in suits is funny on purpose or by accident, but it most definitely saved production resources. But in a time when things like Rusted Armors can come out, I'm not going to complain about largely competent CG. Still, it's enough of a problem that I doubt I'll be sticking around for any more of this.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I feel like Estab-Life is the very definition of “okay.” The plot is contrived and silly, but okay enough to follow, the characters are basically clichés, but okay enough to pay attention to, and the animation isn't EX-ARM levels of bad, but okay enough to watch. It's not quite good enough to be middle-of-the-road, but okay enough to be relatively harmless viewing. The catch is of course that its conceit is on the weirder side of things and that it's animated in the sort of CGI that sends some people running for the hills, especially since “better than EX-ARM and Rusted Armors” isn't exactly a ringing endorsement. Personally, I'm more bothered by Feles' character design; I'd love to take a pair of scissors to that one hunk of hair that hangs over her eye. (Or possibly hedge trimmers; it looks awfully thick.)    While not a lot is explained about the story's world, it is easy enough to put the pieces together, and I do like that we aren't burdened with heavy amounts of exposition. We don't know what happened to break Tokyo up into “clusters,” but it seems to be similar to each ward turning back into its own small town, with the difference being that in the story's dystopian world, moving between them isn't easy and may be outright illegal. That's created the job our heroines do: extracting people from their present lives and moving them into a new one in a different cluster. As a concept, it's neat enough to work, and other bits of world-building thrown in gave it a bit of a fantasy edge from other dystopias, although I'm hoping I'm not the only one who thought of Dragon Half when Martes is revealed to be a slime half. I'm not sure what to make of Ulula the bipedal wolf/furry or some of the other oddball details like the client from the second episode wanting to become a magical girl despite being an old man. Some of them feel like they were just thrown in because they sounded funny to someone rather than having a distinct purpose to fill. (The girls' boss doing low-key dance moves to give them coded messages is another one of those moments.)    I think this may be one of those series that relies on viewer patience for its first third or so before it truly gets moving. The tonal differences between these two episodes, with the first being much more serious than the second, aren't a great sign that it knows what kind of story it wants to tell, and the characters really are pretty cookie-cutter, so if you aren't a fan of their archetypes, that could become an issue. But if you have the patience, I think this may be worth one or two more episodes just to see if it figures out where it's going and what it wants to be – and if the answer to the second question turns out to be something other than “just okay.”       James Beckett  Rating:                A quirk of technology made it so that I accidentally watched the second episode of Estab-Life: Great Escape before the first, and boy howdy, you can probably guess how confused I was when the trio of strange anime girls, their robot, and their anthropomorphic wolf buddy helped an aging yakuza boss shoot himself out of a cannon so he could fulfill his lifelong dream of becoming a magical girl. However, even the actual premiere is very much the kind of episode that is happy to let its audience stew in their confusion for a while as it drip feeds exposition and lore. This isn't a bad thing at all; it just means that even after a double dose of episodes for its premiere, I still don't really know what this show is about. It's pretty fun to watch the weird shenanigans unfold, though.    It also helps that, despite being a fully 3D production, Polygon Pictures has worked hard to ensure that Estab-Life isn't the kind of unholy trash fire that some recent CG anime have been. The facial animations are still plenty awkward, to be sure, and the character animation suffers from a lack of in-betweens to smooth out the transitions between different poses, but it is still a solid effort overall. The direction is efficient and adequately cinematic, and the show's color palette is sufficiently diverse and lush looking. The quality voice acting also livens up the proceedings too; Ekua, Feles, and Martes are all likable and interesting, even if we barely know anything about them yet (except for the fact that Martes is apparently made mostly out of slime, for some reason).    What remains to be seen is if writer Shoji Gatoh's absurd sense of humor is going to mix with the strange sort of pathos that Estab-Life is trying to get from the different clients that the Extractors are helping. Neither the mopey philosophy teacher nor the gung-ho magical girl yakuza boss was terribly interesting, but there's something about the show's nebulous tone that I can't help but find fascinating. I'm definitely willing to give the series another episode or two to see if it can get its hooks into me, but I won't get my hopes up too high, just in case Estab-Life collapses under the weight of its own eccentric ambitions.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                This first episode is a bit of an odd ride. It simply throws us into the middle of things and never really explains itself. And honestly, there is an interesting thought experiment at the center of this: Apparently in the future, Japan is split up into autonomous city-states, each with its own unique laws and varying levels of authoritarianism. In the more controlling states, you can't even decide your own job, much less leave the city-state to join another. Thus, there are “extractors” who illegally help people escape and start new lives elsewhere.    This premise looks primed to be a framework for exploring feelings of entrapment in our daily lives: Sometimes it's in a job we hate. Other times it's in a relationship we know is wrong but just can't seem to leave. Hell, sometimes, it's being trapped in your own skin—feeling the “you” inside doesn't match the outside.    Which is why it's such a shame that Estab-Life fails in every conceivable way to live up to its premise.    For this kind of high-concept story, you need to make the viewer on focus the themes being explored. Bland, one-note, and frankly annoying characters only distract from this. There is no one to really empathize with, not the main characters and not even our disheartened teacher-turned-escapee. (Honestly, if your students aren't taking in your lessons, maybe you need to change how you teach!)    Then there are the visuals. I won't say it looks terrible—we are in the age of EX-ARM and Tesla Note, after all—though they are certainly subpar for what can be done with 3D animation. The real problem is the accidental visual storytelling. Our characters never take cover in gun battles and just stand in the open shooting, implying they are either stupid or invincible. Later we watch a 100 lbs. schoolgirl climb a 10-floor vertical glass face with a 150 lbs. man attached to her back using only her arms. Does she have super strength or is this just bad writing? In the end, it doesn't really matter. What does matter is that it's a distraction from the themes the episode is trying to explore.    To put it as simply as possible: cool ideas, terrible execution.     discuss this in the forum (291 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

I can't decide if the yakuza characters in episode two being identical sunglasses guys in suits is funny on purpose or by accident, but it most definitely saved production resources.

Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I feel like Estab-Life is the very definition of “okay.” The plot is contrived and silly, but okay enough to follow, the characters are basically clichés, but okay enough to pay attention to, and the animation isn't EX-ARM levels of bad, but okay enough to watch.

(Or possibly hedge trimmers; it looks awfully thick.)    While not a lot is explained about the story's world, it is easy enough to put the pieces together, and I do like that we aren't burdened with heavy amounts of exposition. We don't know what happened to break Tokyo up into “clusters,” but it seems to be similar to each ward turning back into its own small town, with the difference being that in the story's dystopian world, moving between them isn't easy and may be outright illegal. That's created the job our heroines do: extracting people from their present lives and moving them into a new one in a different cluster. As a concept, it's neat enough to work, and other bits of world-building thrown in gave it a bit of a fantasy edge from other dystopias, although I'm hoping I'm not the only one who thought of Dragon Half when Martes is revealed to be a slime half. I'm not sure what to make of Ulula the bipedal wolf/furry or some of the other oddball details like the client from the second episode wanting to become a magical girl despite being an old man. Some of them feel like they were just thrown in because they sounded funny to someone rather than having a distinct purpose to fill. (The girls' boss doing low-key dance moves to give them coded messages is another one of those moments.)    I think this may be one of those series that relies on viewer patience for its first third or so before it truly gets moving. The tonal differences between these two episodes, with the first being much more serious than the second, aren't a great sign that it knows what kind of story it wants to tell, and the characters really are pretty cookie-cutter, so if you aren't a fan of their archetypes, that could become an issue. But if you have the patience, I think this may be worth one or two more episodes just to see if it figures out where it's going and what it wants to be – and if the answer to the second question turns out to be something other than “just okay.”       James Beckett  Rating:                A quirk of technology made it so that I accidentally watched the second episode of Estab-Life: Great Escape before the first, and boy howdy, you can probably guess how confused I was when the trio of strange anime girls, their robot, and their anthropomorphic wolf buddy helped an aging yakuza boss shoot himself out of a cannon so he could fulfill his lifelong dream of becoming a magical girl. However, even the actual premiere is very much the kind of episode that is happy to let its audience stew in their confusion for a while as it drip feeds exposition and lore. This isn't a bad thing at all; it just means that even after a double dose of episodes for its premiere, I still don't really know what this show is about. It's pretty fun to watch the weird shenanigans unfold, though.    It also helps that, despite being a fully 3D production, Polygon Pictures has worked hard to ensure that Estab-Life isn't the kind of unholy trash fire that some recent CG anime have been. The facial animations are still plenty awkward, to be sure, and the character animation suffers from a lack of in-betweens to smooth out the transitions between different poses, but it is still a solid effort overall. The direction is efficient and adequately cinematic, and the show's color palette is sufficiently diverse and lush looking. The quality voice acting also livens up the proceedings too; Ekua, Feles, and Martes are all likable and interesting, even if we barely know anything about them yet (except for the fact that Martes is apparently made mostly out of slime, for some reason).    What remains to be seen is if writer Shoji Gatoh's absurd sense of humor is going to mix with the strange sort of pathos that Estab-Life is trying to get from the different clients that the Extractors are helping. Neither the mopey philosophy teacher nor the gung-ho magical girl yakuza boss was terribly interesting, but there's something about the show's nebulous tone that I can't help but find fascinating. I'm definitely willing to give the series another episode or two to see if it can get its hooks into me, but I won't get my hopes up too high, just in case Estab-Life collapses under the weight of its own eccentric ambitions.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                This first episode is a bit of an odd ride. It simply throws us into the middle of things and never really explains itself. And honestly, there is an interesting thought experiment at the center of this: Apparently in the future, Japan is split up into autonomous city-states, each with its own unique laws and varying levels of authoritarianism. In the more controlling states, you can't even decide your own job, much less leave the city-state to join another. Thus, there are “extractors” who illegally help people escape and start new lives elsewhere.    This premise looks primed to be a framework for exploring feelings of entrapment in our daily lives: Sometimes it's in a job we hate. Other times it's in a relationship we know is wrong but just can't seem to leave. Hell, sometimes, it's being trapped in your own skin—feeling the “you” inside doesn't match the outside.    Which is why it's such a shame that Estab-Life fails in every conceivable way to live up to its premise.    For this kind of high-concept story, you need to make the viewer on focus the themes being explored. Bland, one-note, and frankly annoying characters only distract from this. There is no one to really empathize with, not the main characters and not even our disheartened teacher-turned-escapee. (Honestly, if your students aren't taking in your lessons, maybe you need to change how you teach!)    Then there are the visuals. I won't say it looks terrible—we are in the age of EX-ARM and Tesla Note, after all—though they are certainly subpar for what can be done with 3D animation. The real problem is the accidental visual storytelling. Our characters never take cover in gun battles and just stand in the open shooting, implying they are either stupid or invincible. Later we watch a 100 lbs. schoolgirl climb a 10-floor vertical glass face with a 150 lbs. man attached to her back using only her arms. Does she have super strength or is this just bad writing? In the end, it doesn't really matter. What does matter is that it's a distraction from the themes the episode is trying to explore.

The world population has begun to shrink after reaching its peak. The ""Supernatural Renovation Project"" splits Tokyo with towering walls into several Cluster neighborhoods, each with its own unique genetically modified populations, governed by artificial intelligence. Most people live their lives in their own unique Clusters, blissfully unconcerned with life beyond. However, there are some who seek to escape to the other Clusters. An outfit called Nigashiya helps those who wish to escape.    Estab-Life: Great Escape is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll.      How was the first episode?    Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                You've gotta hand it to Goro Taniguchi. In an industry that always hesitates to release original projects, he's leveraged the success of Code Geass into nearly a decade of making original sci-fi TV series. Granted, none of those creations have managed to be better than “just okay” – a streak that looks to continue with Estab-Life – but you have to respect the hustle. And while I probably won't be watching more of this one, I can at least say I had fun with these introductory episodes.    In a word, Estab-Life is busy. Busy in its aesthetic, with the mishmash of colors and designs that constitute our main characters, the design of the sci-fi world they inhabit, and the occasionally well-executed but largely workmanlike CG animation. Busy in its worldbuilding, as it throws concepts like slime girls and wolf men and “Gun Wizards” at the audience with not a second of exposition to clue you in, while only barely communicating its central conceit of closed-off post-apocalypse cities that our heroes help traffic people in-between. Busy in its tone, as these opening episodes attempt to balance snazzy spy action, goofy comedy, and quiet poignancy in ways that work more than you'd expect, but still not often enough to be effective. There's a lot going on here, and the show is never as graceful about any of it as you'd hope for.    That said, I'm a fan of offbeat sci-fi series, and that's very much the vibe I get from this premiere.

The world population has begun to shrink after reaching its peak. The ""Supernatural Renovation Project"" splits Tokyo with towering walls into several Cluster neighborhoods, each with its own unique genetically modified populations, governed by artificial intelligence. Most people live their lives in their own unique Clusters, blissfully unconcerned with life beyond. However, there are some who seek to escape to the other Clusters. An outfit called Nigashiya helps those who wish to escape.    Estab-Life: Great Escape is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll.      How was the first episode?    Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                You've gotta hand it to Goro Taniguchi. In an industry that always hesitates to release original projects, he's leveraged the success of Code Geass into nearly a decade of making original sci-fi TV series. Granted, none of those creations have managed to be better than “just okay” – a streak that looks to continue with Estab-Life – but you have to respect the hustle. And while I probably won't be watching more of this one, I can at least say I had fun with these introductory episodes.    In a word, Estab-Life is busy. Busy in its aesthetic, with the mishmash of colors and designs that constitute our main characters, the design of the sci-fi world they inhabit, and the occasionally well-executed but largely workmanlike CG animation. Busy in its worldbuilding, as it throws concepts like slime girls and wolf men and “Gun Wizards” at the audience with not a second of exposition to clue you in, while only barely communicating its central conceit of closed-off post-apocalypse cities that our heroes help traffic people in-between. Busy in its tone, as these opening episodes attempt to balance snazzy spy action, goofy comedy, and quiet poignancy in ways that work more than you'd expect, but still not often enough to be effective. There's a lot going on here, and the show is never as graceful about any of it as you'd hope for.    That said, I'm a fan of offbeat sci-fi series, and that's very much the vibe I get from this premiere. The characters are simple archetypes with just enough personality to be likable, and they flit between the high-flying sci-fi action setpieces with just the right amount of energy. That's a good thing to have for what is likely to be an episodic series of missions and character pieces, and if the writing can deliver interesting individual stories it may just be worth keeping up with. I was actually pretty charmed by episode two, with the grizzled yakuza boss who yearns to escape Shinjuku's criminal underbelly and achieve his dream of becoming a magical girl. It's silly and it knows it, but there's an earnest feeling to the comedy that invites you to cheer for him and the other characters rather than trying to laugh at him. There's a central idea that it's ok, important even, to run away when you need to live a better life, and that compassion is a big part of what makes this whole scenario work so far. It's not deep, but it is heartfelt.    All in all this is still a pretty light watch. There's nothing all that compelling, but it has the potential for a fun weekly distraction if nothing else. Its biggest sin is the CG character animation, which isn't terrible but leaves a lot to be desired, especially for any character outside the main cast. I can't decide if the yakuza characters in episode two being identical sunglasses guys in suits is funny on purpose or by accident, but it most definitely saved production resources. But in a time when things like Rusted Armors can come out, I'm not going to complain about largely competent CG. Still, it's enough of a problem that I doubt I'll be sticking around for any more of this.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I feel like Estab-Life is the very definition of “okay.” The plot is contrived and silly, but okay enough to follow, the characters are basically clichés, but okay enough to pay attention to, and the animation isn't EX-ARM levels of bad, but okay enough to watch. It's not quite good enough to be middle-of-the-road, but okay enough to be relatively harmless viewing. The catch is of course that its conceit is on the weirder side of things and that it's animated in the sort of CGI that sends some people running for the hills, especially since “better than EX-ARM and Rusted Armors” isn't exactly a ringing endorsement. Personally, I'm more bothered by Feles' character design; I'd love to take a pair of scissors to that one hunk of hair that hangs over her eye. (Or possibly hedge trimmers; it looks awfully thick.)    While not a lot is explained about the story's world, it is easy enough to put the pieces together, and I do like that we aren't burdened with heavy amounts of exposition. We don't know what happened to break Tokyo up into “clusters,” but it seems to be similar to each ward turning back into its own small town, with the difference being that in the story's dystopian world, moving between them isn't easy and may be outright illegal. That's created the job our heroines do: extracting people from their present lives and moving them into a new one in a different cluster. As a concept, it's neat enough to work, and other bits of world-building thrown in gave it a bit of a fantasy edge from other dystopias, although I'm hoping I'm not the only one who thought of Dragon Half when Martes is revealed to be a slime half. I'm not sure what to make of Ulula the bipedal wolf/furry or some of the other oddball details like the client from the second episode wanting to become a magical girl despite being an old man. Some of them feel like they were just thrown in because they sounded funny to someone rather than having a distinct purpose to fill. (The girls' boss doing low-key dance moves to give them coded messages is another one of those moments.)    I think this may be one of those series that relies on viewer patience for its first third or so before it truly gets moving. The tonal differences between these two episodes, with the first being much more serious than the second, aren't a great sign that it knows what kind of story it wants to tell, and the characters really are pretty cookie-cutter, so if you aren't a fan of their archetypes, that could become an issue. But if you have the patience, I think this may be worth one or two more episodes just to see if it figures out where it's going and what it wants to be – and if the answer to the second question turns out to be something other than “just okay.”       James Beckett  Rating:                A quirk of technology made it so that I accidentally watched the second episode of Estab-Life: Great Escape before the first, and boy howdy, you can probably guess how confused I was when the trio of strange anime girls, their robot, and their anthropomorphic wolf buddy helped an aging yakuza boss shoot himself out of a cannon so he could fulfill his lifelong dream of becoming a magical girl. However, even the actual premiere is very much the kind of episode that is happy to let its audience stew in their confusion for a while as it drip feeds exposition and lore. This isn't a bad thing at all; it just means that even after a double dose of episodes for its premiere, I still don't really know what this show is about. It's pretty fun to watch the weird shenanigans unfold, though.    It also helps that, despite being a fully 3D production, Polygon Pictures has worked hard to ensure that Estab-Life isn't the kind of unholy trash fire that some recent CG anime have been. The facial animations are still plenty awkward, to be sure, and the character animation suffers from a lack of in-betweens to smooth out the transitions between different poses, but it is still a solid effort overall. The direction is efficient and adequately cinematic, and the show's color palette is sufficiently diverse and lush looking. The quality voice acting also livens up the proceedings too; Ekua, Feles, and Martes are all likable and interesting, even if we barely know anything about them yet (except for the fact that Martes is apparently made mostly out of slime, for some reason).    What remains to be seen is if writer Shoji Gatoh's absurd sense of humor is going to mix with the strange sort of pathos that Estab-Life is trying to get from the different clients that the Extractors are helping. Neither the mopey philosophy teacher nor the gung-ho magical girl yakuza boss was terribly interesting, but there's something about the show's nebulous tone that I can't help but find fascinating. I'm definitely willing to give the series another episode or two to see if it can get its hooks into me, but I won't get my hopes up too high, just in case Estab-Life collapses under the weight of its own eccentric ambitions.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                This first episode is a bit of an odd ride. It simply throws us into the middle of things and never really explains itself. And honestly, there is an interesting thought experiment at the center of this: Apparently in the future, Japan is split up into autonomous city-states, each with its own unique laws and varying levels of authoritarianism. In the more controlling states, you can't even decide your own job, much less leave the city-state to join another. Thus, there are “extractors” who illegally help people escape and start new lives elsewhere.    This premise looks primed to be a framework for exploring feelings of entrapment in our daily lives: Sometimes it's in a job we hate. Other times it's in a relationship we know is wrong but just can't seem to leave. Hell, sometimes, it's being trapped in your own skin—feeling the “you” inside doesn't match the outside.    Which is why it's such a shame that Estab-Life fails in every conceivable way to live up to its premise.    For this kind of high-concept story, you need to make the viewer on focus the themes being explored. Bland, one-note, and frankly annoying characters only distract from this. There is no one to really empathize with, not the main characters and not even our disheartened teacher-turned-escapee. (Honestly, if your students aren't taking in your lessons, maybe you need to change how you teach!)    Then there are the visuals. I won't say it looks terrible—we are in the age of EX-ARM and Tesla Note, after all—though they are certainly subpar for what can be done with 3D animation. The real problem is the accidental visual storytelling. Our characters never take cover in gun battles and just stand in the open shooting, implying they are either stupid or invincible.

14-04-2022,animation,1,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/preview-guide/2022/spring/dance-dance-danseur/.183671,Dance Dance Danseur - The Spring 2022 Preview Guide - Anime News Network:SEA,"    The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Dance Dance Danseur   Apr  9th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Dance Dance Danseur ?                     Community score: 3.7              What is this?   Junpei Murao was fascinated with ballet as a child, but in his second year of middle school, his father passed away and he decided he needed to become more ""masculine,"" and he gave up on his aspirations. While still having an attachment to ballet, he takes up the martial art of Jeet Kune Do, and becomes popular in his class. Then one day, a new transfer student named Miyako Godai arrives in Junpei's class, and her mother runs a ballet studio. Miyako realizes that Junpei is interested in ballet, and invites him to do ballet together.    Dance Dance Danseur is based on George Asakura's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                 Hey, did you know that toxic masculinity really messes people up? It's insidious. It trickles down to others subconsciously, teaching men, even as children, to encourage those who follow the classical male ideal and shame those who do not. Dance Dance Danseur is like a case study showing how these commonly held beliefs can rob a child of his dream and destiny—and how he has to fight against his own ingrained worldview to get them back.    As a child, we see that Junpei was willing and able to follow his dream to become a ballet dancer. He was even willing to fight his friends when they disparaged it. However, what really messed him up was the death of his father. His father was a martial artist and stuntman; in other words, he was about as stereotypical of a manly man as you can get.    When Junpei brings up his dream to his father, his father initially tries to dissuade him and get him to do Jeet Kun Do instead. This is partly due to his own ingrained toxic masculinity, but it's also because he wants a shared interest through which he can connect with his son. But Junpei can't see that second bit. All he can see is that his father wanted him to do something more manly than ballet, an idea that is reinforced when his uncle (a likewise manly man) tells the young boy to be strong for his family after his father's passing. In his own way, he is trying to help Junpei through his grief by giving him a reason to fight on, but Junpei (being a literal child) only hears: manly=good, girly=bad.    Now, years later, Junpei has done everything he can to be the manliest man he can be. He sees it as his way of honoring his father, making his family and friends happy with how great he has become. The only problem is that in doing so, he has forgone his own chance at true happiness. Is it any surprise he's turned out to be such an angry young man? He forced his own desires deep down inside but they keep bubbling up. The loving support of his mother and sister isn't enough for him to accept his true self. What he needs is someone to confront him on a “masculine level”—to aggressively attack him right in the male ego and make doing ballet part of his manly pride. Its only through regaining his own inborn self-worth—by determining for himself what it means to be a man—that Junpei can find happiness. And while in this episode he has taken a step towards that, it is only the first step of many.    Dance Dance Danseur's first episode is a fantastic breakdown of toxic masculinity and the harm it subconsciously inflicts on children. Moreover, it has fantastic animation and a great moral. Honestly, there's not much here to dislike.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This is one of those premieres that's frustrating in good and bad ways. For the good, when this episode ended I seriously wanted the next one right away, which means this premiere did its job. For the bad, part of the reason I wanted another episode is because this one only feels like half a story.    On the one hand, that may be a good decision – plenty of otherwise good shows rush through their premieres in order to get to some kind of climax, sacrificing important character work to reach a suitably big moment to end on. So it may ultimately be good thing that Junpei's story feels like it's still stuck on the tarmac waiting for permission to take off. Because what we do get from him is really interesting, and tells us a lot about who this kid is and what the overall theme of this story will be. We see a kid who clearly wants to follow his passion, but a mixture of grief and toxic masculinity keeps him from pursuing it.    Those combative forces cause him to waffle a lot through this episode, insisting he's left ballet behind as a childhood whim while coming back to Miyako's studio every day once the offer's extended. It can be a little irksome to see him going back and forth like that, but it also builds anticipation for that moment when he'll finally let go of all that baggage and dance the way he so obviously wants to. But that moment is not coming now, and it does feel a little underwhelming when the episode just kind of stops, rather than ending. We've gotten the setup, but no payoff. There's enough good stuff here that I'm confident that payoff will deliver, but having to wait is, well, frustrating.    The other stumbling block for some will probably be the character designs. An admirable job has been done to translate George Asakura's lanky, limpid-eyed designs for animation. The dance scenes are also all-around solid, capturing the grace and precision that can make ballet such a delight to watch. It's everything that isn't a dance sequence that leaves some worries for me – there's a number of awkward still frames and edits that could just be a consequence of the brisk pace of this premiere, or be portents of a looming production collapse from an overburdened MAPPA. I'd like it to be the former, as there's a ton of potential for an anime that can really deliver on honest-to-goodness ballet performances, and it'd suck to see that fall apart.    Hangups aside, there's a lot of good here and it's a unique offering in an already packed season. That will hopefully make it stand out, and if nothing else I'll be hanging around until we get that big moment of catharsis for Junpei. Consider it a hesitant thumbs up.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                If you don't know, until I broke my left ankle in four places, I was a dancer. Primarily modern dance, but ballet as well, and I was serious about it that I would have, as the unpleasantly abrasive dance teacher says in this episode, given up everything else to pursue it. But that's not how life works, and it certainly gives me mixed feelings about Dance Dance Danseur's first episode. On the one hand, I absolutely agree with some of what the teacher says – to really excel in dance on a professional level, you do have to start early and you do have to give up most other things…and even then, it might not work out, as one of my cousins learned when she was told she didn't have the right body type to ever be a prima ballerina. But there are also ways to enjoy being a dancer without putting in that level of commitment, and there's nothing that says that Junpei can't perform and be a dancer while still keeping up with his other activities.    That of course is part of the conflict. Junpei's always wanted to do ballet, but the levels of fragile and toxic masculinity around him are astronomical, preventing him from pursuing what he loves. His dad's comment that people “already think he's a girl” because he plays piano made my skin crawl, because way to randomly gender music and dance, sir. Then when his uncle (who I suspect may be one of those family friend uncles rather than blood related) tells him after his father's death that Jumpei has to be the man in the family now, the damage is complete—Junpei has to be the man, dancing isn't manly, therefore, he can't be a dancer. It's terrible and all too familiar, and the poor kid is still busy lying to himself when he's a second year in middle school, fooling everyone except his older sister and Miyako, the newish girl at school. Miyako knows a dance move when she sees one, no matter what crap Junpei feeds everyone else about martial arts kicks, and she becomes the one person who's willing to support him—or at least to do so without being a jerk about it, like her mother.    Basically this episode was an exercise in frustration begging for relief that will almost certainly come in later episodes. Junpei is clearly working towards accepting himself and what he loves, and he's got a lot to work through, including being a fourteen-year-old boy who can't think of any reason why Miyako would want him to dance besides that she likes him. (More likely the reason is that there are so few male dancers that she's having a hard time finding a partner her age.) It's mostly a good frustration, because it does look to be in service of something rewarding, and the dancing is well enough animated that we can feel the muscles engaging, especially in the opening performance that hooks Jumpei on dance in the first place. Likewise we can see how Jumpei is self-taught in his movements, which is an excellent detail. I'll need to give it a couple more episodes before I decide, because this is a subject I could be very picky about, but since it seems to be as close to a Swan anime (or even getting the rest of the manga in English) as I'm likely to get, I suspect I'll end up taking it.     discuss this in the forum (291 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 3.7              What is this?   Junpei Murao was fascinated with ballet as a child, but in his second year of middle school, his father passed away and he decided he needed to become more ""masculine,"" and he gave up on his aspirations. While still having an attachment to ballet, he takes up the martial art of Jeet Kune Do, and becomes popular in his class. Then one day, a new transfer student named Miyako Godai arrives in Junpei's class, and her mother runs a ballet studio. Miyako realizes that Junpei is interested in ballet, and invites him to do ballet together.    Dance Dance Danseur is based on George Asakura's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                 Hey, did you know that toxic masculinity really messes people up? It's insidious. It trickles down to others subconsciously, teaching men, even as children, to encourage those who follow the classical male ideal and shame those who do not. Dance Dance Danseur is like a case study showing how these commonly held beliefs can rob a child of his dream and destiny—and how he has to fight against his own ingrained worldview to get them back.    As a child, we see that Junpei was willing and able to follow his dream to become a ballet dancer. He was even willing to fight his friends when they disparaged it. However, what really messed him up was the death of his father. His father was a martial artist and stuntman; in other words, he was about as stereotypical of a manly man as you can get.    When Junpei brings up his dream to his father, his father initially tries to dissuade him and get him to do Jeet Kun Do instead. This is partly due to his own ingrained toxic masculinity, but it's also because he wants a shared interest through which he can connect with his son. But Junpei can't see that second bit. All he can see is that his father wanted him to do something more manly than ballet, an idea that is reinforced when his uncle (a likewise manly man) tells the young boy to be strong for his family after his father's passing. In his own way, he is trying to help Junpei through his grief by giving him a reason to fight on, but Junpei (being a literal child) only hears: manly=good, girly=bad.    Now, years later, Junpei has done everything he can to be the manliest man he can be. He sees it as his way of honoring his father, making his family and friends happy with how great he has become. The only problem is that in doing so, he has forgone his own chance at true happiness. Is it any surprise he's turned out to be such an angry young man? He forced his own desires deep down inside but they keep bubbling up. The loving support of his mother and sister isn't enough for him to accept his true self. What he needs is someone to confront him on a “masculine level”—to aggressively attack him right in the male ego and make doing ballet part of his manly pride. Its only through regaining his own inborn self-worth—by determining for himself what it means to be a man—that Junpei can find happiness. And while in this episode he has taken a step towards that, it is only the first step of many.    Dance Dance Danseur's first episode is a fantastic breakdown of toxic masculinity and the harm it subconsciously inflicts on children. Moreover, it has fantastic animation and a great moral. Honestly, there's not much here to dislike.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This is one of those premieres that's frustrating in good and bad ways. For the good, when this episode ended I seriously wanted the next one right away, which means this premiere did its job. For the bad, part of the reason I wanted another episode is because this one only feels like half a story.    On the one hand, that may be a good decision – plenty of otherwise good shows rush through their premieres in order to get to some kind of climax, sacrificing important character work to reach a suitably big moment to end on. So it may ultimately be good thing that Junpei's story feels like it's still stuck on the tarmac waiting for permission to take off. Because what we do get from him is really interesting, and tells us a lot about who this kid is and what the overall theme of this story will be. We see a kid who clearly wants to follow his passion, but a mixture of grief and toxic masculinity keeps him from pursuing it.    Those combative forces cause him to waffle a lot through this episode, insisting he's left ballet behind as a childhood whim while coming back to Miyako's studio every day once the offer's extended. It can be a little irksome to see him going back and forth like that, but it also builds anticipation for that moment when he'll finally let go of all that baggage and dance the way he so obviously wants to. But that moment is not coming now, and it does feel a little underwhelming when the episode just kind of stops, rather than ending. We've gotten the setup, but no payoff. There's enough good stuff here that I'm confident that payoff will deliver, but having to wait is, well, frustrating.    The other stumbling block for some will probably be the character designs. An admirable job has been done to translate George Asakura's lanky, limpid-eyed designs for animation. The dance scenes are also all-around solid, capturing the grace and precision that can make ballet such a delight to watch. It's everything that isn't a dance sequence that leaves some worries for me – there's a number of awkward still frames and edits that could just be a consequence of the brisk pace of this premiere, or be portents of a looming production collapse from an overburdened MAPPA. I'd like it to be the former, as there's a ton of potential for an anime that can really deliver on honest-to-goodness ballet performances, and it'd suck to see that fall apart.    Hangups aside, there's a lot of good here and it's a unique offering in an already packed season. That will hopefully make it stand out, and if nothing else I'll be hanging around until we get that big moment of catharsis for Junpei. Consider it a hesitant thumbs up.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                If you don't know, until I broke my left ankle in four places, I was a dancer. Primarily modern dance, but ballet as well, and I was serious about it that I would have, as the unpleasantly abrasive dance teacher says in this episode, given up everything else to pursue it. But that's not how life works, and it certainly gives me mixed feelings about Dance Dance Danseur's first episode.

Junpei is clearly working towards accepting himself and what he loves, and he's got a lot to work through, including being a fourteen-year-old boy who can't think of any reason why Miyako would want him to dance besides that she likes him. (More likely the reason is that there are so few male dancers that she's having a hard time finding a partner her age.) It's mostly a good frustration, because it does look to be in service of something rewarding, and the dancing is well enough animated that we can feel the muscles engaging, especially in the opening performance that hooks Jumpei on dance in the first place. Likewise we can see how Jumpei is self-taught in his movements, which is an excellent detail. I'll need to give it a couple more episodes before I decide, because this is a subject I could be very picky about, but since it seems to be as close to a Swan anime (or even getting the rest of the manga in English) as I'm likely to get, I suspect I'll end up taking it.     discuss this in the forum (291 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives   ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 3.7              What is this?   Junpei Murao was fascinated with ballet as a child, but in his second year of middle school, his father passed away and he decided he needed to become more ""masculine,"" and he gave up on his aspirations. While still having an attachment to ballet, he takes up the martial art of Jeet Kune Do, and becomes popular in his class. Then one day, a new transfer student named Miyako Godai arrives in Junpei's class, and her mother runs a ballet studio. Miyako realizes that Junpei is interested in ballet, and invites him to do ballet together.    Dance Dance Danseur is based on George Asakura's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                 Hey, did you know that toxic masculinity really messes people up? It's insidious. It trickles down to others subconsciously, teaching men, even as children, to encourage those who follow the classical male ideal and shame those who do not. Dance Dance Danseur is like a case study showing how these commonly held beliefs can rob a child of his dream and destiny—and how he has to fight against his own ingrained worldview to get them back.    As a child, we see that Junpei was willing and able to follow his dream to become a ballet dancer. He was even willing to fight his friends when they disparaged it. However, what really messed him up was the death of his father. His father was a martial artist and stuntman; in other words, he was about as stereotypical of a manly man as you can get.    When Junpei brings up his dream to his father, his father initially tries to dissuade him and get him to do Jeet Kun Do instead. This is partly due to his own ingrained toxic masculinity, but it's also because he wants a shared interest through which he can connect with his son. But Junpei can't see that second bit. All he can see is that his father wanted him to do something more manly than ballet, an idea that is reinforced when his uncle (a likewise manly man) tells the young boy to be strong for his family after his father's passing. In his own way, he is trying to help Junpei through his grief by giving him a reason to fight on, but Junpei (being a literal child) only hears: manly=good, girly=bad.    Now, years later, Junpei has done everything he can to be the manliest man he can be. He sees it as his way of honoring his father, making his family and friends happy with how great he has become. The only problem is that in doing so, he has forgone his own chance at true happiness. Is it any surprise he's turned out to be such an angry young man? He forced his own desires deep down inside but they keep bubbling up. The loving support of his mother and sister isn't enough for him to accept his true self. What he needs is someone to confront him on a “masculine level”—to aggressively attack him right in the male ego and make doing ballet part of his manly pride. Its only through regaining his own inborn self-worth—by determining for himself what it means to be a man—that Junpei can find happiness. And while in this episode he has taken a step towards that, it is only the first step of many.    Dance Dance Danseur's first episode is a fantastic breakdown of toxic masculinity and the harm it subconsciously inflicts on children. Moreover, it has fantastic animation and a great moral. Honestly, there's not much here to dislike.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This is one of those premieres that's frustrating in good and bad ways. For the good, when this episode ended I seriously wanted the next one right away, which means this premiere did its job. For the bad, part of the reason I wanted another episode is because this one only feels like half a story.    On the one hand, that may be a good decision – plenty of otherwise good shows rush through their premieres in order to get to some kind of climax, sacrificing important character work to reach a suitably big moment to end on. So it may ultimately be good thing that Junpei's story feels like it's still stuck on the tarmac waiting for permission to take off. Because what we do get from him is really interesting, and tells us a lot about who this kid is and what the overall theme of this story will be. We see a kid who clearly wants to follow his passion, but a mixture of grief and toxic masculinity keeps him from pursuing it.    Those combative forces cause him to waffle a lot through this episode, insisting he's left ballet behind as a childhood whim while coming back to Miyako's studio every day once the offer's extended. It can be a little irksome to see him going back and forth like that, but it also builds anticipation for that moment when he'll finally let go of all that baggage and dance the way he so obviously wants to. But that moment is not coming now, and it does feel a little underwhelming when the episode just kind of stops, rather than ending. We've gotten the setup, but no payoff. There's enough good stuff here that I'm confident that payoff will deliver, but having to wait is, well, frustrating.    The other stumbling block for some will probably be the character designs. An admirable job has been done to translate George Asakura's lanky, limpid-eyed designs for animation. The dance scenes are also all-around solid, capturing the grace and precision that can make ballet such a delight to watch. It's everything that isn't a dance sequence that leaves some worries for me – there's a number of awkward still frames and edits that could just be a consequence of the brisk pace of this premiere, or be portents of a looming production collapse from an overburdened MAPPA. I'd like it to be the former, as there's a ton of potential for an anime that can really deliver on honest-to-goodness ballet performances, and it'd suck to see that fall apart.    Hangups aside, there's a lot of good here and it's a unique offering in an already packed season. That will hopefully make it stand out, and if nothing else I'll be hanging around until we get that big moment of catharsis for Junpei. Consider it a hesitant thumbs up.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                If you don't know, until I broke my left ankle in four places, I was a dancer. Primarily modern dance, but ballet as well, and I was serious about it that I would have, as the unpleasantly abrasive dance teacher says in this episode, given up everything else to pursue it. But that's not how life works, and it certainly gives me mixed feelings about Dance Dance Danseur's first episode. On the one hand, I absolutely agree with some of what the teacher says – to really excel in dance on a professional level, you do have to start early and you do have to give up most other things…and even then, it might not work out, as one of my cousins learned when she was told she didn't have the right body type to ever be a prima ballerina. But there are also ways to enjoy being a dancer without putting in that level of commitment, and there's nothing that says that Junpei can't perform and be a dancer while still keeping up with his other activities.    That of course is part of the conflict. Junpei's always wanted to do ballet, but the levels of fragile and toxic masculinity around him are astronomical, preventing him from pursuing what he loves. His dad's comment that people “already think he's a girl” because he plays piano made my skin crawl, because way to randomly gender music and dance, sir. Then when his uncle (who I suspect may be one of those family friend uncles rather than blood related) tells him after his father's death that Jumpei has to be the man in the family now, the damage is complete—Junpei has to be the man, dancing isn't manly, therefore, he can't be a dancer. It's terrible and all too familiar, and the poor kid is still busy lying to himself when he's a second year in middle school, fooling everyone except his older sister and Miyako, the newish girl at school. Miyako knows a dance move when she sees one, no matter what crap Junpei feeds everyone else about martial arts kicks, and she becomes the one person who's willing to support him—or at least to do so without being a jerk about it, like her mother.

The setting is one we've all seen before: There's been a robot apocalypse of sorts and now humanity is on its last legs. However, there are a few AI who continue to fight for the human race—including our titular heroine, Black Rock Shooter.    This anime starts with the classic go-to for creating an audience POV character: amnesia. Not only does it allow Black Rock Shooter to ask all the dumb questions that any person living in the fictional world would already know the answers to, it also allows her to be super powerful without any explanation. Of course, the big drawback here is that, without memories, Black Rock Shooter has very little in the way of personality. All she knows is that she has to reach “lighthouse no. 8” and that she's not willing to abandon those in her care regardless of the tactical situation. It's a solid enough starting point, but for the moment she's not much of a character.    Unfortunately, neither are the other three main characters of this episode. We have the stereotypical protective big brother/sick little sister duo and a hardass military commander. Honestly, there's nothing more to them than that—which leaves the action to carry the show.    More than anything else, this first episode is a series of fight scenes. All of them are decently choreographed and show off the above average CG animation used in the show, further bolstered by a surprisingly rocking soundtrack. However, the black, brown, and grey color pallet can make it hard to see what is happening at times—especially during the fights that occur at night.

Fear not, citizens! The recap movie and sequel are on Netflix right now and Jean-Karlo and Nicky are ready to give you the official This Week in Anime™ experience.    These movies are streaming on Netflix   Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the participants in this chatlog are not the views of Anime News Network.Spoiler Warning for discussion of the series ahead.     @Lossthief    @mouse_inhouse    @NickyEnchilada    @vestenet      Nicky  Hey, everybody, it's me and Jean-Karlo here, and today we announce that due to recent changes in upper-management This Week in Anime will include regular shout-outs to sponsors!     Jean-Karlo  This week's This Week in Anime was brought to you by Crab! It all comes crawling back to Crab™!     Crab and very region-specific Pepsi sounds like an interesting flavor combo, NGL. But still not as interesting of a combo as the hero duo Tiger & Bunny!     The original Tiger & Bunny anime came out a bit before the massive influx of superheroes became the mono-culture in the U.S. And weirdly enough, it's taken this long for the series to come back with a new season. Netflix is also streaming two movies for the Tiger & Bunny series, The Beginning and The Rising.   These two films came out in 2012 and 2014 respectively but have just now been re-released for streaming on Netflix in honor of that hot new second season. The Beginning is half re-cap of the early part of the series and serves as a great re-introduction for our Super Hero Buddy Cops, while The Rising takes place after the series proper with entirely new material.     Now, I love me some Japanese superheroes, especially the old blood. Yatterman, Gatchaman, Kamen Rider, Casshern, Ultraman, that stuff. And I was always interested in how Japan would handle a take on more Americanized superheroes. Tiger & Bunny has been beloved by fans since its premiere, and not just because of the wave of heroes the Mouse of House churns out on a daily basis. It's a fascinating show, all the way down to the folks wearing those fancy sponsored CG costumes.   Tiger & Bunny is conceptually rich because it fully breaks down the idea of commercialized heroing as an industry, including real company sponsors (which leads to some funny dissonance). The heroes of Sternbild receive live TV coverage and toe the line between being enforcers, performers, and public motivators, along with everything else that life throws at them, on and off the cameras. The focus on the corporate inner workings is part of what makes it feel more mature. It's not just some kids' fantasy of saving people, but a more detailed look at what would happen if someone really tried to make this their job.   Normally, all the heroes compete for points with each other. But when veteran Wild Tiger, real name Kotetsu Kaburagi, moves to a new company after his previous one folds, he's paired with the young and ambitious Barnaby Brooks Jr., to which he affectionally nicknames Bunny, much to his new partner's annoyance.      What makes Tiger & Bunny work – unlike a lot of ""these heroes are realistic!"" joints like The Boys – is that it's not relentlessly dour. The characters aren't irredeemable louts or psychopaths, they're just people trying to make an honest living while living under the whims of an unfeeling, uncaring management system. These people live or die by their sponsors. It's more Mystery Men than anything else, and that's a damn original place to start from when you're making a superhero movie.   It also leans heavily into the showbiz stuff more than any other cape thing I had watched before, but if anything its core is its ensemble cast of heroes and trying to build the companionship between the two main characters. Like many stories about manly bonds, the two of them start out pretty prickly at first, but both have also suffered severe losses of love in their lives. Kotetsu has a 10-year-old daughter he keeps his work secret from, and has previously lost his wife. Barnaby lost his family to a tragic (extremely plot related) incident that left him traumatized. Just knowing this, you can see how much they could benefit from having someone else to call family in their life. Y'know, assuming you could get one of them to open up.     Kotetsu is a really compelling character, and not just because he's a handsome fail-dad with a stylish outfit. He just needs some loving heart to make him better, or worse, that's a fantasy, too. He's goofy and his sense of heroism really doesn't jive with the mercenary world he's in, but rather than feeling like an idiot he just feels quaint. He's not wrong to want to help people, he's just shouldering more weight than he can carry because he just cares about people that much.     He's definitely meant to appeal to an older audience, a rarity for anime, and he's the the heart of the show despite being a lame guy who struggles to keep up with the younger competition. He constantly lets people down, including his own daughter, but you can tell he really values people's feelings just as much as being a hero.     As if to underline it all: his is the only ""conventional"" superhero outfit among all the other heroes. Everyone else has a fancy suit of armor, but Wild Tiger insists on a cape, a themed cowl, and a strongman suit. Even when he gets his updated power suit, he still wears his old one underneath. You can see him wearing the mask inside his helmet.   Barnaby however is the complete opposite, all suped up in the latest tech and uses his real name and face. He instantly saves Kotetsu's sorry ass and is eager to climb up the ladder. They also both happen to share the same type of power, including the fact that both of them have a time limit to use it.      Where Kotetsu wants to be a hero out of a genuine-to-a-fault desire to help people, Barnaby is wholly self-interested... or so he tells himself. He's convinced that putting his identity out there and acting as a hero can get him the funds and recognition he needs to track down the Oroboros group, the crime ring involved with the  murder of his parents. He may not want to care about other people, but he still cares nevertheless. Not that he'd ever admit it to such an embarrassing dad like Kotetsu.   Also, in a twist of fate, Barnaby Brooks Jr is Kotetsu's daughter's favorite superhero. Not even Wild Tiger. Eesh.      Kotetsu's old school ways doesn't make him popular, even with his own daughter. He was inspired by the King of Old Timers, Mr. Legend, so it makes sense that he clings to those ideals. Many people with super powers in this world – referred to as NEXT – don't always fit in when their powers are fresh and new, and even so, not everyone is fit to be a hero.      This is explored a bit more in The Rising, but a lot of NEXTs have powers that just skirt the line of being useful. Stuff like producing a toxin that just makes you really itchy. Or making your hand grow really, really big. Or, like... being really good at swimming. Kotetsu himself rides that line, partially because of his shtick, partially because his power on its own isn't the best (he can make himself one-hundred times stronger for a short period of time), and partially because he tends to leap before he looks. Like My Hero Academia and its many characters that have wholly-pedestrian Quirks, a lot of heroes in Tiger & Bunny just aren't meant for the big leagues.   When the series begins, Kotetsu is at least doing well enough to stand alongside the biggest heroes in the city: the immovable Rock Bison, the scaredy-cat ninja Origami Cyclone, the thunder-wielding Dragon Kid, the literally-flaming Fire Emblem, the King of Heroes Sky High, and the ice-wielding idol Blue Rose.       And even in The Beginning we really see how Kotetsu helps bring these people together. At first they don't really have much comradery with each other, they might even get in each other's way, something the villain of the first movie actively uses against all of them. But by the time The Rising happens you can really feel how they've grown close.   As always, the villain is capitalism. Because all of the heroes are part of Hero TV, a superhero reality tv show, they're all rated on their actions. You earn points for saving citizens and preventing disasters, but lose points if you fail to capture criminals or if they give you the slip. Getting points is important because you cannot become a hero without a sponsor, and doing well means your sponsor is happy. Happy sponsors, happy network, happy hero. Thus, it's against their best interests to help each other out: each hero scrambles for as many points as they can get.    This is also part of why Kotetsu is such a bomb in the ratings: much to his producer's chagrin, he values people's lives over ratings or network shares, so instead of waiting for a commercial break to let the audience get excited he goes and just tries to save people anyway.      Other than the recap portion of the movie, the plot of The Beginning is that someone nabs the city's very important golden statue of justice and nobody can catch the crook. All the heroes run around, get bamboozled by his power to swap places, and it's really just a fun excuse to allow the cast run around and interact. Anime movies often feel bad for being superfluous, but since Tiger & Bunny the series has quite a few episodes dedicated to just building up the characters, it doesn't really feel out of place for the franchise.     It helps that the other heroes aren't terribly complicated and nevertheless get plenty of scenes to themselves. When the team is called out to arrest thief Robin Baxter, they all go their separate ways... together. Dragon Kid and Blue Rose talk about earrings. Fire Emblem... flirts with Rock Bison. Sky High shows off his wind-control powers to Origami Cyclone, showing an uncharacteristically fun-loving side of himself. It's good stuff that does a good job of letting the cast start to see themselves as more than just competitors.       They each get their moments, whether it's Sky High being a little ""up in the clouds"" even though he's currently the top-rated hero, Rock Bison and Kotetsu being Old Guys together as pals at the bottom of the rankings, or Blue Rose's hilariously cheesy mandated catchphrase.   I also wanna point out that I love the character designs in Tiger & Bunny. It's not just Kotetsu's fancy outfits or Barnaby's flowing locks – everyone in this series looks amazing. Masakazu Katsura was brought onboard to handle character designs; he worked on the superhero-flavored Zetman but he's also known for the romantic comedies D.N.A.², Video Girl Ai, and I''s. His charming character designs are fantastic.   ... Also, he did a manga called Wingman about a toku-themed superhero and I'm dying to see that get brought back someday.    They're also more semi-realistic than most anime even ten years ago and it works better since most of the characters are older. The downside is that it makes them harder to animate too, so expect them to look off-model in places. But I think overall the movies look good even compared to today's standards, including the heavy use of CG for the suits and the action.     As it turns out, the CG is on purpose: because many of the costumes would otherwise have to be redrawn if sponsors for the heroes changed (or if the sponsorship brands had to be removed for foreign markets), it's just easier to render them as CG models. The only one who gets traditional animation is Blue Rose, partly because it's hard to shove a logo on her skimpy outfit, partly because she's T&B's source of T&A.     Which becomes upsetting when you remember she's supposed to be in high school still, for some reason. Why are there no adult female superheroes?!   Nobody said idol culture was healthy... A detail the movies leave out from the series is that Blue Rose might have romantic inclinations towards Kotetsu, who's like... twice her age. Thank goodness. Also, because let's be honest, Kotetsu and Barnaby all the way. A family can be a little girl and her two bickering superhero dads.     That's touched on in the series but I prefer to see it as a ""hero crush"" rather than just being hot for a single dad since she obviously takes Kotetsu's ideals to heart after a point. But it's not strong enough to get in the way of Kotetsu and Barnaby's intense married couple energy. The series very much leans in on the ""partner"" thing in more than just a joke or tongue-in-cheek way; they really are each other's emotional support. Which is why in The Rising the whole plot is just about them breaking up and trying to get back together. It's classic.     I wanna touch on one more thing from The Beginning before we get into The Rising: it ends with a really big show of trust for Barnaby from Kotetsu. Barnaby manages to trick Robin Baxter into imprisoning himself, but later finds that Kotetsu specifically went out of his way not only to let the other heroes allow Barnaby to do this alone, but also made sure to hang in the background to make sure Barnaby's plan went off. As much as Kotetsu chafes at Barnaby's antics, he still wants him to feel like a member of a team.      Oh yeah, it's a great moment of just the way Kotetsu quietly supports people even if they didn't ask for it or he doesn't always know how to show it, and the plan wouldn't have worked if Kotetsu never stuck his neck out to the others the way he did.    I'll also take a moment to shoutout to the dub. I found both language tracks to be pretty good, but Tiger & Bunny has a lot of what I miss in anime dubs. The script is adapted really well and fits the more natural and Americanized feel of the show and the more diverse cast.   Being that I'm more of a fan of older Japanese heroes, I do regret the more-Americanized takes on the recent Japanese superheroes. But this does mean that a lot of life is breathed into them in English dubs.   Anyway, Kotetsu starts The Rising out with his breath beaten out of him. Wild Tiger and Barnaby have sunk in the ratings in the time since The Beginning (it's been a few months and later events from the Tiger & Bunny series have transpired). They're knocked down to the ""Second League"", where a bunch of not-so-great superheroes dwell.      Kotetsu had gotten up in age to the point where he can't use his powers very long and is trying to take a slower pace to accommodate but fears that by doing so he's now drawing down his partner.   The good news is, a mogul named Mark Schneider bought out their old sponsor and pulls the strings needed to get Barnaby back up to the First League, teaming him up with a new hero named Golden Ryan. The bad news is, Schneider had no intention of doing anything for Kotetsu: without a sponsor, he's forced to retire from heroism and take up a job as a cab driver.     Golden Ryan (A pun on ""Golden Lion"" to Kotetsu's Tiger), is also a bit of a huge douchebag.     You think the guys at Banpresto had a laugh about their logo being emblazoned on such a tool of a hero? I can't see him making any Super Robot Wars cameos anytime soon...   At any rate, a series of disasters strikes the city. Barnaby puts the clues together and deduces that the disasters are connected to an old legend from the city's history: a goddess, angered by mankind's greed, sends earthquakes, sleeping sickness and a massive chasm to devour the city. The problem is just trying to convince the higher-ups to let the heroes investigate this.    Also compounding issues is Golden Ryan being concerned with just earning points for just him and Barnaby, instead of collaborating with other heroes--a selfishness helped along with Ryan's gravity-powers.      Barnaby may have been eager in the past, but he sticks to his ideals plenty compared to Ryan, whose dubious methods actively gets in the way of the other heroes, cause collateral damage, and puts citizens in danger just to get racked up on a point sheet.   It's here... that we can finally touch on Fire Emblem, because they're an important part of The Rising's story.   So... Fire Emblem is self-described as a gay superhero (and he's got fire powers, get it?). Being that they own their own company, they're their own sponsor. But like... Fire Emblem feels like a really bad take on a gay person, more akin to The Crying Game and that era of not differentiating gay men from trans-women or the like.    In a lot of ways, Fire Emblem reminds me of Levin from Tekkaman Blade (I'm going somewhere with this, bear with me). Levin was also swishy, flaming, and very flirty with the protagonist--and there's a very touching episode where Levin talks to a woman about living their truth. There's only one Levin in the world, and they live true to themselves, and Levin contains multitudes that just can't be described by simple binary concepts like ""man"" or ""woman."" And in a lot of ways, that's what Fire Emblem is going for: we see in their past that Nathan (Fire Emblem's real name) struggled with their attraction to men or presenting as a woman. Their big climactic moment while stuck in a nightmare of their own worst fears is having a Persona 4 moment and embracing their shadow, celebrating what it means to be themselves. This is really good and genuinely compelling and it does loads to keep Fire Emblem from just being a camp joke... if only Fire Emblem weren't always goosing the other men and touching their butts in what's clearly discomforting. Like, Levin also thirsted for D-Boy, but they kept their hands to themselves.       I'm actually really sweet on Fire Emblem for this type of extremely extra character. Anime doesn't have a good track record of portraying openly queer characters; they're often extremely one note, and while there are elements of Fire Emblem that still aid into negative stereotypes like occasionally making predatory statements or bad touching, there's also a lot of sincerity around the character as well. Fire Emblem regularly proves to be mature, competent, and an emotionally supportive character to others. The other characters never shun Nathan for who they are or who they love, and overall I'm glad that the series' writing does seem to take their character seriously even if it's not perfect.      Nathan's pros definitely outweigh his cons and I don't want to give the impression that I think they're an outright bad character; the phrase ""problematic"" was made for moments like these. They're a great hero, a trusted friend, and honestly the only ding on their journey of acceptance is the fact that they kept goosing the other guys. Nathan is a person of color and that's always a delight to see in anime. Also, I'm using they/them pronouns for Nathan because it's my understanding the new Tiger & Bunny anime is also doing so in the dub.   And once Fire Emblem comes back they lend one heck of an assist to Blue Rose and Dragon Kid... Also, Fire Emblem is sponsored by Domino's. That just amuses me.      Kotetsu also manages to get the go-ahead to jump back in the game while the 2nd League Heroes were helping Fire Emblem recover. It's a good moment for them considering they got canned for not making any company money earlier.    I also loved Rock Bison's little moment of SEND ME FLYING and throwing up the horns after. He was sitting in dead last point-wise and was even desperate enough to start copying other people's bits in order to make himself more likeable to poor results due to how obvious the imitation was.     The Fastball Special is a time-honored tradition in superheroism; I salute Rock Bison in return. It's only a matter of time before the MCU makes it utterly obnoxious.   It also goes into some other themes about imitation, like Kotetsu's daughter trying to figure out how to write a good poem for her assignment but running into a wall when she keeps trying to imitate. Kotetsu surprisingly offers some worldly advice, which gets thrown right back at him.    Everyone keeps trying to live up to what they think they should be doing and not necessarily what they can with their abilities or being true to their feelings.   It turns out that none of the disasters have any kind of divine origin: it's all revenge, baby! A man named Virgil is responsible for organizing the NEXTs that kicked the whole thing off. Using Sternbild's mythology against them, Virgil's goal is revenge against Schneider. Years ago, Schneider took advantage of Virgil's father in a business deal, which led to Virgil's father taking his own life. Virgil teamed up with three other NEXTs whose lives had been ruined by Schneider's wheeling-and-dealing in order to take out their revenge.         Which ties into some stuff in the series. Longtime villain and villain-killer Lunatic shows up to help Virgil to enact his own sense of justice and stand as Kotetsu's ideological opposite while Barnaby stands against Virgil as his mirror and opposite. Both of them state that it's important to be able to center yourself in the present, move on, and not be stuck in the past.      I can't be the only one who thinks Lunatic resembles a weird cross between Purple Haze and King Crimson. Anyway, Virgil becomes a giant robot crab made out of junk metal and fights off Wild Tiger and Barnaby in an attempt at carrying out his own revenge, claiming justification because Barnaby also took his revenge on the man that killed his parents.     Using Kotetsu's only one minute of power they unleash a big show-stopping team-up climax! Sweet.      The fantastic showing reinvigorates the public's desire for the old Wild Tiger/Barnaby team-up too, and even Golden Ryan helps spur them back into teaming up again.     With a nice poem from Kotetsu's daughter, the movie closes with the heroes continuing their duty of protecting Sternbild. It's a really solid ending for a solid pair of movies.     I thought these were both good as a re-introduction but also an epilogue for the series. It doesn't cover everything but it deals with a lot of elements that make Tiger & Bunny stand out.   As a Tiger & Bunny neophyte, I think these movies also serve really well as an introduction to the series. You get just enough of a taste of the other heroes to want to see more, the dynamic between Kotetsu and Barnaby is well-established, and the general feel of Sternbild is introduced. It's a unique world with interesting heroes, and I'm glad it's priming to make a big comeback to the world of anime. I hope Tiger & Bunny reaches a much bigger crowd this time around.   Yeah, I actually missed the initial boat for this one 10 years ago and had to binge the first season shortly before this because I kept putting it off until the second season was just around the corner. But I don't regret a minute of it. I definitely regret the fact that this couldn't be a bigger hit when it came out for a myriad of complicated reasons. That doesn't mean it's too late. Just because it's over a decade now doesn't mean it still can't have its day in the sun!   Nothing would be truer to this fail-dad than being late to his own successful franchise, I tell you what!     Anyways, this is Nicky & Jean-Karlo, over and out!

Jean-Karlo  This week's This Week in Anime was brought to you by Crab! It all comes crawling back to Crab™!     Crab and very region-specific Pepsi sounds like an interesting flavor combo, NGL. But still not as interesting of a combo as the hero duo Tiger & Bunny!     The original Tiger & Bunny anime came out a bit before the massive influx of superheroes became the mono-culture in the U.S. And weirdly enough, it's taken this long for the series to come back with a new season. Netflix is also streaming two movies for the Tiger & Bunny series, The Beginning and The Rising.   These two films came out in 2012 and 2014 respectively but have just now been re-released for streaming on Netflix in honor of that hot new second season. The Beginning is half re-cap of the early part of the series and serves as a great re-introduction for our Super Hero Buddy Cops, while The Rising takes place after the series proper with entirely new material.     Now, I love me some Japanese superheroes, especially the old blood. Yatterman, Gatchaman, Kamen Rider, Casshern, Ultraman, that stuff. And I was always interested in how Japan would handle a take on more Americanized superheroes. Tiger & Bunny has been beloved by fans since its premiere, and not just because of the wave of heroes the Mouse of House churns out on a daily basis. It's a fascinating show, all the way down to the folks wearing those fancy sponsored CG costumes.   Tiger & Bunny is conceptually rich because it fully breaks down the idea of commercialized heroing as an industry, including real company sponsors (which leads to some funny dissonance). The heroes of Sternbild receive live TV coverage and toe the line between being enforcers, performers, and public motivators, along with everything else that life throws at them, on and off the cameras. The focus on the corporate inner workings is part of what makes it feel more mature. It's not just some kids' fantasy of saving people, but a more detailed look at what would happen if someone really tried to make this their job.   Normally, all the heroes compete for points with each other. But when veteran Wild Tiger, real name Kotetsu Kaburagi, moves to a new company after his previous one folds, he's paired with the young and ambitious Barnaby Brooks Jr., to which he affectionally nicknames Bunny, much to his new partner's annoyance.      What makes Tiger & Bunny work – unlike a lot of ""these heroes are realistic!"" joints like The Boys – is that it's not relentlessly dour. The characters aren't irredeemable louts or psychopaths, they're just people trying to make an honest living while living under the whims of an unfeeling, uncaring management system. These people live or die by their sponsors. It's more Mystery Men than anything else, and that's a damn original place to start from when you're making a superhero movie.   It also leans heavily into the showbiz stuff more than any other cape thing I had watched before, but if anything its core is its ensemble cast of heroes and trying to build the companionship between the two main characters. Like many stories about manly bonds, the two of them start out pretty prickly at first, but both have also suffered severe losses of love in their lives. Kotetsu has a 10-year-old daughter he keeps his work secret from, and has previously lost his wife. Barnaby lost his family to a tragic (extremely plot related) incident that left him traumatized. Just knowing this, you can see how much they could benefit from having someone else to call family in their life. Y'know, assuming you could get one of them to open up.     Kotetsu is a really compelling character, and not just because he's a handsome fail-dad with a stylish outfit. He just needs some loving heart to make him better, or worse, that's a fantasy, too. He's goofy and his sense of heroism really doesn't jive with the mercenary world he's in, but rather than feeling like an idiot he just feels quaint. He's not wrong to want to help people, he's just shouldering more weight than he can carry because he just cares about people that much.     He's definitely meant to appeal to an older audience, a rarity for anime, and he's the the heart of the show despite being a lame guy who struggles to keep up with the younger competition. He constantly lets people down, including his own daughter, but you can tell he really values people's feelings just as much as being a hero.     As if to underline it all: his is the only ""conventional"" superhero outfit among all the other heroes. Everyone else has a fancy suit of armor, but Wild Tiger insists on a cape, a themed cowl, and a strongman suit. Even when he gets his updated power suit, he still wears his old one underneath. You can see him wearing the mask inside his helmet.   Barnaby however is the complete opposite, all suped up in the latest tech and uses his real name and face. He instantly saves Kotetsu's sorry ass and is eager to climb up the ladder. They also both happen to share the same type of power, including the fact that both of them have a time limit to use it.      Where Kotetsu wants to be a hero out of a genuine-to-a-fault desire to help people, Barnaby is wholly self-interested... or so he tells himself. He's convinced that putting his identity out there and acting as a hero can get him the funds and recognition he needs to track down the Oroboros group, the crime ring involved with the  murder of his parents. He may not want to care about other people, but he still cares nevertheless. Not that he'd ever admit it to such an embarrassing dad like Kotetsu.   Also, in a twist of fate, Barnaby Brooks Jr is Kotetsu's daughter's favorite superhero. Not even Wild Tiger. Eesh.      Kotetsu's old school ways doesn't make him popular, even with his own daughter. He was inspired by the King of Old Timers, Mr. Legend, so it makes sense that he clings to those ideals. Many people with super powers in this world – referred to as NEXT – don't always fit in when their powers are fresh and new, and even so, not everyone is fit to be a hero.      This is explored a bit more in The Rising, but a lot of NEXTs have powers that just skirt the line of being useful. Stuff like producing a toxin that just makes you really itchy. Or making your hand grow really, really big. Or, like... being really good at swimming. Kotetsu himself rides that line, partially because of his shtick, partially because his power on its own isn't the best (he can make himself one-hundred times stronger for a short period of time), and partially because he tends to leap before he looks. Like My Hero Academia and its many characters that have wholly-pedestrian Quirks, a lot of heroes in Tiger & Bunny just aren't meant for the big leagues.   When the series begins, Kotetsu is at least doing well enough to stand alongside the biggest heroes in the city: the immovable Rock Bison, the scaredy-cat ninja Origami Cyclone, the thunder-wielding Dragon Kid, the literally-flaming Fire Emblem, the King of Heroes Sky High, and the ice-wielding idol Blue Rose.       And even in The Beginning we really see how Kotetsu helps bring these people together. At first they don't really have much comradery with each other, they might even get in each other's way, something the villain of the first movie actively uses against all of them. But by the time The Rising happens you can really feel how they've grown close.   As always, the villain is capitalism. Because all of the heroes are part of Hero TV, a superhero reality tv show, they're all rated on their actions. You earn points for saving citizens and preventing disasters, but lose points if you fail to capture criminals or if they give you the slip. Getting points is important because you cannot become a hero without a sponsor, and doing well means your sponsor is happy. Happy sponsors, happy network, happy hero. Thus, it's against their best interests to help each other out: each hero scrambles for as many points as they can get.    This is also part of why Kotetsu is such a bomb in the ratings: much to his producer's chagrin, he values people's lives over ratings or network shares, so instead of waiting for a commercial break to let the audience get excited he goes and just tries to save people anyway.      Other than the recap portion of the movie, the plot of The Beginning is that someone nabs the city's very important golden statue of justice and nobody can catch the crook. All the heroes run around, get bamboozled by his power to swap places, and it's really just a fun excuse to allow the cast run around and interact. Anime movies often feel bad for being superfluous, but since Tiger & Bunny the series has quite a few episodes dedicated to just building up the characters, it doesn't really feel out of place for the franchise.     It helps that the other heroes aren't terribly complicated and nevertheless get plenty of scenes to themselves. When the team is called out to arrest thief Robin Baxter, they all go their separate ways... together. Dragon Kid and Blue Rose talk about earrings. Fire Emblem... flirts with Rock Bison. Sky High shows off his wind-control powers to Origami Cyclone, showing an uncharacteristically fun-loving side of himself. It's good stuff that does a good job of letting the cast start to see themselves as more than just competitors.       They each get their moments, whether it's Sky High being a little ""up in the clouds"" even though he's currently the top-rated hero, Rock Bison and Kotetsu being Old Guys together as pals at the bottom of the rankings, or Blue Rose's hilariously cheesy mandated catchphrase.   I also wanna point out that I love the character designs in Tiger & Bunny. It's not just Kotetsu's fancy outfits or Barnaby's flowing locks – everyone in this series looks amazing. Masakazu Katsura was brought onboard to handle character designs; he worked on the superhero-flavored Zetman but he's also known for the romantic comedies D.N.A.², Video Girl Ai, and I''s. His charming character designs are fantastic.   ... Also, he did a manga called Wingman about a toku-themed superhero and I'm dying to see that get brought back someday.    They're also more semi-realistic than most anime even ten years ago and it works better since most of the characters are older. The downside is that it makes them harder to animate too, so expect them to look off-model in places. But I think overall the movies look good even compared to today's standards, including the heavy use of CG for the suits and the action.     As it turns out, the CG is on purpose: because many of the costumes would otherwise have to be redrawn if sponsors for the heroes changed (or if the sponsorship brands had to be removed for foreign markets), it's just easier to render them as CG models. The only one who gets traditional animation is Blue Rose, partly because it's hard to shove a logo on her skimpy outfit, partly because she's T&B's source of T&A.     Which becomes upsetting when you remember she's supposed to be in high school still, for some reason. Why are there no adult female superheroes?!   Nobody said idol culture was healthy... A detail the movies leave out from the series is that Blue Rose might have romantic inclinations towards Kotetsu, who's like... twice her age. Thank goodness. Also, because let's be honest, Kotetsu and Barnaby all the way. A family can be a little girl and her two bickering superhero dads.     That's touched on in the series but I prefer to see it as a ""hero crush"" rather than just being hot for a single dad since she obviously takes Kotetsu's ideals to heart after a point. But it's not strong enough to get in the way of Kotetsu and Barnaby's intense married couple energy. The series very much leans in on the ""partner"" thing in more than just a joke or tongue-in-cheek way; they really are each other's emotional support. Which is why in The Rising the whole plot is just about them breaking up and trying to get back together. It's classic.     I wanna touch on one more thing from The Beginning before we get into The Rising: it ends with a really big show of trust for Barnaby from Kotetsu. Barnaby manages to trick Robin Baxter into imprisoning himself, but later finds that Kotetsu specifically went out of his way not only to let the other heroes allow Barnaby to do this alone, but also made sure to hang in the background to make sure Barnaby's plan went off. As much as Kotetsu chafes at Barnaby's antics, he still wants him to feel like a member of a team.      Oh yeah, it's a great moment of just the way Kotetsu quietly supports people even if they didn't ask for it or he doesn't always know how to show it, and the plan wouldn't have worked if Kotetsu never stuck his neck out to the others the way he did.    I'll also take a moment to shoutout to the dub. I found both language tracks to be pretty good, but Tiger & Bunny has a lot of what I miss in anime dubs. The script is adapted really well and fits the more natural and Americanized feel of the show and the more diverse cast.   Being that I'm more of a fan of older Japanese heroes, I do regret the more-Americanized takes on the recent Japanese superheroes. But this does mean that a lot of life is breathed into them in English dubs.   Anyway, Kotetsu starts The Rising out with his breath beaten out of him. Wild Tiger and Barnaby have sunk in the ratings in the time since The Beginning (it's been a few months and later events from the Tiger & Bunny series have transpired). They're knocked down to the ""Second League"", where a bunch of not-so-great superheroes dwell.      Kotetsu had gotten up in age to the point where he can't use his powers very long and is trying to take a slower pace to accommodate but fears that by doing so he's now drawing down his partner.   The good news is, a mogul named Mark Schneider bought out their old sponsor and pulls the strings needed to get Barnaby back up to the First League, teaming him up with a new hero named Golden Ryan. The bad news is, Schneider had no intention of doing anything for Kotetsu: without a sponsor, he's forced to retire from heroism and take up a job as a cab driver.     Golden Ryan (A pun on ""Golden Lion"" to Kotetsu's Tiger), is also a bit of a huge douchebag.     You think the guys at Banpresto had a laugh about their logo being emblazoned on such a tool of a hero? I can't see him making any Super Robot Wars cameos anytime soon...   At any rate, a series of disasters strikes the city. Barnaby puts the clues together and deduces that the disasters are connected to an old legend from the city's history: a goddess, angered by mankind's greed, sends earthquakes, sleeping sickness and a massive chasm to devour the city. The problem is just trying to convince the higher-ups to let the heroes investigate this.    Also compounding issues is Golden Ryan being concerned with just earning points for just him and Barnaby, instead of collaborating with other heroes--a selfishness helped along with Ryan's gravity-powers.      Barnaby may have been eager in the past, but he sticks to his ideals plenty compared to Ryan, whose dubious methods actively gets in the way of the other heroes, cause collateral damage, and puts citizens in danger just to get racked up on a point sheet.   It's here... that we can finally touch on Fire Emblem, because they're an important part of The Rising's story.   So... Fire Emblem is self-described as a gay superhero (and he's got fire powers, get it?). Being that they own their own company, they're their own sponsor. But like... Fire Emblem feels like a really bad take on a gay person, more akin to The Crying Game and that era of not differentiating gay men from trans-women or the like.    In a lot of ways, Fire Emblem reminds me of Levin from Tekkaman Blade (I'm going somewhere with this, bear with me). Levin was also swishy, flaming, and very flirty with the protagonist--and there's a very touching episode where Levin talks to a woman about living their truth. There's only one Levin in the world, and they live true to themselves, and Levin contains multitudes that just can't be described by simple binary concepts like ""man"" or ""woman."" And in a lot of ways, that's what Fire Emblem is going for: we see in their past that Nathan (Fire Emblem's real name) struggled with their attraction to men or presenting as a woman. Their big climactic moment while stuck in a nightmare of their own worst fears is having a Persona 4 moment and embracing their shadow, celebrating what it means to be themselves. This is really good and genuinely compelling and it does loads to keep Fire Emblem from just being a camp joke... if only Fire Emblem weren't always goosing the other men and touching their butts in what's clearly discomforting. Like, Levin also thirsted for D-Boy, but they kept their hands to themselves.       I'm actually really sweet on Fire Emblem for this type of extremely extra character. Anime doesn't have a good track record of portraying openly queer characters; they're often extremely one note, and while there are elements of Fire Emblem that still aid into negative stereotypes like occasionally making predatory statements or bad touching, there's also a lot of sincerity around the character as well. Fire Emblem regularly proves to be mature, competent, and an emotionally supportive character to others. The other characters never shun Nathan for who they are or who they love, and overall I'm glad that the series' writing does seem to take their character seriously even if it's not perfect.      Nathan's pros definitely outweigh his cons and I don't want to give the impression that I think they're an outright bad character; the phrase ""problematic"" was made for moments like these. They're a great hero, a trusted friend, and honestly the only ding on their journey of acceptance is the fact that they kept goosing the other guys. Nathan is a person of color and that's always a delight to see in anime. Also, I'm using they/them pronouns for Nathan because it's my understanding the new Tiger & Bunny anime is also doing so in the dub.   And once Fire Emblem comes back they lend one heck of an assist to Blue Rose and Dragon Kid... Also, Fire Emblem is sponsored by Domino's. That just amuses me.      Kotetsu also manages to get the go-ahead to jump back in the game while the 2nd League Heroes were helping Fire Emblem recover. It's a good moment for them considering they got canned for not making any company money earlier.    I also loved Rock Bison's little moment of SEND ME FLYING and throwing up the horns after. He was sitting in dead last point-wise and was even desperate enough to start copying other people's bits in order to make himself more likeable to poor results due to how obvious the imitation was.

The heroes of Sternbild receive live TV coverage and toe the line between being enforcers, performers, and public motivators, along with everything else that life throws at them, on and off the cameras. The focus on the corporate inner workings is part of what makes it feel more mature. It's not just some kids' fantasy of saving people, but a more detailed look at what would happen if someone really tried to make this their job.   Normally, all the heroes compete for points with each other. But when veteran Wild Tiger, real name Kotetsu Kaburagi, moves to a new company after his previous one folds, he's paired with the young and ambitious Barnaby Brooks Jr., to which he affectionally nicknames Bunny, much to his new partner's annoyance.      What makes Tiger & Bunny work – unlike a lot of ""these heroes are realistic!"" joints like The Boys – is that it's not relentlessly dour. The characters aren't irredeemable louts or psychopaths, they're just people trying to make an honest living while living under the whims of an unfeeling, uncaring management system. These people live or die by their sponsors. It's more Mystery Men than anything else, and that's a damn original place to start from when you're making a superhero movie.   It also leans heavily into the showbiz stuff more than any other cape thing I had watched before, but if anything its core is its ensemble cast of heroes and trying to build the companionship between the two main characters. Like many stories about manly bonds, the two of them start out pretty prickly at first, but both have also suffered severe losses of love in their lives. Kotetsu has a 10-year-old daughter he keeps his work secret from, and has previously lost his wife. Barnaby lost his family to a tragic (extremely plot related) incident that left him traumatized. Just knowing this, you can see how much they could benefit from having someone else to call family in their life. Y'know, assuming you could get one of them to open up.     Kotetsu is a really compelling character, and not just because he's a handsome fail-dad with a stylish outfit. He just needs some loving heart to make him better, or worse, that's a fantasy, too. He's goofy and his sense of heroism really doesn't jive with the mercenary world he's in, but rather than feeling like an idiot he just feels quaint. He's not wrong to want to help people, he's just shouldering more weight than he can carry because he just cares about people that much.     He's definitely meant to appeal to an older audience, a rarity for anime, and he's the the heart of the show despite being a lame guy who struggles to keep up with the younger competition. He constantly lets people down, including his own daughter, but you can tell he really values people's feelings just as much as being a hero.     As if to underline it all: his is the only ""conventional"" superhero outfit among all the other heroes. Everyone else has a fancy suit of armor, but Wild Tiger insists on a cape, a themed cowl, and a strongman suit. Even when he gets his updated power suit, he still wears his old one underneath. You can see him wearing the mask inside his helmet.   Barnaby however is the complete opposite, all suped up in the latest tech and uses his real name and face. He instantly saves Kotetsu's sorry ass and is eager to climb up the ladder. They also both happen to share the same type of power, including the fact that both of them have a time limit to use it.      Where Kotetsu wants to be a hero out of a genuine-to-a-fault desire to help people, Barnaby is wholly self-interested... or so he tells himself. He's convinced that putting his identity out there and acting as a hero can get him the funds and recognition he needs to track down the Oroboros group, the crime ring involved with the  murder of his parents. He may not want to care about other people, but he still cares nevertheless. Not that he'd ever admit it to such an embarrassing dad like Kotetsu.   Also, in a twist of fate, Barnaby Brooks Jr is Kotetsu's daughter's favorite superhero. Not even Wild Tiger. Eesh.      Kotetsu's old school ways doesn't make him popular, even with his own daughter. He was inspired by the King of Old Timers, Mr. Legend, so it makes sense that he clings to those ideals. Many people with super powers in this world – referred to as NEXT – don't always fit in when their powers are fresh and new, and even so, not everyone is fit to be a hero.      This is explored a bit more in The Rising, but a lot of NEXTs have powers that just skirt the line of being useful. Stuff like producing a toxin that just makes you really itchy. Or making your hand grow really, really big. Or, like... being really good at swimming. Kotetsu himself rides that line, partially because of his shtick, partially because his power on its own isn't the best (he can make himself one-hundred times stronger for a short period of time), and partially because he tends to leap before he looks. Like My Hero Academia and its many characters that have wholly-pedestrian Quirks, a lot of heroes in Tiger & Bunny just aren't meant for the big leagues.   When the series begins, Kotetsu is at least doing well enough to stand alongside the biggest heroes in the city: the immovable Rock Bison, the scaredy-cat ninja Origami Cyclone, the thunder-wielding Dragon Kid, the literally-flaming Fire Emblem, the King of Heroes Sky High, and the ice-wielding idol Blue Rose.       And even in The Beginning we really see how Kotetsu helps bring these people together. At first they don't really have much comradery with each other, they might even get in each other's way, something the villain of the first movie actively uses against all of them. But by the time The Rising happens you can really feel how they've grown close.   As always, the villain is capitalism. Because all of the heroes are part of Hero TV, a superhero reality tv show, they're all rated on their actions. You earn points for saving citizens and preventing disasters, but lose points if you fail to capture criminals or if they give you the slip. Getting points is important because you cannot become a hero without a sponsor, and doing well means your sponsor is happy. Happy sponsors, happy network, happy hero. Thus, it's against their best interests to help each other out: each hero scrambles for as many points as they can get.    This is also part of why Kotetsu is such a bomb in the ratings: much to his producer's chagrin, he values people's lives over ratings or network shares, so instead of waiting for a commercial break to let the audience get excited he goes and just tries to save people anyway.      Other than the recap portion of the movie, the plot of The Beginning is that someone nabs the city's very important golden statue of justice and nobody can catch the crook. All the heroes run around, get bamboozled by his power to swap places, and it's really just a fun excuse to allow the cast run around and interact. Anime movies often feel bad for being superfluous, but since Tiger & Bunny the series has quite a few episodes dedicated to just building up the characters, it doesn't really feel out of place for the franchise.     It helps that the other heroes aren't terribly complicated and nevertheless get plenty of scenes to themselves. When the team is called out to arrest thief Robin Baxter, they all go their separate ways... together. Dragon Kid and Blue Rose talk about earrings. Fire Emblem... flirts with Rock Bison. Sky High shows off his wind-control powers to Origami Cyclone, showing an uncharacteristically fun-loving side of himself. It's good stuff that does a good job of letting the cast start to see themselves as more than just competitors.       They each get their moments, whether it's Sky High being a little ""up in the clouds"" even though he's currently the top-rated hero, Rock Bison and Kotetsu being Old Guys together as pals at the bottom of the rankings, or Blue Rose's hilariously cheesy mandated catchphrase.   I also wanna point out that I love the character designs in Tiger & Bunny. It's not just Kotetsu's fancy outfits or Barnaby's flowing locks – everyone in this series looks amazing. Masakazu Katsura was brought onboard to handle character designs; he worked on the superhero-flavored Zetman but he's also known for the romantic comedies D.N.A.², Video Girl Ai, and I''s. His charming character designs are fantastic.   ... Also, he did a manga called Wingman about a toku-themed superhero and I'm dying to see that get brought back someday.    They're also more semi-realistic than most anime even ten years ago and it works better since most of the characters are older. The downside is that it makes them harder to animate too, so expect them to look off-model in places. But I think overall the movies look good even compared to today's standards, including the heavy use of CG for the suits and the action.     As it turns out, the CG is on purpose: because many of the costumes would otherwise have to be redrawn if sponsors for the heroes changed (or if the sponsorship brands had to be removed for foreign markets), it's just easier to render them as CG models. The only one who gets traditional animation is Blue Rose, partly because it's hard to shove a logo on her skimpy outfit, partly because she's T&B's source of T&A.     Which becomes upsetting when you remember she's supposed to be in high school still, for some reason. Why are there no adult female superheroes?!   Nobody said idol culture was healthy... A detail the movies leave out from the series is that Blue Rose might have romantic inclinations towards Kotetsu, who's like... twice her age. Thank goodness. Also, because let's be honest, Kotetsu and Barnaby all the way. A family can be a little girl and her two bickering superhero dads.     That's touched on in the series but I prefer to see it as a ""hero crush"" rather than just being hot for a single dad since she obviously takes Kotetsu's ideals to heart after a point. But it's not strong enough to get in the way of Kotetsu and Barnaby's intense married couple energy. The series very much leans in on the ""partner"" thing in more than just a joke or tongue-in-cheek way; they really are each other's emotional support. Which is why in The Rising the whole plot is just about them breaking up and trying to get back together. It's classic.     I wanna touch on one more thing from The Beginning before we get into The Rising: it ends with a really big show of trust for Barnaby from Kotetsu. Barnaby manages to trick Robin Baxter into imprisoning himself, but later finds that Kotetsu specifically went out of his way not only to let the other heroes allow Barnaby to do this alone, but also made sure to hang in the background to make sure Barnaby's plan went off. As much as Kotetsu chafes at Barnaby's antics, he still wants him to feel like a member of a team.      Oh yeah, it's a great moment of just the way Kotetsu quietly supports people even if they didn't ask for it or he doesn't always know how to show it, and the plan wouldn't have worked if Kotetsu never stuck his neck out to the others the way he did.    I'll also take a moment to shoutout to the dub. I found both language tracks to be pretty good, but Tiger & Bunny has a lot of what I miss in anime dubs. The script is adapted really well and fits the more natural and Americanized feel of the show and the more diverse cast.   Being that I'm more of a fan of older Japanese heroes, I do regret the more-Americanized takes on the recent Japanese superheroes. But this does mean that a lot of life is breathed into them in English dubs.   Anyway, Kotetsu starts The Rising out with his breath beaten out of him. Wild Tiger and Barnaby have sunk in the ratings in the time since The Beginning (it's been a few months and later events from the Tiger & Bunny series have transpired). They're knocked down to the ""Second League"", where a bunch of not-so-great superheroes dwell.      Kotetsu had gotten up in age to the point where he can't use his powers very long and is trying to take a slower pace to accommodate but fears that by doing so he's now drawing down his partner.   The good news is, a mogul named Mark Schneider bought out their old sponsor and pulls the strings needed to get Barnaby back up to the First League, teaming him up with a new hero named Golden Ryan. The bad news is, Schneider had no intention of doing anything for Kotetsu: without a sponsor, he's forced to retire from heroism and take up a job as a cab driver.     Golden Ryan (A pun on ""Golden Lion"" to Kotetsu's Tiger), is also a bit of a huge douchebag.     You think the guys at Banpresto had a laugh about their logo being emblazoned on such a tool of a hero? I can't see him making any Super Robot Wars cameos anytime soon...   At any rate, a series of disasters strikes the city. Barnaby puts the clues together and deduces that the disasters are connected to an old legend from the city's history: a goddess, angered by mankind's greed, sends earthquakes, sleeping sickness and a massive chasm to devour the city. The problem is just trying to convince the higher-ups to let the heroes investigate this.    Also compounding issues is Golden Ryan being concerned with just earning points for just him and Barnaby, instead of collaborating with other heroes--a selfishness helped along with Ryan's gravity-powers.      Barnaby may have been eager in the past, but he sticks to his ideals plenty compared to Ryan, whose dubious methods actively gets in the way of the other heroes, cause collateral damage, and puts citizens in danger just to get racked up on a point sheet.   It's here... that we can finally touch on Fire Emblem, because they're an important part of The Rising's story.   So... Fire Emblem is self-described as a gay superhero (and he's got fire powers, get it?). Being that they own their own company, they're their own sponsor. But like... Fire Emblem feels like a really bad take on a gay person, more akin to The Crying Game and that era of not differentiating gay men from trans-women or the like.    In a lot of ways, Fire Emblem reminds me of Levin from Tekkaman Blade (I'm going somewhere with this, bear with me). Levin was also swishy, flaming, and very flirty with the protagonist--and there's a very touching episode where Levin talks to a woman about living their truth. There's only one Levin in the world, and they live true to themselves, and Levin contains multitudes that just can't be described by simple binary concepts like ""man"" or ""woman."" And in a lot of ways, that's what Fire Emblem is going for: we see in their past that Nathan (Fire Emblem's real name) struggled with their attraction to men or presenting as a woman. Their big climactic moment while stuck in a nightmare of their own worst fears is having a Persona 4 moment and embracing their shadow, celebrating what it means to be themselves. This is really good and genuinely compelling and it does loads to keep Fire Emblem from just being a camp joke... if only Fire Emblem weren't always goosing the other men and touching their butts in what's clearly discomforting. Like, Levin also thirsted for D-Boy, but they kept their hands to themselves.       I'm actually really sweet on Fire Emblem for this type of extremely extra character. Anime doesn't have a good track record of portraying openly queer characters; they're often extremely one note, and while there are elements of Fire Emblem that still aid into negative stereotypes like occasionally making predatory statements or bad touching, there's also a lot of sincerity around the character as well. Fire Emblem regularly proves to be mature, competent, and an emotionally supportive character to others. The other characters never shun Nathan for who they are or who they love, and overall I'm glad that the series' writing does seem to take their character seriously even if it's not perfect.      Nathan's pros definitely outweigh his cons and I don't want to give the impression that I think they're an outright bad character; the phrase ""problematic"" was made for moments like these. They're a great hero, a trusted friend, and honestly the only ding on their journey of acceptance is the fact that they kept goosing the other guys. Nathan is a person of color and that's always a delight to see in anime. Also, I'm using they/them pronouns for Nathan because it's my understanding the new Tiger & Bunny anime is also doing so in the dub.   And once Fire Emblem comes back they lend one heck of an assist to Blue Rose and Dragon Kid... Also, Fire Emblem is sponsored by Domino's. That just amuses me.      Kotetsu also manages to get the go-ahead to jump back in the game while the 2nd League Heroes were helping Fire Emblem recover. It's a good moment for them considering they got canned for not making any company money earlier.    I also loved Rock Bison's little moment of SEND ME FLYING and throwing up the horns after. He was sitting in dead last point-wise and was even desperate enough to start copying other people's bits in order to make himself more likeable to poor results due to how obvious the imitation was.     The Fastball Special is a time-honored tradition in superheroism; I salute Rock Bison in return. It's only a matter of time before the MCU makes it utterly obnoxious.   It also goes into some other themes about imitation, like Kotetsu's daughter trying to figure out how to write a good poem for her assignment but running into a wall when she keeps trying to imitate. Kotetsu surprisingly offers some worldly advice, which gets thrown right back at him.    Everyone keeps trying to live up to what they think they should be doing and not necessarily what they can with their abilities or being true to their feelings.   It turns out that none of the disasters have any kind of divine origin: it's all revenge, baby! A man named Virgil is responsible for organizing the NEXTs that kicked the whole thing off. Using Sternbild's mythology against them, Virgil's goal is revenge against Schneider. Years ago, Schneider took advantage of Virgil's father in a business deal, which led to Virgil's father taking his own life. Virgil teamed up with three other NEXTs whose lives had been ruined by Schneider's wheeling-and-dealing in order to take out their revenge.         Which ties into some stuff in the series. Longtime villain and villain-killer Lunatic shows up to help Virgil to enact his own sense of justice and stand as Kotetsu's ideological opposite while Barnaby stands against Virgil as his mirror and opposite. Both of them state that it's important to be able to center yourself in the present, move on, and not be stuck in the past.      I can't be the only one who thinks Lunatic resembles a weird cross between Purple Haze and King Crimson. Anyway, Virgil becomes a giant robot crab made out of junk metal and fights off Wild Tiger and Barnaby in an attempt at carrying out his own revenge, claiming justification because Barnaby also took his revenge on the man that killed his parents.     Using Kotetsu's only one minute of power they unleash a big show-stopping team-up climax! Sweet.      The fantastic showing reinvigorates the public's desire for the old Wild Tiger/Barnaby team-up too, and even Golden Ryan helps spur them back into teaming up again.     With a nice poem from Kotetsu's daughter, the movie closes with the heroes continuing their duty of protecting Sternbild. It's a really solid ending for a solid pair of movies.     I thought these were both good as a re-introduction but also an epilogue for the series. It doesn't cover everything but it deals with a lot of elements that make Tiger & Bunny stand out.   As a Tiger & Bunny neophyte, I think these movies also serve really well as an introduction to the series. You get just enough of a taste of the other heroes to want to see more, the dynamic between Kotetsu and Barnaby is well-established, and the general feel of Sternbild is introduced. It's a unique world with interesting heroes, and I'm glad it's priming to make a big comeback to the world of anime. I hope Tiger & Bunny reaches a much bigger crowd this time around.   Yeah, I actually missed the initial boat for this one 10 years ago and had to binge the first season shortly before this because I kept putting it off until the second season was just around the corner. But I don't regret a minute of it. I definitely regret the fact that this couldn't be a bigger hit when it came out for a myriad of complicated reasons. That doesn't mean it's too late. Just because it's over a decade now doesn't mean it still can't have its day in the sun!   Nothing would be truer to this fail-dad than being late to his own successful franchise, I tell you what!     Anyways, this is Nicky & Jean-Karlo, over and out!

Jean-Karlo  This week's This Week in Anime was brought to you by Crab! It all comes crawling back to Crab™!     Crab and very region-specific Pepsi sounds like an interesting flavor combo, NGL. But still not as interesting of a combo as the hero duo Tiger & Bunny!     The original Tiger & Bunny anime came out a bit before the massive influx of superheroes became the mono-culture in the U.S. And weirdly enough, it's taken this long for the series to come back with a new season. Netflix is also streaming two movies for the Tiger & Bunny series, The Beginning and The Rising.   These two films came out in 2012 and 2014 respectively but have just now been re-released for streaming on Netflix in honor of that hot new second season. The Beginning is half re-cap of the early part of the series and serves as a great re-introduction for our Super Hero Buddy Cops, while The Rising takes place after the series proper with entirely new material.     Now, I love me some Japanese superheroes, especially the old blood. Yatterman, Gatchaman, Kamen Rider, Casshern, Ultraman, that stuff. And I was always interested in how Japan would handle a take on more Americanized superheroes. Tiger & Bunny has been beloved by fans since its premiere, and not just because of the wave of heroes the Mouse of House churns out on a daily basis. It's a fascinating show, all the way down to the folks wearing those fancy sponsored CG costumes.   Tiger & Bunny is conceptually rich because it fully breaks down the idea of commercialized heroing as an industry, including real company sponsors (which leads to some funny dissonance). The heroes of Sternbild receive live TV coverage and toe the line between being enforcers, performers, and public motivators, along with everything else that life throws at them, on and off the cameras. The focus on the corporate inner workings is part of what makes it feel more mature. It's not just some kids' fantasy of saving people, but a more detailed look at what would happen if someone really tried to make this their job.   Normally, all the heroes compete for points with each other. But when veteran Wild Tiger, real name Kotetsu Kaburagi, moves to a new company after his previous one folds, he's paired with the young and ambitious Barnaby Brooks Jr., to which he affectionally nicknames Bunny, much to his new partner's annoyance.

But I think overall the movies look good even compared to today's standards, including the heavy use of CG for the suits and the action.     As it turns out, the CG is on purpose: because many of the costumes would otherwise have to be redrawn if sponsors for the heroes changed (or if the sponsorship brands had to be removed for foreign markets), it's just easier to render them as CG models. The only one who gets traditional animation is Blue Rose, partly because it's hard to shove a logo on her skimpy outfit, partly because she's T&B's source of T&A.     Which becomes upsetting when you remember she's supposed to be in high school still, for some reason. Why are there no adult female superheroes?!   Nobody said idol culture was healthy... A detail the movies leave out from the series is that Blue Rose might have romantic inclinations towards Kotetsu, who's like... twice her age. Thank goodness. Also, because let's be honest, Kotetsu and Barnaby all the way. A family can be a little girl and her two bickering superhero dads.     That's touched on in the series but I prefer to see it as a ""hero crush"" rather than just being hot for a single dad since she obviously takes Kotetsu's ideals to heart after a point. But it's not strong enough to get in the way of Kotetsu and Barnaby's intense married couple energy. The series very much leans in on the ""partner"" thing in more than just a joke or tongue-in-cheek way; they really are each other's emotional support. Which is why in The Rising the whole plot is just about them breaking up and trying to get back together. It's classic.     I wanna touch on one more thing from The Beginning before we get into The Rising: it ends with a really big show of trust for Barnaby from Kotetsu. Barnaby manages to trick Robin Baxter into imprisoning himself, but later finds that Kotetsu specifically went out of his way not only to let the other heroes allow Barnaby to do this alone, but also made sure to hang in the background to make sure Barnaby's plan went off. As much as Kotetsu chafes at Barnaby's antics, he still wants him to feel like a member of a team.      Oh yeah, it's a great moment of just the way Kotetsu quietly supports people even if they didn't ask for it or he doesn't always know how to show it, and the plan wouldn't have worked if Kotetsu never stuck his neck out to the others the way he did.    I'll also take a moment to shoutout to the dub. I found both language tracks to be pretty good, but Tiger & Bunny has a lot of what I miss in anime dubs. The script is adapted really well and fits the more natural and Americanized feel of the show and the more diverse cast.   Being that I'm more of a fan of older Japanese heroes, I do regret the more-Americanized takes on the recent Japanese superheroes. But this does mean that a lot of life is breathed into them in English dubs.   Anyway, Kotetsu starts The Rising out with his breath beaten out of him. Wild Tiger and Barnaby have sunk in the ratings in the time since The Beginning (it's been a few months and later events from the Tiger & Bunny series have transpired). They're knocked down to the ""Second League"", where a bunch of not-so-great superheroes dwell.      Kotetsu had gotten up in age to the point where he can't use his powers very long and is trying to take a slower pace to accommodate but fears that by doing so he's now drawing down his partner.   The good news is, a mogul named Mark Schneider bought out their old sponsor and pulls the strings needed to get Barnaby back up to the First League, teaming him up with a new hero named Golden Ryan. The bad news is, Schneider had no intention of doing anything for Kotetsu: without a sponsor, he's forced to retire from heroism and take up a job as a cab driver.     Golden Ryan (A pun on ""Golden Lion"" to Kotetsu's Tiger), is also a bit of a huge douchebag.     You think the guys at Banpresto had a laugh about their logo being emblazoned on such a tool of a hero? I can't see him making any Super Robot Wars cameos anytime soon...   At any rate, a series of disasters strikes the city. Barnaby puts the clues together and deduces that the disasters are connected to an old legend from the city's history: a goddess, angered by mankind's greed, sends earthquakes, sleeping sickness and a massive chasm to devour the city. The problem is just trying to convince the higher-ups to let the heroes investigate this.    Also compounding issues is Golden Ryan being concerned with just earning points for just him and Barnaby, instead of collaborating with other heroes--a selfishness helped along with Ryan's gravity-powers.      Barnaby may have been eager in the past, but he sticks to his ideals plenty compared to Ryan, whose dubious methods actively gets in the way of the other heroes, cause collateral damage, and puts citizens in danger just to get racked up on a point sheet.   It's here... that we can finally touch on Fire Emblem, because they're an important part of The Rising's story.   So... Fire Emblem is self-described as a gay superhero (and he's got fire powers, get it?). Being that they own their own company, they're their own sponsor. But like... Fire Emblem feels like a really bad take on a gay person, more akin to The Crying Game and that era of not differentiating gay men from trans-women or the like.    In a lot of ways, Fire Emblem reminds me of Levin from Tekkaman Blade (I'm going somewhere with this, bear with me). Levin was also swishy, flaming, and very flirty with the protagonist--and there's a very touching episode where Levin talks to a woman about living their truth. There's only one Levin in the world, and they live true to themselves, and Levin contains multitudes that just can't be described by simple binary concepts like ""man"" or ""woman."" And in a lot of ways, that's what Fire Emblem is going for: we see in their past that Nathan (Fire Emblem's real name) struggled with their attraction to men or presenting as a woman. Their big climactic moment while stuck in a nightmare of their own worst fears is having a Persona 4 moment and embracing their shadow, celebrating what it means to be themselves. This is really good and genuinely compelling and it does loads to keep Fire Emblem from just being a camp joke... if only Fire Emblem weren't always goosing the other men and touching their butts in what's clearly discomforting. Like, Levin also thirsted for D-Boy, but they kept their hands to themselves.       I'm actually really sweet on Fire Emblem for this type of extremely extra character. Anime doesn't have a good track record of portraying openly queer characters; they're often extremely one note, and while there are elements of Fire Emblem that still aid into negative stereotypes like occasionally making predatory statements or bad touching, there's also a lot of sincerity around the character as well. Fire Emblem regularly proves to be mature, competent, and an emotionally supportive character to others. The other characters never shun Nathan for who they are or who they love, and overall I'm glad that the series' writing does seem to take their character seriously even if it's not perfect.      Nathan's pros definitely outweigh his cons and I don't want to give the impression that I think they're an outright bad character; the phrase ""problematic"" was made for moments like these. They're a great hero, a trusted friend, and honestly the only ding on their journey of acceptance is the fact that they kept goosing the other guys. Nathan is a person of color and that's always a delight to see in anime. Also, I'm using they/them pronouns for Nathan because it's my understanding the new Tiger & Bunny anime is also doing so in the dub.   And once Fire Emblem comes back they lend one heck of an assist to Blue Rose and Dragon Kid... Also, Fire Emblem is sponsored by Domino's. That just amuses me.      Kotetsu also manages to get the go-ahead to jump back in the game while the 2nd League Heroes were helping Fire Emblem recover. It's a good moment for them considering they got canned for not making any company money earlier.    I also loved Rock Bison's little moment of SEND ME FLYING and throwing up the horns after. He was sitting in dead last point-wise and was even desperate enough to start copying other people's bits in order to make himself more likeable to poor results due to how obvious the imitation was.     The Fastball Special is a time-honored tradition in superheroism; I salute Rock Bison in return. It's only a matter of time before the MCU makes it utterly obnoxious.   It also goes into some other themes about imitation, like Kotetsu's daughter trying to figure out how to write a good poem for her assignment but running into a wall when she keeps trying to imitate. Kotetsu surprisingly offers some worldly advice, which gets thrown right back at him.    Everyone keeps trying to live up to what they think they should be doing and not necessarily what they can with their abilities or being true to their feelings.   It turns out that none of the disasters have any kind of divine origin: it's all revenge, baby! A man named Virgil is responsible for organizing the NEXTs that kicked the whole thing off. Using Sternbild's mythology against them, Virgil's goal is revenge against Schneider. Years ago, Schneider took advantage of Virgil's father in a business deal, which led to Virgil's father taking his own life. Virgil teamed up with three other NEXTs whose lives had been ruined by Schneider's wheeling-and-dealing in order to take out their revenge.         Which ties into some stuff in the series. Longtime villain and villain-killer Lunatic shows up to help Virgil to enact his own sense of justice and stand as Kotetsu's ideological opposite while Barnaby stands against Virgil as his mirror and opposite. Both of them state that it's important to be able to center yourself in the present, move on, and not be stuck in the past.      I can't be the only one who thinks Lunatic resembles a weird cross between Purple Haze and King Crimson. Anyway, Virgil becomes a giant robot crab made out of junk metal and fights off Wild Tiger and Barnaby in an attempt at carrying out his own revenge, claiming justification because Barnaby also took his revenge on the man that killed his parents.     Using Kotetsu's only one minute of power they unleash a big show-stopping team-up climax! Sweet.      The fantastic showing reinvigorates the public's desire for the old Wild Tiger/Barnaby team-up too, and even Golden Ryan helps spur them back into teaming up again.     With a nice poem from Kotetsu's daughter, the movie closes with the heroes continuing their duty of protecting Sternbild. It's a really solid ending for a solid pair of movies.     I thought these were both good as a re-introduction but also an epilogue for the series. It doesn't cover everything but it deals with a lot of elements that make Tiger & Bunny stand out.   As a Tiger & Bunny neophyte, I think these movies also serve really well as an introduction to the series. You get just enough of a taste of the other heroes to want to see more, the dynamic between Kotetsu and Barnaby is well-established, and the general feel of Sternbild is introduced. It's a unique world with interesting heroes, and I'm glad it's priming to make a big comeback to the world of anime. I hope Tiger & Bunny reaches a much bigger crowd this time around.   Yeah, I actually missed the initial boat for this one 10 years ago and had to binge the first season shortly before this because I kept putting it off until the second season was just around the corner. But I don't regret a minute of it. I definitely regret the fact that this couldn't be a bigger hit when it came out for a myriad of complicated reasons. That doesn't mean it's too late. Just because it's over a decade now doesn't mean it still can't have its day in the sun!   Nothing would be truer to this fail-dad than being late to his own successful franchise, I tell you what!     Anyways, this is Nicky & Jean-Karlo, over and out!

Jean-Karlo  This week's This Week in Anime was brought to you by Crab! It all comes crawling back to Crab™!     Crab and very region-specific Pepsi sounds like an interesting flavor combo, NGL. But still not as interesting of a combo as the hero duo Tiger & Bunny!     The original Tiger & Bunny anime came out a bit before the massive influx of superheroes became the mono-culture in the U.S. And weirdly enough, it's taken this long for the series to come back with a new season. Netflix is also streaming two movies for the Tiger & Bunny series, The Beginning and The Rising.   These two films came out in 2012 and 2014 respectively but have just now been re-released for streaming on Netflix in honor of that hot new second season. The Beginning is half re-cap of the early part of the series and serves as a great re-introduction for our Super Hero Buddy Cops, while The Rising takes place after the series proper with entirely new material.     Now, I love me some Japanese superheroes, especially the old blood. Yatterman, Gatchaman, Kamen Rider, Casshern, Ultraman, that stuff. And I was always interested in how Japan would handle a take on more Americanized superheroes. Tiger & Bunny has been beloved by fans since its premiere, and not just because of the wave of heroes the Mouse of House churns out on a daily basis. It's a fascinating show, all the way down to the folks wearing those fancy sponsored CG costumes.   Tiger & Bunny is conceptually rich because it fully breaks down the idea of commercialized heroing as an industry, including real company sponsors (which leads to some funny dissonance). The heroes of Sternbild receive live TV coverage and toe the line between being enforcers, performers, and public motivators, along with everything else that life throws at them, on and off the cameras. The focus on the corporate inner workings is part of what makes it feel more mature. It's not just some kids' fantasy of saving people, but a more detailed look at what would happen if someone really tried to make this their job.   Normally, all the heroes compete for points with each other. But when veteran Wild Tiger, real name Kotetsu Kaburagi, moves to a new company after his previous one folds, he's paired with the young and ambitious Barnaby Brooks Jr., to which he affectionally nicknames Bunny, much to his new partner's annoyance.      What makes Tiger & Bunny work – unlike a lot of ""these heroes are realistic!"" joints like The Boys – is that it's not relentlessly dour. The characters aren't irredeemable louts or psychopaths, they're just people trying to make an honest living while living under the whims of an unfeeling, uncaring management system. These people live or die by their sponsors. It's more Mystery Men than anything else, and that's a damn original place to start from when you're making a superhero movie.   It also leans heavily into the showbiz stuff more than any other cape thing I had watched before, but if anything its core is its ensemble cast of heroes and trying to build the companionship between the two main characters. Like many stories about manly bonds, the two of them start out pretty prickly at first, but both have also suffered severe losses of love in their lives. Kotetsu has a 10-year-old daughter he keeps his work secret from, and has previously lost his wife. Barnaby lost his family to a tragic (extremely plot related) incident that left him traumatized. Just knowing this, you can see how much they could benefit from having someone else to call family in their life. Y'know, assuming you could get one of them to open up.     Kotetsu is a really compelling character, and not just because he's a handsome fail-dad with a stylish outfit. He just needs some loving heart to make him better, or worse, that's a fantasy, too. He's goofy and his sense of heroism really doesn't jive with the mercenary world he's in, but rather than feeling like an idiot he just feels quaint. He's not wrong to want to help people, he's just shouldering more weight than he can carry because he just cares about people that much.     He's definitely meant to appeal to an older audience, a rarity for anime, and he's the the heart of the show despite being a lame guy who struggles to keep up with the younger competition. He constantly lets people down, including his own daughter, but you can tell he really values people's feelings just as much as being a hero.     As if to underline it all: his is the only ""conventional"" superhero outfit among all the other heroes. Everyone else has a fancy suit of armor, but Wild Tiger insists on a cape, a themed cowl, and a strongman suit. Even when he gets his updated power suit, he still wears his old one underneath. You can see him wearing the mask inside his helmet.   Barnaby however is the complete opposite, all suped up in the latest tech and uses his real name and face. He instantly saves Kotetsu's sorry ass and is eager to climb up the ladder. They also both happen to share the same type of power, including the fact that both of them have a time limit to use it.      Where Kotetsu wants to be a hero out of a genuine-to-a-fault desire to help people, Barnaby is wholly self-interested... or so he tells himself. He's convinced that putting his identity out there and acting as a hero can get him the funds and recognition he needs to track down the Oroboros group, the crime ring involved with the  murder of his parents. He may not want to care about other people, but he still cares nevertheless. Not that he'd ever admit it to such an embarrassing dad like Kotetsu.   Also, in a twist of fate, Barnaby Brooks Jr is Kotetsu's daughter's favorite superhero. Not even Wild Tiger. Eesh.      Kotetsu's old school ways doesn't make him popular, even with his own daughter. He was inspired by the King of Old Timers, Mr. Legend, so it makes sense that he clings to those ideals. Many people with super powers in this world – referred to as NEXT – don't always fit in when their powers are fresh and new, and even so, not everyone is fit to be a hero.      This is explored a bit more in The Rising, but a lot of NEXTs have powers that just skirt the line of being useful. Stuff like producing a toxin that just makes you really itchy. Or making your hand grow really, really big. Or, like... being really good at swimming. Kotetsu himself rides that line, partially because of his shtick, partially because his power on its own isn't the best (he can make himself one-hundred times stronger for a short period of time), and partially because he tends to leap before he looks. Like My Hero Academia and its many characters that have wholly-pedestrian Quirks, a lot of heroes in Tiger & Bunny just aren't meant for the big leagues.   When the series begins, Kotetsu is at least doing well enough to stand alongside the biggest heroes in the city: the immovable Rock Bison, the scaredy-cat ninja Origami Cyclone, the thunder-wielding Dragon Kid, the literally-flaming Fire Emblem, the King of Heroes Sky High, and the ice-wielding idol Blue Rose.       And even in The Beginning we really see how Kotetsu helps bring these people together. At first they don't really have much comradery with each other, they might even get in each other's way, something the villain of the first movie actively uses against all of them. But by the time The Rising happens you can really feel how they've grown close.   As always, the villain is capitalism. Because all of the heroes are part of Hero TV, a superhero reality tv show, they're all rated on their actions. You earn points for saving citizens and preventing disasters, but lose points if you fail to capture criminals or if they give you the slip. Getting points is important because you cannot become a hero without a sponsor, and doing well means your sponsor is happy. Happy sponsors, happy network, happy hero. Thus, it's against their best interests to help each other out: each hero scrambles for as many points as they can get.    This is also part of why Kotetsu is such a bomb in the ratings: much to his producer's chagrin, he values people's lives over ratings or network shares, so instead of waiting for a commercial break to let the audience get excited he goes and just tries to save people anyway.      Other than the recap portion of the movie, the plot of The Beginning is that someone nabs the city's very important golden statue of justice and nobody can catch the crook. All the heroes run around, get bamboozled by his power to swap places, and it's really just a fun excuse to allow the cast run around and interact. Anime movies often feel bad for being superfluous, but since Tiger & Bunny the series has quite a few episodes dedicated to just building up the characters, it doesn't really feel out of place for the franchise.     It helps that the other heroes aren't terribly complicated and nevertheless get plenty of scenes to themselves. When the team is called out to arrest thief Robin Baxter, they all go their separate ways... together. Dragon Kid and Blue Rose talk about earrings. Fire Emblem... flirts with Rock Bison. Sky High shows off his wind-control powers to Origami Cyclone, showing an uncharacteristically fun-loving side of himself. It's good stuff that does a good job of letting the cast start to see themselves as more than just competitors.       They each get their moments, whether it's Sky High being a little ""up in the clouds"" even though he's currently the top-rated hero, Rock Bison and Kotetsu being Old Guys together as pals at the bottom of the rankings, or Blue Rose's hilariously cheesy mandated catchphrase.   I also wanna point out that I love the character designs in Tiger & Bunny. It's not just Kotetsu's fancy outfits or Barnaby's flowing locks – everyone in this series looks amazing. Masakazu Katsura was brought onboard to handle character designs; he worked on the superhero-flavored Zetman but he's also known for the romantic comedies D.N.A.², Video Girl Ai, and I''s. His charming character designs are fantastic.   ... Also, he did a manga called Wingman about a toku-themed superhero and I'm dying to see that get brought back someday.    They're also more semi-realistic than most anime even ten years ago and it works better since most of the characters are older. The downside is that it makes them harder to animate too, so expect them to look off-model in places. But I think overall the movies look good even compared to today's standards, including the heavy use of CG for the suits and the action.     As it turns out, the CG is on purpose: because many of the costumes would otherwise have to be redrawn if sponsors for the heroes changed (or if the sponsorship brands had to be removed for foreign markets), it's just easier to render them as CG models. The only one who gets traditional animation is Blue Rose, partly because it's hard to shove a logo on her skimpy outfit, partly because she's T&B's source of T&A.     Which becomes upsetting when you remember she's supposed to be in high school still, for some reason. Why are there no adult female superheroes?!   Nobody said idol culture was healthy... A detail the movies leave out from the series is that Blue Rose might have romantic inclinations towards Kotetsu, who's like... twice her age. Thank goodness.

Kotetsu surprisingly offers some worldly advice, which gets thrown right back at him.    Everyone keeps trying to live up to what they think they should be doing and not necessarily what they can with their abilities or being true to their feelings.   It turns out that none of the disasters have any kind of divine origin: it's all revenge, baby! A man named Virgil is responsible for organizing the NEXTs that kicked the whole thing off. Using Sternbild's mythology against them, Virgil's goal is revenge against Schneider. Years ago, Schneider took advantage of Virgil's father in a business deal, which led to Virgil's father taking his own life. Virgil teamed up with three other NEXTs whose lives had been ruined by Schneider's wheeling-and-dealing in order to take out their revenge.         Which ties into some stuff in the series. Longtime villain and villain-killer Lunatic shows up to help Virgil to enact his own sense of justice and stand as Kotetsu's ideological opposite while Barnaby stands against Virgil as his mirror and opposite. Both of them state that it's important to be able to center yourself in the present, move on, and not be stuck in the past.      I can't be the only one who thinks Lunatic resembles a weird cross between Purple Haze and King Crimson. Anyway, Virgil becomes a giant robot crab made out of junk metal and fights off Wild Tiger and Barnaby in an attempt at carrying out his own revenge, claiming justification because Barnaby also took his revenge on the man that killed his parents.     Using Kotetsu's only one minute of power they unleash a big show-stopping team-up climax! Sweet.      The fantastic showing reinvigorates the public's desire for the old Wild Tiger/Barnaby team-up too, and even Golden Ryan helps spur them back into teaming up again.     With a nice poem from Kotetsu's daughter, the movie closes with the heroes continuing their duty of protecting Sternbild. It's a really solid ending for a solid pair of movies.     I thought these were both good as a re-introduction but also an epilogue for the series. It doesn't cover everything but it deals with a lot of elements that make Tiger & Bunny stand out.   As a Tiger & Bunny neophyte, I think these movies also serve really well as an introduction to the series. You get just enough of a taste of the other heroes to want to see more, the dynamic between Kotetsu and Barnaby is well-established, and the general feel of Sternbild is introduced. It's a unique world with interesting heroes, and I'm glad it's priming to make a big comeback to the world of anime. I hope Tiger & Bunny reaches a much bigger crowd this time around.   Yeah, I actually missed the initial boat for this one 10 years ago and had to binge the first season shortly before this because I kept putting it off until the second season was just around the corner. But I don't regret a minute of it. I definitely regret the fact that this couldn't be a bigger hit when it came out for a myriad of complicated reasons. That doesn't mean it's too late. Just because it's over a decade now doesn't mean it still can't have its day in the sun!   Nothing would be truer to this fail-dad than being late to his own successful franchise, I tell you what!     Anyways, this is Nicky & Jean-Karlo, over and out! Til next time.

Fear not, citizens! The recap movie and sequel are on Netflix right now and Jean-Karlo and Nicky are ready to give you the official This Week in Anime™ experience.    These movies are streaming on Netflix   Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the participants in this chatlog are not the views of Anime News Network.Spoiler Warning for discussion of the series ahead.     @Lossthief    @mouse_inhouse    @NickyEnchilada    @vestenet      Nicky  Hey, everybody, it's me and Jean-Karlo here, and today we announce that due to recent changes in upper-management This Week in Anime will include regular shout-outs to sponsors!     Jean-Karlo  This week's This Week in Anime was brought to you by Crab! It all comes crawling back to Crab™!     Crab and very region-specific Pepsi sounds like an interesting flavor combo, NGL. But still not as interesting of a combo as the hero duo Tiger & Bunny!     The original Tiger & Bunny anime came out a bit before the massive influx of superheroes became the mono-culture in the U.S. And weirdly enough, it's taken this long for the series to come back with a new season. Netflix is also streaming two movies for the Tiger & Bunny series, The Beginning and The Rising.   These two films came out in 2012 and 2014 respectively but have just now been re-released for streaming on Netflix in honor of that hot new second season. The Beginning is half re-cap of the early part of the series and serves as a great re-introduction for our Super Hero Buddy Cops, while The Rising takes place after the series proper with entirely new material.     Now, I love me some Japanese superheroes, especially the old blood. Yatterman, Gatchaman, Kamen Rider, Casshern, Ultraman, that stuff. And I was always interested in how Japan would handle a take on more Americanized superheroes. Tiger & Bunny has been beloved by fans since its premiere, and not just because of the wave of heroes the Mouse of House churns out on a daily basis. It's a fascinating show, all the way down to the folks wearing those fancy sponsored CG costumes.   Tiger & Bunny is conceptually rich because it fully breaks down the idea of commercialized heroing as an industry, including real company sponsors (which leads to some funny dissonance). The heroes of Sternbild receive live TV coverage and toe the line between being enforcers, performers, and public motivators, along with everything else that life throws at them, on and off the cameras. The focus on the corporate inner workings is part of what makes it feel more mature. It's not just some kids' fantasy of saving people, but a more detailed look at what would happen if someone really tried to make this their job.   Normally, all the heroes compete for points with each other. But when veteran Wild Tiger, real name Kotetsu Kaburagi, moves to a new company after his previous one folds, he's paired with the young and ambitious Barnaby Brooks Jr., to which he affectionally nicknames Bunny, much to his new partner's annoyance.      What makes Tiger & Bunny work – unlike a lot of ""these heroes are realistic!"" joints like The Boys – is that it's not relentlessly dour. The characters aren't irredeemable louts or psychopaths, they're just people trying to make an honest living while living under the whims of an unfeeling, uncaring management system. These people live or die by their sponsors. It's more Mystery Men than anything else, and that's a damn original place to start from when you're making a superhero movie.   It also leans heavily into the showbiz stuff more than any other cape thing I had watched before, but if anything its core is its ensemble cast of heroes and trying to build the companionship between the two main characters. Like many stories about manly bonds, the two of them start out pretty prickly at first, but both have also suffered severe losses of love in their lives. Kotetsu has a 10-year-old daughter he keeps his work secret from, and has previously lost his wife. Barnaby lost his family to a tragic (extremely plot related) incident that left him traumatized. Just knowing this, you can see how much they could benefit from having someone else to call family in their life. Y'know, assuming you could get one of them to open up.     Kotetsu is a really compelling character, and not just because he's a handsome fail-dad with a stylish outfit. He just needs some loving heart to make him better, or worse, that's a fantasy, too. He's goofy and his sense of heroism really doesn't jive with the mercenary world he's in, but rather than feeling like an idiot he just feels quaint. He's not wrong to want to help people, he's just shouldering more weight than he can carry because he just cares about people that much.     He's definitely meant to appeal to an older audience, a rarity for anime, and he's the the heart of the show despite being a lame guy who struggles to keep up with the younger competition. He constantly lets people down, including his own daughter, but you can tell he really values people's feelings just as much as being a hero.     As if to underline it all: his is the only ""conventional"" superhero outfit among all the other heroes. Everyone else has a fancy suit of armor, but Wild Tiger insists on a cape, a themed cowl, and a strongman suit. Even when he gets his updated power suit, he still wears his old one underneath. You can see him wearing the mask inside his helmet.   Barnaby however is the complete opposite, all suped up in the latest tech and uses his real name and face. He instantly saves Kotetsu's sorry ass and is eager to climb up the ladder. They also both happen to share the same type of power, including the fact that both of them have a time limit to use it.      Where Kotetsu wants to be a hero out of a genuine-to-a-fault desire to help people, Barnaby is wholly self-interested... or so he tells himself. He's convinced that putting his identity out there and acting as a hero can get him the funds and recognition he needs to track down the Oroboros group, the crime ring involved with the  murder of his parents. He may not want to care about other people, but he still cares nevertheless. Not that he'd ever admit it to such an embarrassing dad like Kotetsu.   Also, in a twist of fate, Barnaby Brooks Jr is Kotetsu's daughter's favorite superhero. Not even Wild Tiger. Eesh.      Kotetsu's old school ways doesn't make him popular, even with his own daughter. He was inspired by the King of Old Timers, Mr. Legend, so it makes sense that he clings to those ideals. Many people with super powers in this world – referred to as NEXT – don't always fit in when their powers are fresh and new, and even so, not everyone is fit to be a hero.      This is explored a bit more in The Rising, but a lot of NEXTs have powers that just skirt the line of being useful. Stuff like producing a toxin that just makes you really itchy. Or making your hand grow really, really big. Or, like... being really good at swimming. Kotetsu himself rides that line, partially because of his shtick, partially because his power on its own isn't the best (he can make himself one-hundred times stronger for a short period of time), and partially because he tends to leap before he looks. Like My Hero Academia and its many characters that have wholly-pedestrian Quirks, a lot of heroes in Tiger & Bunny just aren't meant for the big leagues.   When the series begins, Kotetsu is at least doing well enough to stand alongside the biggest heroes in the city: the immovable Rock Bison, the scaredy-cat ninja Origami Cyclone, the thunder-wielding Dragon Kid, the literally-flaming Fire Emblem, the King of Heroes Sky High, and the ice-wielding idol Blue Rose.       And even in The Beginning we really see how Kotetsu helps bring these people together. At first they don't really have much comradery with each other, they might even get in each other's way, something the villain of the first movie actively uses against all of them. But by the time The Rising happens you can really feel how they've grown close.   As always, the villain is capitalism. Because all of the heroes are part of Hero TV, a superhero reality tv show, they're all rated on their actions. You earn points for saving citizens and preventing disasters, but lose points if you fail to capture criminals or if they give you the slip. Getting points is important because you cannot become a hero without a sponsor, and doing well means your sponsor is happy. Happy sponsors, happy network, happy hero. Thus, it's against their best interests to help each other out: each hero scrambles for as many points as they can get.    This is also part of why Kotetsu is such a bomb in the ratings: much to his producer's chagrin, he values people's lives over ratings or network shares, so instead of waiting for a commercial break to let the audience get excited he goes and just tries to save people anyway.      Other than the recap portion of the movie, the plot of The Beginning is that someone nabs the city's very important golden statue of justice and nobody can catch the crook. All the heroes run around, get bamboozled by his power to swap places, and it's really just a fun excuse to allow the cast run around and interact. Anime movies often feel bad for being superfluous, but since Tiger & Bunny the series has quite a few episodes dedicated to just building up the characters, it doesn't really feel out of place for the franchise.     It helps that the other heroes aren't terribly complicated and nevertheless get plenty of scenes to themselves. When the team is called out to arrest thief Robin Baxter, they all go their separate ways... together. Dragon Kid and Blue Rose talk about earrings. Fire Emblem... flirts with Rock Bison. Sky High shows off his wind-control powers to Origami Cyclone, showing an uncharacteristically fun-loving side of himself. It's good stuff that does a good job of letting the cast start to see themselves as more than just competitors.       They each get their moments, whether it's Sky High being a little ""up in the clouds"" even though he's currently the top-rated hero, Rock Bison and Kotetsu being Old Guys together as pals at the bottom of the rankings, or Blue Rose's hilariously cheesy mandated catchphrase.   I also wanna point out that I love the character designs in Tiger & Bunny. It's not just Kotetsu's fancy outfits or Barnaby's flowing locks – everyone in this series looks amazing. Masakazu Katsura was brought onboard to handle character designs; he worked on the superhero-flavored Zetman but he's also known for the romantic comedies D.N.A.², Video Girl Ai, and I''s. His charming character designs are fantastic.   ... Also, he did a manga called Wingman about a toku-themed superhero and I'm dying to see that get brought back someday.    They're also more semi-realistic than most anime even ten years ago and it works better since most of the characters are older. The downside is that it makes them harder to animate too, so expect them to look off-model in places. But I think overall the movies look good even compared to today's standards, including the heavy use of CG for the suits and the action.     As it turns out, the CG is on purpose: because many of the costumes would otherwise have to be redrawn if sponsors for the heroes changed (or if the sponsorship brands had to be removed for foreign markets), it's just easier to render them as CG models. The only one who gets traditional animation is Blue Rose, partly because it's hard to shove a logo on her skimpy outfit, partly because she's T&B's source of T&A.     Which becomes upsetting when you remember she's supposed to be in high school still, for some reason. Why are there no adult female superheroes?!   Nobody said idol culture was healthy... A detail the movies leave out from the series is that Blue Rose might have romantic inclinations towards Kotetsu, who's like... twice her age. Thank goodness. Also, because let's be honest, Kotetsu and Barnaby all the way. A family can be a little girl and her two bickering superhero dads.     That's touched on in the series but I prefer to see it as a ""hero crush"" rather than just being hot for a single dad since she obviously takes Kotetsu's ideals to heart after a point. But it's not strong enough to get in the way of Kotetsu and Barnaby's intense married couple energy. The series very much leans in on the ""partner"" thing in more than just a joke or tongue-in-cheek way; they really are each other's emotional support. Which is why in The Rising the whole plot is just about them breaking up and trying to get back together. It's classic.     I wanna touch on one more thing from The Beginning before we get into The Rising: it ends with a really big show of trust for Barnaby from Kotetsu. Barnaby manages to trick Robin Baxter into imprisoning himself, but later finds that Kotetsu specifically went out of his way not only to let the other heroes allow Barnaby to do this alone, but also made sure to hang in the background to make sure Barnaby's plan went off. As much as Kotetsu chafes at Barnaby's antics, he still wants him to feel like a member of a team.      Oh yeah, it's a great moment of just the way Kotetsu quietly supports people even if they didn't ask for it or he doesn't always know how to show it, and the plan wouldn't have worked if Kotetsu never stuck his neck out to the others the way he did.    I'll also take a moment to shoutout to the dub. I found both language tracks to be pretty good, but Tiger & Bunny has a lot of what I miss in anime dubs. The script is adapted really well and fits the more natural and Americanized feel of the show and the more diverse cast.   Being that I'm more of a fan of older Japanese heroes, I do regret the more-Americanized takes on the recent Japanese superheroes. But this does mean that a lot of life is breathed into them in English dubs.   Anyway, Kotetsu starts The Rising out with his breath beaten out of him. Wild Tiger and Barnaby have sunk in the ratings in the time since The Beginning (it's been a few months and later events from the Tiger & Bunny series have transpired). They're knocked down to the ""Second League"", where a bunch of not-so-great superheroes dwell.      Kotetsu had gotten up in age to the point where he can't use his powers very long and is trying to take a slower pace to accommodate but fears that by doing so he's now drawing down his partner.   The good news is, a mogul named Mark Schneider bought out their old sponsor and pulls the strings needed to get Barnaby back up to the First League, teaming him up with a new hero named Golden Ryan. The bad news is, Schneider had no intention of doing anything for Kotetsu: without a sponsor, he's forced to retire from heroism and take up a job as a cab driver.     Golden Ryan (A pun on ""Golden Lion"" to Kotetsu's Tiger), is also a bit of a huge douchebag.     You think the guys at Banpresto had a laugh about their logo being emblazoned on such a tool of a hero? I can't see him making any Super Robot Wars cameos anytime soon...   At any rate, a series of disasters strikes the city. Barnaby puts the clues together and deduces that the disasters are connected to an old legend from the city's history: a goddess, angered by mankind's greed, sends earthquakes, sleeping sickness and a massive chasm to devour the city. The problem is just trying to convince the higher-ups to let the heroes investigate this.    Also compounding issues is Golden Ryan being concerned with just earning points for just him and Barnaby, instead of collaborating with other heroes--a selfishness helped along with Ryan's gravity-powers.      Barnaby may have been eager in the past, but he sticks to his ideals plenty compared to Ryan, whose dubious methods actively gets in the way of the other heroes, cause collateral damage, and puts citizens in danger just to get racked up on a point sheet.   It's here... that we can finally touch on Fire Emblem, because they're an important part of The Rising's story.   So... Fire Emblem is self-described as a gay superhero (and he's got fire powers, get it?). Being that they own their own company, they're their own sponsor. But like... Fire Emblem feels like a really bad take on a gay person, more akin to The Crying Game and that era of not differentiating gay men from trans-women or the like.    In a lot of ways, Fire Emblem reminds me of Levin from Tekkaman Blade (I'm going somewhere with this, bear with me). Levin was also swishy, flaming, and very flirty with the protagonist--and there's a very touching episode where Levin talks to a woman about living their truth. There's only one Levin in the world, and they live true to themselves, and Levin contains multitudes that just can't be described by simple binary concepts like ""man"" or ""woman."" And in a lot of ways, that's what Fire Emblem is going for: we see in their past that Nathan (Fire Emblem's real name) struggled with their attraction to men or presenting as a woman. Their big climactic moment while stuck in a nightmare of their own worst fears is having a Persona 4 moment and embracing their shadow, celebrating what it means to be themselves. This is really good and genuinely compelling and it does loads to keep Fire Emblem from just being a camp joke... if only Fire Emblem weren't always goosing the other men and touching their butts in what's clearly discomforting. Like, Levin also thirsted for D-Boy, but they kept their hands to themselves.       I'm actually really sweet on Fire Emblem for this type of extremely extra character. Anime doesn't have a good track record of portraying openly queer characters; they're often extremely one note, and while there are elements of Fire Emblem that still aid into negative stereotypes like occasionally making predatory statements or bad touching, there's also a lot of sincerity around the character as well. Fire Emblem regularly proves to be mature, competent, and an emotionally supportive character to others. The other characters never shun Nathan for who they are or who they love, and overall I'm glad that the series' writing does seem to take their character seriously even if it's not perfect.      Nathan's pros definitely outweigh his cons and I don't want to give the impression that I think they're an outright bad character; the phrase ""problematic"" was made for moments like these. They're a great hero, a trusted friend, and honestly the only ding on their journey of acceptance is the fact that they kept goosing the other guys. Nathan is a person of color and that's always a delight to see in anime. Also, I'm using they/them pronouns for Nathan because it's my understanding the new Tiger & Bunny anime is also doing so in the dub.   And once Fire Emblem comes back they lend one heck of an assist to Blue Rose and Dragon Kid... Also, Fire Emblem is sponsored by Domino's. That just amuses me.      Kotetsu also manages to get the go-ahead to jump back in the game while the 2nd League Heroes were helping Fire Emblem recover. It's a good moment for them considering they got canned for not making any company money earlier.    I also loved Rock Bison's little moment of SEND ME FLYING and throwing up the horns after. He was sitting in dead last point-wise and was even desperate enough to start copying other people's bits in order to make himself more likeable to poor results due to how obvious the imitation was.     The Fastball Special is a time-honored tradition in superheroism; I salute Rock Bison in return. It's only a matter of time before the MCU makes it utterly obnoxious.   It also goes into some other themes about imitation, like Kotetsu's daughter trying to figure out how to write a good poem for her assignment but running into a wall when she keeps trying to imitate. Kotetsu surprisingly offers some worldly advice, which gets thrown right back at him.

I can't be the only one who thinks Lunatic resembles a weird cross between Purple Haze and King Crimson.

Community score: 3.8              What is this?   A youth story centering on two young women golfers named Eve and Aoi Amawashi. The two come from completely different backgrounds, with completely opposite play styles, and together they will shake the world of golf.    Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story- is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    Cailtin Moore  Rating:                People who have been reading my preview guide entries (and maybe premiere reviews for other sites before that) over the last few years are well familiar with how I've been opining that the lack of serious girls' sports anime is a travesty. Most of them are moe-fests about the power of friendship that aim to portray cuteness over athleticism, or jiggly fanservice delivery devices. I wanted the equivalent of Haikyu!! or Run with the Wind: stories that portray the characters as serious competitors, scrappy underdogs scraping by through hard training and camaraderie. That's what I thought I wanted.    But now that I've seen Birdie Wing, I've seen the light. I didn't need a serious story about overcoming the odds and rising through the ranks. I needed a shonen story full of hotblooded rivalry and ridiculously over-the-top superpowered moves, but minus the obsession with bouncing tits. What I needed… was Birdie Wing.    Oh, I was skeptical at first. Like many others who grew up before everyone had their own personal devices, I was tormented by my dad hogging the TV all day on weekends to watch his excruciatingly boring gold matches. I could not have cared less who Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods, or Vijay Singh were, but I learned nonetheless. I thought the trailer for Birdie Wing looked good and the character designs were appealing, but I wasn't sure if that could cut through the trauma of all those weekend afternoons I was forced to read instead of watch syndicated sitcoms.    By the time the ending credits rolled, I was more than ready to take back my misgivings. I wasn't sure how I felt about what I had just watched, but it certainly wasn't boring. And as I processed it, I finally arrived at how I felt: I loved it. It's not particularly well-animated or coherent, but it's wildly off-the-wall in the best possible way, constantly throwing things at the wall to see what sticks without rhyme or reason, and it is incredibly fun. Playing basically the world's most intense game of mini-golf but with actual trains instead of the archetypical windmill and your opponent is a clown mask? Sure. Hitting a tree branch in your way so hard it breaks without the ball completely losing its velocity? Why not! And don't forget the insert song full of black-and-white images of the protagonist Eve posing angstily against graffitied walls in slums that do nothing to advance the story.    It's so much. So much what, you ask? Just… so much. It's stuffed to the gills with the kind of anime bullshit that draw people to the medium, gleefully weird and energetic. It's not going to be a hole in one for everyone, but if you're looking for something that's not just par for the course, this is worth taking a look at.        James Beckett  Rating:               Birdie Wing is a sports anime that dares to break eons of tradition and ask the question that everyone has been to afraid to utter: “What if golf…was actually really cool?” That isn't to imply that golf isn't fun, or interesting, or a worthwhile athletic challenge; of all the less prolific sports for an anime to cover, I'm actually pretty happy to see one that's about golf at all. But I don't think even the hardest of the hardcore devotees of 18-Hole Pilgrimage would ever be shocked to hear me say that golf usually isn't considered one of the “cool” sports. For many folks, golf resides firmly within the realm of middle-aged white men donned in khaki shorts and matching visors who are probably just using a trip out to the greens as an excuse to get day drunk with all of their recently divorced friends.    Birdie Wing, instead, gives us a world of golf where the rich geezers are outnumbered by flashy anime gals and mysterious clown women that all treat golf as nothing less than existential blood sport. This cartoon's version of America is a dichotomy of disparity, where the most desperate and destitute live in the shadow of the wealthy elite (so…basically the exact same thing as the real America, come to think of it). Our scrappy heroine Eve is the equivalent of a jaded ronin for hire, except her katana is a golf club, and instead of bathing in the blood of her enemies, she revels in the meager riches she can accrue for her gal pals and the orphans they're helping to raise. Eve looks like a the frontwoman of a punk band and wields borderline supernatural skills on the links, and her companion Lily is all too happy to patiently explain to their opponents all of the ways in which they are viscerally screwed. Lily also loves Gunpla, which naturally makes here almost as cool as Eve.    Is this an utterly ridiculous premise for a golf anime to tackle? Yes, but damn it, that's what makes it cool. It's like when Calvin and Hobbes put on those dark shades and just stood around, doing nothing. The best sports shows are the ones that take the everyday thrills of athletic achievement and gild them in a shiny layer of Glorious Anime Bullshit, without so much as an ounce of shame. Y'all can keep your “Cute Girls Gently Sharing Common Hobbies,” I'd like to order a double serving of “Vagrant Women Engaging in Spiritual Combat with Suggestive Sports Metaphors,” and pile on the extra cheese if you please.    My only complaint about Birdie Wing is that its modest productions values and flat direction don't always do the funny premise and genuinely likeable characters justice. This is the kind of series that only becomes funnier the more ironically impressive it looks, and some more sakuga would go a long way towards bringing the whole experience together. Still, Birdie Wing is an awful lot of fun, and I'm excited to see where these golf girls go in future episodes.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               I have to hand it to Birdie Wing – it has managed to make one of the most stultifying sports to watch interesting. That's due to a combination of some very nice animation and shot framing and a premise that I can get behind, which is one that stands to challenge the exclusivity of what can be a very snooty sport. (At least in my experience; it's kind of a summer person sport where I'm from.) For Eve and her sister Lily, golf isn't just about winning prestigious tournaments, it's about having money to keep their found family together, because they're all living what appears to be a very precarious life in the slums, and while the oldest sister does her best, it's leveraging Eve's golf skills that keeps body and soul together – or at least that's the implication.    That's something that the episode does a remarkable job of showing us without any clunky exposition. We see a corrupt cop shaking down the family for protection money, we see that Eve's earnings go directly to food, and we see that Eve only plays with three clubs, instead of the vast array that other players have in their bags. When Eve is filling in for an injured player, her caddy is surprised to see her choose what she deems inappropriate clubs for a shot; later we realize that Eve's using the only clubs she's used to playing with – the others just aren't comfortable for her because she's not had the opportunity to use them very often, if ever. When Helene, a girl her age who plays in tournaments, notes that Eve only has the three clubs, it drives home the point without ever explicitly saying, “She's poor and these clubs are all she can afford.”    The episode also takes its time to establish Eve and Lily as characters before bringing us into the fateful meeting that stands to shape Eve's future. It's not until the end of the episode that Eve and Aoi, her probable rival/friend, even meet. We see just enough of Aoi to get the impression that she's intensely competitive and living in a totally different world than Eve – again, through context clues rather than being flat-out told – and it isn't until she approaches Eve that we start to get an idea of how they'll affect each other. Aoi calls golf “sacred;” Eve says that she only plays for money, which is something that Eve can't possibly understand. While I don't give a damn about golf, seeing where this relationship goes looks like it'll be worth putting up with the spectacularly cheesy background music. Both Eve and Aoi have things that could benefit each other. How they'll develop should be worth watching.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               I think golf is pretty much the most boring sport in the world to watch. But as I've said before, sports anime live or die on their characters—the sport itself is nothing more than a catalyst for the show's interpersonal drama. And let me tell you, Birdie Wing has learned this lesson well. Instead of being set around a high school sports team or being about a newbie learning the sport for the first time, Birdie Wing follows Eve, a golf hustler who makes her money by winning underground matches against rich amateurs and moonlighting on the pro-circuit in disguise.    Honestly, it's a welcome change of pace—especially as Eve is a highly sympathetic character. Living in the slums, making money to keep a room over the head of orphans, it's impossible not to root for her as she pockets the money of the rich despite owning only three clubs herself. She's basically the Robin Hood of golf. It also helps that while Eve is no doubt talented, much of her skill comes from countless hours of hard work—despite rarely getting to play on anything as nice as an actual course. It looks like watching her rise to stardom will be a cathartic experience to say the least.    On the visual side of things, the anime looks great. From the shots of the dirty slums and vibrant golf courses to the surreal animation of Eve's Prince of Tennis-style special moves, everything is clear and detailed. (And did anyone else notice that Eve and Aoi look a lot like the transformation scene versions of Panty and Stocking? No? Just me? Okay.) Then we have the music. From surprise Eurobeat to a heartfelt ballad, it was fantastic throughout. It's a score I'd expect in an idol anime, not a sports one.    All in all, it's safe to say that Birdie Wing caught me completely off guard. It is easily the best sport anime we've seen so far this season and with its Megalobox meets Carole & Tuesday vibes, I am 100% here for it.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Let me say up top that you're best off going into this show with as little foreknowledge as possible. If you're at all curious about this series, or were planning to check it out if the reviews were good, or just have 30 minutes to kill, do yourself a favor: go in blind and let this premiere wash over you. That's what I did, and I'm confident saying that's the best way to experience whatever the hell Birdie Wing is doing.    Really, going into this with just a short preview and a key image, I was fully expecting a standard sports anime. Sure there was the novelty of it being a rather rare girls' sports show, but I've been here before. I knew what I was getting into. Then 90 seconds in our heroine peeled off a Lupin-style rubber mask to reveal she was a secret underground golfer who makes her living betting on games against pros and occasionally impersonating other golfers to help them place in tournaments. Then I learned she does all this to support her found family of undocumented immigrants who run a dive bar and take care of three orphaned children. THEN she went off to play a midnight, high-stakes golf match against a woman in a clown mask on a golf course built on top of active train tracks. And right about there I realized I had no clue where this show was going, but I needed to find out.    It's the kind a pure-hearted anime bullshit that gets talked about a lot, but only occasionally pops up for real, and I ate it right up. Every couple of minutes this premiere found some new idea or element to blindside me with, and it pulled me through the entire episode in record time. A moody music video interlude of Eve looking solemnly over the slums of her home town? Osamu Dezaki-esque postcard memories to punctuate our heroine's cool lines about golf? Her rival striking an Obari Pose before showing off her absurdly long driver that powers he own cartoony style of golf? All of that and far more, to the point where it legitimately started to feel like this wasn't a real show, but an elaborate prank laser targeted at me and my online friend circle.    The only real hangup is that I don't know how long this show can keep that kind of energy up. It's already showing some strains in its production, and while the golf sections are conceptually creative, they struggle to deliver that energy in motion. Sk8 the Infinity, this show's closest cousin, managed its bawdy mix of skateboarding and pro-wrestling with fantastic visuals and pulse-pounding races, and I don't think this series has that in its cards. This could all very well fall apart in a few episodes once it runs out of ideas or the drawings start melting, and that would be a huge bummer.    But those are problems for Future Nick to worry about. In the here and now, this was an absolute blast to watch from start to finish. God knows I never expected to say that about a golf anime. If you were coming here looking for a serious and down-to-earth girls' sports show, I'm sorry. There's nothing for you here. But if you're at all intrigued by this nonsense I've been rambling out, give it a shot.     discuss this in the forum (291 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 3.8              What is this?   A youth story centering on two young women golfers named Eve and Aoi Amawashi. The two come from completely different backgrounds, with completely opposite play styles, and together they will shake the world of golf.    Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story- is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    Cailtin Moore  Rating:                People who have been reading my preview guide entries (and maybe premiere reviews for other sites before that) over the last few years are well familiar with how I've been opining that the lack of serious girls' sports anime is a travesty. Most of them are moe-fests about the power of friendship that aim to portray cuteness over athleticism, or jiggly fanservice delivery devices. I wanted the equivalent of Haikyu!! or Run with the Wind: stories that portray the characters as serious competitors, scrappy underdogs scraping by through hard training and camaraderie. That's what I thought I wanted.    But now that I've seen Birdie Wing, I've seen the light. I didn't need a serious story about overcoming the odds and rising through the ranks. I needed a shonen story full of hotblooded rivalry and ridiculously over-the-top superpowered moves, but minus the obsession with bouncing tits. What I needed… was Birdie Wing.    Oh, I was skeptical at first. Like many others who grew up before everyone had their own personal devices, I was tormented by my dad hogging the TV all day on weekends to watch his excruciatingly boring gold matches. I could not have cared less who Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods, or Vijay Singh were, but I learned nonetheless. I thought the trailer for Birdie Wing looked good and the character designs were appealing, but I wasn't sure if that could cut through the trauma of all those weekend afternoons I was forced to read instead of watch syndicated sitcoms.    By the time the ending credits rolled, I was more than ready to take back my misgivings. I wasn't sure how I felt about what I had just watched, but it certainly wasn't boring. And as I processed it, I finally arrived at how I felt: I loved it. It's not particularly well-animated or coherent, but it's wildly off-the-wall in the best possible way, constantly throwing things at the wall to see what sticks without rhyme or reason, and it is incredibly fun. Playing basically the world's most intense game of mini-golf but with actual trains instead of the archetypical windmill and your opponent is a clown mask? Sure. Hitting a tree branch in your way so hard it breaks without the ball completely losing its velocity? Why not! And don't forget the insert song full of black-and-white images of the protagonist Eve posing angstily against graffitied walls in slums that do nothing to advance the story.    It's so much. So much what, you ask? Just… so much. It's stuffed to the gills with the kind of anime bullshit that draw people to the medium, gleefully weird and energetic.

Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               I have to hand it to Birdie Wing – it has managed to make one of the most stultifying sports to watch interesting. That's due to a combination of some very nice animation and shot framing and a premise that I can get behind, which is one that stands to challenge the exclusivity of what can be a very snooty sport. (At least in my experience; it's kind of a summer person sport where I'm from.) For Eve and her sister Lily, golf isn't just about winning prestigious tournaments, it's about having money to keep their found family together, because they're all living what appears to be a very precarious life in the slums, and while the oldest sister does her best, it's leveraging Eve's golf skills that keeps body and soul together – or at least that's the implication.    That's something that the episode does a remarkable job of showing us without any clunky exposition. We see a corrupt cop shaking down the family for protection money, we see that Eve's earnings go directly to food, and we see that Eve only plays with three clubs, instead of the vast array that other players have in their bags. When Eve is filling in for an injured player, her caddy is surprised to see her choose what she deems inappropriate clubs for a shot; later we realize that Eve's using the only clubs she's used to playing with – the others just aren't comfortable for her because she's not had the opportunity to use them very often, if ever. When Helene, a girl her age who plays in tournaments, notes that Eve only has the three clubs, it drives home the point without ever explicitly saying, “She's poor and these clubs are all she can afford.”    The episode also takes its time to establish Eve and Lily as characters before bringing us into the fateful meeting that stands to shape Eve's future. It's not until the end of the episode that Eve and Aoi, her probable rival/friend, even meet. We see just enough of Aoi to get the impression that she's intensely competitive and living in a totally different world than Eve – again, through context clues rather than being flat-out told – and it isn't until she approaches Eve that we start to get an idea of how they'll affect each other. Aoi calls golf “sacred;” Eve says that she only plays for money, which is something that Eve can't possibly understand. While I don't give a damn about golf, seeing where this relationship goes looks like it'll be worth putting up with the spectacularly cheesy background music. Both Eve and Aoi have things that could benefit each other. How they'll develop should be worth watching.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               I think golf is pretty much the most boring sport in the world to watch. But as I've said before, sports anime live or die on their characters—the sport itself is nothing more than a catalyst for the show's interpersonal drama. And let me tell you, Birdie Wing has learned this lesson well. Instead of being set around a high school sports team or being about a newbie learning the sport for the first time, Birdie Wing follows Eve, a golf hustler who makes her money by winning underground matches against rich amateurs and moonlighting on the pro-circuit in disguise.    Honestly, it's a welcome change of pace—especially as Eve is a highly sympathetic character. Living in the slums, making money to keep a room over the head of orphans, it's impossible not to root for her as she pockets the money of the rich despite owning only three clubs herself. She's basically the Robin Hood of golf. It also helps that while Eve is no doubt talented, much of her skill comes from countless hours of hard work—despite rarely getting to play on anything as nice as an actual course. It looks like watching her rise to stardom will be a cathartic experience to say the least.    On the visual side of things, the anime looks great. From the shots of the dirty slums and vibrant golf courses to the surreal animation of Eve's Prince of Tennis-style special moves, everything is clear and detailed. (And did anyone else notice that Eve and Aoi look a lot like the transformation scene versions of Panty and Stocking? No? Just me? Okay.) Then we have the music. From surprise Eurobeat to a heartfelt ballad, it was fantastic throughout. It's a score I'd expect in an idol anime, not a sports one.    All in all, it's safe to say that Birdie Wing caught me completely off guard. It is easily the best sport anime we've seen so far this season and with its Megalobox meets Carole & Tuesday vibes, I am 100% here for it.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Let me say up top that you're best off going into this show with as little foreknowledge as possible. If you're at all curious about this series, or were planning to check it out if the reviews were good, or just have 30 minutes to kill, do yourself a favor: go in blind and let this premiere wash over you. That's what I did, and I'm confident saying that's the best way to experience whatever the hell Birdie Wing is doing.    Really, going into this with just a short preview and a key image, I was fully expecting a standard sports anime. Sure there was the novelty of it being a rather rare girls' sports show, but I've been here before. I knew what I was getting into. Then 90 seconds in our heroine peeled off a Lupin-style rubber mask to reveal she was a secret underground golfer who makes her living betting on games against pros and occasionally impersonating other golfers to help them place in tournaments. Then I learned she does all this to support her found family of undocumented immigrants who run a dive bar and take care of three orphaned children. THEN she went off to play a midnight, high-stakes golf match against a woman in a clown mask on a golf course built on top of active train tracks. And right about there I realized I had no clue where this show was going, but I needed to find out.    It's the kind a pure-hearted anime bullshit that gets talked about a lot, but only occasionally pops up for real, and I ate it right up. Every couple of minutes this premiere found some new idea or element to blindside me with, and it pulled me through the entire episode in record time. A moody music video interlude of Eve looking solemnly over the slums of her home town? Osamu Dezaki-esque postcard memories to punctuate our heroine's cool lines about golf? Her rival striking an Obari Pose before showing off her absurdly long driver that powers he own cartoony style of golf? All of that and far more, to the point where it legitimately started to feel like this wasn't a real show, but an elaborate prank laser targeted at me and my online friend circle.    The only real hangup is that I don't know how long this show can keep that kind of energy up. It's already showing some strains in its production, and while the golf sections are conceptually creative, they struggle to deliver that energy in motion. Sk8 the Infinity, this show's closest cousin, managed its bawdy mix of skateboarding and pro-wrestling with fantastic visuals and pulse-pounding races, and I don't think this series has that in its cards. This could all very well fall apart in a few episodes once it runs out of ideas or the drawings start melting, and that would be a huge bummer.    But those are problems for Future Nick to worry about. In the here and now, this was an absolute blast to watch from start to finish. God knows I never expected to say that about a golf anime. If you were coming here looking for a serious and down-to-earth girls' sports show, I'm sorry. There's nothing for you here. But if you're at all intrigued by this nonsense I've been rambling out, give it a shot.     discuss this in the forum (291 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives    ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 3.8              What is this?   A youth story centering on two young women golfers named Eve and Aoi Amawashi. The two come from completely different backgrounds, with completely opposite play styles, and together they will shake the world of golf.    Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story- is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    Cailtin Moore  Rating:                People who have been reading my preview guide entries (and maybe premiere reviews for other sites before that) over the last few years are well familiar with how I've been opining that the lack of serious girls' sports anime is a travesty. Most of them are moe-fests about the power of friendship that aim to portray cuteness over athleticism, or jiggly fanservice delivery devices. I wanted the equivalent of Haikyu!! or Run with the Wind: stories that portray the characters as serious competitors, scrappy underdogs scraping by through hard training and camaraderie. That's what I thought I wanted.    But now that I've seen Birdie Wing, I've seen the light. I didn't need a serious story about overcoming the odds and rising through the ranks. I needed a shonen story full of hotblooded rivalry and ridiculously over-the-top superpowered moves, but minus the obsession with bouncing tits. What I needed… was Birdie Wing.    Oh, I was skeptical at first. Like many others who grew up before everyone had their own personal devices, I was tormented by my dad hogging the TV all day on weekends to watch his excruciatingly boring gold matches. I could not have cared less who Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods, or Vijay Singh were, but I learned nonetheless. I thought the trailer for Birdie Wing looked good and the character designs were appealing, but I wasn't sure if that could cut through the trauma of all those weekend afternoons I was forced to read instead of watch syndicated sitcoms.    By the time the ending credits rolled, I was more than ready to take back my misgivings. I wasn't sure how I felt about what I had just watched, but it certainly wasn't boring. And as I processed it, I finally arrived at how I felt: I loved it. It's not particularly well-animated or coherent, but it's wildly off-the-wall in the best possible way, constantly throwing things at the wall to see what sticks without rhyme or reason, and it is incredibly fun. Playing basically the world's most intense game of mini-golf but with actual trains instead of the archetypical windmill and your opponent is a clown mask? Sure. Hitting a tree branch in your way so hard it breaks without the ball completely losing its velocity? Why not! And don't forget the insert song full of black-and-white images of the protagonist Eve posing angstily against graffitied walls in slums that do nothing to advance the story.    It's so much. So much what, you ask? Just… so much. It's stuffed to the gills with the kind of anime bullshit that draw people to the medium, gleefully weird and energetic. It's not going to be a hole in one for everyone, but if you're looking for something that's not just par for the course, this is worth taking a look at.        James Beckett  Rating:               Birdie Wing is a sports anime that dares to break eons of tradition and ask the question that everyone has been to afraid to utter: “What if golf…was actually really cool?” That isn't to imply that golf isn't fun, or interesting, or a worthwhile athletic challenge; of all the less prolific sports for an anime to cover, I'm actually pretty happy to see one that's about golf at all. But I don't think even the hardest of the hardcore devotees of 18-Hole Pilgrimage would ever be shocked to hear me say that golf usually isn't considered one of the “cool” sports. For many folks, golf resides firmly within the realm of middle-aged white men donned in khaki shorts and matching visors who are probably just using a trip out to the greens as an excuse to get day drunk with all of their recently divorced friends.    Birdie Wing, instead, gives us a world of golf where the rich geezers are outnumbered by flashy anime gals and mysterious clown women that all treat golf as nothing less than existential blood sport. This cartoon's version of America is a dichotomy of disparity, where the most desperate and destitute live in the shadow of the wealthy elite (so…basically the exact same thing as the real America, come to think of it). Our scrappy heroine Eve is the equivalent of a jaded ronin for hire, except her katana is a golf club, and instead of bathing in the blood of her enemies, she revels in the meager riches she can accrue for her gal pals and the orphans they're helping to raise. Eve looks like a the frontwoman of a punk band and wields borderline supernatural skills on the links, and her companion Lily is all too happy to patiently explain to their opponents all of the ways in which they are viscerally screwed. Lily also loves Gunpla, which naturally makes here almost as cool as Eve.    Is this an utterly ridiculous premise for a golf anime to tackle? Yes, but damn it, that's what makes it cool. It's like when Calvin and Hobbes put on those dark shades and just stood around, doing nothing. The best sports shows are the ones that take the everyday thrills of athletic achievement and gild them in a shiny layer of Glorious Anime Bullshit, without so much as an ounce of shame. Y'all can keep your “Cute Girls Gently Sharing Common Hobbies,” I'd like to order a double serving of “Vagrant Women Engaging in Spiritual Combat with Suggestive Sports Metaphors,” and pile on the extra cheese if you please.    My only complaint about Birdie Wing is that its modest productions values and flat direction don't always do the funny premise and genuinely likeable characters justice. This is the kind of series that only becomes funnier the more ironically impressive it looks, and some more sakuga would go a long way towards bringing the whole experience together. Still, Birdie Wing is an awful lot of fun, and I'm excited to see where these golf girls go in future episodes.

Living in the slums, making money to keep a room over the head of orphans, it's impossible not to root for her as she pockets the money of the rich despite owning only three clubs herself. She's basically the Robin Hood of golf. It also helps that while Eve is no doubt talented, much of her skill comes from countless hours of hard work—despite rarely getting to play on anything as nice as an actual course. It looks like watching her rise to stardom will be a cathartic experience to say the least.    On the visual side of things, the anime looks great. From the shots of the dirty slums and vibrant golf courses to the surreal animation of Eve's Prince of Tennis-style special moves, everything is clear and detailed. (And did anyone else notice that Eve and Aoi look a lot like the transformation scene versions of Panty and Stocking? No? Just me? Okay.) Then we have the music. From surprise Eurobeat to a heartfelt ballad, it was fantastic throughout. It's a score I'd expect in an idol anime, not a sports one.    All in all, it's safe to say that Birdie Wing caught me completely off guard. It is easily the best sport anime we've seen so far this season and with its Megalobox meets Carole & Tuesday vibes, I am 100% here for it.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Let me say up top that you're best off going into this show with as little foreknowledge as possible. If you're at all curious about this series, or were planning to check it out if the reviews were good, or just have 30 minutes to kill, do yourself a favor: go in blind and let this premiere wash over you. That's what I did, and I'm confident saying that's the best way to experience whatever the hell Birdie Wing is doing.    Really, going into this with just a short preview and a key image, I was fully expecting a standard sports anime. Sure there was the novelty of it being a rather rare girls' sports show, but I've been here before. I knew what I was getting into. Then 90 seconds in our heroine peeled off a Lupin-style rubber mask to reveal she was a secret underground golfer who makes her living betting on games against pros and occasionally impersonating other golfers to help them place in tournaments. Then I learned she does all this to support her found family of undocumented immigrants who run a dive bar and take care of three orphaned children. THEN she went off to play a midnight, high-stakes golf match against a woman in a clown mask on a golf course built on top of active train tracks. And right about there I realized I had no clue where this show was going, but I needed to find out.    It's the kind a pure-hearted anime bullshit that gets talked about a lot, but only occasionally pops up for real, and I ate it right up. Every couple of minutes this premiere found some new idea or element to blindside me with, and it pulled me through the entire episode in record time. A moody music video interlude of Eve looking solemnly over the slums of her home town? Osamu Dezaki-esque postcard memories to punctuate our heroine's cool lines about golf? Her rival striking an Obari Pose before showing off her absurdly long driver that powers he own cartoony style of golf? All of that and far more, to the point where it legitimately started to feel like this wasn't a real show, but an elaborate prank laser targeted at me and my online friend circle.    The only real hangup is that I don't know how long this show can keep that kind of energy up. It's already showing some strains in its production, and while the golf sections are conceptually creative, they struggle to deliver that energy in motion. Sk8 the Infinity, this show's closest cousin, managed its bawdy mix of skateboarding and pro-wrestling with fantastic visuals and pulse-pounding races, and I don't think this series has that in its cards. This could all very well fall apart in a few episodes once it runs out of ideas or the drawings start melting, and that would be a huge bummer.    But those are problems for Future Nick to worry about. In the here and now, this was an absolute blast to watch from start to finish. God knows I never expected to say that about a golf anime. If you were coming here looking for a serious and down-to-earth girls' sports show, I'm sorry. There's nothing for you here. But if you're at all intrigued by this nonsense I've been rambling out, give it a shot.

Community score: 3.8              What is this?   A youth story centering on two young women golfers named Eve and Aoi Amawashi. The two come from completely different backgrounds, with completely opposite play styles, and together they will shake the world of golf.    Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story- is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    Cailtin Moore  Rating:                People who have been reading my preview guide entries (and maybe premiere reviews for other sites before that) over the last few years are well familiar with how I've been opining that the lack of serious girls' sports anime is a travesty. Most of them are moe-fests about the power of friendship that aim to portray cuteness over athleticism, or jiggly fanservice delivery devices. I wanted the equivalent of Haikyu!! or Run with the Wind: stories that portray the characters as serious competitors, scrappy underdogs scraping by through hard training and camaraderie. That's what I thought I wanted.    But now that I've seen Birdie Wing, I've seen the light. I didn't need a serious story about overcoming the odds and rising through the ranks. I needed a shonen story full of hotblooded rivalry and ridiculously over-the-top superpowered moves, but minus the obsession with bouncing tits. What I needed… was Birdie Wing.    Oh, I was skeptical at first. Like many others who grew up before everyone had their own personal devices, I was tormented by my dad hogging the TV all day on weekends to watch his excruciatingly boring gold matches. I could not have cared less who Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods, or Vijay Singh were, but I learned nonetheless. I thought the trailer for Birdie Wing looked good and the character designs were appealing, but I wasn't sure if that could cut through the trauma of all those weekend afternoons I was forced to read instead of watch syndicated sitcoms.    By the time the ending credits rolled, I was more than ready to take back my misgivings. I wasn't sure how I felt about what I had just watched, but it certainly wasn't boring. And as I processed it, I finally arrived at how I felt: I loved it. It's not particularly well-animated or coherent, but it's wildly off-the-wall in the best possible way, constantly throwing things at the wall to see what sticks without rhyme or reason, and it is incredibly fun. Playing basically the world's most intense game of mini-golf but with actual trains instead of the archetypical windmill and your opponent is a clown mask? Sure. Hitting a tree branch in your way so hard it breaks without the ball completely losing its velocity? Why not! And don't forget the insert song full of black-and-white images of the protagonist Eve posing angstily against graffitied walls in slums that do nothing to advance the story.    It's so much. So much what, you ask? Just… so much. It's stuffed to the gills with the kind of anime bullshit that draw people to the medium, gleefully weird and energetic. It's not going to be a hole in one for everyone, but if you're looking for something that's not just par for the course, this is worth taking a look at.        James Beckett  Rating:               Birdie Wing is a sports anime that dares to break eons of tradition and ask the question that everyone has been to afraid to utter: “What if golf…was actually really cool?” That isn't to imply that golf isn't fun, or interesting, or a worthwhile athletic challenge; of all the less prolific sports for an anime to cover, I'm actually pretty happy to see one that's about golf at all. But I don't think even the hardest of the hardcore devotees of 18-Hole Pilgrimage would ever be shocked to hear me say that golf usually isn't considered one of the “cool” sports. For many folks, golf resides firmly within the realm of middle-aged white men donned in khaki shorts and matching visors who are probably just using a trip out to the greens as an excuse to get day drunk with all of their recently divorced friends.    Birdie Wing, instead, gives us a world of golf where the rich geezers are outnumbered by flashy anime gals and mysterious clown women that all treat golf as nothing less than existential blood sport. This cartoon's version of America is a dichotomy of disparity, where the most desperate and destitute live in the shadow of the wealthy elite (so…basically the exact same thing as the real America, come to think of it). Our scrappy heroine Eve is the equivalent of a jaded ronin for hire, except her katana is a golf club, and instead of bathing in the blood of her enemies, she revels in the meager riches she can accrue for her gal pals and the orphans they're helping to raise. Eve looks like a the frontwoman of a punk band and wields borderline supernatural skills on the links, and her companion Lily is all too happy to patiently explain to their opponents all of the ways in which they are viscerally screwed. Lily also loves Gunpla, which naturally makes here almost as cool as Eve.    Is this an utterly ridiculous premise for a golf anime to tackle? Yes, but damn it, that's what makes it cool. It's like when Calvin and Hobbes put on those dark shades and just stood around, doing nothing. The best sports shows are the ones that take the everyday thrills of athletic achievement and gild them in a shiny layer of Glorious Anime Bullshit, without so much as an ounce of shame. Y'all can keep your “Cute Girls Gently Sharing Common Hobbies,” I'd like to order a double serving of “Vagrant Women Engaging in Spiritual Combat with Suggestive Sports Metaphors,” and pile on the extra cheese if you please.    My only complaint about Birdie Wing is that its modest productions values and flat direction don't always do the funny premise and genuinely likeable characters justice. This is the kind of series that only becomes funnier the more ironically impressive it looks, and some more sakuga would go a long way towards bringing the whole experience together. Still, Birdie Wing is an awful lot of fun, and I'm excited to see where these golf girls go in future episodes.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               I have to hand it to Birdie Wing – it has managed to make one of the most stultifying sports to watch interesting. That's due to a combination of some very nice animation and shot framing and a premise that I can get behind, which is one that stands to challenge the exclusivity of what can be a very snooty sport. (At least in my experience; it's kind of a summer person sport where I'm from.) For Eve and her sister Lily, golf isn't just about winning prestigious tournaments, it's about having money to keep their found family together, because they're all living what appears to be a very precarious life in the slums, and while the oldest sister does her best, it's leveraging Eve's golf skills that keeps body and soul together – or at least that's the implication.    That's something that the episode does a remarkable job of showing us without any clunky exposition. We see a corrupt cop shaking down the family for protection money, we see that Eve's earnings go directly to food, and we see that Eve only plays with three clubs, instead of the vast array that other players have in their bags. When Eve is filling in for an injured player, her caddy is surprised to see her choose what she deems inappropriate clubs for a shot; later we realize that Eve's using the only clubs she's used to playing with – the others just aren't comfortable for her because she's not had the opportunity to use them very often, if ever. When Helene, a girl her age who plays in tournaments, notes that Eve only has the three clubs, it drives home the point without ever explicitly saying, “She's poor and these clubs are all she can afford.”    The episode also takes its time to establish Eve and Lily as characters before bringing us into the fateful meeting that stands to shape Eve's future. It's not until the end of the episode that Eve and Aoi, her probable rival/friend, even meet. We see just enough of Aoi to get the impression that she's intensely competitive and living in a totally different world than Eve – again, through context clues rather than being flat-out told – and it isn't until she approaches Eve that we start to get an idea of how they'll affect each other. Aoi calls golf “sacred;” Eve says that she only plays for money, which is something that Eve can't possibly understand. While I don't give a damn about golf, seeing where this relationship goes looks like it'll be worth putting up with the spectacularly cheesy background music. Both Eve and Aoi have things that could benefit each other. How they'll develop should be worth watching.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               I think golf is pretty much the most boring sport in the world to watch. But as I've said before, sports anime live or die on their characters—the sport itself is nothing more than a catalyst for the show's interpersonal drama. And let me tell you, Birdie Wing has learned this lesson well. Instead of being set around a high school sports team or being about a newbie learning the sport for the first time, Birdie Wing follows Eve, a golf hustler who makes her money by winning underground matches against rich amateurs and moonlighting on the pro-circuit in disguise.    Honestly, it's a welcome change of pace—especially as Eve is a highly sympathetic character.

Community score: 4.3           After last week's stunner, there aren't a whole lot of surprises left in Sabikui Bisco's bag of tricks, but it doesn't need them to pull together a satisfying and highly fungal finale. In fact, it's a credit to the story's construction that all of this feels as natural as it does. It's an over-the-top capstone on a drawn out and action heavy kaiju assualt, yet it hits the right character beats and ties a neat bow on this season's most important threads. And at this point, all Sabikui Bisco really needed to do was not trip over itself in order to wrap up a solid adaptation, so it can consider itself as steady as bedrock.    To my chagrin, Bisco's messianic return does indeed receive an explanation, but at least it jives with the rest of the setting. If I've already accepted that spore-coated arrows can spontaneously generate skyscraper-sized caps, then it only takes a light mental jog to accept that pipe snake poison can turn you into an immortal mushroom man. What's most important is that it's very gross. Bisco remarks that he has to clean Rust Eater growths off himself regularly, and he's in a hurry to find a cure for this unwanted boon of immortality, which is very in-character for him. I had been wondering where the story could go from here now that one of its heroes is apparently unkillable, and this makes a lot of sense.    Even with Bisco's miraculous mycelium, however, it still takes all hands to take down Kurokawa's yucky rust-spewing colossus. Personally, I wouldn't have dragged this confrontation out over three weeks, and I think the story's pacing would have been better served by frontloading at least one more episodic travelogue to better acquaint ourselves with both our heroes and the oddness of this world. Nonetheless, this conclusion has a collection of small and large moments I like a lot. Tirol frantically flipping through the Tetsujin user manual is a fitting gag for her mental acumen and total lack of combat prowess. Milo and Bisco naturally get the finishing blow with their bro-and-arrow combo, fitting their bodies together to send one final Rust Eater payload through Kurokawa's cranium.    Pawoo definitely steals the show, though. I continue to find it funny the narrative seems so adamant on setting her, not her brother, up with Bisco—whether this is due to prejudice, cowardice, or some other factor, I couldn't say. But if it's going to do so, then at least it's doing so with plenty of aplomb. Never mind that she gets the best action setpiece in this episode, rocketing herself up close and personal into the Tetsujin's massive mug and using her much vaunted pole to cleave his mask in twain. She Frenches Bisco and then nonchalantly brags about tasting the tongue of a walking deity. That is pure action hero badass behavior. At the end of the day, I'm still team Milo, but Pawoo is too good a character to be upset with.    And Milo and Bisco do bless us with the finale's tenderest moment after the battle is won. Yeah, Pawoo got to play tonsil hockey with him, but it's Milo who snuggles up against Bisco's chiseled chest to listen to the steadiness of his hyphae-enhanced heartbeat. At no point in the episode is there ever a doubt that they'll do everything together, from kicking Kurokawa's big rusty ass, to searching for a cure for immortality, to spreading the good shroom news (and spores) to Japan's other prefectures. Despite all the melodrama of the season's second half, they're back to bickering like an old couple in no time. It's pleasant! And that honestly might be the best word for Sabikui Bisco. It might make a lot of waves with its weird ideas and outrageous presentation, but overall it's just a very pleasant, crowd-pleasing watch that does right by its source material.    As my last word on Sabikui Bisco as an adaptation and anime, I really want to note how impressive and consistent it was on the production level. I think I may have voiced my quibbles a little too much in these reviews, but that's only because the show was operating on a level where I could assess the animation and feel okay about it. Because, as a whole, the show looks great! It emphasized personality-rich character art and backgrounds throughout its run, and it was able to inject kinetic energy where it counted. This finale, for instance, has some really nice cuts. Consider the fallen Tetsujin sloughing off its rust body, or Pawoo slamming her sword into the giant mask. It's even more impressive considering this is Studio OZ's first main credit, although director Atsushi Ikariya is no neophyte, and the team appear closely entwined with the older and similarly named Studio NAZ. This tally of animators and animation directors suggests a highly concentrated core staff, and the results speak for themselves.    The season bookends itself with the border outpost, which both serves as a nice way to send off those characters, and serves as a piece of narrative punctuation suggesting the further adventures to come. While Imihama is sorted now that it has Rust Eater aplenty and a governor who's not a total psychopath, the rest of Japan isn't as enthused about Milo and Bisco's fungal proselytization. The societal rot that let Kurokawa flourish is still out there, and they need to cure it with their own brand of good natural rot. I will most certainly be game to pop more shrooms should we ever be blessed with more Bisco, but with its creative vision and focus on adapting just one volume, this season does an admirable job standing alone as one of winter's most enjoyable action anime.    Rating:                 Sabikui Bisco is currently streaming on Crunchyroll and Funimation.    Steve can be found on Twitter if you want to read his World’s End Harem livetweets. Otherwise, catch him chatting about trash and treasure alike on This Week in Anime.  <prevEpisodes 1-2 Episode 3 Episode 4 Episode 5 Episode 6 Episode 7 Episode 8 Episode 9 Episode 10 Episode 11 Episode 12     discuss this in the forum (51 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               back to Sabikui Bisco Episode Review homepage / archives      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4, 'https://twitter.com/sa10tatsu/status/1508496872826195976': 1, 'http://www.crunchyroll.com/sabikui-bisco': 1, 'https://www.funimation.com/shows/sabikui-bisco/': 1, 'https://www.twitter.com/vestenet': 1}"

And at this point, all Sabikui Bisco really needed to do was not trip over itself in order to wrap up a solid adaptation, so it can consider itself as steady as bedrock.    To my chagrin, Bisco's messianic return does indeed receive an explanation, but at least it jives with the rest of the setting. If I've already accepted that spore-coated arrows can spontaneously generate skyscraper-sized caps, then it only takes a light mental jog to accept that pipe snake poison can turn you into an immortal mushroom man. What's most important is that it's very gross. Bisco remarks that he has to clean Rust Eater growths off himself regularly, and he's in a hurry to find a cure for this unwanted boon of immortality, which is very in-character for him. I had been wondering where the story could go from here now that one of its heroes is apparently unkillable, and this makes a lot of sense.    Even with Bisco's miraculous mycelium, however, it still takes all hands to take down Kurokawa's yucky rust-spewing colossus. Personally, I wouldn't have dragged this confrontation out over three weeks, and I think the story's pacing would have been better served by frontloading at least one more episodic travelogue to better acquaint ourselves with both our heroes and the oddness of this world. Nonetheless, this conclusion has a collection of small and large moments I like a lot. Tirol frantically flipping through the Tetsujin user manual is a fitting gag for her mental acumen and total lack of combat prowess. Milo and Bisco naturally get the finishing blow with their bro-and-arrow combo, fitting their bodies together to send one final Rust Eater payload through Kurokawa's cranium.    Pawoo definitely steals the show, though. I continue to find it funny the narrative seems so adamant on setting her, not her brother, up with Bisco—whether this is due to prejudice, cowardice, or some other factor, I couldn't say. But if it's going to do so, then at least it's doing so with plenty of aplomb. Never mind that she gets the best action setpiece in this episode, rocketing herself up close and personal into the Tetsujin's massive mug and using her much vaunted pole to cleave his mask in twain. She Frenches Bisco and then nonchalantly brags about tasting the tongue of a walking deity. That is pure action hero badass behavior. At the end of the day, I'm still team Milo, but Pawoo is too good a character to be upset with.    And Milo and Bisco do bless us with the finale's tenderest moment after the battle is won. Yeah, Pawoo got to play tonsil hockey with him, but it's Milo who snuggles up against Bisco's chiseled chest to listen to the steadiness of his hyphae-enhanced heartbeat. At no point in the episode is there ever a doubt that they'll do everything together, from kicking Kurokawa's big rusty ass, to searching for a cure for immortality, to spreading the good shroom news (and spores) to Japan's other prefectures. Despite all the melodrama of the season's second half, they're back to bickering like an old couple in no time. It's pleasant! And that honestly might be the best word for Sabikui Bisco. It might make a lot of waves with its weird ideas and outrageous presentation, but overall it's just a very pleasant, crowd-pleasing watch that does right by its source material.    As my last word on Sabikui Bisco as an adaptation and anime, I really want to note how impressive and consistent it was on the production level. I think I may have voiced my quibbles a little too much in these reviews, but that's only because the show was operating on a level where I could assess the animation and feel okay about it. Because, as a whole, the show looks great! It emphasized personality-rich character art and backgrounds throughout its run, and it was able to inject kinetic energy where it counted. This finale, for instance, has some really nice cuts. Consider the fallen Tetsujin sloughing off its rust body, or Pawoo slamming her sword into the giant mask. It's even more impressive considering this is Studio OZ's first main credit, although director Atsushi Ikariya is no neophyte, and the team appear closely entwined with the older and similarly named Studio NAZ. This tally of animators and animation directors suggests a highly concentrated core staff, and the results speak for themselves.    The season bookends itself with the border outpost, which both serves as a nice way to send off those characters, and serves as a piece of narrative punctuation suggesting the further adventures to come. While Imihama is sorted now that it has Rust Eater aplenty and a governor who's not a total psychopath, the rest of Japan isn't as enthused about Milo and Bisco's fungal proselytization. The societal rot that let Kurokawa flourish is still out there, and they need to cure it with their own brand of good natural rot. I will most certainly be game to pop more shrooms should we ever be blessed with more Bisco, but with its creative vision and focus on adapting just one volume, this season does an admirable job standing alone as one of winter's most enjoyable action anime.

Community score: 3.4              What is this?   A gamer falls asleep—only to wake up in the world of the game he was playing. Arc has the powerful skills and weapons of his character, but there's just one problem, he's stuck looking like that character, too. An adventure in a fantastical new land awaits him, if he can get used to being a walking skeleton.    Skeleton Knight in Another World is based on  Ennki Hakari's light novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Jesus Christ. I started up Skeleton Knight in Another World determined that I wouldn't just repeat everything my fellow reviewers were saying, but that rape scene really casts a pall over the entire episode, doesn't it? Let's leave behind for a second that it's tawdry and potentially triggering and holy fuck Crunchyroll, couldn't you have tried to head it off with a warning screen for at least a couple seconds? Okay? Let's move on from that. It's still a spectacularly bad choice purely in terms of mood, character, and narrative structure.    Once the ridiculously graphic scene ends, the show jumps back to Arc waking up one day in a bunch of high-level gear from his favorite MMORPG with access to super powerful magic skills. But uh-oh! He's a skeleton! So he farts around getting excited about his powers and going gaga over an elf. He needs to interact with people in town without letting them know he's a skeleton, which I imagine is a lot like those dreams where you forget to put on clothes and now you're walking around naked trying to find something to wear before someone notices. I found its mishmash of isekai clichés boring, but I'm sure someone out there would like it, and overall it's pretty inoffensive.    Oh but wait! Back to the graphic rape! And all at once we've gone from silly skeleton antics to rape again, but this time we get to see Arc debating whether or not he should intervene. In a brutal rape. When he knows for a fact he's ridiculously overpowered. His hemming and hawing is even presented as comical, as he ponders whether it would be like entering PVP. It's extreme tonal whiplash, and the heaviness of the subject matter is out of place and totally overshadows everything else that happens. It's also a really, really bad look for Arc, especially as Tomoaki Maeno continues his goofy performance as Arc talks himself up between shots of the bandits ripping off the girl's piss-stained pantaloons, and her maid's breasts jiggling as another bandit slams her face into the ground.    And then, after a short scene of him accompanying them, we're back to goofy skeleton man enjoying some tasty food while trying not to let anyone notice he's a skeleton!! So funny!!    So, you know, it's not just about being offended about on-screen rape being used for cheap shock value. It's just a bad narrative choice all around, and deserves to be criticized for that in addition to being crass.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Holy crap. Hit that play button and you get both barrels, don't you? So let's get this out of the way first. I'm not going to say rape can't be used as a plot device, but it should be used carefully—and be integral to the plot/characters when used. It should not be used for simple shock value or for shorthand to show us the hero is good because he kills rapists.    Moving on, can I say how nice it is to see someone who's having fun being whisked away to a fantasy world as the game character they've put so much into? There's some real joy in seeing Arc play with his powers and get pumped up about seeing a real-life elf. Even better is that, even with his excitement, he's still smart enough to realize the immediate issues he has to face. Arc is way overpowered, sure, but he can't even afford a meal, and he has no idea how to clean and cook his own food.    So it makes sense that he would immediately think to do what he already has some knowledge of: become an adventurer. He doesn't complain about the entry test, and the lack of “epic quests” doesn't really matter to him as long as he can get enough for food and a place to stay. It makes him rather likeable as a character. He's not a gun-ho fool nor is he an angsty complainer. He's just a guy enjoying the cards fate has dealt him.    The bandit scene, despite its subject matter, works well on a character development level for Arc. When coming upon the bandits, Arc doesn't intervene immediately. It isn't because he doesn't care about those being harmed but rather because he thinks he might lose. This is interesting because it shows that he doesn't see the bandits as NPCs or monsters; he sees them as other players. Not only does this mean he views them as real people, but it also makes him associate what's going on with PVP—and in PVP, numbers almost always matter more than gear. That said, he does eventually step in because he feels he has to—he sees the women as real people too, after all. The whole internal conflict speaks volumes about how he views the world he has become trapped in.    Other than that, I liked the little touches the episode threw in here and there, from people noticing his armor and deciding he was a knight to him questioning why he didn't feel bad about slaughtering the bandits despite it being the first time he had ever taken a life. The subversion of him peaking over at the women not because he's a horny asshole but because he wants to make sure they aren't looking while he excitedly loots the bodies was fantastic—and can I just say I love his oversized armor with its giant pauldrons? Him riding a horse was a great visual gag. All in all, despite the rough start, I really enjoyed this episode and can't wait to see where things go from here as he inevitably forms a party and answers the call to adventure.      James Beckett  Rating:                Skeleton Knight in Another World might just be a front-runner for two Preview Guide World Records, though they are dubious achievements indeed. First off, we have the elephant in the room, which is the “Shortest Ever Gap Between A Content Warning And The Content In Question” Award. The literal first shot of this series is of a surprisingly graphic sexual assault, and I don't know what is worse: That the scene is so lascivious and needlessly cruel right off the bat, or that we're forced to watch this twice in a show that is ostensibly a breezy isekai comedy. It isn't more than five seconds after the rapists are violently vivisected in front of their already traumatized victims that we transition to the show's cheesy OP, which I must remind you serves to introduce a main character whose sole defining character trait is that he's a goofy-looking cartoon skeleton. It is as catastrophic failure to read the room as I've seen in a long ass time, and there are a good many viewers who will understandably recoil in disgust and reject this anime outright before the opening credits finish.    The second award that Skeleton Knight in Another World is up for is a far less offensive one, though it also represents a problem that you can't simply fast-forward through. It's the “You Don't Even Really Need To Watch This Show, Because Literally Everything You Could Ever Possibly Need To Know About It Is Right There In The Title” Award! If you take the “…in Another World” half of this anime's title into consideration, then practically every single element of this premiere will fall into place, immediately, in your own head, before you even set eyes on it (except perhaps for the terrible and stupid rape scene, but you get my point).    The main character is somehow reborn into a real, flesh-and-blood universe that just so happens to perfectly mirror his favorite generic fantasy MMORPG. He is improbably strong and gifted in literally every aspect of the game, and he also spends a bunch of time breaking down his “in- game” stats sheet and skill set, as if that is somehow a substitute for having actual world-building and a plot. He then meanders around, talking to people and narrating to himself about this completely bizarre and insane scenario that we've all seen play out so many times before. He also might be a genuine sociopath, since he is completely unfazed by the horrible suffering and pain that he witnesses and inflicts upon others, and seems to live only to hoard loot from the mangled corpses he leaves behind. The ”Skeleton” part of the title tells you that the main character is a skeleton.    And look, I'm a fair critic, and I will give Skeleton Knight in Another World credit where it is due: It is somewhat amusing when when the skeleton guy makes goofy faces and gets unreasonably excited about loot. I chuckled once, near the end of the episode, because of the funny skeleton faces on the screen. For that alone, I will grant this premiere a bonus half-star to its rating. Everything else about it sucks, though, so it can wear its two Premiere Guide World Record badges like the marks of dishonor that they are.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               If any other show this season has a worse start than Skeleton Knight I'll be horribly surprised. It's not “just” that this premiere starts off, from the literal first second, with an attempted rape sequence. Nor is it “just” that said scene is gratuitous and directed with an eye for titillation for the audience, and is a cheap attempt at setting up paper thin bad guys from our hero to kill. It's that this would be a gross and crummy opening for a dark fantasy like Goblin Slayer, but it's a truly abysmal first impression for a premiere that is 90% goofy bullshit with our skeleton gamer protagonist Himbo-ing his way through a bog standard isekai setup.    Because that's what nearly this whole episode is actually about. Our hero, Arc, wakes up in a skeleton body and a suit of magic armor, realizes he's been isekai'd, and basically stumbles through a tutorial fetch quest with his overpowered skills, laughing all the way. And while the actual story is generic as hell, Arc himself makes a pretty good introduction. He's just excited to be in this new world, doesn't think to ask any questions about how it happened, and rolls through every new discovery with an almost infectious zest for fantasy life. It still slows down too much when he's shuffling through his various video game skills, and the world itself is devoid of anything interesting, but I could honestly picture myself following this literal bonehead for a few episodes, especially if the wacky slapstick from the OP animation is an honest promise.    But all that goodwill died once we circled back around to that rape scene. It's just such a lazy, shameless bit of shock-jock writing that stops the episode in its tracks. It exists solely to create some indisputably evil bandits for our hero to gallantly kill, letting him take lives without guilt (literally, the show admits this right after) and gaining him the affection of the victimized waif he saved. It's the same kind of hacky, exploitative garbage that showed up to ruin Sword Art Online every season like clockwork, and it's especially out of place in what is otherwise a goofy comedy. Plus, it's all made even worse when we see the attack from Arc's perspective and know he could have stepped in sooner, but was busy fretting over his chances in a PVP fight and waited until literally the last second. Then once it's over we're right back to silly funtimes with The Bone Boi as he celebrates his new life in this fantasy world, making the entire thing feel like a bad joke.    So congrats to the story for ensuring I'm not going to bother with any more of it. Ya took any charm or fun you managed to generate and threw it in the garbage. If other viewers have more tolerance for this kind of crap writing, maybe it's worth sticking it out and see if this is a one-time aberration. But for me, there's nothing interesting or special enough in the rest of this show to risk sitting through another scene like that.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Do you have a boilerplate isekai story to tell that borrows heavily from about four hundred other similar series? Do you need a way to spice it up and get eyes on your project? Well then, may I suggest not using rape to do that? Skeleton Knight in Another World's first episode opens with a graphic (or at least graphic enough) rape scene that comes back almost shot-for-shot at about the fourteen-minute mark. It does establish that our hero, who is helpfully not the rapist, is a good guy, because he saves Lady Lauren and her maid Rita, but there seems to be no reason to show us the exact same scene of sexual violence twice in the same episode. The opening salvo seems to be a cheap bid to make viewers pay attention, and while I do recall the same scene happening in the source material, that's not an excuse. If your story's not interesting enough to appeal to viewers without shocking them, maybe you should rethink your plot.    That out of the way, the rest of the episode is also a bit shocking – shockingly bland, that is. Arc, the eponymous skeleton knight, fell asleep playing his game and woke up as his character, only he forgot that he went with the skeleton build when he was creating him, so now he's afraid to take his armor off in public. If he wanted to be a bad guy like his bone-related cousin Ainz from Overlord, he'd be all set, but in this story, his character is a holy knight, so the whole skeleton thing is a bit of a problem. So is the fact that everyone sees his ridiculously nice and powerful armor and assumes that he's gainfully employed, because that armor's all he's got and he's hungry. Watching him try to integrate himself into a very run-of-the-mill town is the most amusing part of the episode, because he's both making things up on the fly and getting random backstory assigned to him by townsfolk.    He's also incredibly excited to be having his very own isekai experience, although he doesn't phrase it that way. Arc's disappointed that his new world seems more plain old Medieval than fantasy based on Medieval Europe, and any little bit of fantasy that he can find is thrilling to him, be that an elf, an orc, or the fact that he can use magic. (Why he doesn't use his fire magic to roast himself some food is never answered.) Of course, he teleports himself right off a cliff trying to figure out how to use it, but that actually sounds about right for how this would work.    If the sexual assault had been left out, this would be an okay-ish show. Not innovative, but bland in an inoffensive way. But it does have the rape scene and that is enough to make me say that steering clear is the better option here, because a combination of insipid and offensive doesn't leave this with a whole lot to recommend it.     discuss this in the forum (291 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"
14-04-2022,animation,1,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/preview-guide/2022/spring/skeleton-knight-in-another-world/.183617,Skeleton Knight in Another World - The Spring 2022 Preview Guide - Anime News Network:SEA,"   The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Skeleton Knight in Another World   Apr  8th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Skeleton Knight in Another World ?                     Community score: 3.4              What is this?   A gamer falls asleep—only to wake up in the world of the game he was playing. Arc has the powerful skills and weapons of his character, but there's just one problem, he's stuck looking like that character, too. An adventure in a fantastical new land awaits him, if he can get used to being a walking skeleton.    Skeleton Knight in Another World is based on  Ennki Hakari's light novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Jesus Christ. I started up Skeleton Knight in Another World determined that I wouldn't just repeat everything my fellow reviewers were saying, but that rape scene really casts a pall over the entire episode, doesn't it? Let's leave behind for a second that it's tawdry and potentially triggering and holy fuck Crunchyroll, couldn't you have tried to head it off with a warning screen for at least a couple seconds? Okay? Let's move on from that. It's still a spectacularly bad choice purely in terms of mood, character, and narrative structure.    Once the ridiculously graphic scene ends, the show jumps back to Arc waking up one day in a bunch of high-level gear from his favorite MMORPG with access to super powerful magic skills. But uh-oh! He's a skeleton! So he farts around getting excited about his powers and going gaga over an elf. He needs to interact with people in town without letting them know he's a skeleton, which I imagine is a lot like those dreams where you forget to put on clothes and now you're walking around naked trying to find something to wear before someone notices. I found its mishmash of isekai clichés boring, but I'm sure someone out there would like it, and overall it's pretty inoffensive.    Oh but wait! Back to the graphic rape! And all at once we've gone from silly skeleton antics to rape again, but this time we get to see Arc debating whether or not he should intervene. In a brutal rape. When he knows for a fact he's ridiculously overpowered. His hemming and hawing is even presented as comical, as he ponders whether it would be like entering PVP. It's extreme tonal whiplash, and the heaviness of the subject matter is out of place and totally overshadows everything else that happens. It's also a really, really bad look for Arc, especially as Tomoaki Maeno continues his goofy performance as Arc talks himself up between shots of the bandits ripping off the girl's piss-stained pantaloons, and her maid's breasts jiggling as another bandit slams her face into the ground.    And then, after a short scene of him accompanying them, we're back to goofy skeleton man enjoying some tasty food while trying not to let anyone notice he's a skeleton!! So funny!!    So, you know, it's not just about being offended about on-screen rape being used for cheap shock value. It's just a bad narrative choice all around, and deserves to be criticized for that in addition to being crass.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Holy crap. Hit that play button and you get both barrels, don't you? So let's get this out of the way first. I'm not going to say rape can't be used as a plot device, but it should be used carefully—and be integral to the plot/characters when used. It should not be used for simple shock value or for shorthand to show us the hero is good because he kills rapists.    Moving on, can I say how nice it is to see someone who's having fun being whisked away to a fantasy world as the game character they've put so much into? There's some real joy in seeing Arc play with his powers and get pumped up about seeing a real-life elf. Even better is that, even with his excitement, he's still smart enough to realize the immediate issues he has to face. Arc is way overpowered, sure, but he can't even afford a meal, and he has no idea how to clean and cook his own food.    So it makes sense that he would immediately think to do what he already has some knowledge of: become an adventurer. He doesn't complain about the entry test, and the lack of “epic quests” doesn't really matter to him as long as he can get enough for food and a place to stay. It makes him rather likeable as a character. He's not a gun-ho fool nor is he an angsty complainer. He's just a guy enjoying the cards fate has dealt him.    The bandit scene, despite its subject matter, works well on a character development level for Arc. When coming upon the bandits, Arc doesn't intervene immediately. It isn't because he doesn't care about those being harmed but rather because he thinks he might lose. This is interesting because it shows that he doesn't see the bandits as NPCs or monsters; he sees them as other players. Not only does this mean he views them as real people, but it also makes him associate what's going on with PVP—and in PVP, numbers almost always matter more than gear. That said, he does eventually step in because he feels he has to—he sees the women as real people too, after all. The whole internal conflict speaks volumes about how he views the world he has become trapped in.    Other than that, I liked the little touches the episode threw in here and there, from people noticing his armor and deciding he was a knight to him questioning why he didn't feel bad about slaughtering the bandits despite it being the first time he had ever taken a life. The subversion of him peaking over at the women not because he's a horny asshole but because he wants to make sure they aren't looking while he excitedly loots the bodies was fantastic—and can I just say I love his oversized armor with its giant pauldrons? Him riding a horse was a great visual gag. All in all, despite the rough start, I really enjoyed this episode and can't wait to see where things go from here as he inevitably forms a party and answers the call to adventure.      James Beckett  Rating:                Skeleton Knight in Another World might just be a front-runner for two Preview Guide World Records, though they are dubious achievements indeed. First off, we have the elephant in the room, which is the “Shortest Ever Gap Between A Content Warning And The Content In Question” Award. The literal first shot of this series is of a surprisingly graphic sexual assault, and I don't know what is worse: That the scene is so lascivious and needlessly cruel right off the bat, or that we're forced to watch this twice in a show that is ostensibly a breezy isekai comedy. It isn't more than five seconds after the rapists are violently vivisected in front of their already traumatized victims that we transition to the show's cheesy OP, which I must remind you serves to introduce a main character whose sole defining character trait is that he's a goofy-looking cartoon skeleton. It is as catastrophic failure to read the room as I've seen in a long ass time, and there are a good many viewers who will understandably recoil in disgust and reject this anime outright before the opening credits finish.    The second award that Skeleton Knight in Another World is up for is a far less offensive one, though it also represents a problem that you can't simply fast-forward through. It's the “You Don't Even Really Need To Watch This Show, Because Literally Everything You Could Ever Possibly Need To Know About It Is Right There In The Title” Award! If you take the “…in Another World” half of this anime's title into consideration, then practically every single element of this premiere will fall into place, immediately, in your own head, before you even set eyes on it (except perhaps for the terrible and stupid rape scene, but you get my point).    The main character is somehow reborn into a real, flesh-and-blood universe that just so happens to perfectly mirror his favorite generic fantasy MMORPG. He is improbably strong and gifted in literally every aspect of the game, and he also spends a bunch of time breaking down his “in- game” stats sheet and skill set, as if that is somehow a substitute for having actual world-building and a plot. He then meanders around, talking to people and narrating to himself about this completely bizarre and insane scenario that we've all seen play out so many times before. He also might be a genuine sociopath, since he is completely unfazed by the horrible suffering and pain that he witnesses and inflicts upon others, and seems to live only to hoard loot from the mangled corpses he leaves behind. The ”Skeleton” part of the title tells you that the main character is a skeleton.    And look, I'm a fair critic, and I will give Skeleton Knight in Another World credit where it is due: It is somewhat amusing when when the skeleton guy makes goofy faces and gets unreasonably excited about loot. I chuckled once, near the end of the episode, because of the funny skeleton faces on the screen. For that alone, I will grant this premiere a bonus half-star to its rating. Everything else about it sucks, though, so it can wear its two Premiere Guide World Record badges like the marks of dishonor that they are.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               If any other show this season has a worse start than Skeleton Knight I'll be horribly surprised. It's not “just” that this premiere starts off, from the literal first second, with an attempted rape sequence. Nor is it “just” that said scene is gratuitous and directed with an eye for titillation for the audience, and is a cheap attempt at setting up paper thin bad guys from our hero to kill. It's that this would be a gross and crummy opening for a dark fantasy like Goblin Slayer, but it's a truly abysmal first impression for a premiere that is 90% goofy bullshit with our skeleton gamer protagonist Himbo-ing his way through a bog standard isekai setup.    Because that's what nearly this whole episode is actually about. Our hero, Arc, wakes up in a skeleton body and a suit of magic armor, realizes he's been isekai'd, and basically stumbles through a tutorial fetch quest with his overpowered skills, laughing all the way. And while the actual story is generic as hell, Arc himself makes a pretty good introduction. He's just excited to be in this new world, doesn't think to ask any questions about how it happened, and rolls through every new discovery with an almost infectious zest for fantasy life. It still slows down too much when he's shuffling through his various video game skills, and the world itself is devoid of anything interesting, but I could honestly picture myself following this literal bonehead for a few episodes, especially if the wacky slapstick from the OP animation is an honest promise.    But all that goodwill died once we circled back around to that rape scene. It's just such a lazy, shameless bit of shock-jock writing that stops the episode in its tracks. It exists solely to create some indisputably evil bandits for our hero to gallantly kill, letting him take lives without guilt (literally, the show admits this right after) and gaining him the affection of the victimized waif he saved. It's the same kind of hacky, exploitative garbage that showed up to ruin Sword Art Online every season like clockwork, and it's especially out of place in what is otherwise a goofy comedy. Plus, it's all made even worse when we see the attack from Arc's perspective and know he could have stepped in sooner, but was busy fretting over his chances in a PVP fight and waited until literally the last second. Then once it's over we're right back to silly funtimes with The Bone Boi as he celebrates his new life in this fantasy world, making the entire thing feel like a bad joke.    So congrats to the story for ensuring I'm not going to bother with any more of it. Ya took any charm or fun you managed to generate and threw it in the garbage.

If your story's not interesting enough to appeal to viewers without shocking them, maybe you should rethink your plot.    That out of the way, the rest of the episode is also a bit shocking – shockingly bland, that is. Arc, the eponymous skeleton knight, fell asleep playing his game and woke up as his character, only he forgot that he went with the skeleton build when he was creating him, so now he's afraid to take his armor off in public. If he wanted to be a bad guy like his bone-related cousin Ainz from Overlord, he'd be all set, but in this story, his character is a holy knight, so the whole skeleton thing is a bit of a problem. So is the fact that everyone sees his ridiculously nice and powerful armor and assumes that he's gainfully employed, because that armor's all he's got and he's hungry. Watching him try to integrate himself into a very run-of-the-mill town is the most amusing part of the episode, because he's both making things up on the fly and getting random backstory assigned to him by townsfolk.    He's also incredibly excited to be having his very own isekai experience, although he doesn't phrase it that way. Arc's disappointed that his new world seems more plain old Medieval than fantasy based on Medieval Europe, and any little bit of fantasy that he can find is thrilling to him, be that an elf, an orc, or the fact that he can use magic. (Why he doesn't use his fire magic to roast himself some food is never answered.) Of course, he teleports himself right off a cliff trying to figure out how to use it, but that actually sounds about right for how this would work.    If the sexual assault had been left out, this would be an okay-ish show. Not innovative, but bland in an inoffensive way. But it does have the rape scene and that is enough to make me say that steering clear is the better option here, because a combination of insipid and offensive doesn't leave this with a whole lot to recommend it.     discuss this in the forum (291 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives    ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"
14-04-2022,animation,1,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/preview-guide/2022/spring/skeleton-knight-in-another-world/.183617,Skeleton Knight in Another World - The Spring 2022 Preview Guide - Anime News Network:SEA,"                How would you rate episode 1 of Skeleton Knight in Another World ?                     Community score: 3.4              What is this?   A gamer falls asleep—only to wake up in the world of the game he was playing. Arc has the powerful skills and weapons of his character, but there's just one problem, he's stuck looking like that character, too. An adventure in a fantastical new land awaits him, if he can get used to being a walking skeleton.    Skeleton Knight in Another World is based on  Ennki Hakari's light novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Jesus Christ. I started up Skeleton Knight in Another World determined that I wouldn't just repeat everything my fellow reviewers were saying, but that rape scene really casts a pall over the entire episode, doesn't it? Let's leave behind for a second that it's tawdry and potentially triggering and holy fuck Crunchyroll, couldn't you have tried to head it off with a warning screen for at least a couple seconds? Okay? Let's move on from that. It's still a spectacularly bad choice purely in terms of mood, character, and narrative structure.    Once the ridiculously graphic scene ends, the show jumps back to Arc waking up one day in a bunch of high-level gear from his favorite MMORPG with access to super powerful magic skills. But uh-oh! He's a skeleton! So he farts around getting excited about his powers and going gaga over an elf. He needs to interact with people in town without letting them know he's a skeleton, which I imagine is a lot like those dreams where you forget to put on clothes and now you're walking around naked trying to find something to wear before someone notices. I found its mishmash of isekai clichés boring, but I'm sure someone out there would like it, and overall it's pretty inoffensive.    Oh but wait! Back to the graphic rape! And all at once we've gone from silly skeleton antics to rape again, but this time we get to see Arc debating whether or not he should intervene. In a brutal rape. When he knows for a fact he's ridiculously overpowered. His hemming and hawing is even presented as comical, as he ponders whether it would be like entering PVP. It's extreme tonal whiplash, and the heaviness of the subject matter is out of place and totally overshadows everything else that happens. It's also a really, really bad look for Arc, especially as Tomoaki Maeno continues his goofy performance as Arc talks himself up between shots of the bandits ripping off the girl's piss-stained pantaloons, and her maid's breasts jiggling as another bandit slams her face into the ground.    And then, after a short scene of him accompanying them, we're back to goofy skeleton man enjoying some tasty food while trying not to let anyone notice he's a skeleton!! So funny!!    So, you know, it's not just about being offended about on-screen rape being used for cheap shock value. It's just a bad narrative choice all around, and deserves to be criticized for that in addition to being crass.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Holy crap. Hit that play button and you get both barrels, don't you? So let's get this out of the way first. I'm not going to say rape can't be used as a plot device, but it should be used carefully—and be integral to the plot/characters when used. It should not be used for simple shock value or for shorthand to show us the hero is good because he kills rapists.    Moving on, can I say how nice it is to see someone who's having fun being whisked away to a fantasy world as the game character they've put so much into? There's some real joy in seeing Arc play with his powers and get pumped up about seeing a real-life elf. Even better is that, even with his excitement, he's still smart enough to realize the immediate issues he has to face. Arc is way overpowered, sure, but he can't even afford a meal, and he has no idea how to clean and cook his own food.    So it makes sense that he would immediately think to do what he already has some knowledge of: become an adventurer. He doesn't complain about the entry test, and the lack of “epic quests” doesn't really matter to him as long as he can get enough for food and a place to stay. It makes him rather likeable as a character. He's not a gun-ho fool nor is he an angsty complainer. He's just a guy enjoying the cards fate has dealt him.    The bandit scene, despite its subject matter, works well on a character development level for Arc. When coming upon the bandits, Arc doesn't intervene immediately. It isn't because he doesn't care about those being harmed but rather because he thinks he might lose. This is interesting because it shows that he doesn't see the bandits as NPCs or monsters; he sees them as other players. Not only does this mean he views them as real people, but it also makes him associate what's going on with PVP—and in PVP, numbers almost always matter more than gear. That said, he does eventually step in because he feels he has to—he sees the women as real people too, after all. The whole internal conflict speaks volumes about how he views the world he has become trapped in.    Other than that, I liked the little touches the episode threw in here and there, from people noticing his armor and deciding he was a knight to him questioning why he didn't feel bad about slaughtering the bandits despite it being the first time he had ever taken a life. The subversion of him peaking over at the women not because he's a horny asshole but because he wants to make sure they aren't looking while he excitedly loots the bodies was fantastic—and can I just say I love his oversized armor with its giant pauldrons? Him riding a horse was a great visual gag. All in all, despite the rough start, I really enjoyed this episode and can't wait to see where things go from here as he inevitably forms a party and answers the call to adventure.      James Beckett  Rating:                Skeleton Knight in Another World might just be a front-runner for two Preview Guide World Records, though they are dubious achievements indeed. First off, we have the elephant in the room, which is the “Shortest Ever Gap Between A Content Warning And The Content In Question” Award. The literal first shot of this series is of a surprisingly graphic sexual assault, and I don't know what is worse: That the scene is so lascivious and needlessly cruel right off the bat, or that we're forced to watch this twice in a show that is ostensibly a breezy isekai comedy. It isn't more than five seconds after the rapists are violently vivisected in front of their already traumatized victims that we transition to the show's cheesy OP, which I must remind you serves to introduce a main character whose sole defining character trait is that he's a goofy-looking cartoon skeleton. It is as catastrophic failure to read the room as I've seen in a long ass time, and there are a good many viewers who will understandably recoil in disgust and reject this anime outright before the opening credits finish.    The second award that Skeleton Knight in Another World is up for is a far less offensive one, though it also represents a problem that you can't simply fast-forward through. It's the “You Don't Even Really Need To Watch This Show, Because Literally Everything You Could Ever Possibly Need To Know About It Is Right There In The Title” Award! If you take the “…in Another World” half of this anime's title into consideration, then practically every single element of this premiere will fall into place, immediately, in your own head, before you even set eyes on it (except perhaps for the terrible and stupid rape scene, but you get my point).    The main character is somehow reborn into a real, flesh-and-blood universe that just so happens to perfectly mirror his favorite generic fantasy MMORPG. He is improbably strong and gifted in literally every aspect of the game, and he also spends a bunch of time breaking down his “in- game” stats sheet and skill set, as if that is somehow a substitute for having actual world-building and a plot. He then meanders around, talking to people and narrating to himself about this completely bizarre and insane scenario that we've all seen play out so many times before. He also might be a genuine sociopath, since he is completely unfazed by the horrible suffering and pain that he witnesses and inflicts upon others, and seems to live only to hoard loot from the mangled corpses he leaves behind. The ”Skeleton” part of the title tells you that the main character is a skeleton.    And look, I'm a fair critic, and I will give Skeleton Knight in Another World credit where it is due: It is somewhat amusing when when the skeleton guy makes goofy faces and gets unreasonably excited about loot. I chuckled once, near the end of the episode, because of the funny skeleton faces on the screen. For that alone, I will grant this premiere a bonus half-star to its rating. Everything else about it sucks, though, so it can wear its two Premiere Guide World Record badges like the marks of dishonor that they are.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               If any other show this season has a worse start than Skeleton Knight I'll be horribly surprised. It's not “just” that this premiere starts off, from the literal first second, with an attempted rape sequence. Nor is it “just” that said scene is gratuitous and directed with an eye for titillation for the audience, and is a cheap attempt at setting up paper thin bad guys from our hero to kill. It's that this would be a gross and crummy opening for a dark fantasy like Goblin Slayer, but it's a truly abysmal first impression for a premiere that is 90% goofy bullshit with our skeleton gamer protagonist Himbo-ing his way through a bog standard isekai setup.    Because that's what nearly this whole episode is actually about. Our hero, Arc, wakes up in a skeleton body and a suit of magic armor, realizes he's been isekai'd, and basically stumbles through a tutorial fetch quest with his overpowered skills, laughing all the way. And while the actual story is generic as hell, Arc himself makes a pretty good introduction. He's just excited to be in this new world, doesn't think to ask any questions about how it happened, and rolls through every new discovery with an almost infectious zest for fantasy life. It still slows down too much when he's shuffling through his various video game skills, and the world itself is devoid of anything interesting, but I could honestly picture myself following this literal bonehead for a few episodes, especially if the wacky slapstick from the OP animation is an honest promise.    But all that goodwill died once we circled back around to that rape scene. It's just such a lazy, shameless bit of shock-jock writing that stops the episode in its tracks. It exists solely to create some indisputably evil bandits for our hero to gallantly kill, letting him take lives without guilt (literally, the show admits this right after) and gaining him the affection of the victimized waif he saved. It's the same kind of hacky, exploitative garbage that showed up to ruin Sword Art Online every season like clockwork, and it's especially out of place in what is otherwise a goofy comedy. Plus, it's all made even worse when we see the attack from Arc's perspective and know he could have stepped in sooner, but was busy fretting over his chances in a PVP fight and waited until literally the last second. Then once it's over we're right back to silly funtimes with The Bone Boi as he celebrates his new life in this fantasy world, making the entire thing feel like a bad joke.    So congrats to the story for ensuring I'm not going to bother with any more of it. Ya took any charm or fun you managed to generate and threw it in the garbage. If other viewers have more tolerance for this kind of crap writing, maybe it's worth sticking it out and see if this is a one-time aberration. But for me, there's nothing interesting or special enough in the rest of this show to risk sitting through another scene like that.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Do you have a boilerplate isekai story to tell that borrows heavily from about four hundred other similar series? Do you need a way to spice it up and get eyes on your project? Well then, may I suggest not using rape to do that? Skeleton Knight in Another World's first episode opens with a graphic (or at least graphic enough) rape scene that comes back almost shot-for-shot at about the fourteen-minute mark. It does establish that our hero, who is helpfully not the rapist, is a good guy, because he saves Lady Lauren and her maid Rita, but there seems to be no reason to show us the exact same scene of sexual violence twice in the same episode.

Arc's disappointed that his new world seems more plain old Medieval than fantasy based on Medieval Europe, and any little bit of fantasy that he can find is thrilling to him, be that an elf, an orc, or the fact that he can use magic. (Why he doesn't use his fire magic to roast himself some food is never answered.) Of course, he teleports himself right off a cliff trying to figure out how to use it, but that actually sounds about right for how this would work.    If the sexual assault had been left out, this would be an okay-ish show. Not innovative, but bland in an inoffensive way. But it does have the rape scene and that is enough to make me say that steering clear is the better option here, because a combination of insipid and offensive doesn't leave this with a whole lot to recommend it.

14-04-2022,animation,1,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/preview-guide/2022/spring/skeleton-knight-in-another-world/.183617,Skeleton Knight in Another World - The Spring 2022 Preview Guide - Anime News Network:SEA,"            How would you rate episode 1 of Skeleton Knight in Another World ?                     Community score: 3.4              What is this?   A gamer falls asleep—only to wake up in the world of the game he was playing. Arc has the powerful skills and weapons of his character, but there's just one problem, he's stuck looking like that character, too. An adventure in a fantastical new land awaits him, if he can get used to being a walking skeleton.    Skeleton Knight in Another World is based on  Ennki Hakari's light novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Jesus Christ. I started up Skeleton Knight in Another World determined that I wouldn't just repeat everything my fellow reviewers were saying, but that rape scene really casts a pall over the entire episode, doesn't it? Let's leave behind for a second that it's tawdry and potentially triggering and holy fuck Crunchyroll, couldn't you have tried to head it off with a warning screen for at least a couple seconds? Okay? Let's move on from that. It's still a spectacularly bad choice purely in terms of mood, character, and narrative structure.    Once the ridiculously graphic scene ends, the show jumps back to Arc waking up one day in a bunch of high-level gear from his favorite MMORPG with access to super powerful magic skills. But uh-oh! He's a skeleton! So he farts around getting excited about his powers and going gaga over an elf. He needs to interact with people in town without letting them know he's a skeleton, which I imagine is a lot like those dreams where you forget to put on clothes and now you're walking around naked trying to find something to wear before someone notices. I found its mishmash of isekai clichés boring, but I'm sure someone out there would like it, and overall it's pretty inoffensive.    Oh but wait! Back to the graphic rape! And all at once we've gone from silly skeleton antics to rape again, but this time we get to see Arc debating whether or not he should intervene. In a brutal rape. When he knows for a fact he's ridiculously overpowered. His hemming and hawing is even presented as comical, as he ponders whether it would be like entering PVP. It's extreme tonal whiplash, and the heaviness of the subject matter is out of place and totally overshadows everything else that happens. It's also a really, really bad look for Arc, especially as Tomoaki Maeno continues his goofy performance as Arc talks himself up between shots of the bandits ripping off the girl's piss-stained pantaloons, and her maid's breasts jiggling as another bandit slams her face into the ground.    And then, after a short scene of him accompanying them, we're back to goofy skeleton man enjoying some tasty food while trying not to let anyone notice he's a skeleton!! So funny!!    So, you know, it's not just about being offended about on-screen rape being used for cheap shock value. It's just a bad narrative choice all around, and deserves to be criticized for that in addition to being crass.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Holy crap. Hit that play button and you get both barrels, don't you? So let's get this out of the way first. I'm not going to say rape can't be used as a plot device, but it should be used carefully—and be integral to the plot/characters when used. It should not be used for simple shock value or for shorthand to show us the hero is good because he kills rapists.    Moving on, can I say how nice it is to see someone who's having fun being whisked away to a fantasy world as the game character they've put so much into? There's some real joy in seeing Arc play with his powers and get pumped up about seeing a real-life elf. Even better is that, even with his excitement, he's still smart enough to realize the immediate issues he has to face. Arc is way overpowered, sure, but he can't even afford a meal, and he has no idea how to clean and cook his own food.    So it makes sense that he would immediately think to do what he already has some knowledge of: become an adventurer. He doesn't complain about the entry test, and the lack of “epic quests” doesn't really matter to him as long as he can get enough for food and a place to stay. It makes him rather likeable as a character. He's not a gun-ho fool nor is he an angsty complainer. He's just a guy enjoying the cards fate has dealt him.    The bandit scene, despite its subject matter, works well on a character development level for Arc. When coming upon the bandits, Arc doesn't intervene immediately. It isn't because he doesn't care about those being harmed but rather because he thinks he might lose. This is interesting because it shows that he doesn't see the bandits as NPCs or monsters; he sees them as other players. Not only does this mean he views them as real people, but it also makes him associate what's going on with PVP—and in PVP, numbers almost always matter more than gear. That said, he does eventually step in because he feels he has to—he sees the women as real people too, after all. The whole internal conflict speaks volumes about how he views the world he has become trapped in.    Other than that, I liked the little touches the episode threw in here and there, from people noticing his armor and deciding he was a knight to him questioning why he didn't feel bad about slaughtering the bandits despite it being the first time he had ever taken a life. The subversion of him peaking over at the women not because he's a horny asshole but because he wants to make sure they aren't looking while he excitedly loots the bodies was fantastic—and can I just say I love his oversized armor with its giant pauldrons? Him riding a horse was a great visual gag. All in all, despite the rough start, I really enjoyed this episode and can't wait to see where things go from here as he inevitably forms a party and answers the call to adventure.      James Beckett  Rating:                Skeleton Knight in Another World might just be a front-runner for two Preview Guide World Records, though they are dubious achievements indeed. First off, we have the elephant in the room, which is the “Shortest Ever Gap Between A Content Warning And The Content In Question” Award. The literal first shot of this series is of a surprisingly graphic sexual assault, and I don't know what is worse: That the scene is so lascivious and needlessly cruel right off the bat, or that we're forced to watch this twice in a show that is ostensibly a breezy isekai comedy. It isn't more than five seconds after the rapists are violently vivisected in front of their already traumatized victims that we transition to the show's cheesy OP, which I must remind you serves to introduce a main character whose sole defining character trait is that he's a goofy-looking cartoon skeleton. It is as catastrophic failure to read the room as I've seen in a long ass time, and there are a good many viewers who will understandably recoil in disgust and reject this anime outright before the opening credits finish.    The second award that Skeleton Knight in Another World is up for is a far less offensive one, though it also represents a problem that you can't simply fast-forward through. It's the “You Don't Even Really Need To Watch This Show, Because Literally Everything You Could Ever Possibly Need To Know About It Is Right There In The Title” Award! If you take the “…in Another World” half of this anime's title into consideration, then practically every single element of this premiere will fall into place, immediately, in your own head, before you even set eyes on it (except perhaps for the terrible and stupid rape scene, but you get my point).    The main character is somehow reborn into a real, flesh-and-blood universe that just so happens to perfectly mirror his favorite generic fantasy MMORPG. He is improbably strong and gifted in literally every aspect of the game, and he also spends a bunch of time breaking down his “in- game” stats sheet and skill set, as if that is somehow a substitute for having actual world-building and a plot. He then meanders around, talking to people and narrating to himself about this completely bizarre and insane scenario that we've all seen play out so many times before. He also might be a genuine sociopath, since he is completely unfazed by the horrible suffering and pain that he witnesses and inflicts upon others, and seems to live only to hoard loot from the mangled corpses he leaves behind. The ”Skeleton” part of the title tells you that the main character is a skeleton.    And look, I'm a fair critic, and I will give Skeleton Knight in Another World credit where it is due: It is somewhat amusing when when the skeleton guy makes goofy faces and gets unreasonably excited about loot. I chuckled once, near the end of the episode, because of the funny skeleton faces on the screen. For that alone, I will grant this premiere a bonus half-star to its rating. Everything else about it sucks, though, so it can wear its two Premiere Guide World Record badges like the marks of dishonor that they are.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               If any other show this season has a worse start than Skeleton Knight I'll be horribly surprised. It's not “just” that this premiere starts off, from the literal first second, with an attempted rape sequence. Nor is it “just” that said scene is gratuitous and directed with an eye for titillation for the audience, and is a cheap attempt at setting up paper thin bad guys from our hero to kill. It's that this would be a gross and crummy opening for a dark fantasy like Goblin Slayer, but it's a truly abysmal first impression for a premiere that is 90% goofy bullshit with our skeleton gamer protagonist Himbo-ing his way through a bog standard isekai setup.    Because that's what nearly this whole episode is actually about. Our hero, Arc, wakes up in a skeleton body and a suit of magic armor, realizes he's been isekai'd, and basically stumbles through a tutorial fetch quest with his overpowered skills, laughing all the way. And while the actual story is generic as hell, Arc himself makes a pretty good introduction. He's just excited to be in this new world, doesn't think to ask any questions about how it happened, and rolls through every new discovery with an almost infectious zest for fantasy life. It still slows down too much when he's shuffling through his various video game skills, and the world itself is devoid of anything interesting, but I could honestly picture myself following this literal bonehead for a few episodes, especially if the wacky slapstick from the OP animation is an honest promise.    But all that goodwill died once we circled back around to that rape scene. It's just such a lazy, shameless bit of shock-jock writing that stops the episode in its tracks. It exists solely to create some indisputably evil bandits for our hero to gallantly kill, letting him take lives without guilt (literally, the show admits this right after) and gaining him the affection of the victimized waif he saved. It's the same kind of hacky, exploitative garbage that showed up to ruin Sword Art Online every season like clockwork, and it's especially out of place in what is otherwise a goofy comedy. Plus, it's all made even worse when we see the attack from Arc's perspective and know he could have stepped in sooner, but was busy fretting over his chances in a PVP fight and waited until literally the last second. Then once it's over we're right back to silly funtimes with The Bone Boi as he celebrates his new life in this fantasy world, making the entire thing feel like a bad joke.    So congrats to the story for ensuring I'm not going to bother with any more of it. Ya took any charm or fun you managed to generate and threw it in the garbage. If other viewers have more tolerance for this kind of crap writing, maybe it's worth sticking it out and see if this is a one-time aberration. But for me, there's nothing interesting or special enough in the rest of this show to risk sitting through another scene like that.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Do you have a boilerplate isekai story to tell that borrows heavily from about four hundred other similar series? Do you need a way to spice it up and get eyes on your project? Well then, may I suggest not using rape to do that? Skeleton Knight in Another World's first episode opens with a graphic (or at least graphic enough) rape scene that comes back almost shot-for-shot at about the fourteen-minute mark. It does establish that our hero, who is helpfully not the rapist, is a good guy, because he saves Lady Lauren and her maid Rita, but there seems to be no reason to show us the exact same scene of sexual violence twice in the same episode. The opening salvo seems to be a cheap bid to make viewers pay attention, and while I do recall the same scene happening in the source material, that's not an excuse. If your story's not interesting enough to appeal to viewers without shocking them, maybe you should rethink your plot.    That out of the way, the rest of the episode is also a bit shocking – shockingly bland, that is. Arc, the eponymous skeleton knight, fell asleep playing his game and woke up as his character, only he forgot that he went with the skeleton build when he was creating him, so now he's afraid to take his armor off in public. If he wanted to be a bad guy like his bone-related cousin Ainz from Overlord, he'd be all set, but in this story, his character is a holy knight, so the whole skeleton thing is a bit of a problem. So is the fact that everyone sees his ridiculously nice and powerful armor and assumes that he's gainfully employed, because that armor's all he's got and he's hungry. Watching him try to integrate himself into a very run-of-the-mill town is the most amusing part of the episode, because he's both making things up on the fly and getting random backstory assigned to him by townsfolk.    He's also incredibly excited to be having his very own isekai experience, although he doesn't phrase it that way. Arc's disappointed that his new world seems more plain old Medieval than fantasy based on Medieval Europe, and any little bit of fantasy that he can find is thrilling to him, be that an elf, an orc, or the fact that he can use magic. (Why he doesn't use his fire magic to roast himself some food is never answered.) Of course, he teleports himself right off a cliff trying to figure out how to use it, but that actually sounds about right for how this would work.    If the sexual assault had been left out, this would be an okay-ish show. Not innovative, but bland in an inoffensive way.

Community score: 3.6              What is this?   Those that use ""voice medicine,"" the ability to heal injuries and cure illnesses with song, are called ""healers."" There are three apprentice healers working at the Karasuma Voice Treatment Center. Kana Fujii, an energetic girl who sets the tone, the strong-willed lady Reimi Itsushiro, and Hibiki Morishima who is caring but firm. These three first year high school girls are training after school to become full-fledged Healers. With the addition of Sonia Yanagi, a returnee who is a certified C-level healer, the girls are singing songs of healing as they work towards their dreams.    Healer Girl is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Mondays.      How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                While the first episode of Healer Girl is an enjoyable enough introduction to our typical cute girl trio—i.e., the well-intentioned screw-up, the calm one, and the overly serious one—what really captured my attention was the world they exist in. Healer Girl is a world in which singing is an accepted form of medical treatment with results on par with Western medicine. This is a fun idea—it's basically a form of magic being incorporated into everyday society. More interesting still is that natural talent is apparently a prerequisite for healing through singing—though even recordings of these healers will give at least some relief. As a person who loves hard magic systems (i.e., magic systems with concrete rules on how and why they work the way they do), it was a blast to learn about the girls' singing powers.    At the same time, however, the central conflict of the episode doesn't make sense. The show is structured around the conceit that magical singers are basically doctors. As such, they can't heal without a license. But why? The reason doctors need licenses is that, when dealing with invasive medical procedures or dangerous medications, an ignorant person could do far more harm than good.  But can a magical song hurt a patient? We see no sign of this as, according to the character dialogue, the only downside of poor singing is that it makes the treatment less effective.    I'm guessing that what Kana did in the climax counts as first aid rather than healing, but it made me wonder where exactly the line is. (It also made me wonder if a normal first aid kit in this world comes with a non-prescription MP3 player to help in emergencies.)    If it comes off like I dislike the show, let me assure you that I'm not. It's the opposite, actually.  I enjoyed the show so much that I am invested in the world it is trying to build—that is why these issues stand out. I want this world to feel as real as possible.    And as for the music, while I wouldn't call the songs bangers, they were decent enough. But what I absolutely loved more than the songs themselves was the extensive use of diegetic music. When the girls break into song in public, they are actually singing and the people around them act accordingly. And, due to their profession, their constant singing makes total sense. (As a onetime musical theater/choir kid, let me tell you, randomly singing at your friends is actually rather normal.) It adds yet another layer to the world-building and makes it feel even more, well, real. And while it has some plot holes that need filling, it's a world I am loving spending time in.        Caitlin Moore  Rating:               Oh wow, a musical anime! I hope it'll be just like my favorite anime, Lost Song!    Just kidding. Lost Song has never been and never will be anyone's favorite anime. Healer Girl, on the other hand, stands a pretty chance of becoming beloved by at least some and, if it keeps on track, maybe even many. This sweet little musical series, with its bright, colorful aesthetic and strong direction with dynamic camera work by industry veteran Yasuhiro Irie, has presented a strong premiere, even if it's not totally my thing.    While I wasn't particularly drawn in by the character writing – Karin is a pretty typical overenthusiastic but gifted newbie with her two best friends to corral her – the world fascinated me. Musical healing exists right alongside Eastern and Western medicine, and is presented as empirically effective. A kid has a scraped knee, Karin sings to him, his knee heals, all is well. Not a lot of room for skepticism there. I have so many questions, but in a good, “I'm curious about this worldbuilding” way rather than the way of “this makes no sense if you think about it for ten seconds.” Why would people choose the more invasive forms of medicine over musical healing? Clearly this form of medicine has its limits, since their instructor sent their client, an old woman with respiratory problems, to a hospital. What are they? Is there an in-universe reason for why all the healers are girls?    My biggest issue lies in the music. Plainly put, it's bland. It's like the most boring, forgettable Disney soundtrack ever conceived, and I'm not convinced that it can carry the show. Oh sure, the number where the girls start singing to each other about why they want to become healers is kind of fun, but it's unfocused and there doesn't seem to be much reason for it to be a song. It's more like an opera's libretto than anything you'd find in the standard structure of a musical.    Still, I doubt that'll be enough to put off most of the people who will be drawn in by this.        James Beckett  Rating:               I freaking love musicals. One of my longtime dreams has been to see a studio produce a big-budget, no- holds-barred Broadway-style musical. I'm not talking about an idol series or a show about a rock band, or an episode of a slice-of-life anime where the kids put on a concert for their culture festival. I'm talking about the pure, undiluted cheese that comes from regular characters interrupting the story to break out into perfectly choreographed dance numbers, belt their hearts out, and then move on as if nothing completely insane has just happened. Does anyone here remember Galavant? That show rules. I basically want an anime Galavant.    Healer Girl is not anime Galavant, sadly, but it's the closest we've gotten to the dream, gosh darn it, and it made me extremely happy anyways. Our main trio are all well-drawn, both literally and as likable character archetypes, and they all possess the nearly unbearable levels of sincerity it takes to make it as the leads of a musical, not to mention some incredibly toned diaphragms, and the whole “Being able to magically heal the wounds of the sick with nothing but the power of music” thing. The show looks good, it's cute and charming when it needs to be, and most importantly, it's got the tunes it needs to back up its premise.    Now, if I'm being honest, the style of singing we get in this premiere is just a bit treacly for my taste, and I was a little put off by some of the strange mixing choices—not only are the girls' voices auto-tuned to heck and back, but the universe provides a somewhat tinny and perfectly synched backing soundtrack whenever Kana and her friends open their mouths. In short, it both looks and sounds less like the characters are themselves singing, and more like they're all lip-syncing to some poorly mixed audio already in progress. And yes, I know that technically I'm just defining how voice-over works in animation, but I'm talking about the effect of the production. It often doesn't quite feel like the music and the characters are operating on the same aural plane of existence, if that makes any sense.    Still, I won't complain too much, because it was very fun to watch the girls get to know each other and show off their vocal skills, and some of the banter we get is the closest that I've ever seen an anime get to a Broadway styled patter song. Plus, we get to spend a half-hour in a world where, when a little kid's grandmother collapses on the floor, she really can be saved with the power of a good show tune. That's the kind of world I want to live in, if only in weekly chunks of about twenty-three minutes each. Healer Girl may not be quite the full-scale song-and-dance production that I've been waiting for, but it's a damned good time for anyone that needs an extra dose of musical healing this season.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               We get a lot of music-related anime – mostly idol shows – but it's exceedingly rare that we get a full-on West Side Story-style Capital-M Musical anime. While Healer Girl doesn't go all the way into that territory, it gets pretty darn close, and the result is a vibrant and earnest little treat. You're just going to need a stomach for unerringly saccharine sentimentality to get through it.    Make no mistake: if you're the kind of person who starts to grimace when characters snap their gaze into the middle distance and start singing their feelings, you will find nothing but pain here. Healer Girl is such a bubbly show in tone, aesthetic, and presentation, that it has no place for a concept so cynical as cringe. It's dancing forward down the street, humming a pop ballad too loudly with its airpods on full blast, and you can either trot along to its tune or hastily cross the street to avoid it.    Me, I love musicals, even if this show's audio sensibilities aren't really my jam. But that's more than made up for by the wonderful, colorful, constantly expressive animation that brings these characters and their songs to life. The way each of them moves, especially in their flowy “Healer” robes, is just a delight to take in. The characters themselves are likable enough, though not particularly deep or novel. But the way they're characterized through movement, how they physically interact with each other and the world around them, is just so charming that it overrides any writing deficiencies.    And because there's not a speck of cynicism in Healer Girl's body, that all manages to make Kana and her friends really fun to just watch, whether they're healing the sick or goofing around to avoid filling out paperwork. My favorite scene is easily the one where Kana asks her fellow apprentices why they chose to be Healers, and they all start spontaneously singing their motivations. It's campy, silly, and caps off with Hibiki getting so caught up in singing about her admiration for their teacher that nothing can stop her. It takes what could be a by-the-books bit of character exposition and turns it into something with way more personality, and if the rest of the show can add touches like that, I think this will turn out to be a wonderful little show.    There are most certainly people who will be put off by the chord this show is striking, and I totally get that. Healer Girl is prancing right on the line between earnest iyashikei and irritating pabulum, and no amount of stellar production is going to make you like something you find annoyingly pwecious. But at least for this first episode, I'm happy to sing along with this sugary sweet bubblegum bop.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               It's not exactly a secret that singing can sometimes help to calm you down or otherwise affect your mood, and I'm not just saying that because my mother took The King and I's advice about whistling a happy tune to forget you're afraid pretty literally. (Because who doesn't want terrible musical accompaniment on a harrowing boat trip?) Healer Girl may be taking the concept a bit too far, though, with its fancy third branch of medicine and an apprenticeship program to train girls into fully-fledged musical healers. Do male voices not work as well? Are there no accredited musical medical schools? Who knows? It's a musical, pesky things like serious questions aren't necessary here.    And this really is a fairly classic musical. While there's singing to heal a variety of ailments, we also have a couple of instances where people just burst into song to explain things like why they got into musical healing in the first place, and before we know what's going on in that opening scene, Kana walking down the street singing at full blast and the stunned facial expressions of the folks on the street certainly looks like something straight out of a self-aware musical. Even the basic plot of Kana's inability to wait until her training is complete before she heals people feels a bit like the stuff of Broadway, or at least the Disney Channel, especially since there aren't any real repercussions for her doing so twice this episode. It's just fortunate that she's as talented as she is enthusiastic, because otherwise the whole thing with Yui's grandmother could have gone downhill fast.    How much you will like this is absolutely going to hinge on your ability to suspend your disbelief. Not that it's any less ridiculous than any number of other plot premises we've seen over the years; it's more the way that it's executed. I do very much appreciate that we don't get a lot of long-winded explanations about what the whole musical healing thing is, and that Karasuma and Shoko (the masters to the girls' apprentices) go to what is clearly an academic conference is an important bit of world-building because it establishes musical medicine as a real and serious profession in the story's world rather than a fringe belief. But at the end of the day it's still a story about a very perky, nearly TSTL high school girl singing at people to make their boo-boos go away. And it is worth mentioning that all but one of the cases that we see in this episode appear to be scrapes and scratches, even those treated by Karasuma. Possibly this is to save up the drama for Grandma's collapse in the end of the episode, which isn't a terrible plan, but it does feel a little odd, since normally a scrape is more a trip to the pharmacy than the doctor.    I'm not sure I'm interested in watching more of this. Kana's naivete is a bit much, watching Reimi pant after her teacher isn't as funny as it wants to be, and the episode didn't really sell me on the lure of musical healing. But I'm also not really a music or a musical person, so if those things are more appealing to you, I think this could turn out to be pretty fun.     discuss this in the forum (291 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Our main trio are all well-drawn, both literally and as likable character archetypes, and they all possess the nearly unbearable levels of sincerity it takes to make it as the leads of a musical, not to mention some incredibly toned diaphragms, and the whole “Being able to magically heal the wounds of the sick with nothing but the power of music” thing. The show looks good, it's cute and charming when it needs to be, and most importantly, it's got the tunes it needs to back up its premise.    Now, if I'm being honest, the style of singing we get in this premiere is just a bit treacly for my taste, and I was a little put off by some of the strange mixing choices—not only are the girls' voices auto-tuned to heck and back, but the universe provides a somewhat tinny and perfectly synched backing soundtrack whenever Kana and her friends open their mouths. In short, it both looks and sounds less like the characters are themselves singing, and more like they're all lip-syncing to some poorly mixed audio already in progress. And yes, I know that technically I'm just defining how voice-over works in animation, but I'm talking about the effect of the production. It often doesn't quite feel like the music and the characters are operating on the same aural plane of existence, if that makes any sense.    Still, I won't complain too much, because it was very fun to watch the girls get to know each other and show off their vocal skills, and some of the banter we get is the closest that I've ever seen an anime get to a Broadway styled patter song. Plus, we get to spend a half-hour in a world where, when a little kid's grandmother collapses on the floor, she really can be saved with the power of a good show tune. That's the kind of world I want to live in, if only in weekly chunks of about twenty-three minutes each. Healer Girl may not be quite the full-scale song-and-dance production that I've been waiting for, but it's a damned good time for anyone that needs an extra dose of musical healing this season.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               We get a lot of music-related anime – mostly idol shows – but it's exceedingly rare that we get a full-on West Side Story-style Capital-M Musical anime. While Healer Girl doesn't go all the way into that territory, it gets pretty darn close, and the result is a vibrant and earnest little treat. You're just going to need a stomach for unerringly saccharine sentimentality to get through it.    Make no mistake: if you're the kind of person who starts to grimace when characters snap their gaze into the middle distance and start singing their feelings, you will find nothing but pain here. Healer Girl is such a bubbly show in tone, aesthetic, and presentation, that it has no place for a concept so cynical as cringe. It's dancing forward down the street, humming a pop ballad too loudly with its airpods on full blast, and you can either trot along to its tune or hastily cross the street to avoid it.    Me, I love musicals, even if this show's audio sensibilities aren't really my jam. But that's more than made up for by the wonderful, colorful, constantly expressive animation that brings these characters and their songs to life. The way each of them moves, especially in their flowy “Healer” robes, is just a delight to take in. The characters themselves are likable enough, though not particularly deep or novel. But the way they're characterized through movement, how they physically interact with each other and the world around them, is just so charming that it overrides any writing deficiencies.    And because there's not a speck of cynicism in Healer Girl's body, that all manages to make Kana and her friends really fun to just watch, whether they're healing the sick or goofing around to avoid filling out paperwork. My favorite scene is easily the one where Kana asks her fellow apprentices why they chose to be Healers, and they all start spontaneously singing their motivations. It's campy, silly, and caps off with Hibiki getting so caught up in singing about her admiration for their teacher that nothing can stop her. It takes what could be a by-the-books bit of character exposition and turns it into something with way more personality, and if the rest of the show can add touches like that, I think this will turn out to be a wonderful little show.    There are most certainly people who will be put off by the chord this show is striking, and I totally get that. Healer Girl is prancing right on the line between earnest iyashikei and irritating pabulum, and no amount of stellar production is going to make you like something you find annoyingly pwecious. But at least for this first episode, I'm happy to sing along with this sugary sweet bubblegum bop.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               It's not exactly a secret that singing can sometimes help to calm you down or otherwise affect your mood, and I'm not just saying that because my mother took The King and I's advice about whistling a happy tune to forget you're afraid pretty literally. (Because who doesn't want terrible musical accompaniment on a harrowing boat trip?) Healer Girl may be taking the concept a bit too far, though, with its fancy third branch of medicine and an apprenticeship program to train girls into fully-fledged musical healers. Do male voices not work as well? Are there no accredited musical medical schools? Who knows? It's a musical, pesky things like serious questions aren't necessary here.    And this really is a fairly classic musical. While there's singing to heal a variety of ailments, we also have a couple of instances where people just burst into song to explain things like why they got into musical healing in the first place, and before we know what's going on in that opening scene, Kana walking down the street singing at full blast and the stunned facial expressions of the folks on the street certainly looks like something straight out of a self-aware musical. Even the basic plot of Kana's inability to wait until her training is complete before she heals people feels a bit like the stuff of Broadway, or at least the Disney Channel, especially since there aren't any real repercussions for her doing so twice this episode. It's just fortunate that she's as talented as she is enthusiastic, because otherwise the whole thing with Yui's grandmother could have gone downhill fast.    How much you will like this is absolutely going to hinge on your ability to suspend your disbelief. Not that it's any less ridiculous than any number of other plot premises we've seen over the years; it's more the way that it's executed. I do very much appreciate that we don't get a lot of long-winded explanations about what the whole musical healing thing is, and that Karasuma and Shoko (the masters to the girls' apprentices) go to what is clearly an academic conference is an important bit of world-building because it establishes musical medicine as a real and serious profession in the story's world rather than a fringe belief. But at the end of the day it's still a story about a very perky, nearly TSTL high school girl singing at people to make their boo-boos go away. And it is worth mentioning that all but one of the cases that we see in this episode appear to be scrapes and scratches, even those treated by Karasuma. Possibly this is to save up the drama for Grandma's collapse in the end of the episode, which isn't a terrible plan, but it does feel a little odd, since normally a scrape is more a trip to the pharmacy than the doctor.    I'm not sure I'm interested in watching more of this. Kana's naivete is a bit much, watching Reimi pant after her teacher isn't as funny as it wants to be, and the episode didn't really sell me on the lure of musical healing. But I'm also not really a music or a musical person, so if those things are more appealing to you, I think this could turn out to be pretty fun.     discuss this in the forum (291 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives     ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 3.6              What is this?   Those that use ""voice medicine,"" the ability to heal injuries and cure illnesses with song, are called ""healers."" There are three apprentice healers working at the Karasuma Voice Treatment Center. Kana Fujii, an energetic girl who sets the tone, the strong-willed lady Reimi Itsushiro, and Hibiki Morishima who is caring but firm. These three first year high school girls are training after school to become full-fledged Healers. With the addition of Sonia Yanagi, a returnee who is a certified C-level healer, the girls are singing songs of healing as they work towards their dreams.    Healer Girl is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Mondays.      How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                While the first episode of Healer Girl is an enjoyable enough introduction to our typical cute girl trio—i.e., the well-intentioned screw-up, the calm one, and the overly serious one—what really captured my attention was the world they exist in. Healer Girl is a world in which singing is an accepted form of medical treatment with results on par with Western medicine. This is a fun idea—it's basically a form of magic being incorporated into everyday society. More interesting still is that natural talent is apparently a prerequisite for healing through singing—though even recordings of these healers will give at least some relief. As a person who loves hard magic systems (i.e., magic systems with concrete rules on how and why they work the way they do), it was a blast to learn about the girls' singing powers.    At the same time, however, the central conflict of the episode doesn't make sense. The show is structured around the conceit that magical singers are basically doctors. As such, they can't heal without a license. But why? The reason doctors need licenses is that, when dealing with invasive medical procedures or dangerous medications, an ignorant person could do far more harm than good.  But can a magical song hurt a patient? We see no sign of this as, according to the character dialogue, the only downside of poor singing is that it makes the treatment less effective.    I'm guessing that what Kana did in the climax counts as first aid rather than healing, but it made me wonder where exactly the line is. (It also made me wonder if a normal first aid kit in this world comes with a non-prescription MP3 player to help in emergencies.)    If it comes off like I dislike the show, let me assure you that I'm not. It's the opposite, actually.  I enjoyed the show so much that I am invested in the world it is trying to build—that is why these issues stand out. I want this world to feel as real as possible.    And as for the music, while I wouldn't call the songs bangers, they were decent enough. But what I absolutely loved more than the songs themselves was the extensive use of diegetic music. When the girls break into song in public, they are actually singing and the people around them act accordingly. And, due to their profession, their constant singing makes total sense. (As a onetime musical theater/choir kid, let me tell you, randomly singing at your friends is actually rather normal.) It adds yet another layer to the world-building and makes it feel even more, well, real. And while it has some plot holes that need filling, it's a world I am loving spending time in.        Caitlin Moore  Rating:               Oh wow, a musical anime! I hope it'll be just like my favorite anime, Lost Song!    Just kidding. Lost Song has never been and never will be anyone's favorite anime. Healer Girl, on the other hand, stands a pretty chance of becoming beloved by at least some and, if it keeps on track, maybe even many. This sweet little musical series, with its bright, colorful aesthetic and strong direction with dynamic camera work by industry veteran Yasuhiro Irie, has presented a strong premiere, even if it's not totally my thing.    While I wasn't particularly drawn in by the character writing – Karin is a pretty typical overenthusiastic but gifted newbie with her two best friends to corral her – the world fascinated me. Musical healing exists right alongside Eastern and Western medicine, and is presented as empirically effective. A kid has a scraped knee, Karin sings to him, his knee heals, all is well. Not a lot of room for skepticism there. I have so many questions, but in a good, “I'm curious about this worldbuilding” way rather than the way of “this makes no sense if you think about it for ten seconds.” Why would people choose the more invasive forms of medicine over musical healing? Clearly this form of medicine has its limits, since their instructor sent their client, an old woman with respiratory problems, to a hospital. What are they? Is there an in-universe reason for why all the healers are girls?    My biggest issue lies in the music. Plainly put, it's bland. It's like the most boring, forgettable Disney soundtrack ever conceived, and I'm not convinced that it can carry the show. Oh sure, the number where the girls start singing to each other about why they want to become healers is kind of fun, but it's unfocused and there doesn't seem to be much reason for it to be a song. It's more like an opera's libretto than anything you'd find in the standard structure of a musical.    Still, I doubt that'll be enough to put off most of the people who will be drawn in by this.        James Beckett  Rating:               I freaking love musicals. One of my longtime dreams has been to see a studio produce a big-budget, no- holds-barred Broadway-style musical. I'm not talking about an idol series or a show about a rock band, or an episode of a slice-of-life anime where the kids put on a concert for their culture festival. I'm talking about the pure, undiluted cheese that comes from regular characters interrupting the story to break out into perfectly choreographed dance numbers, belt their hearts out, and then move on as if nothing completely insane has just happened. Does anyone here remember Galavant? That show rules. I basically want an anime Galavant.

It's dancing forward down the street, humming a pop ballad too loudly with its airpods on full blast, and you can either trot along to its tune or hastily cross the street to avoid it.    Me, I love musicals, even if this show's audio sensibilities aren't really my jam. But that's more than made up for by the wonderful, colorful, constantly expressive animation that brings these characters and their songs to life. The way each of them moves, especially in their flowy “Healer” robes, is just a delight to take in. The characters themselves are likable enough, though not particularly deep or novel. But the way they're characterized through movement, how they physically interact with each other and the world around them, is just so charming that it overrides any writing deficiencies.    And because there's not a speck of cynicism in Healer Girl's body, that all manages to make Kana and her friends really fun to just watch, whether they're healing the sick or goofing around to avoid filling out paperwork. My favorite scene is easily the one where Kana asks her fellow apprentices why they chose to be Healers, and they all start spontaneously singing their motivations. It's campy, silly, and caps off with Hibiki getting so caught up in singing about her admiration for their teacher that nothing can stop her. It takes what could be a by-the-books bit of character exposition and turns it into something with way more personality, and if the rest of the show can add touches like that, I think this will turn out to be a wonderful little show.    There are most certainly people who will be put off by the chord this show is striking, and I totally get that. Healer Girl is prancing right on the line between earnest iyashikei and irritating pabulum, and no amount of stellar production is going to make you like something you find annoyingly pwecious. But at least for this first episode, I'm happy to sing along with this sugary sweet bubblegum bop.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               It's not exactly a secret that singing can sometimes help to calm you down or otherwise affect your mood, and I'm not just saying that because my mother took The King and I's advice about whistling a happy tune to forget you're afraid pretty literally. (Because who doesn't want terrible musical accompaniment on a harrowing boat trip?) Healer Girl may be taking the concept a bit too far, though, with its fancy third branch of medicine and an apprenticeship program to train girls into fully-fledged musical healers. Do male voices not work as well? Are there no accredited musical medical schools? Who knows? It's a musical, pesky things like serious questions aren't necessary here.    And this really is a fairly classic musical. While there's singing to heal a variety of ailments, we also have a couple of instances where people just burst into song to explain things like why they got into musical healing in the first place, and before we know what's going on in that opening scene, Kana walking down the street singing at full blast and the stunned facial expressions of the folks on the street certainly looks like something straight out of a self-aware musical. Even the basic plot of Kana's inability to wait until her training is complete before she heals people feels a bit like the stuff of Broadway, or at least the Disney Channel, especially since there aren't any real repercussions for her doing so twice this episode. It's just fortunate that she's as talented as she is enthusiastic, because otherwise the whole thing with Yui's grandmother could have gone downhill fast.    How much you will like this is absolutely going to hinge on your ability to suspend your disbelief. Not that it's any less ridiculous than any number of other plot premises we've seen over the years; it's more the way that it's executed. I do very much appreciate that we don't get a lot of long-winded explanations about what the whole musical healing thing is, and that Karasuma and Shoko (the masters to the girls' apprentices) go to what is clearly an academic conference is an important bit of world-building because it establishes musical medicine as a real and serious profession in the story's world rather than a fringe belief. But at the end of the day it's still a story about a very perky, nearly TSTL high school girl singing at people to make their boo-boos go away. And it is worth mentioning that all but one of the cases that we see in this episode appear to be scrapes and scratches, even those treated by Karasuma. Possibly this is to save up the drama for Grandma's collapse in the end of the episode, which isn't a terrible plan, but it does feel a little odd, since normally a scrape is more a trip to the pharmacy than the doctor.    I'm not sure I'm interested in watching more of this. Kana's naivete is a bit much, watching Reimi pant after her teacher isn't as funny as it wants to be, and the episode didn't really sell me on the lure of musical healing. But I'm also not really a music or a musical person, so if those things are more appealing to you, I think this could turn out to be pretty fun.     discuss this in the forum (291 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives   ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 3.6              What is this?   Those that use ""voice medicine,"" the ability to heal injuries and cure illnesses with song, are called ""healers."" There are three apprentice healers working at the Karasuma Voice Treatment Center. Kana Fujii, an energetic girl who sets the tone, the strong-willed lady Reimi Itsushiro, and Hibiki Morishima who is caring but firm. These three first year high school girls are training after school to become full-fledged Healers. With the addition of Sonia Yanagi, a returnee who is a certified C-level healer, the girls are singing songs of healing as they work towards their dreams.    Healer Girl is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Mondays.      How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                While the first episode of Healer Girl is an enjoyable enough introduction to our typical cute girl trio—i.e., the well-intentioned screw-up, the calm one, and the overly serious one—what really captured my attention was the world they exist in. Healer Girl is a world in which singing is an accepted form of medical treatment with results on par with Western medicine. This is a fun idea—it's basically a form of magic being incorporated into everyday society. More interesting still is that natural talent is apparently a prerequisite for healing through singing—though even recordings of these healers will give at least some relief. As a person who loves hard magic systems (i.e., magic systems with concrete rules on how and why they work the way they do), it was a blast to learn about the girls' singing powers.    At the same time, however, the central conflict of the episode doesn't make sense. The show is structured around the conceit that magical singers are basically doctors. As such, they can't heal without a license. But why? The reason doctors need licenses is that, when dealing with invasive medical procedures or dangerous medications, an ignorant person could do far more harm than good.  But can a magical song hurt a patient? We see no sign of this as, according to the character dialogue, the only downside of poor singing is that it makes the treatment less effective.    I'm guessing that what Kana did in the climax counts as first aid rather than healing, but it made me wonder where exactly the line is. (It also made me wonder if a normal first aid kit in this world comes with a non-prescription MP3 player to help in emergencies.)    If it comes off like I dislike the show, let me assure you that I'm not. It's the opposite, actually.  I enjoyed the show so much that I am invested in the world it is trying to build—that is why these issues stand out. I want this world to feel as real as possible.    And as for the music, while I wouldn't call the songs bangers, they were decent enough. But what I absolutely loved more than the songs themselves was the extensive use of diegetic music. When the girls break into song in public, they are actually singing and the people around them act accordingly. And, due to their profession, their constant singing makes total sense. (As a onetime musical theater/choir kid, let me tell you, randomly singing at your friends is actually rather normal.) It adds yet another layer to the world-building and makes it feel even more, well, real. And while it has some plot holes that need filling, it's a world I am loving spending time in.        Caitlin Moore  Rating:               Oh wow, a musical anime! I hope it'll be just like my favorite anime, Lost Song!    Just kidding. Lost Song has never been and never will be anyone's favorite anime. Healer Girl, on the other hand, stands a pretty chance of becoming beloved by at least some and, if it keeps on track, maybe even many. This sweet little musical series, with its bright, colorful aesthetic and strong direction with dynamic camera work by industry veteran Yasuhiro Irie, has presented a strong premiere, even if it's not totally my thing.    While I wasn't particularly drawn in by the character writing – Karin is a pretty typical overenthusiastic but gifted newbie with her two best friends to corral her – the world fascinated me. Musical healing exists right alongside Eastern and Western medicine, and is presented as empirically effective. A kid has a scraped knee, Karin sings to him, his knee heals, all is well. Not a lot of room for skepticism there. I have so many questions, but in a good, “I'm curious about this worldbuilding” way rather than the way of “this makes no sense if you think about it for ten seconds.” Why would people choose the more invasive forms of medicine over musical healing? Clearly this form of medicine has its limits, since their instructor sent their client, an old woman with respiratory problems, to a hospital. What are they? Is there an in-universe reason for why all the healers are girls?    My biggest issue lies in the music. Plainly put, it's bland. It's like the most boring, forgettable Disney soundtrack ever conceived, and I'm not convinced that it can carry the show. Oh sure, the number where the girls start singing to each other about why they want to become healers is kind of fun, but it's unfocused and there doesn't seem to be much reason for it to be a song. It's more like an opera's libretto than anything you'd find in the standard structure of a musical.    Still, I doubt that'll be enough to put off most of the people who will be drawn in by this.        James Beckett  Rating:               I freaking love musicals. One of my longtime dreams has been to see a studio produce a big-budget, no- holds-barred Broadway-style musical. I'm not talking about an idol series or a show about a rock band, or an episode of a slice-of-life anime where the kids put on a concert for their culture festival. I'm talking about the pure, undiluted cheese that comes from regular characters interrupting the story to break out into perfectly choreographed dance numbers, belt their hearts out, and then move on as if nothing completely insane has just happened. Does anyone here remember Galavant? That show rules. I basically want an anime Galavant.    Healer Girl is not anime Galavant, sadly, but it's the closest we've gotten to the dream, gosh darn it, and it made me extremely happy anyways. Our main trio are all well-drawn, both literally and as likable character archetypes, and they all possess the nearly unbearable levels of sincerity it takes to make it as the leads of a musical, not to mention some incredibly toned diaphragms, and the whole “Being able to magically heal the wounds of the sick with nothing but the power of music” thing. The show looks good, it's cute and charming when it needs to be, and most importantly, it's got the tunes it needs to back up its premise.    Now, if I'm being honest, the style of singing we get in this premiere is just a bit treacly for my taste, and I was a little put off by some of the strange mixing choices—not only are the girls' voices auto-tuned to heck and back, but the universe provides a somewhat tinny and perfectly synched backing soundtrack whenever Kana and her friends open their mouths. In short, it both looks and sounds less like the characters are themselves singing, and more like they're all lip-syncing to some poorly mixed audio already in progress. And yes, I know that technically I'm just defining how voice-over works in animation, but I'm talking about the effect of the production. It often doesn't quite feel like the music and the characters are operating on the same aural plane of existence, if that makes any sense.    Still, I won't complain too much, because it was very fun to watch the girls get to know each other and show off their vocal skills, and some of the banter we get is the closest that I've ever seen an anime get to a Broadway styled patter song. Plus, we get to spend a half-hour in a world where, when a little kid's grandmother collapses on the floor, she really can be saved with the power of a good show tune. That's the kind of world I want to live in, if only in weekly chunks of about twenty-three minutes each. Healer Girl may not be quite the full-scale song-and-dance production that I've been waiting for, but it's a damned good time for anyone that needs an extra dose of musical healing this season.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               We get a lot of music-related anime – mostly idol shows – but it's exceedingly rare that we get a full-on West Side Story-style Capital-M Musical anime. While Healer Girl doesn't go all the way into that territory, it gets pretty darn close, and the result is a vibrant and earnest little treat. You're just going to need a stomach for unerringly saccharine sentimentality to get through it.    Make no mistake: if you're the kind of person who starts to grimace when characters snap their gaze into the middle distance and start singing their feelings, you will find nothing but pain here.

Even the basic plot of Kana's inability to wait until her training is complete before she heals people feels a bit like the stuff of Broadway, or at least the Disney Channel, especially since there aren't any real repercussions for her doing so twice this episode. It's just fortunate that she's as talented as she is enthusiastic, because otherwise the whole thing with Yui's grandmother could have gone downhill fast.    How much you will like this is absolutely going to hinge on your ability to suspend your disbelief. Not that it's any less ridiculous than any number of other plot premises we've seen over the years; it's more the way that it's executed. I do very much appreciate that we don't get a lot of long-winded explanations about what the whole musical healing thing is, and that Karasuma and Shoko (the masters to the girls' apprentices) go to what is clearly an academic conference is an important bit of world-building because it establishes musical medicine as a real and serious profession in the story's world rather than a fringe belief. But at the end of the day it's still a story about a very perky, nearly TSTL high school girl singing at people to make their boo-boos go away. And it is worth mentioning that all but one of the cases that we see in this episode appear to be scrapes and scratches, even those treated by Karasuma. Possibly this is to save up the drama for Grandma's collapse in the end of the episode, which isn't a terrible plan, but it does feel a little odd, since normally a scrape is more a trip to the pharmacy than the doctor.    I'm not sure I'm interested in watching more of this. Kana's naivete is a bit much, watching Reimi pant after her teacher isn't as funny as it wants to be, and the episode didn't really sell me on the lure of musical healing. But I'm also not really a music or a musical person, so if those things are more appealing to you, I think this could turn out to be pretty fun.

Community score: 3.6              What is this?   Office worker Leon is reincarnated into a particularly punishing dating sim video game, where women reign supreme and only beautiful men have a seat at the table. But Leon has a secret weapon: he remembers everything from his past life, which includes a complete playthrough of the very game in which he is now trapped. Watch Leon spark a revolution to change this new world in order to fulfill his ultimate desire of living a quiet, easy life in the countryside.    Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs is based on Yomu Mishima's light novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Sundays.      How was the first episode?   Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               This seems to be the season for me to be making statements like this, but I liked this story (tale type?) more when it was Past Life Countess, Present Life Otome Game NPC?!. Both series have a similar premise: someone is reincarnated in the world of an otome game as a random background character and have to do their best to get the kind of life they want. In the case of this show (based on the light novels of the same name), Leon seems to mostly want to overcome the disadvantages of his upbringing, which are apparently being both the son of his father's mistress and being born male. The latter does raise an eyebrow from me, because I can't think of any otome games that I've played that have that sort of world set up; naturally this doesn't mean that they don't exist, but it's the kind of detail that makes me wonder if the writer(s) have a whole lot of familiarity with otome games in the first place.    The show feels most concerned with the apparently bizarre nature of the game world he's been reincarnated into, which has elements of both fantasy and science fiction, but that's another mild red flag, because those two genres absolutely coexist in the otome games Steam Prison and Code:Realize.    Even if that wasn't the case, however, there's negligible time spent discovering what exactly Leon is after in going to the fancy academy from the game. Perhaps he does want to marry well, but the loot that he brings back from his foray to steal the game's goodies before the plot of the game begins would seem to negate that need, and he also doesn't seem interested in making a play for the heroine. In fact, he actively dislikes the characters from the game, as we see in his playthrough before he falls down the stairs and dies, which may be the single most original moment here because he's not being creamed by everyone's favorite motor vehicle. Watching Leon play the game is probably the most entertaining piece of the entire episode as he gets increasingly frustrated with its mechanics and characters, but even that is marred by the fact that he's doing it for his sister so that she doesn't have to. Does YouTube not exist in their world? Because last I checked, that was a good way to get to watch the cutscenes from video games without having to play them yourself.    The plot doesn't have a terrible concept, and goodness knows that isekai (otome game or otherwise) is ripe for parody and deconstruction at this stage. But as with The Executioner and Her Way of Life, I don't find this the most compelling telling of this particular story. Plus I'm very concerned that the story's “women have all the power” set up is going to be used as a way for the hero to frame himself as a perpetual victim, and I'm not a fan of that for any gender. This just is kind of a muddle, and that's a shame.        James Beckett  Rating:               I've come to learn that, of all the variations of the modern isekai anime that have cropped up over the years, I tend to prefer the ones where characters get trapped in dating sims and the like. The generic MMORPG worlds that so many of the other isekai trade in bore me to tears, and the stories tend to lack focus and direction on account of the open-ended natures of the video games that the stories are riffing on. When a gal or guy gets reincarnated into a dating sim, though, we have a set cast of characters and plot with more momentum right off the bat, and the characters' knowledge of the game has to be a little more specific than simply having memorized a thousand menus and sub-systems. Granted, the point of cribbing from the tropes of popular dating sims still lies in the fact that the isekai stories are treading familiar ground, but if we must operate entirely within the bumper-lanes of old clichés, I'll settle for the somewhat more entertaining clichés.    For those reasons, I ended up having an okay time with Trapped in a Dating Sim, even if it never left me feeling particularly excited or intrigued. A lot of my reservations come from the episode being such an exposition dump; we don't even meet the other central characters of the dating game that Leon has found himself stuck in until the very final shots of the premiere. Until then, it's the Leon the Loner show from top to bottom. He's not an awful protagonist, but he's nothing new to the genre, either. He's prickly and socially awkward, but he also can't be too much of an asshole, since we still have to be impressed with how much he breaks the game using his Earthbound knowledge of its systems and plot. This means that the story of this premiere is essentially a linear chronicle of how Leon inserts himself into the main plot of the game, with most scenes consisting of Leon monologuing in explicit detail what he knows about the game, how he's going to manipulate it, etc. This is the kind of stuff I almost never find interesting, because it assumes that the joy of the isekai premise comes from having the protagonist narrate the condensed Wiki-entry version of a video game, and not, you know, letting us just watch the story happen in peace.    Still, the setting itself has some cool stuff going for it, namely in how it mixes the elements of its typical fantasy setting with mechs and other sci-fi trappings—always a nice touch. It could also very well be that the story picks up speed once Leon arrives at the academy where the game truly takes place and starts to mingle with all of the characters; it's hard to judge how strong a dating-game style story is going to be when you don't even know most of the ensemble yet. I might stick with Trapped in a Dating Sim for another episode or two, just to see if it ends up winning me over. I doubt it will be as fun as My Next Life as a Villainess, but who knows? Stranger things have happened!        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               We haven't really seen it reflected in anime yet, but in LN and manga scenes, the isekai subgenre is absolutely rife with Otome Game Villainess stories. You can throw a rock in any direction and are just as liable to hit a book about being reincarnated as the mean girl character in a video game as anything else. So it makes sense with that particular gimmick's proliferation that you'd start seeing stories intentionally twisting it for novelty. Thus we have this show, which attempts to pull the perspective away from the stereotypical nobles and upper class, and instead focus on what it's like to be an anonymous background character in one of these stories. Or, well, it sort of tries that, then gets bored immediately with that premise and more or less turns into a typical male-led isekai in the span of half an episode. Whoops.    The biggest weakness for this show is it just doesn't feel like its creators knew all that much about otome games. Stories like My Next Life as a Villainess or I'm in Love with the Villainess use their familiarity with the subgenre to gently (and sometimes harshly) mock the established conventions of them, but you get the impression those are jokes borne from somebody who deeply enjoys that type of media and spends a lot of time thinking about them. This show, on the other hand, doesn't seem to know much about the genre besides there being a female PC and a lot of hot dudes for her to sweet talk. Everything else is crammed in from other facets of gaming – RTS battles, power armor, sci-fi style airships, micro-transactions, all stuff that shows up in other games that has to be ham-fistedly crammed in here because that's what the creators are more familiar with.    I say all this not to call the creators phonies, but because that muddling of its own premise kind of kills the joke. This isn't a parody of otome games or a critical look at the genre from a new point of view, so none of its observations or gags have any teeth. Wow show, you're right, there sure are a lot of haughty pretty boys in games made for women. You really got them there. And yeah, some games aren't balanced very well so you're forced to spend real money on them. Can't remember ever playing an otome game where that was the case but uh, good dunk on...mobile games? What are we parodying here, again?    This even comes down to our protagonist, who spends three full days 100%ing the central game – not because he is a guy who likes otome games, but because his pushy little sister blackmailed him into playing it for her. Because she wants to see the ending CGs but doesn't actually want to play the game to get it, and apparently can't use Google to just look them up? It's a clunky, contrived way to allow a guy who hates otome games to still have all the knowledge necessary to cheat the system and get ahead in life, making him fundamentally identical to a regular isekai hero. So we've taken three lefts to make a right and arrive at a plain wayne isekai story, only now our male lead will have to build a harem of doting anime girls by showing up those handsome gigachads who make up the typical love interests.    Then there's the frankly flaccid attempts at role reversal with the game world's gender politics. See, in this game, it's women who hold all the power! So now MEN are the ones forced into loveless political marriages where they serve older, richer WOMEN who all have disposable male paramours. See, it's clever, because they did CTRL+F for the word “patriarchy” and then replaced the P with an M. My first impression upon seeing that part of the premise was that this would be a cringe-inducing setup for a victim complex to further fuel the main character's resentful snark, but I've read enough of the manga adaptation to know that's largely not the case. But that doesn't stop it from feeling like a lazy way to build a paper-thin world, which isn't a whole lot better.    Combined with stiff, sub-par animation and pacing that leaps from moment to moment with a bald-faced desperation, this one winds up a total mess. It's at once overstuffed and totally lacking in ideas, and has the gall to have its own protagonist complain about how much its world and story suck like it's somebody else's fault. It's just a flop all around.        Caitlin Moore  Rating:               There's a particular type of guy out there who is seethingly angry at the idea of things that exist to play into women's fantasies. He doesn't take issue with media aimed at delivering male fantasies, oh no, but the very concept of media where the central aim is allowing women to indulge in the fantasy of being desirable to a range of hot men? Oh no, that cannot stand! Such things are truly detestable, and any girl who likes them is a shallow bitch.    I can't say that's for sure the case with whoever wrote Trapped in a Dating Sim, but it sure does come across that way. The protagonist, now known as Leon, beefed it on the staircase after his little sister blackmailed him into playing an otome game for three days straight while she went on Hawaii because… she wanted to hear the end conversation? Why not just go look it up? Why would she even care about it decontextualized from the rest of the game? (Or maybe that's just me.) What is this terrible secret she's holding over his head? Our little pre-Leon seems baffled that the game would have JRPG/science fiction/strategy elements, but considering my favorite genre of game is “visual novel with gameplay elements,” it doesn't seem remotely shocking. And why would it make him actively angry?    Then there's the issue of the matriarchal society. Why would that even be a thing in a dating sim? It's such a bizarre detail that has existed in absolutely none of the games I've played. That's the part that made me really get the feeling that whoever created this nonsense has never actually played an otome game, but is super angry that they exist. Pre-Leon grouses that the girls in the game are way too powerful, which shows up in the game world as women subjecting men to the exact same social oppression that women in the real world have been suffering under for centuries. Now, if it seemed like it had any actual intention of examining how things like economics arranged marriages between girls and much older men, that would be one thing, but it just leaves it as one of the reasons being in this world sucks for average men.    I hate being able to see the seams of constructed worlds, where you can see the structures designed specifically for the main character to chafe at and systems designed specifically to screw them over individually. And honestly, most of the episode's plot, with him going off on a little sidequest to get his DLC super-powerful fighter plane and enough money to sidestep his arranged marriage, felt like little more than a digression. The next one, where he starts attending the academy, will probably feel entirely different.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               As someone who loves games—including JRPGs and dating sims—I greatly enjoyed this first episode. Over the years we've had numerous anime about being reincarnated in good games. The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is the opposite: what it would be like to be trapped in a terrible one.    Let's break down the game we see in this anime. To start with, it suffers from the shotgun approach to game design. Alto Liebe may be a dating sim first and foremost, but it also features both turn-based dungeon crawling and strategy RPG mecha battles. Worse yet, the difficulty for these parts of the game is ridiculously unbalanced. The game is literally designed around its cash shop—forcing players to dump even more real-world money into the game if they want to be able to beat it.    The actual story for the game makes things even worse. When the game was just a game, things didn't really need to make sense. You could have fantasy magic, sci-fi mecha, and a feudal society together in the same story. You could even have an ending where the player character ends up with a harmonious harem made up of the kingdom's finest young men. The problem is that when this becomes a fully-realized world, everything becomes taken to their logical extremes.    This is the world our “hero” (and I use that term loosely) Leon finds himself in. The pay-to-win aspect of the game means that not only are the enemies in the world so strong that he almost dies on his first adventure (despite exploiting the enemies' weaknesses) but also that society is obsessed with money. But far worse is that, to contrive a happy reverse harem ending, the world suffers from a ludicrous level of ingrained misandry—with human men relegated to the status of third-class citizens. Leon himself is set to be married off to a 50-year-old black widow who will send him to the front lines to die for a quick insurance payout.    The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is a joke—and that's the point. It's cliché and underwritten to the extreme. It's a hell to live in. Because of this, we can get behind Leon and his rather assholish nature. His drive to be as far away from the main plot as possible is understandable—at least in the background he might find something resembling normalcy. Of course, it almost certainly won't be that simple and I look forward to watching Leon bust through numerous dating sim and RPG game tropes as the weeks go on.     discuss this in the forum (291 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Now, if it seemed like it had any actual intention of examining how things like economics arranged marriages between girls and much older men, that would be one thing, but it just leaves it as one of the reasons being in this world sucks for average men.    I hate being able to see the seams of constructed worlds, where you can see the structures designed specifically for the main character to chafe at and systems designed specifically to screw them over individually. And honestly, most of the episode's plot, with him going off on a little sidequest to get his DLC super-powerful fighter plane and enough money to sidestep his arranged marriage, felt like little more than a digression. The next one, where he starts attending the academy, will probably feel entirely different.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               As someone who loves games—including JRPGs and dating sims—I greatly enjoyed this first episode. Over the years we've had numerous anime about being reincarnated in good games. The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is the opposite: what it would be like to be trapped in a terrible one.    Let's break down the game we see in this anime. To start with, it suffers from the shotgun approach to game design. Alto Liebe may be a dating sim first and foremost, but it also features both turn-based dungeon crawling and strategy RPG mecha battles. Worse yet, the difficulty for these parts of the game is ridiculously unbalanced. The game is literally designed around its cash shop—forcing players to dump even more real-world money into the game if they want to be able to beat it.    The actual story for the game makes things even worse. When the game was just a game, things didn't really need to make sense. You could have fantasy magic, sci-fi mecha, and a feudal society together in the same story. You could even have an ending where the player character ends up with a harmonious harem made up of the kingdom's finest young men. The problem is that when this becomes a fully-realized world, everything becomes taken to their logical extremes.    This is the world our “hero” (and I use that term loosely) Leon finds himself in. The pay-to-win aspect of the game means that not only are the enemies in the world so strong that he almost dies on his first adventure (despite exploiting the enemies' weaknesses) but also that society is obsessed with money. But far worse is that, to contrive a happy reverse harem ending, the world suffers from a ludicrous level of ingrained misandry—with human men relegated to the status of third-class citizens. Leon himself is set to be married off to a 50-year-old black widow who will send him to the front lines to die for a quick insurance payout.    The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is a joke—and that's the point. It's cliché and underwritten to the extreme. It's a hell to live in. Because of this, we can get behind Leon and his rather assholish nature. His drive to be as far away from the main plot as possible is understandable—at least in the background he might find something resembling normalcy. Of course, it almost certainly won't be that simple and I look forward to watching Leon bust through numerous dating sim and RPG game tropes as the weeks go on.     discuss this in the forum (291 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives     ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 3.6              What is this?   Office worker Leon is reincarnated into a particularly punishing dating sim video game, where women reign supreme and only beautiful men have a seat at the table. But Leon has a secret weapon: he remembers everything from his past life, which includes a complete playthrough of the very game in which he is now trapped. Watch Leon spark a revolution to change this new world in order to fulfill his ultimate desire of living a quiet, easy life in the countryside.    Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs is based on Yomu Mishima's light novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Sundays.      How was the first episode?   Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               This seems to be the season for me to be making statements like this, but I liked this story (tale type?) more when it was Past Life Countess, Present Life Otome Game NPC?!. Both series have a similar premise: someone is reincarnated in the world of an otome game as a random background character and have to do their best to get the kind of life they want. In the case of this show (based on the light novels of the same name), Leon seems to mostly want to overcome the disadvantages of his upbringing, which are apparently being both the son of his father's mistress and being born male. The latter does raise an eyebrow from me, because I can't think of any otome games that I've played that have that sort of world set up; naturally this doesn't mean that they don't exist, but it's the kind of detail that makes me wonder if the writer(s) have a whole lot of familiarity with otome games in the first place.    The show feels most concerned with the apparently bizarre nature of the game world he's been reincarnated into, which has elements of both fantasy and science fiction, but that's another mild red flag, because those two genres absolutely coexist in the otome games Steam Prison and Code:Realize.    Even if that wasn't the case, however, there's negligible time spent discovering what exactly Leon is after in going to the fancy academy from the game. Perhaps he does want to marry well, but the loot that he brings back from his foray to steal the game's goodies before the plot of the game begins would seem to negate that need, and he also doesn't seem interested in making a play for the heroine. In fact, he actively dislikes the characters from the game, as we see in his playthrough before he falls down the stairs and dies, which may be the single most original moment here because he's not being creamed by everyone's favorite motor vehicle. Watching Leon play the game is probably the most entertaining piece of the entire episode as he gets increasingly frustrated with its mechanics and characters, but even that is marred by the fact that he's doing it for his sister so that she doesn't have to. Does YouTube not exist in their world? Because last I checked, that was a good way to get to watch the cutscenes from video games without having to play them yourself.    The plot doesn't have a terrible concept, and goodness knows that isekai (otome game or otherwise) is ripe for parody and deconstruction at this stage. But as with The Executioner and Her Way of Life, I don't find this the most compelling telling of this particular story. Plus I'm very concerned that the story's “women have all the power” set up is going to be used as a way for the hero to frame himself as a perpetual victim, and I'm not a fan of that for any gender. This just is kind of a muddle, and that's a shame.        James Beckett  Rating:               I've come to learn that, of all the variations of the modern isekai anime that have cropped up over the years, I tend to prefer the ones where characters get trapped in dating sims and the like. The generic MMORPG worlds that so many of the other isekai trade in bore me to tears, and the stories tend to lack focus and direction on account of the open-ended natures of the video games that the stories are riffing on. When a gal or guy gets reincarnated into a dating sim, though, we have a set cast of characters and plot with more momentum right off the bat, and the characters' knowledge of the game has to be a little more specific than simply having memorized a thousand menus and sub-systems. Granted, the point of cribbing from the tropes of popular dating sims still lies in the fact that the isekai stories are treading familiar ground, but if we must operate entirely within the bumper-lanes of old clichés, I'll settle for the somewhat more entertaining clichés.    For those reasons, I ended up having an okay time with Trapped in a Dating Sim, even if it never left me feeling particularly excited or intrigued. A lot of my reservations come from the episode being such an exposition dump; we don't even meet the other central characters of the dating game that Leon has found himself stuck in until the very final shots of the premiere. Until then, it's the Leon the Loner show from top to bottom. He's not an awful protagonist, but he's nothing new to the genre, either. He's prickly and socially awkward, but he also can't be too much of an asshole, since we still have to be impressed with how much he breaks the game using his Earthbound knowledge of its systems and plot. This means that the story of this premiere is essentially a linear chronicle of how Leon inserts himself into the main plot of the game, with most scenes consisting of Leon monologuing in explicit detail what he knows about the game, how he's going to manipulate it, etc. This is the kind of stuff I almost never find interesting, because it assumes that the joy of the isekai premise comes from having the protagonist narrate the condensed Wiki-entry version of a video game, and not, you know, letting us just watch the story happen in peace.    Still, the setting itself has some cool stuff going for it, namely in how it mixes the elements of its typical fantasy setting with mechs and other sci-fi trappings—always a nice touch. It could also very well be that the story picks up speed once Leon arrives at the academy where the game truly takes place and starts to mingle with all of the characters; it's hard to judge how strong a dating-game style story is going to be when you don't even know most of the ensemble yet. I might stick with Trapped in a Dating Sim for another episode or two, just to see if it ends up winning me over. I doubt it will be as fun as My Next Life as a Villainess, but who knows? Stranger things have happened!        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               We haven't really seen it reflected in anime yet, but in LN and manga scenes, the isekai subgenre is absolutely rife with Otome Game Villainess stories. You can throw a rock in any direction and are just as liable to hit a book about being reincarnated as the mean girl character in a video game as anything else. So it makes sense with that particular gimmick's proliferation that you'd start seeing stories intentionally twisting it for novelty. Thus we have this show, which attempts to pull the perspective away from the stereotypical nobles and upper class, and instead focus on what it's like to be an anonymous background character in one of these stories. Or, well, it sort of tries that, then gets bored immediately with that premise and more or less turns into a typical male-led isekai in the span of half an episode. Whoops.    The biggest weakness for this show is it just doesn't feel like its creators knew all that much about otome games. Stories like My Next Life as a Villainess or I'm in Love with the Villainess use their familiarity with the subgenre to gently (and sometimes harshly) mock the established conventions of them, but you get the impression those are jokes borne from somebody who deeply enjoys that type of media and spends a lot of time thinking about them. This show, on the other hand, doesn't seem to know much about the genre besides there being a female PC and a lot of hot dudes for her to sweet talk. Everything else is crammed in from other facets of gaming – RTS battles, power armor, sci-fi style airships, micro-transactions, all stuff that shows up in other games that has to be ham-fistedly crammed in here because that's what the creators are more familiar with.    I say all this not to call the creators phonies, but because that muddling of its own premise kind of kills the joke. This isn't a parody of otome games or a critical look at the genre from a new point of view, so none of its observations or gags have any teeth. Wow show, you're right, there sure are a lot of haughty pretty boys in games made for women. You really got them there. And yeah, some games aren't balanced very well so you're forced to spend real money on them. Can't remember ever playing an otome game where that was the case but uh, good dunk on...mobile games? What are we parodying here, again?    This even comes down to our protagonist, who spends three full days 100%ing the central game – not because he is a guy who likes otome games, but because his pushy little sister blackmailed him into playing it for her. Because she wants to see the ending CGs but doesn't actually want to play the game to get it, and apparently can't use Google to just look them up? It's a clunky, contrived way to allow a guy who hates otome games to still have all the knowledge necessary to cheat the system and get ahead in life, making him fundamentally identical to a regular isekai hero. So we've taken three lefts to make a right and arrive at a plain wayne isekai story, only now our male lead will have to build a harem of doting anime girls by showing up those handsome gigachads who make up the typical love interests.    Then there's the frankly flaccid attempts at role reversal with the game world's gender politics. See, in this game, it's women who hold all the power! So now MEN are the ones forced into loveless political marriages where they serve older, richer WOMEN who all have disposable male paramours. See, it's clever, because they did CTRL+F for the word “patriarchy” and then replaced the P with an M. My first impression upon seeing that part of the premise was that this would be a cringe-inducing setup for a victim complex to further fuel the main character's resentful snark, but I've read enough of the manga adaptation to know that's largely not the case. But that doesn't stop it from feeling like a lazy way to build a paper-thin world, which isn't a whole lot better.    Combined with stiff, sub-par animation and pacing that leaps from moment to moment with a bald-faced desperation, this one winds up a total mess. It's at once overstuffed and totally lacking in ideas, and has the gall to have its own protagonist complain about how much its world and story suck like it's somebody else's fault. It's just a flop all around.        Caitlin Moore  Rating:               There's a particular type of guy out there who is seethingly angry at the idea of things that exist to play into women's fantasies. He doesn't take issue with media aimed at delivering male fantasies, oh no, but the very concept of media where the central aim is allowing women to indulge in the fantasy of being desirable to a range of hot men? Oh no, that cannot stand! Such things are truly detestable, and any girl who likes them is a shallow bitch.    I can't say that's for sure the case with whoever wrote Trapped in a Dating Sim, but it sure does come across that way. The protagonist, now known as Leon, beefed it on the staircase after his little sister blackmailed him into playing an otome game for three days straight while she went on Hawaii because… she wanted to hear the end conversation? Why not just go look it up? Why would she even care about it decontextualized from the rest of the game? (Or maybe that's just me.) What is this terrible secret she's holding over his head? Our little pre-Leon seems baffled that the game would have JRPG/science fiction/strategy elements, but considering my favorite genre of game is “visual novel with gameplay elements,” it doesn't seem remotely shocking. And why would it make him actively angry?    Then there's the issue of the matriarchal society. Why would that even be a thing in a dating sim? It's such a bizarre detail that has existed in absolutely none of the games I've played. That's the part that made me really get the feeling that whoever created this nonsense has never actually played an otome game, but is super angry that they exist. Pre-Leon grouses that the girls in the game are way too powerful, which shows up in the game world as women subjecting men to the exact same social oppression that women in the real world have been suffering under for centuries.

The protagonist, now known as Leon, beefed it on the staircase after his little sister blackmailed him into playing an otome game for three days straight while she went on Hawaii because… she wanted to hear the end conversation? Why not just go look it up? Why would she even care about it decontextualized from the rest of the game? (Or maybe that's just me.) What is this terrible secret she's holding over his head? Our little pre-Leon seems baffled that the game would have JRPG/science fiction/strategy elements, but considering my favorite genre of game is “visual novel with gameplay elements,” it doesn't seem remotely shocking. And why would it make him actively angry?    Then there's the issue of the matriarchal society. Why would that even be a thing in a dating sim? It's such a bizarre detail that has existed in absolutely none of the games I've played. That's the part that made me really get the feeling that whoever created this nonsense has never actually played an otome game, but is super angry that they exist. Pre-Leon grouses that the girls in the game are way too powerful, which shows up in the game world as women subjecting men to the exact same social oppression that women in the real world have been suffering under for centuries. Now, if it seemed like it had any actual intention of examining how things like economics arranged marriages between girls and much older men, that would be one thing, but it just leaves it as one of the reasons being in this world sucks for average men.    I hate being able to see the seams of constructed worlds, where you can see the structures designed specifically for the main character to chafe at and systems designed specifically to screw them over individually. And honestly, most of the episode's plot, with him going off on a little sidequest to get his DLC super-powerful fighter plane and enough money to sidestep his arranged marriage, felt like little more than a digression. The next one, where he starts attending the academy, will probably feel entirely different.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               As someone who loves games—including JRPGs and dating sims—I greatly enjoyed this first episode. Over the years we've had numerous anime about being reincarnated in good games. The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is the opposite: what it would be like to be trapped in a terrible one.    Let's break down the game we see in this anime. To start with, it suffers from the shotgun approach to game design. Alto Liebe may be a dating sim first and foremost, but it also features both turn-based dungeon crawling and strategy RPG mecha battles. Worse yet, the difficulty for these parts of the game is ridiculously unbalanced. The game is literally designed around its cash shop—forcing players to dump even more real-world money into the game if they want to be able to beat it.    The actual story for the game makes things even worse. When the game was just a game, things didn't really need to make sense. You could have fantasy magic, sci-fi mecha, and a feudal society together in the same story. You could even have an ending where the player character ends up with a harmonious harem made up of the kingdom's finest young men. The problem is that when this becomes a fully-realized world, everything becomes taken to their logical extremes.    This is the world our “hero” (and I use that term loosely) Leon finds himself in. The pay-to-win aspect of the game means that not only are the enemies in the world so strong that he almost dies on his first adventure (despite exploiting the enemies' weaknesses) but also that society is obsessed with money. But far worse is that, to contrive a happy reverse harem ending, the world suffers from a ludicrous level of ingrained misandry—with human men relegated to the status of third-class citizens. Leon himself is set to be married off to a 50-year-old black widow who will send him to the front lines to die for a quick insurance payout.    The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is a joke—and that's the point. It's cliché and underwritten to the extreme. It's a hell to live in. Because of this, we can get behind Leon and his rather assholish nature. His drive to be as far away from the main plot as possible is understandable—at least in the background he might find something resembling normalcy. Of course, it almost certainly won't be that simple and I look forward to watching Leon bust through numerous dating sim and RPG game tropes as the weeks go on.     discuss this in the forum (291 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives   ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 3.6              What is this?   Office worker Leon is reincarnated into a particularly punishing dating sim video game, where women reign supreme and only beautiful men have a seat at the table. But Leon has a secret weapon: he remembers everything from his past life, which includes a complete playthrough of the very game in which he is now trapped. Watch Leon spark a revolution to change this new world in order to fulfill his ultimate desire of living a quiet, easy life in the countryside.    Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs is based on Yomu Mishima's light novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Sundays.      How was the first episode?   Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               This seems to be the season for me to be making statements like this, but I liked this story (tale type?) more when it was Past Life Countess, Present Life Otome Game NPC?!. Both series have a similar premise: someone is reincarnated in the world of an otome game as a random background character and have to do their best to get the kind of life they want. In the case of this show (based on the light novels of the same name), Leon seems to mostly want to overcome the disadvantages of his upbringing, which are apparently being both the son of his father's mistress and being born male. The latter does raise an eyebrow from me, because I can't think of any otome games that I've played that have that sort of world set up; naturally this doesn't mean that they don't exist, but it's the kind of detail that makes me wonder if the writer(s) have a whole lot of familiarity with otome games in the first place.    The show feels most concerned with the apparently bizarre nature of the game world he's been reincarnated into, which has elements of both fantasy and science fiction, but that's another mild red flag, because those two genres absolutely coexist in the otome games Steam Prison and Code:Realize.    Even if that wasn't the case, however, there's negligible time spent discovering what exactly Leon is after in going to the fancy academy from the game. Perhaps he does want to marry well, but the loot that he brings back from his foray to steal the game's goodies before the plot of the game begins would seem to negate that need, and he also doesn't seem interested in making a play for the heroine. In fact, he actively dislikes the characters from the game, as we see in his playthrough before he falls down the stairs and dies, which may be the single most original moment here because he's not being creamed by everyone's favorite motor vehicle. Watching Leon play the game is probably the most entertaining piece of the entire episode as he gets increasingly frustrated with its mechanics and characters, but even that is marred by the fact that he's doing it for his sister so that she doesn't have to. Does YouTube not exist in their world? Because last I checked, that was a good way to get to watch the cutscenes from video games without having to play them yourself.    The plot doesn't have a terrible concept, and goodness knows that isekai (otome game or otherwise) is ripe for parody and deconstruction at this stage. But as with The Executioner and Her Way of Life, I don't find this the most compelling telling of this particular story. Plus I'm very concerned that the story's “women have all the power” set up is going to be used as a way for the hero to frame himself as a perpetual victim, and I'm not a fan of that for any gender. This just is kind of a muddle, and that's a shame.        James Beckett  Rating:               I've come to learn that, of all the variations of the modern isekai anime that have cropped up over the years, I tend to prefer the ones where characters get trapped in dating sims and the like. The generic MMORPG worlds that so many of the other isekai trade in bore me to tears, and the stories tend to lack focus and direction on account of the open-ended natures of the video games that the stories are riffing on. When a gal or guy gets reincarnated into a dating sim, though, we have a set cast of characters and plot with more momentum right off the bat, and the characters' knowledge of the game has to be a little more specific than simply having memorized a thousand menus and sub-systems. Granted, the point of cribbing from the tropes of popular dating sims still lies in the fact that the isekai stories are treading familiar ground, but if we must operate entirely within the bumper-lanes of old clichés, I'll settle for the somewhat more entertaining clichés.    For those reasons, I ended up having an okay time with Trapped in a Dating Sim, even if it never left me feeling particularly excited or intrigued. A lot of my reservations come from the episode being such an exposition dump; we don't even meet the other central characters of the dating game that Leon has found himself stuck in until the very final shots of the premiere. Until then, it's the Leon the Loner show from top to bottom. He's not an awful protagonist, but he's nothing new to the genre, either. He's prickly and socially awkward, but he also can't be too much of an asshole, since we still have to be impressed with how much he breaks the game using his Earthbound knowledge of its systems and plot. This means that the story of this premiere is essentially a linear chronicle of how Leon inserts himself into the main plot of the game, with most scenes consisting of Leon monologuing in explicit detail what he knows about the game, how he's going to manipulate it, etc. This is the kind of stuff I almost never find interesting, because it assumes that the joy of the isekai premise comes from having the protagonist narrate the condensed Wiki-entry version of a video game, and not, you know, letting us just watch the story happen in peace.    Still, the setting itself has some cool stuff going for it, namely in how it mixes the elements of its typical fantasy setting with mechs and other sci-fi trappings—always a nice touch. It could also very well be that the story picks up speed once Leon arrives at the academy where the game truly takes place and starts to mingle with all of the characters; it's hard to judge how strong a dating-game style story is going to be when you don't even know most of the ensemble yet. I might stick with Trapped in a Dating Sim for another episode or two, just to see if it ends up winning me over. I doubt it will be as fun as My Next Life as a Villainess, but who knows? Stranger things have happened!        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               We haven't really seen it reflected in anime yet, but in LN and manga scenes, the isekai subgenre is absolutely rife with Otome Game Villainess stories. You can throw a rock in any direction and are just as liable to hit a book about being reincarnated as the mean girl character in a video game as anything else. So it makes sense with that particular gimmick's proliferation that you'd start seeing stories intentionally twisting it for novelty. Thus we have this show, which attempts to pull the perspective away from the stereotypical nobles and upper class, and instead focus on what it's like to be an anonymous background character in one of these stories. Or, well, it sort of tries that, then gets bored immediately with that premise and more or less turns into a typical male-led isekai in the span of half an episode. Whoops.    The biggest weakness for this show is it just doesn't feel like its creators knew all that much about otome games. Stories like My Next Life as a Villainess or I'm in Love with the Villainess use their familiarity with the subgenre to gently (and sometimes harshly) mock the established conventions of them, but you get the impression those are jokes borne from somebody who deeply enjoys that type of media and spends a lot of time thinking about them. This show, on the other hand, doesn't seem to know much about the genre besides there being a female PC and a lot of hot dudes for her to sweet talk. Everything else is crammed in from other facets of gaming – RTS battles, power armor, sci-fi style airships, micro-transactions, all stuff that shows up in other games that has to be ham-fistedly crammed in here because that's what the creators are more familiar with.    I say all this not to call the creators phonies, but because that muddling of its own premise kind of kills the joke. This isn't a parody of otome games or a critical look at the genre from a new point of view, so none of its observations or gags have any teeth. Wow show, you're right, there sure are a lot of haughty pretty boys in games made for women. You really got them there. And yeah, some games aren't balanced very well so you're forced to spend real money on them. Can't remember ever playing an otome game where that was the case but uh, good dunk on...mobile games? What are we parodying here, again?    This even comes down to our protagonist, who spends three full days 100%ing the central game – not because he is a guy who likes otome games, but because his pushy little sister blackmailed him into playing it for her. Because she wants to see the ending CGs but doesn't actually want to play the game to get it, and apparently can't use Google to just look them up? It's a clunky, contrived way to allow a guy who hates otome games to still have all the knowledge necessary to cheat the system and get ahead in life, making him fundamentally identical to a regular isekai hero. So we've taken three lefts to make a right and arrive at a plain wayne isekai story, only now our male lead will have to build a harem of doting anime girls by showing up those handsome gigachads who make up the typical love interests.    Then there's the frankly flaccid attempts at role reversal with the game world's gender politics. See, in this game, it's women who hold all the power! So now MEN are the ones forced into loveless political marriages where they serve older, richer WOMEN who all have disposable male paramours. See, it's clever, because they did CTRL+F for the word “patriarchy” and then replaced the P with an M. My first impression upon seeing that part of the premise was that this would be a cringe-inducing setup for a victim complex to further fuel the main character's resentful snark, but I've read enough of the manga adaptation to know that's largely not the case. But that doesn't stop it from feeling like a lazy way to build a paper-thin world, which isn't a whole lot better.    Combined with stiff, sub-par animation and pacing that leaps from moment to moment with a bald-faced desperation, this one winds up a total mess. It's at once overstuffed and totally lacking in ideas, and has the gall to have its own protagonist complain about how much its world and story suck like it's somebody else's fault. It's just a flop all around.        Caitlin Moore  Rating:               There's a particular type of guy out there who is seethingly angry at the idea of things that exist to play into women's fantasies. He doesn't take issue with media aimed at delivering male fantasies, oh no, but the very concept of media where the central aim is allowing women to indulge in the fantasy of being desirable to a range of hot men? Oh no, that cannot stand! Such things are truly detestable, and any girl who likes them is a shallow bitch.    I can't say that's for sure the case with whoever wrote Trapped in a Dating Sim, but it sure does come across that way.

Caitlin Moore  Rating:               There's a particular type of guy out there who is seethingly angry at the idea of things that exist to play into women's fantasies. He doesn't take issue with media aimed at delivering male fantasies, oh no, but the very concept of media where the central aim is allowing women to indulge in the fantasy of being desirable to a range of hot men? Oh no, that cannot stand! Such things are truly detestable, and any girl who likes them is a shallow bitch.    I can't say that's for sure the case with whoever wrote Trapped in a Dating Sim, but it sure does come across that way. The protagonist, now known as Leon, beefed it on the staircase after his little sister blackmailed him into playing an otome game for three days straight while she went on Hawaii because… she wanted to hear the end conversation? Why not just go look it up? Why would she even care about it decontextualized from the rest of the game? (Or maybe that's just me.) What is this terrible secret she's holding over his head? Our little pre-Leon seems baffled that the game would have JRPG/science fiction/strategy elements, but considering my favorite genre of game is “visual novel with gameplay elements,” it doesn't seem remotely shocking. And why would it make him actively angry?    Then there's the issue of the matriarchal society. Why would that even be a thing in a dating sim? It's such a bizarre detail that has existed in absolutely none of the games I've played. That's the part that made me really get the feeling that whoever created this nonsense has never actually played an otome game, but is super angry that they exist. Pre-Leon grouses that the girls in the game are way too powerful, which shows up in the game world as women subjecting men to the exact same social oppression that women in the real world have been suffering under for centuries. Now, if it seemed like it had any actual intention of examining how things like economics arranged marriages between girls and much older men, that would be one thing, but it just leaves it as one of the reasons being in this world sucks for average men.    I hate being able to see the seams of constructed worlds, where you can see the structures designed specifically for the main character to chafe at and systems designed specifically to screw them over individually. And honestly, most of the episode's plot, with him going off on a little sidequest to get his DLC super-powerful fighter plane and enough money to sidestep his arranged marriage, felt like little more than a digression. The next one, where he starts attending the academy, will probably feel entirely different.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               As someone who loves games—including JRPGs and dating sims—I greatly enjoyed this first episode. Over the years we've had numerous anime about being reincarnated in good games. The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is the opposite: what it would be like to be trapped in a terrible one.    Let's break down the game we see in this anime. To start with, it suffers from the shotgun approach to game design. Alto Liebe may be a dating sim first and foremost, but it also features both turn-based dungeon crawling and strategy RPG mecha battles. Worse yet, the difficulty for these parts of the game is ridiculously unbalanced. The game is literally designed around its cash shop—forcing players to dump even more real-world money into the game if they want to be able to beat it.    The actual story for the game makes things even worse. When the game was just a game, things didn't really need to make sense. You could have fantasy magic, sci-fi mecha, and a feudal society together in the same story. You could even have an ending where the player character ends up with a harmonious harem made up of the kingdom's finest young men. The problem is that when this becomes a fully-realized world, everything becomes taken to their logical extremes.    This is the world our “hero” (and I use that term loosely) Leon finds himself in. The pay-to-win aspect of the game means that not only are the enemies in the world so strong that he almost dies on his first adventure (despite exploiting the enemies' weaknesses) but also that society is obsessed with money. But far worse is that, to contrive a happy reverse harem ending, the world suffers from a ludicrous level of ingrained misandry—with human men relegated to the status of third-class citizens. Leon himself is set to be married off to a 50-year-old black widow who will send him to the front lines to die for a quick insurance payout.    The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is a joke—and that's the point. It's cliché and underwritten to the extreme. It's a hell to live in. Because of this, we can get behind Leon and his rather assholish nature. His drive to be as far away from the main plot as possible is understandable—at least in the background he might find something resembling normalcy. Of course, it almost certainly won't be that simple and I look forward to watching Leon bust through numerous dating sim and RPG game tropes as the weeks go on.

Review:         Synopsis:          When super-powered school girl A-ko isn't rushing to class with her cry-baby friend C-ko, she's destroying school property in her battles with B-ko. Her carefree days of wanton destruction are about to get a serious wrench thrown in them however, when an alien menace descends on her futuristic hometown of Graviton City.    We're revisiting the 1986 classic from Discotek, issued in high-definition for the first time with all the bells and whistles!      Review:            I'm here to answer three questions looming over this release. Is Project A-ko worth watching for newcomers? If you have seen it before, is this edition worth your time? Lastly, what are the special features that make this the ""perfect edition?""    For the uninitiated, Project A-ko is a 1986 anime film that was widely successful in Japan and groundbreaking for the U.S. market. This isn't a piece of quaint retro media; it was formative to early English-language fandom as one of the first anime fans could (legally) get on tape. It was initially pitched as a direct-to-video release as part of the Cream Lemon erotica series, but producers must have seen its potential for wider appeal, and it was reworked as a mainstream title with a bit of spicy content left in. By and large though, Project A-ko is a sci-fi comedy full of impressive action set pieces, mechanical designs, and physical humor that surprisingly still holds up over 30 years later.    The film's premise is pretty straightforward: Super-powered A-ko lives in Graviton City, a place in the near future that has experienced a surge in technological development after recovering from a meteor strike. She and her childhood friend C-ko are new high school students and perpetually late for class. The crybaby C-ko immediately catches the attention of the wealthy queen bee and part-time inventor B-ko who makes it her mission to defeat A-ko and claim B-ko for herself. In the background, an alien ship is approaching Graviton City in search of their missing princess.    Much of the film's charm is thanks to its commitment to the bit. If that means five slightly varying sequences of A-ko thundering through a neighborhood and crashing into the alien spy D, so be it. Will she ever lose to B-ko in their quickly escalating face offs? Probably not, but director Katsuhiko Nishijima (who was only 24 at the time) and the rest of the animation crew know how to defy viewer's expectations. A build-up to a fight is just as likely to end in a quick leg sweep as it is to turn into a full-out brawl.    If I had to levy any criticisms at the queer-charged narrative, it's that the pacing can be a bit all over the place. There are a few beats that feel like the story is drawing out for time until it finally gets to the explosive climax, but Project A-ko runs on spectacle. Just as the audience feels inclined to groan at yet another ""race to school before the bell"" sequence, the movie changes it up with a different diversion. My other primary complaint is that the joke reveal that all the aliens are women hasn't aged well. It isn't malicious, but it does feel dated to a time when ""manly women"" (and all the baggage that came with it) were a common punchline.    Visually, this is the best Project A-ko has ever (and perhaps will ever) look. There's a great feature over on Crunchyroll by Paul Chapman that discusses the wild story of how Discotek pulled off this remaster. The condensed version, as was told to me by Justin Sevakis, is that the team was remastering the film manually through a new process (referred to on Discotek releases as AstroRes) that was pitched to them out of the UK. At that time, the original 35mm film was considered lost. As the restoration process marched on, Robert Woodhead, the founder and owner of AnimEigo, would become the unsung hero of the release. Through what was discovered to be a filing error, Woodhead found the original 35mm film elements of Project A-ko.    The results are fantastic. I had seen the the CPM release of A-ko back in the early aughts and was lucky enough to be at the Otakon viewing last year. Watching it again at home, the clean-up work and color correction are stellar. From A-ko's hair to the giant spaceships, there's a deeper richness to the hues that create a superior and more enjoyable experience. At the risk of sounding like I'm repeating my praises from Discotek's Memories release, this is worth viewing just for the animation alone. But it's the special features that really sell it.    Project A-ko's unique history extends to its musical score. The anime features three vocal tracks and a score composed and produced by Joey Carbone and Richie Zito with performances by Anne Livingston, Samantha Newark, Valerie Stevenson, and George Doering. There's a great 30-minute documentary with Carbone, Zito, Livingston, and Newark that discusses how they were brought on to the project and their specific places in music history. I'm not an 80s pop music buff, so consider how surprised I was to learn that besides some bopping tracks, the creators were heavily influential in mainstream music. The special features are full of interesting insights like this, whether it's a 1980s behind-the-scenes doc shot by a Japanese film crew in Los Angeles or a quick playthrough of an abandoned CD-Rom game. These are features that aren't just nice to have but provide a full context of why Project A-ko has its place as a seminal part of anime history.    Project A-ko is a good romp. Personally, I recommend watching it with friends while eating fried chicken to get the perfect vibes. Throw it in when the world feels a little too much and let A-ko's physical hijinks clear up your bad day.

14-04-2022,animation,2,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/preview-guide/2022/spring/love-after-world-domination/.183623,Love After World Domination - The Spring 2022 Preview Guide - Anime News Network:SEA,"    The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Love After World Domination   Apr  9th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Love After World Domination ?                     Community score: 4.0              What is this?   Fudo Aikawa and Desumi Magahara are in love. There's only one small problem: they are mortal enemies. Fudo is the red ranger and leader of the fighting force Gelato 5, while Desumi is the reaper princess of the evil organization Gekko. To make matters worse, neither of them have ever been in a relationship before. They have to keep their budding romance a secret, while figuring out how to be in a relationship and juggle their real life responsibilities along the way.    Love After World Domination is based on Hiroshi Noda and Takahiro Wakamatsu's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?   James Beckett  Rating:                Look, what do you want from me? Love After World Domination is an extremely cute and surprisingly well-produced romantic comedy featuring two catastrophically dorky young lovers that are fighting their way through the awkwardness of their own inexperience because they like each other so gosh darned much, and it's a loving homage/spoof of Super Sentai. This show was literally made specifically for me. I am not a strong man. There was never any chance that I would be able to resist the charms of this one.    I could just make this review a straightforward list of the things I loved about this premiere. The sentai team is themed after gelato flavors, which is hilarious; the fight scenes are actually pretty fun and cool-looking; one of the evil minions is a giant bear; Fudo the Red Gelato is King Himbo of Good Boy Mountain; Desumi's little skull mask is cute as heck, and she also has a chonky cat that she loves, which makes her perfect girlfriend material.    Honestly, I only have one real complaint with Love After World Domination, and it isn't even entirely fair to the show's own qualities. It just had the unfortunate luck of coming after Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic on today's schedule, and 99% of every other rom-com anime out there would pale in comparison to that show. Love After World Domination is plenty cute, and plenty funny, but it is standing in the shadow of one of the GOATs that is operating at the peak of its powers, which is bound to make it seem maybe a touch modest in comparison.    I suppose that this is also one of those productions that could easily suffer from diminishing returns, especially if the animation starts to suffer and the show has to rely on the same round of jokes about dating etiquette and Super Sentai tropes. Then again, real Super Sentai series have gotten by on recycling tried and true cliches on a limited budget for, like, 50 years straight, so I doubt LAWD will have too difficult a time at keeping things fresh. Either way, I had a rollicking good time with this premiere, and I'm going to add it to this season's growing list of must-watch comedies.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Love After World Domination is one of those premieres that I enjoyed for the most part but worry about the longevity of the concept. As it stands, the first episode really only has two core jokes—if they can even be called that. The first is the ultra-cute love story between Fudo and Desumi. While they are battlefield enemies engaging in a scandalous relationship, the crux of the humor comes from the fact that neither of them know a thing about romance. They clearly like each other, but are basically resorting to Google to figure out how this “dating” thing works. It's cute, innocent fun with a sprinkle of social commentary (like when it pokes fun at the creepiness of cyber-stalking your crush and how it changes the traditional dating process).    The other core joke of the show is its parody of the Japanese superhero genre, tokusatsu. This is also where the show falters a bit. While its five gelato-flavored heroes and their appropriately themed attacks seem like an attempt to make fun of the general concept of tokusatsu, it's not really out of the realm of believability for an actual toku show to be themed like this. I mean, Kamen Rider Gaim, penned by Madoka Magica creator Gen Urobuchi, was fruit-themed, after all. Moreover, there is no subversion of Japanese superhero tropes here. Everyone is 100% serious about what is going on—from the villains who stand back and make speeches even as the rangers go to town on the low level mooks, to the rangers who are earnest and friendly even when off duty. Because of this, the show feels painfully predictable and almost boring whenever its not solidly focused on the relationship between Fudo and Desumi.    So even though I have a soft spot for both Power Rangers and hero/villain romances, I'm not really as into this anime as I feel I should be. Even within this premiere alone, it feels like the concept is already running out of steam. I don't see myself coming back for more next week, though I may check out a bit of the manga and see if that is able to change my mind.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Move over, Romeo and Juliet. Fudo and Desumi are here to show you how real star-crossed lovers do it: by not just having feuding families, but being on completely opposite sides of a major fight. Or at least a ridiculous fight? Even if the superheroes weren't the Gelato 5 – complete with flavor-themed colors – and the villains seeking to take over the world didn't employ a giant talking bear named Culverin Bear, there's not much about the two warring sides for us to take seriously. Even the people populating the story's world don't – when Gekko attacks a public park, the screams for help from the general public are…let's go with “underwhelming.” Simply put, this is equal parts super sentai sendup and gooey romcom, and it looks like those two things are going to mesh just as well here as they do in the source manga.    The central romance is between Desumi, AKA Reaper Princess, and Fudo, Red Gelato (strawberry flavor). Fudo falls in love at first sight, which is impressive since his “first sight” is of Desumi in her battle “gear,” which consists of fancy lingerie and a face-hiding mask. (So maybe not impressive.) But there's a real sense that it's not so much that he fell in love with what he saw as he did with her fighting skills and her parting words, which are about his battle prowess. Since there's a definite sense that the rest of the Gelato 5 think he's just some muscle head, Desumi's remarks may be the nicest thing anyone's said to him about all that training he's done. Likewise, Fudo's heartfelt confession to her is clearly her first brush with romance and she's flattered and more than a little charmed by his earnestness.    It's a cute mix of tropes made even more fun by their efforts at hiding the fact that they're dating from both Gelato 5 and Gekko, although technically Fudo did get permission from Professor Gelato to ask Desumi out. Not that the good professor knew who Fudo was crushing on when he urged him to go forth and speak his feelings, something Fudo may be realizing in hindsight. Or he may not; Fudo's perhaps not the sharpest tool in the proverbial shed. When you combine that with Desumi's incredible naivete in matters romantic (holding hands practically sends her into a fainting fit), it's the recipe for peach-pink love – at least as far as Pink Gelato's definition of the color goes.    While there are some awkward things about the character designs – specifically the way people fit into their clothes, or don't, as the case may be – this looks better than I was expecting and the animation is up to some flashy fights and over-the-top transformation scenes. As a fan of the manga, I'm happy with how this looks in its first episode, and I'm looking forward to seeing more.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Finally, some good god damn food. Don't get me wrong: I enjoyed Aharen-san wa Hakarenai perfectly fine, and I'm looking forward to some other romcoms that have yet to debut. But I have been craving another goofy-ass show about a pair of idiots blushing their way into the next dimension, and this show has given me all I could ever ask for.    There's really not a whole lot else to dig into here, though. I could try to talk about how hard the show goes on its Super Sentai parody, complete with a full five-person transformation sequence where our gelato-themed Power Rangers sound off increasingly goofy battle cries. But I'm far from an expert on this stuff so all I can say is that I refuse to believe pistachio is “the flavor of peace” no matter how hard Gelato Green insists. And outside of some sharp gags and moments of parody, this entire premiere is just watching our adorable, awkward leads together – either when they're already dating or when Fudo first made his confession. That means most of this episode is just iterations on a single joke that, while funny and well-delivered, also means you have to really like that joke to get onboard with it.    The production does help a lot in keeping that joke fresh, though. Unlike the similarly toku-themed Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department, this show actually has the production values to show off some cool fight choreography to go along with its jokes, and it especially has room to make our dorky central couple expressive and appealing to watch. This is just some A+ romcom blushing, and it makes the two of them tip-toeing through the “steps” of dating fun to watch all on its own. There's even room to add some actual detail to their fanservice, like making sure Desumi has her garters on right to avoid a bathroom death trap. In a year that's already featured World’s End Harem and its horny JPEG artifacts, having cheesecake that actually knows how to properly present itself shouldn't be taken for granted, so if this show's gonna be a little horny I'm glad they actually know what they're doing.    I'm not going to tell you this show is deep or thought-provoking or even particularly romantic, but what I will say is I had a big dumb grin on my face the entire episode. I love these losers and I want to see them go on a hundred secret dates where they suddenly have to turn a kiss into a clashing headbutt to avoid suspicion. I want to see them send flirty texts in code that make it look like threatening letters. This show was made for me, and I plan to embrace it with both arms.     discuss this in the forum (291 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Love After World Domination is plenty cute, and plenty funny, but it is standing in the shadow of one of the GOATs that is operating at the peak of its powers, which is bound to make it seem maybe a touch modest in comparison.    I suppose that this is also one of those productions that could easily suffer from diminishing returns, especially if the animation starts to suffer and the show has to rely on the same round of jokes about dating etiquette and Super Sentai tropes. Then again, real Super Sentai series have gotten by on recycling tried and true cliches on a limited budget for, like, 50 years straight, so I doubt LAWD will have too difficult a time at keeping things fresh. Either way, I had a rollicking good time with this premiere, and I'm going to add it to this season's growing list of must-watch comedies.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Love After World Domination is one of those premieres that I enjoyed for the most part but worry about the longevity of the concept. As it stands, the first episode really only has two core jokes—if they can even be called that. The first is the ultra-cute love story between Fudo and Desumi. While they are battlefield enemies engaging in a scandalous relationship, the crux of the humor comes from the fact that neither of them know a thing about romance. They clearly like each other, but are basically resorting to Google to figure out how this “dating” thing works. It's cute, innocent fun with a sprinkle of social commentary (like when it pokes fun at the creepiness of cyber-stalking your crush and how it changes the traditional dating process).    The other core joke of the show is its parody of the Japanese superhero genre, tokusatsu. This is also where the show falters a bit. While its five gelato-flavored heroes and their appropriately themed attacks seem like an attempt to make fun of the general concept of tokusatsu, it's not really out of the realm of believability for an actual toku show to be themed like this. I mean, Kamen Rider Gaim, penned by Madoka Magica creator Gen Urobuchi, was fruit-themed, after all. Moreover, there is no subversion of Japanese superhero tropes here. Everyone is 100% serious about what is going on—from the villains who stand back and make speeches even as the rangers go to town on the low level mooks, to the rangers who are earnest and friendly even when off duty. Because of this, the show feels painfully predictable and almost boring whenever its not solidly focused on the relationship between Fudo and Desumi.    So even though I have a soft spot for both Power Rangers and hero/villain romances, I'm not really as into this anime as I feel I should be. Even within this premiere alone, it feels like the concept is already running out of steam. I don't see myself coming back for more next week, though I may check out a bit of the manga and see if that is able to change my mind.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Move over, Romeo and Juliet. Fudo and Desumi are here to show you how real star-crossed lovers do it: by not just having feuding families, but being on completely opposite sides of a major fight. Or at least a ridiculous fight? Even if the superheroes weren't the Gelato 5 – complete with flavor-themed colors – and the villains seeking to take over the world didn't employ a giant talking bear named Culverin Bear, there's not much about the two warring sides for us to take seriously. Even the people populating the story's world don't – when Gekko attacks a public park, the screams for help from the general public are…let's go with “underwhelming.” Simply put, this is equal parts super sentai sendup and gooey romcom, and it looks like those two things are going to mesh just as well here as they do in the source manga.    The central romance is between Desumi, AKA Reaper Princess, and Fudo, Red Gelato (strawberry flavor). Fudo falls in love at first sight, which is impressive since his “first sight” is of Desumi in her battle “gear,” which consists of fancy lingerie and a face-hiding mask. (So maybe not impressive.) But there's a real sense that it's not so much that he fell in love with what he saw as he did with her fighting skills and her parting words, which are about his battle prowess. Since there's a definite sense that the rest of the Gelato 5 think he's just some muscle head, Desumi's remarks may be the nicest thing anyone's said to him about all that training he's done. Likewise, Fudo's heartfelt confession to her is clearly her first brush with romance and she's flattered and more than a little charmed by his earnestness.    It's a cute mix of tropes made even more fun by their efforts at hiding the fact that they're dating from both Gelato 5 and Gekko, although technically Fudo did get permission from Professor Gelato to ask Desumi out. Not that the good professor knew who Fudo was crushing on when he urged him to go forth and speak his feelings, something Fudo may be realizing in hindsight. Or he may not; Fudo's perhaps not the sharpest tool in the proverbial shed. When you combine that with Desumi's incredible naivete in matters romantic (holding hands practically sends her into a fainting fit), it's the recipe for peach-pink love – at least as far as Pink Gelato's definition of the color goes.    While there are some awkward things about the character designs – specifically the way people fit into their clothes, or don't, as the case may be – this looks better than I was expecting and the animation is up to some flashy fights and over-the-top transformation scenes. As a fan of the manga, I'm happy with how this looks in its first episode, and I'm looking forward to seeing more.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Finally, some good god damn food. Don't get me wrong: I enjoyed Aharen-san wa Hakarenai perfectly fine, and I'm looking forward to some other romcoms that have yet to debut. But I have been craving another goofy-ass show about a pair of idiots blushing their way into the next dimension, and this show has given me all I could ever ask for.    There's really not a whole lot else to dig into here, though. I could try to talk about how hard the show goes on its Super Sentai parody, complete with a full five-person transformation sequence where our gelato-themed Power Rangers sound off increasingly goofy battle cries. But I'm far from an expert on this stuff so all I can say is that I refuse to believe pistachio is “the flavor of peace” no matter how hard Gelato Green insists. And outside of some sharp gags and moments of parody, this entire premiere is just watching our adorable, awkward leads together – either when they're already dating or when Fudo first made his confession. That means most of this episode is just iterations on a single joke that, while funny and well-delivered, also means you have to really like that joke to get onboard with it.    The production does help a lot in keeping that joke fresh, though. Unlike the similarly toku-themed Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department, this show actually has the production values to show off some cool fight choreography to go along with its jokes, and it especially has room to make our dorky central couple expressive and appealing to watch. This is just some A+ romcom blushing, and it makes the two of them tip-toeing through the “steps” of dating fun to watch all on its own. There's even room to add some actual detail to their fanservice, like making sure Desumi has her garters on right to avoid a bathroom death trap. In a year that's already featured World’s End Harem and its horny JPEG artifacts, having cheesecake that actually knows how to properly present itself shouldn't be taken for granted, so if this show's gonna be a little horny I'm glad they actually know what they're doing.    I'm not going to tell you this show is deep or thought-provoking or even particularly romantic, but what I will say is I had a big dumb grin on my face the entire episode. I love these losers and I want to see them go on a hundred secret dates where they suddenly have to turn a kiss into a clashing headbutt to avoid suspicion. I want to see them send flirty texts in code that make it look like threatening letters. This show was made for me, and I plan to embrace it with both arms.     discuss this in the forum (291 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives     ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 4.0              What is this?   Fudo Aikawa and Desumi Magahara are in love. There's only one small problem: they are mortal enemies. Fudo is the red ranger and leader of the fighting force Gelato 5, while Desumi is the reaper princess of the evil organization Gekko. To make matters worse, neither of them have ever been in a relationship before. They have to keep their budding romance a secret, while figuring out how to be in a relationship and juggle their real life responsibilities along the way.    Love After World Domination is based on Hiroshi Noda and Takahiro Wakamatsu's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?   James Beckett  Rating:                Look, what do you want from me? Love After World Domination is an extremely cute and surprisingly well-produced romantic comedy featuring two catastrophically dorky young lovers that are fighting their way through the awkwardness of their own inexperience because they like each other so gosh darned much, and it's a loving homage/spoof of Super Sentai. This show was literally made specifically for me. I am not a strong man. There was never any chance that I would be able to resist the charms of this one.    I could just make this review a straightforward list of the things I loved about this premiere. The sentai team is themed after gelato flavors, which is hilarious; the fight scenes are actually pretty fun and cool-looking; one of the evil minions is a giant bear; Fudo the Red Gelato is King Himbo of Good Boy Mountain; Desumi's little skull mask is cute as heck, and she also has a chonky cat that she loves, which makes her perfect girlfriend material.

They have to keep their budding romance a secret, while figuring out how to be in a relationship and juggle their real life responsibilities along the way.    Love After World Domination is based on Hiroshi Noda and Takahiro Wakamatsu's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?   James Beckett  Rating:                Look, what do you want from me? Love After World Domination is an extremely cute and surprisingly well-produced romantic comedy featuring two catastrophically dorky young lovers that are fighting their way through the awkwardness of their own inexperience because they like each other so gosh darned much, and it's a loving homage/spoof of Super Sentai. This show was literally made specifically for me. I am not a strong man. There was never any chance that I would be able to resist the charms of this one.    I could just make this review a straightforward list of the things I loved about this premiere. The sentai team is themed after gelato flavors, which is hilarious; the fight scenes are actually pretty fun and cool-looking; one of the evil minions is a giant bear; Fudo the Red Gelato is King Himbo of Good Boy Mountain; Desumi's little skull mask is cute as heck, and she also has a chonky cat that she loves, which makes her perfect girlfriend material.    Honestly, I only have one real complaint with Love After World Domination, and it isn't even entirely fair to the show's own qualities. It just had the unfortunate luck of coming after Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic on today's schedule, and 99% of every other rom-com anime out there would pale in comparison to that show. Love After World Domination is plenty cute, and plenty funny, but it is standing in the shadow of one of the GOATs that is operating at the peak of its powers, which is bound to make it seem maybe a touch modest in comparison.    I suppose that this is also one of those productions that could easily suffer from diminishing returns, especially if the animation starts to suffer and the show has to rely on the same round of jokes about dating etiquette and Super Sentai tropes. Then again, real Super Sentai series have gotten by on recycling tried and true cliches on a limited budget for, like, 50 years straight, so I doubt LAWD will have too difficult a time at keeping things fresh. Either way, I had a rollicking good time with this premiere, and I'm going to add it to this season's growing list of must-watch comedies.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Love After World Domination is one of those premieres that I enjoyed for the most part but worry about the longevity of the concept. As it stands, the first episode really only has two core jokes—if they can even be called that. The first is the ultra-cute love story between Fudo and Desumi. While they are battlefield enemies engaging in a scandalous relationship, the crux of the humor comes from the fact that neither of them know a thing about romance. They clearly like each other, but are basically resorting to Google to figure out how this “dating” thing works. It's cute, innocent fun with a sprinkle of social commentary (like when it pokes fun at the creepiness of cyber-stalking your crush and how it changes the traditional dating process).    The other core joke of the show is its parody of the Japanese superhero genre, tokusatsu. This is also where the show falters a bit. While its five gelato-flavored heroes and their appropriately themed attacks seem like an attempt to make fun of the general concept of tokusatsu, it's not really out of the realm of believability for an actual toku show to be themed like this. I mean, Kamen Rider Gaim, penned by Madoka Magica creator Gen Urobuchi, was fruit-themed, after all. Moreover, there is no subversion of Japanese superhero tropes here. Everyone is 100% serious about what is going on—from the villains who stand back and make speeches even as the rangers go to town on the low level mooks, to the rangers who are earnest and friendly even when off duty. Because of this, the show feels painfully predictable and almost boring whenever its not solidly focused on the relationship between Fudo and Desumi.    So even though I have a soft spot for both Power Rangers and hero/villain romances, I'm not really as into this anime as I feel I should be. Even within this premiere alone, it feels like the concept is already running out of steam. I don't see myself coming back for more next week, though I may check out a bit of the manga and see if that is able to change my mind.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Move over, Romeo and Juliet. Fudo and Desumi are here to show you how real star-crossed lovers do it: by not just having feuding families, but being on completely opposite sides of a major fight. Or at least a ridiculous fight? Even if the superheroes weren't the Gelato 5 – complete with flavor-themed colors – and the villains seeking to take over the world didn't employ a giant talking bear named Culverin Bear, there's not much about the two warring sides for us to take seriously. Even the people populating the story's world don't – when Gekko attacks a public park, the screams for help from the general public are…let's go with “underwhelming.” Simply put, this is equal parts super sentai sendup and gooey romcom, and it looks like those two things are going to mesh just as well here as they do in the source manga.    The central romance is between Desumi, AKA Reaper Princess, and Fudo, Red Gelato (strawberry flavor). Fudo falls in love at first sight, which is impressive since his “first sight” is of Desumi in her battle “gear,” which consists of fancy lingerie and a face-hiding mask. (So maybe not impressive.) But there's a real sense that it's not so much that he fell in love with what he saw as he did with her fighting skills and her parting words, which are about his battle prowess. Since there's a definite sense that the rest of the Gelato 5 think he's just some muscle head, Desumi's remarks may be the nicest thing anyone's said to him about all that training he's done. Likewise, Fudo's heartfelt confession to her is clearly her first brush with romance and she's flattered and more than a little charmed by his earnestness.    It's a cute mix of tropes made even more fun by their efforts at hiding the fact that they're dating from both Gelato 5 and Gekko, although technically Fudo did get permission from Professor Gelato to ask Desumi out. Not that the good professor knew who Fudo was crushing on when he urged him to go forth and speak his feelings, something Fudo may be realizing in hindsight. Or he may not; Fudo's perhaps not the sharpest tool in the proverbial shed. When you combine that with Desumi's incredible naivete in matters romantic (holding hands practically sends her into a fainting fit), it's the recipe for peach-pink love – at least as far as Pink Gelato's definition of the color goes.    While there are some awkward things about the character designs – specifically the way people fit into their clothes, or don't, as the case may be – this looks better than I was expecting and the animation is up to some flashy fights and over-the-top transformation scenes. As a fan of the manga, I'm happy with how this looks in its first episode, and I'm looking forward to seeing more.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Finally, some good god damn food. Don't get me wrong: I enjoyed Aharen-san wa Hakarenai perfectly fine, and I'm looking forward to some other romcoms that have yet to debut. But I have been craving another goofy-ass show about a pair of idiots blushing their way into the next dimension, and this show has given me all I could ever ask for.    There's really not a whole lot else to dig into here, though. I could try to talk about how hard the show goes on its Super Sentai parody, complete with a full five-person transformation sequence where our gelato-themed Power Rangers sound off increasingly goofy battle cries. But I'm far from an expert on this stuff so all I can say is that I refuse to believe pistachio is “the flavor of peace” no matter how hard Gelato Green insists. And outside of some sharp gags and moments of parody, this entire premiere is just watching our adorable, awkward leads together – either when they're already dating or when Fudo first made his confession. That means most of this episode is just iterations on a single joke that, while funny and well-delivered, also means you have to really like that joke to get onboard with it.    The production does help a lot in keeping that joke fresh, though. Unlike the similarly toku-themed Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department, this show actually has the production values to show off some cool fight choreography to go along with its jokes, and it especially has room to make our dorky central couple expressive and appealing to watch. This is just some A+ romcom blushing, and it makes the two of them tip-toeing through the “steps” of dating fun to watch all on its own. There's even room to add some actual detail to their fanservice, like making sure Desumi has her garters on right to avoid a bathroom death trap. In a year that's already featured World’s End Harem and its horny JPEG artifacts, having cheesecake that actually knows how to properly present itself shouldn't be taken for granted, so if this show's gonna be a little horny I'm glad they actually know what they're doing.    I'm not going to tell you this show is deep or thought-provoking or even particularly romantic, but what I will say is I had a big dumb grin on my face the entire episode. I love these losers and I want to see them go on a hundred secret dates where they suddenly have to turn a kiss into a clashing headbutt to avoid suspicion. I want to see them send flirty texts in code that make it look like threatening letters. This show was made for me, and I plan to embrace it with both arms.

Community score: 4.6              What is this?   Kaguya Shinomiya and Miyuki Shirogane are two geniuses who stand atop their prestigious academy's student council, making them the elite among elite. But it's lonely at the top and each has fallen for the other. There's just one huge problem standing in the way of lovey-dovey bliss—they're both too prideful to be the first to confess their romantic feelings and thus become the “loser” in the competition of love.    Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic is the latest entry in the television anime based on Aka Akasaka's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                I can't believe that in one day, two of my favorite romances had new seasons start! Premiere season is tough, but days like this make it worth it. Kaguya-sama: Love is War has returned for a third season, picking right back where the previous season left off, and boy, am I glad to see these kids with all their weird little quirks and foibles again.    I wasn't totally sold on Miko Iino by the end of the previous season, unsure of where she would fit into the group dynamic with rigid prudishness as her primary character trait. So of course, the episode leads with a skit between her and Ishigami, who once upon a time was one of the worst characters but is now one of the best. Miko's strange listening habits, and Ishigami's attempt at taking the fall for her, made her feel more like a little weirdo, and by now, a bit of weirdness is basically a requirement to be a student council member.    This is important because there's a playfulness inherent to Kaguya-sama that Iino's rigidity seemed antithetical to, but ended up on full display for the rest of the episode. Teenagers aren't my area of expertise, but they're still kids, and kids need to play! They need to be awkward and obsess over things like read receipts on messaging apps and boast and set up arm-wrestling tournaments instead of doing their actual work. Their personalities are exaggerated and caricatured, but few comedies capture those special moments where you get a strange idea and just keep going with it.    That playfulness extends to the visual presentation as well. The animation in this season has so far been fairly middle of the road, and thus I haven't commented on it much, but Kaguya-sama has some of the best goddamn direction and animation in the medium. Mamoru Hatakeyama and his team almost always manage to elevate the manga's punchlines into something special, and they held nothing back this episode. From the camel wandering around in the background as Iino studies, to Shirogane's shifting body language as he realizes he has the upper hand on Kaguya over the phone, to making the picture quality look like a VHS transfer – every frame has something joyful and unexpected. Big gags and subtle expressions alike have been animated with equal levels of care.    If you haven't watched Kaguya-sama: Love is War yet… why not? It's seriously one of the best anime comedies ever made. Why deprive yourself?       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               After having watched two full seasons, it's become perfectly clear that Kaguya-sama isn't for me (except in the rare cases where it is). Being mostly a series of short gags—usually involving instant karma as one of the student council members attempts to assert dominance over the others in some way—means that there's not much to further develop the characters or progress the love story between Shinomiya and Shirogane. The episodes of the series I most enjoy tend to be the final few of the season where meaningful things happen and there is real drama and tangible stakes. This season premiere was most certainly not one of those episodes.    Now, that's not to say I don't find the humor of the show funny in its own right. From Ishigami futilely trying to stop Iino from embarrassing herself to Shinomiya's ignorance about the differences between email and texting, there are a ton of great gags in this episode. The final self-contained story about the arm wrestling tournament takes things to a whole other level—especially with its post-credits scene showing that Fujiwara was just talking trash the whole time and couldn't win without cheating.    But what takes all these gags to the next level is the animation that merges what's really going on with what the characters are thinking to create something as funny as it is surreal. From the large camel making noises in Iino's ear to the mountain of bodybuilders supporting Shinomiya, it's all but impossible not to laugh.    So while Kaguya-sama isn't my cup of tea in general, I wouldn't say that this is a bad episode. In fact, it is pretty much the epitome of what Kaguya-sama is at its essence. If you ever need a laugh, Kaguya-sama is eager to deliver—just don't expect anything more.       James Beckett  Rating:               One of the “benefits” of being a teacher is getting to essentially serve as a kind of covert anthropologist that specializes in that most elusive and influential of species: The modern teenager. I'm like Jane Goodall; I live among them, in their native environment, and since they give absolutely zero shits about what I think, I have free reign to study the peculiar social rituals and developmental adaptations that these hormonal and aggressive pack animals undergo. As such, I feel like I can say, with legitimately authoritative expertise, that one of the things that makes Kaguya-sama: Love is War such a smashing success is how well it understands the interior lives of teenagers. Specifically, it has a comprehensive understanding of all the ridiculously dumb shit that teenagers will do to and with one another when left to their own devices. More importantly, it gets that all of this inane tomfoolery, no matter how stupid, will feel to a teenager like the most earth-shatteringly consequential events that will ever occur in their lifetimes.    Kaguya-sama: Love is War –Ultra Romantic– is essentially more of the same, in that regard. The goofy kids of Shuchiin Academy's student council spend their days getting into the most ridiculous of shenanigans, while Kaguya and Miyuki sloooooooowly progress along their romantic destinies with one another. “More of the same” can come across as a backhanded compliment, but that couldn't be further from the truth in the case of an anime like Kaguya-sama, considering that the “same” in question happens to be some of the most consistently hilarious and expertly animated comedy in the business.    Each of the three sketches in this premiere does what Kaguya-sama does best, in that they take painfully relatable, everyday scenarios and crank the intensity so far past the eleven mark that the the dial may as well be ripped clean off. The opening sketch is perhaps the weakest of the three, since it focuses on Yu trying to deal with Miko not realizing that people can hear the weird crap she listens to when she's studying, and neither of these characters are the strongest of the ensemble. The joke about Miko's weird listening habits is also just not terribly funny, though that might be because that my own ADHD has had me go to some truly strange and avant garde places in search of distracting sounds to play when I'm trying to focus.    The other two scenes are golden, though, and they show off a wide variety of Kaguya-sama's strengths. The “Read Receipts” sketch is a masterpiece of observational humor, mining Kaguya's technological naivety and featuring Miyuki in full-on petty-goblin mode. It's one of those bits where the show manages to generate horror movie levels of tension on behalf of these loveably awkward children and their inability to just have a normal conversation. We also get a lot of good Ai content, which is always a bonus.    The “Arm Wrestling” sketch is just as hilarious, mostly because it's one of those showcases that gets the whole cast in on a silly mess-around that allows the artists at A-1 Pictures to really strut their stuff. It would already have been funny to have Chika get so obsessed with putting on an arm- wrestling contest, but Kaguya-sama goes the extra mile by animating the ever-loving hell out of it all. I demand a raise specifically for whoever got to handle the cut where Miyuki's face nearly implodes against the fury of Kaguya's sweat-hands fury (we've all been there, girl, there's no shame in it).    Do you honestly need me to tell you that Kaguya-sama's third season is mandatory viewing for this spring? Of course not. It's proven itself time and time again. Still, in case it needs to be said: Yes, the show is great, and you should absolutely watch it. Duh-doy, Britta.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               There really is nothing else quite like Kaguya-sama is there? Even as a self-proclaimed connoisseur of romcoms, it's hard to think of another series that managed to take such a simple premise and spin it into one of the most infectiously hilarious – and consistent – anime comedies of the past decade. But whatever alchemy is happening between the source material and the always exuberant adaptation team is still firing on all cylinders, and they've come back from season two without missing a step.    The series isn't resting on its laurels for this sequel either. It'd be easy to throw us back in with a classic Kaguya vs Shirogane battle, but instead they used the opportunity to demonstrate just how much good the previous season did for the show's weakest characters. Not only are Ishigami and Iino capable of carrying a skit almost entirely on their own, but they're able to do it in a way that capitalizes on all of  Ishigami's growth from the previous arc, going from the show's go-to punching bag to the kind of selfless idiot-genius that butters this show's bread. It's an unconventional way to welcome viewers back, but nonetheless promises to be just as hilarious as always.    From there, it's the same Kaguya-sama that steamrolled through our hearts in the previous seasons. The characters are still a blast, and the direction is as committed as ever to ridiculous, eclectic, and endlessly creative visual gags to sell every joke. It's not doing anything particularly new for the series, but that's a “don't mess with perfection” situation if ever there was one. I can attest to having a stupid smile plastered on my face across the entire premiere, and I busted out laughing as these kids tried to Death Note their way through being left on read, or when an homage to the soundtrack of Over The Top started playing during their arm-wrestling tournament. It's the kind of layered, high-effort joke that sets this show apart from the rest of its subgenre, and it's just so nice to have it back.    If you've missed this runaway train of a show, there probably aren't enough creatively directed romantic mind games in the world to convince you at this point. But if you're already a fan who was just worried the magic might have run out after all this time, you've got nothing to worry about.

Community score: 4.6              What is this?   Kaguya Shinomiya and Miyuki Shirogane are two geniuses who stand atop their prestigious academy's student council, making them the elite among elite. But it's lonely at the top and each has fallen for the other. There's just one huge problem standing in the way of lovey-dovey bliss—they're both too prideful to be the first to confess their romantic feelings and thus become the “loser” in the competition of love.    Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic is the latest entry in the television anime based on Aka Akasaka's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                I can't believe that in one day, two of my favorite romances had new seasons start! Premiere season is tough, but days like this make it worth it. Kaguya-sama: Love is War has returned for a third season, picking right back where the previous season left off, and boy, am I glad to see these kids with all their weird little quirks and foibles again.    I wasn't totally sold on Miko Iino by the end of the previous season, unsure of where she would fit into the group dynamic with rigid prudishness as her primary character trait. So of course, the episode leads with a skit between her and Ishigami, who once upon a time was one of the worst characters but is now one of the best. Miko's strange listening habits, and Ishigami's attempt at taking the fall for her, made her feel more like a little weirdo, and by now, a bit of weirdness is basically a requirement to be a student council member.    This is important because there's a playfulness inherent to Kaguya-sama that Iino's rigidity seemed antithetical to, but ended up on full display for the rest of the episode. Teenagers aren't my area of expertise, but they're still kids, and kids need to play! They need to be awkward and obsess over things like read receipts on messaging apps and boast and set up arm-wrestling tournaments instead of doing their actual work. Their personalities are exaggerated and caricatured, but few comedies capture those special moments where you get a strange idea and just keep going with it.    That playfulness extends to the visual presentation as well. The animation in this season has so far been fairly middle of the road, and thus I haven't commented on it much, but Kaguya-sama has some of the best goddamn direction and animation in the medium. Mamoru Hatakeyama and his team almost always manage to elevate the manga's punchlines into something special, and they held nothing back this episode. From the camel wandering around in the background as Iino studies, to Shirogane's shifting body language as he realizes he has the upper hand on Kaguya over the phone, to making the picture quality look like a VHS transfer – every frame has something joyful and unexpected. Big gags and subtle expressions alike have been animated with equal levels of care.    If you haven't watched Kaguya-sama: Love is War yet… why not? It's seriously one of the best anime comedies ever made. Why deprive yourself?       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               After having watched two full seasons, it's become perfectly clear that Kaguya-sama isn't for me (except in the rare cases where it is). Being mostly a series of short gags—usually involving instant karma as one of the student council members attempts to assert dominance over the others in some way—means that there's not much to further develop the characters or progress the love story between Shinomiya and Shirogane. The episodes of the series I most enjoy tend to be the final few of the season where meaningful things happen and there is real drama and tangible stakes. This season premiere was most certainly not one of those episodes.    Now, that's not to say I don't find the humor of the show funny in its own right. From Ishigami futilely trying to stop Iino from embarrassing herself to Shinomiya's ignorance about the differences between email and texting, there are a ton of great gags in this episode. The final self-contained story about the arm wrestling tournament takes things to a whole other level—especially with its post-credits scene showing that Fujiwara was just talking trash the whole time and couldn't win without cheating.    But what takes all these gags to the next level is the animation that merges what's really going on with what the characters are thinking to create something as funny as it is surreal. From the large camel making noises in Iino's ear to the mountain of bodybuilders supporting Shinomiya, it's all but impossible not to laugh.    So while Kaguya-sama isn't my cup of tea in general, I wouldn't say that this is a bad episode. In fact, it is pretty much the epitome of what Kaguya-sama is at its essence. If you ever need a laugh, Kaguya-sama is eager to deliver—just don't expect anything more.       James Beckett  Rating:               One of the “benefits” of being a teacher is getting to essentially serve as a kind of covert anthropologist that specializes in that most elusive and influential of species: The modern teenager. I'm like Jane Goodall; I live among them, in their native environment, and since they give absolutely zero shits about what I think, I have free reign to study the peculiar social rituals and developmental adaptations that these hormonal and aggressive pack animals undergo. As such, I feel like I can say, with legitimately authoritative expertise, that one of the things that makes Kaguya-sama: Love is War such a smashing success is how well it understands the interior lives of teenagers. Specifically, it has a comprehensive understanding of all the ridiculously dumb shit that teenagers will do to and with one another when left to their own devices. More importantly, it gets that all of this inane tomfoolery, no matter how stupid, will feel to a teenager like the most earth-shatteringly consequential events that will ever occur in their lifetimes.

The animation in this season has so far been fairly middle of the road, and thus I haven't commented on it much, but Kaguya-sama has some of the best goddamn direction and animation in the medium. Mamoru Hatakeyama and his team almost always manage to elevate the manga's punchlines into something special, and they held nothing back this episode. From the camel wandering around in the background as Iino studies, to Shirogane's shifting body language as he realizes he has the upper hand on Kaguya over the phone, to making the picture quality look like a VHS transfer – every frame has something joyful and unexpected. Big gags and subtle expressions alike have been animated with equal levels of care.    If you haven't watched Kaguya-sama: Love is War yet… why not? It's seriously one of the best anime comedies ever made. Why deprive yourself?       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               After having watched two full seasons, it's become perfectly clear that Kaguya-sama isn't for me (except in the rare cases where it is). Being mostly a series of short gags—usually involving instant karma as one of the student council members attempts to assert dominance over the others in some way—means that there's not much to further develop the characters or progress the love story between Shinomiya and Shirogane. The episodes of the series I most enjoy tend to be the final few of the season where meaningful things happen and there is real drama and tangible stakes. This season premiere was most certainly not one of those episodes.    Now, that's not to say I don't find the humor of the show funny in its own right. From Ishigami futilely trying to stop Iino from embarrassing herself to Shinomiya's ignorance about the differences between email and texting, there are a ton of great gags in this episode. The final self-contained story about the arm wrestling tournament takes things to a whole other level—especially with its post-credits scene showing that Fujiwara was just talking trash the whole time and couldn't win without cheating.    But what takes all these gags to the next level is the animation that merges what's really going on with what the characters are thinking to create something as funny as it is surreal. From the large camel making noises in Iino's ear to the mountain of bodybuilders supporting Shinomiya, it's all but impossible not to laugh.    So while Kaguya-sama isn't my cup of tea in general, I wouldn't say that this is a bad episode. In fact, it is pretty much the epitome of what Kaguya-sama is at its essence. If you ever need a laugh, Kaguya-sama is eager to deliver—just don't expect anything more.       James Beckett  Rating:               One of the “benefits” of being a teacher is getting to essentially serve as a kind of covert anthropologist that specializes in that most elusive and influential of species: The modern teenager. I'm like Jane Goodall; I live among them, in their native environment, and since they give absolutely zero shits about what I think, I have free reign to study the peculiar social rituals and developmental adaptations that these hormonal and aggressive pack animals undergo. As such, I feel like I can say, with legitimately authoritative expertise, that one of the things that makes Kaguya-sama: Love is War such a smashing success is how well it understands the interior lives of teenagers. Specifically, it has a comprehensive understanding of all the ridiculously dumb shit that teenagers will do to and with one another when left to their own devices. More importantly, it gets that all of this inane tomfoolery, no matter how stupid, will feel to a teenager like the most earth-shatteringly consequential events that will ever occur in their lifetimes.    Kaguya-sama: Love is War –Ultra Romantic– is essentially more of the same, in that regard. The goofy kids of Shuchiin Academy's student council spend their days getting into the most ridiculous of shenanigans, while Kaguya and Miyuki sloooooooowly progress along their romantic destinies with one another. “More of the same” can come across as a backhanded compliment, but that couldn't be further from the truth in the case of an anime like Kaguya-sama, considering that the “same” in question happens to be some of the most consistently hilarious and expertly animated comedy in the business.    Each of the three sketches in this premiere does what Kaguya-sama does best, in that they take painfully relatable, everyday scenarios and crank the intensity so far past the eleven mark that the the dial may as well be ripped clean off. The opening sketch is perhaps the weakest of the three, since it focuses on Yu trying to deal with Miko not realizing that people can hear the weird crap she listens to when she's studying, and neither of these characters are the strongest of the ensemble. The joke about Miko's weird listening habits is also just not terribly funny, though that might be because that my own ADHD has had me go to some truly strange and avant garde places in search of distracting sounds to play when I'm trying to focus.    The other two scenes are golden, though, and they show off a wide variety of Kaguya-sama's strengths. The “Read Receipts” sketch is a masterpiece of observational humor, mining Kaguya's technological naivety and featuring Miyuki in full-on petty-goblin mode. It's one of those bits where the show manages to generate horror movie levels of tension on behalf of these loveably awkward children and their inability to just have a normal conversation. We also get a lot of good Ai content, which is always a bonus.    The “Arm Wrestling” sketch is just as hilarious, mostly because it's one of those showcases that gets the whole cast in on a silly mess-around that allows the artists at A-1 Pictures to really strut their stuff. It would already have been funny to have Chika get so obsessed with putting on an arm- wrestling contest, but Kaguya-sama goes the extra mile by animating the ever-loving hell out of it all. I demand a raise specifically for whoever got to handle the cut where Miyuki's face nearly implodes against the fury of Kaguya's sweat-hands fury (we've all been there, girl, there's no shame in it).    Do you honestly need me to tell you that Kaguya-sama's third season is mandatory viewing for this spring? Of course not. It's proven itself time and time again. Still, in case it needs to be said: Yes, the show is great, and you should absolutely watch it. Duh-doy, Britta.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               There really is nothing else quite like Kaguya-sama is there? Even as a self-proclaimed connoisseur of romcoms, it's hard to think of another series that managed to take such a simple premise and spin it into one of the most infectiously hilarious – and consistent – anime comedies of the past decade. But whatever alchemy is happening between the source material and the always exuberant adaptation team is still firing on all cylinders, and they've come back from season two without missing a step.    The series isn't resting on its laurels for this sequel either. It'd be easy to throw us back in with a classic Kaguya vs Shirogane battle, but instead they used the opportunity to demonstrate just how much good the previous season did for the show's weakest characters. Not only are Ishigami and Iino capable of carrying a skit almost entirely on their own, but they're able to do it in a way that capitalizes on all of  Ishigami's growth from the previous arc, going from the show's go-to punching bag to the kind of selfless idiot-genius that butters this show's bread. It's an unconventional way to welcome viewers back, but nonetheless promises to be just as hilarious as always.    From there, it's the same Kaguya-sama that steamrolled through our hearts in the previous seasons. The characters are still a blast, and the direction is as committed as ever to ridiculous, eclectic, and endlessly creative visual gags to sell every joke. It's not doing anything particularly new for the series, but that's a “don't mess with perfection” situation if ever there was one. I can attest to having a stupid smile plastered on my face across the entire premiere, and I busted out laughing as these kids tried to Death Note their way through being left on read, or when an homage to the soundtrack of Over The Top started playing during their arm-wrestling tournament. It's the kind of layered, high-effort joke that sets this show apart from the rest of its subgenre, and it's just so nice to have it back.    If you've missed this runaway train of a show, there probably aren't enough creatively directed romantic mind games in the world to convince you at this point. But if you're already a fan who was just worried the magic might have run out after all this time, you've got nothing to worry about.

Community score: 4.6              What is this?   Kaguya Shinomiya and Miyuki Shirogane are two geniuses who stand atop their prestigious academy's student council, making them the elite among elite. But it's lonely at the top and each has fallen for the other. There's just one huge problem standing in the way of lovey-dovey bliss—they're both too prideful to be the first to confess their romantic feelings and thus become the “loser” in the competition of love.    Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic is the latest entry in the television anime based on Aka Akasaka's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                I can't believe that in one day, two of my favorite romances had new seasons start! Premiere season is tough, but days like this make it worth it. Kaguya-sama: Love is War has returned for a third season, picking right back where the previous season left off, and boy, am I glad to see these kids with all their weird little quirks and foibles again.    I wasn't totally sold on Miko Iino by the end of the previous season, unsure of where she would fit into the group dynamic with rigid prudishness as her primary character trait. So of course, the episode leads with a skit between her and Ishigami, who once upon a time was one of the worst characters but is now one of the best. Miko's strange listening habits, and Ishigami's attempt at taking the fall for her, made her feel more like a little weirdo, and by now, a bit of weirdness is basically a requirement to be a student council member.    This is important because there's a playfulness inherent to Kaguya-sama that Iino's rigidity seemed antithetical to, but ended up on full display for the rest of the episode. Teenagers aren't my area of expertise, but they're still kids, and kids need to play! They need to be awkward and obsess over things like read receipts on messaging apps and boast and set up arm-wrestling tournaments instead of doing their actual work. Their personalities are exaggerated and caricatured, but few comedies capture those special moments where you get a strange idea and just keep going with it.

Community score: 4.4            I'd hardly call it the comeback of the century or anything, but it still seems pretty impressive how far the Arifureta anime has come since its incredibly iffy inception. After multiple studio switchovers and a first-season opening that seemed to misrepresent the tonal appeal of the series, here we've arrived at the wrap party for its second season, finishing in a mostly satisfying, effective way. While it's fine for me, I guess I mostly find myself hoping this has worked well for fans of the original work, ending up with a solid adaptation that supplements their appreciation for the novel after all. This isn't even the actual end for Arifureta either, as we've already got confirmation that there's an OVA coming later this year. Which makes sense, given that the story is hardly over by the point of this season finale. But much like Hajime's growth from a 'commonplace' weakling to an overpowered edgelord badass, the anime's glow-up from the murky, shambling mess it originally was into a perfectly serviceable little fantasy cartoon makes for an appreciable journey all its own.    Simply taking stock of the state of the product is appropriate enough at this stopping point, since so much of this season finale similarly spends its time consolidating the leftover pieces of the big blowout of the last few episodes. The biggest dangling thread is almost certainly the fate of Kaori, but as I was last week, the storyline is so assured that she'll be 'fine' that the characters straight-up turn to the camera and tell us that before sending Hajime over on a few other personal diversions. Instead, the actual biggest return on an emotional investment comes from Ai-Chan-Sensei, which probably isn't that surprising to anyone who's been paying attention through this arc, but is still nice to see just for a sense of completion.    Part of Ai-Sensei's focus here is necessarily on her processing the guilt over the people killed around and as a result of her in this battle. So she's got to come to terms with the church full of people she leveled, or the fact that Hiyama's demise, played somewhat flippantly as it occurred last episode, was still an instance of one of her students dying, so she's a bit tore up by that as well. What's nice here is that Hajime's contribution to talking Sensei through these feelings isn't to insist on his personal method of burying any trauma beneath a badass facade, but instead advising her to hold onto the weight and importance of that guilt. The association he asks for on it could come off like Hajime basically asking Sensei to perform emotional labor for him, but to hear him tell it, his experiences thus far have left him unsure if he even can still experience those human extremes of emotions anymore. Of course, our boy's actions regarding his teammates, friends, and the likes of Myu indicate that he's handling things more healthily than he's giving himself credit for, but the concern being there at all still rings true, and fits with Hajime's desire to have a 'way back' for himself, both in terms of physically returning to Japan and living therein apart from his current vengeful disposition.    It's that long-term mission statement I've always appreciated about Arifureta, a power-fantasy makeover isekai that nonetheless sets its hero's ultimate goal of getting back to his original life after all. And given Sensei's long-standing willingness to shoulder these kinds of burdens for all her students, it fits, and continues the unique reciprocal relationship between her and Hajime. Where her presence and faith in him has comforted Hajime in the background of his struggles so far, he gets to return the favor here by turning his back on her only to allow her to cry into it in the event of being overwhelmed by her own struggles. That alone speaks to Hajime not being as callous as he'd like everyone to think he is. How moe.    I'm glad this closer can provide that kind of emotional closure, as the rest is more mechanical plot stuff getting sorted out for future stories. Kaori does indeed survive, with the outlandish side-effect of having her soul moved into the defeated Noint's body in the process, in a power-up acquisition so out there I absolutely didn't see it coming from this story. They even expressly detail that the move was entirely Kaori's desire and her old body is fine in stasis and ready for her to migrate back to once everything's taken care of. I kind of appreciate how buck-wild this is just as an expression of the lengths Kaori is now willing to go to in service of Hajime's adventuring harem. Something to be said for conviction, I suppose, and the animation here does a decent job of communicating it's still Kaori through facial expressions and the like, so it mostly works.    The other big shift that happens at this stage in the story comes from Hajime finally bringing everyone else up on that whole ""The gods are evil jerks"" thing, and a huge collection of the classmate crew resultantly deciding to tag along with him on the next leg of his adventures. I'm rather more apprehensive about this development, least of all because of the crowd factor involved (how are they all going to fit in the Hummvee?!), even if I can see the reasoning for it within the storytelling. For one thing, most of these people are going to have way more basis to interact with Eri the next time she pops up as a dedicated villain. Plus it's another point that acts with Hajime's arc from his original forced ousting from the group. Yes there's something a bit obvious about him suddenly finding that everyone thinks he is cool and wants to be his friend, but so long as the story isn't leaning too hard on Hajime reveling in vengeful vindication over the turnaround and is instead simply acting adorably tsundere over the whole affair, I think it's fine. I guess we'll just have to wait until that OVA (and who knows what other anime extensions) to see how this setup is actually going to shake out.    To the end, Arifureta is still Arifureta, so even among all its emotional satisfaction and interesting status-quo shakeups, this finale still can't finish without, say, a scene where all of Hajime's wives feed him or Tio, as she always does, returning to the bit about dragon sodomy. ""I've never been so uncomfortable"" indeed. But while I don't know if 'respectable' is a term I'd associate with all of that, it still all feels assured enough. I left the first season of Arifureta with a surprising amount of hope for its future, and I now leave the second season reasonably satisfied with the fulfillment of that hope. It's hardly the ""World's Strongest"", but I don't think there's any shame in going from Commonplace to Decently Entertaining.

Community score: 4.4            I'd hardly call it the comeback of the century or anything, but it still seems pretty impressive how far the Arifureta anime has come since its incredibly iffy inception. After multiple studio switchovers and a first-season opening that seemed to misrepresent the tonal appeal of the series, here we've arrived at the wrap party for its second season, finishing in a mostly satisfying, effective way. While it's fine for me, I guess I mostly find myself hoping this has worked well for fans of the original work, ending up with a solid adaptation that supplements their appreciation for the novel after all. This isn't even the actual end for Arifureta either, as we've already got confirmation that there's an OVA coming later this year. Which makes sense, given that the story is hardly over by the point of this season finale. But much like Hajime's growth from a 'commonplace' weakling to an overpowered edgelord badass, the anime's glow-up from the murky, shambling mess it originally was into a perfectly serviceable little fantasy cartoon makes for an appreciable journey all its own.    Simply taking stock of the state of the product is appropriate enough at this stopping point, since so much of this season finale similarly spends its time consolidating the leftover pieces of the big blowout of the last few episodes. The biggest dangling thread is almost certainly the fate of Kaori, but as I was last week, the storyline is so assured that she'll be 'fine' that the characters straight-up turn to the camera and tell us that before sending Hajime over on a few other personal diversions. Instead, the actual biggest return on an emotional investment comes from Ai-Chan-Sensei, which probably isn't that surprising to anyone who's been paying attention through this arc, but is still nice to see just for a sense of completion.    Part of Ai-Sensei's focus here is necessarily on her processing the guilt over the people killed around and as a result of her in this battle. So she's got to come to terms with the church full of people she leveled, or the fact that Hiyama's demise, played somewhat flippantly as it occurred last episode, was still an instance of one of her students dying, so she's a bit tore up by that as well. What's nice here is that Hajime's contribution to talking Sensei through these feelings isn't to insist on his personal method of burying any trauma beneath a badass facade, but instead advising her to hold onto the weight and importance of that guilt. The association he asks for on it could come off like Hajime basically asking Sensei to perform emotional labor for him, but to hear him tell it, his experiences thus far have left him unsure if he even can still experience those human extremes of emotions anymore. Of course, our boy's actions regarding his teammates, friends, and the likes of Myu indicate that he's handling things more healthily than he's giving himself credit for, but the concern being there at all still rings true, and fits with Hajime's desire to have a 'way back' for himself, both in terms of physically returning to Japan and living therein apart from his current vengeful disposition.    It's that long-term mission statement I've always appreciated about Arifureta, a power-fantasy makeover isekai that nonetheless sets its hero's ultimate goal of getting back to his original life after all. And given Sensei's long-standing willingness to shoulder these kinds of burdens for all her students, it fits, and continues the unique reciprocal relationship between her and Hajime. Where her presence and faith in him has comforted Hajime in the background of his struggles so far, he gets to return the favor here by turning his back on her only to allow her to cry into it in the event of being overwhelmed by her own struggles. That alone speaks to Hajime not being as callous as he'd like everyone to think he is. How moe.    I'm glad this closer can provide that kind of emotional closure, as the rest is more mechanical plot stuff getting sorted out for future stories. Kaori does indeed survive, with the outlandish side-effect of having her soul moved into the defeated Noint's body in the process, in a power-up acquisition so out there I absolutely didn't see it coming from this story. They even expressly detail that the move was entirely Kaori's desire and her old body is fine in stasis and ready for her to migrate back to once everything's taken care of. I kind of appreciate how buck-wild this is just as an expression of the lengths Kaori is now willing to go to in service of Hajime's adventuring harem. Something to be said for conviction, I suppose, and the animation here does a decent job of communicating it's still Kaori through facial expressions and the like, so it mostly works.    The other big shift that happens at this stage in the story comes from Hajime finally bringing everyone else up on that whole ""The gods are evil jerks"" thing, and a huge collection of the classmate crew resultantly deciding to tag along with him on the next leg of his adventures. I'm rather more apprehensive about this development, least of all because of the crowd factor involved (how are they all going to fit in the Hummvee?!), even if I can see the reasoning for it within the storytelling. For one thing, most of these people are going to have way more basis to interact with Eri the next time she pops up as a dedicated villain. Plus it's another point that acts with Hajime's arc from his original forced ousting from the group. Yes there's something a bit obvious about him suddenly finding that everyone thinks he is cool and wants to be his friend, but so long as the story isn't leaning too hard on Hajime reveling in vengeful vindication over the turnaround and is instead simply acting adorably tsundere over the whole affair, I think it's fine. I guess we'll just have to wait until that OVA (and who knows what other anime extensions) to see how this setup is actually going to shake out.    To the end, Arifureta is still Arifureta, so even among all its emotional satisfaction and interesting status-quo shakeups, this finale still can't finish without, say, a scene where all of Hajime's wives feed him or Tio, as she always does, returning to the bit about dragon sodomy. ""I've never been so uncomfortable"" indeed. But while I don't know if 'respectable' is a term I'd associate with all of that, it still all feels assured enough. I left the first season of Arifureta with a surprising amount of hope for its future, and I now leave the second season reasonably satisfied with the fulfillment of that hope. It's hardly the ""World's Strongest"", but I don't think there's any shame in going from Commonplace to Decently Entertaining.

Community score: 3.7            Time to get ready to play ball, which is coincidentally the title of Tribe Nine's grand slam of a finale (that is, “PLAY BALL” in all caps) to what I can only assume will be a one cour project as, spoiler alert: it has very little baseball, actually. But there's lots and lots of feelings.    Ojiro goes full mask off (as in, he literally takes off his mask) this week, taking on the Minato Tribe in a face-to-face battle that's full of twists and turns, including a good bit of betrayal. I love a last-minute heel turn (with GUNS!), even if it's crammed into twenty-four minutes of not the best paced scripting. But hey: that banger soundtrack though, am I right?    There is so much crammed into this episode: there's flashbacks and XB fights (and even more almost XB fights) and character growth and character deconstruction. It's all a lot, and it's not necessarily well-structured. It is fairly interesting, but maybe, in another series it would be well-executed and not feel like Tribe Nine was trying to tie up a bunch of loose ends. It ultimately feels messy, and when the resolution comes it's expected, which is really all I can say.    And since we're here, let's talk about resolutions.    I can easily say I'll be leaving the series with a solid sense of closure and a bit of optimism, which is nice, but unexpected. I genuinely thought I'd be leaving with some sort of “now go play the mobile game” bait, but instead we get an ending that feels about as good as you can expect from a show that's gone through some very high highs and extremely low lows like Tribe Nine has, cliffhangers included.    And goodness me, has this show gone through it over the past few weeks.    But where the show lands -and actually sticks the landing- is on the notion of fun. Part of why XB is so engaging for the late Shun Kamiya, and now, for Haru, is because it's a game. XB thrives when that's at the core: when it becomes a knock down, drag out battle, the game loses it's enjoyment. And it's actually this return to fun by Haru -who literally throws hands this episode- that actually kind of had me smiling in the end because say what you will, this show stays the course with its overall message, roiling the world of XB and Neo Tokyo by Game Over-ing some characters. (Or are they alive? Here's the thing, I genuinely don't know.)    Tribe Nine is a series that I don't regret spending time with, if only because of my insatiable desire to devour everything Kazutaka Kodaka lays his hands on. I just kind of can't help myself: every since I played Danganronpa in grad school, I've been very into everything he makes. Tribe Nine is the fast food of anime. It is is the 7-11 pizza slice of the animation world. Will it do in a pinch? Yeah, of course, but is it exactly what I wanted?    No, not at all.    There was a lot of mixed feelings as the credits rolled: I tried to reflect on what drew me to this show outside of my desire to kin my personality into every single Danganronpa character. Thinking back, it was a desire to see  a sports anime that was fun, and to a degree Tribe Nine was, at least initially. That said, I know there was an audience for this series, and I really hope that if you're that audience, you enjoyed it. Truth be told, that's always my wish for shows that I'm reviewing, whether or not I like them in the end: I hope that they brought enjoyment to as many people as possible. I'm a bit on both sides of the fence with my enjoyment, but honestly I can safely conclude this review saying that this anime is perfectly okay, and that's okay in and of itself. Every season needs its C-minus grade anime, and Tribe Nine?    Well, it's a grand slam in that category.

The world of Japanese anime and manga features numerous famous and mainstream romance and drama titles, such as the shojo classic Fruits Basket starring the lovers Tohru and Kyo, along with shows such as Maid-Sama! and many others. However, many other solid romances fall right under the radar, including the underrated After the Rain.  This short but sweet manga/anime franchise, created by Jun Mayuzuki, tells the tale of the kind-hearted kuudere heroine Akira Tachibana and her one-sided crush on her manager at work, a single father named Masami Kondo. What follows is not an awkward romance between a teenager and a middle-aged man, but rather a tale of healing and self-acceptance told in the framework of a would-be romance. RELATED: Komi Can't Communicate & Other Great High School Anime Streaming on Netflix          The Tale Of Healing In After The Rain                At first glance, After the Rain is a traditional romance story that could potentially be problematic given that the heroine Akira is 17 years old and Mr. Kondo is 45 -- old enough to be Akira's father. Many anime fans know that various franchises have pushed things with iffy romances before, but fortunately, After the Rain has much more finesse than that. Akira nurses a strong crush on Mr. Kondo and expresses it more than once, but as a smart and responsible man, Mr. Kondo keeps Akira at arm's length and treats her as a platonic friend. This means that the story is less about conventional romance and more about healing the heart. There are more routes for a romance story to take than a predictable ""happily ever after"" riding into the sunset.  After the Rain uses its would-be romance story as the framework for something just as sweet and inspiring as a wholesome romance -- that being a story of healing and self-acceptance. In many cases, a romance isn't just about longing and lust but also about how love can potentially soothe a wounded heart and help a person come to terms with their own problems. This isn't always the case, but when things go right, a romance can heal and strengthen both people in the relationship, whether or not they start going steady or eventually marry. This is exactly the case with After the Rain. In this story, Akira Tachibana is passionate about running track, but a recent leg injury sidelined her, and she feels miserable about her everyday life as a high school student missing out on track meets. She busies herself by working at a restaurant named Garden, where she soon develops a crush on her kind-hearted manager, who gives off a paternal and nurturing vibe. Most likely, this is what drew Akira to him, as her heart needed healing and Mr. Kondo's personality is all about generosity and caring for others.  In the end, the two of them don't get together, but they didn't have to. Akira's leg and heart both recover, and soon after turning 18, she resumes running track and finds happiness once again. Meanwhile, Akira's youthful innocence and energy inspire Mr. Kondo to reignite his passion for literature and writing, which he had abandoned years ago. On his platonic dates with Akira, he often encouraged her to embrace literature and learning, but he benefited from this almost as much as Akira did and was much happier for it. RELATED: The Best Comedy High School Anime Series You Can Watch Right Now          How After The Rain Portrays A Restrained Romance                To begin with, After the Rain shows restraint by not showing any explicit scenes between Akira and Mr. Kondo -- in fact, it's highly unlikely that any such scenes took place at all, whether shown on-screen or not. This may be a romantic seinen manga/anime franchise, but the author saw no need to throw in some fan service just for the sake of it. Doing so would sabotage After the Rain's wholesome message about healing and might stir up unwanted controversy as well. It's clear that Akira's crush on Mr. Kondo is strong and genuine, especially when Akira directly tells Mr. Kondo about it. All the same, Mr. Kondo and the narrative alike hold back, knowing that Akira is off-limits to a man his age. Instead, Mr. Kondo acts more like a role model and parental figure for Akira. Akira is the only one with a crush, and this is largely portrayed as the kind of innocent crush schoolgirls get on their handsome, kind-hearted male teachers.  These harmless crushes don't lead to a serious romance, but they might inspire the amorous character to push themselves harder to live up to their crush's expectations of them, growing as a person in the process. This is the route After the Rain follows, and in turn, any fan of the series can follow its example and better themselves with the power of self-acceptance and healing.

14-04-2022,animation,1,0,https://www.cbr.com/after-the-rain-anime-happy-ending-no-couple/,After the Rain’s Unrealized Love Story Still Has a Happy Ending,"      Home Anime After the Rain Is a Love Story With a Happy Ending, Despite Its Lack of a Main ‘Couple’    After the Rain Is a Love Story With a Happy Ending, Despite Its Lack of a Main ‘Couple’  By Louis Kemner Published 18 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   After the Rain doesn't have a steamy romantic conclusion, but it didn't need one.                 The world of Japanese anime and manga features numerous famous and mainstream romance and drama titles, such as the shojo classic Fruits Basket starring the lovers Tohru and Kyo, along with shows such as Maid-Sama! and many others. However, many other solid romances fall right under the radar, including the underrated After the Rain.  This short but sweet manga/anime franchise, created by Jun Mayuzuki, tells the tale of the kind-hearted kuudere heroine Akira Tachibana and her one-sided crush on her manager at work, a single father named Masami Kondo. What follows is not an awkward romance between a teenager and a middle-aged man, but rather a tale of healing and self-acceptance told in the framework of a would-be romance. RELATED: Komi Can't Communicate & Other Great High School Anime Streaming on Netflix          The Tale Of Healing In After The Rain                At first glance, After the Rain is a traditional romance story that could potentially be problematic given that the heroine Akira is 17 years old and Mr. Kondo is 45 -- old enough to be Akira's father. Many anime fans know that various franchises have pushed things with iffy romances before, but fortunately, After the Rain has much more finesse than that. Akira nurses a strong crush on Mr. Kondo and expresses it more than once, but as a smart and responsible man, Mr. Kondo keeps Akira at arm's length and treats her as a platonic friend. This means that the story is less about conventional romance and more about healing the heart. There are more routes for a romance story to take than a predictable ""happily ever after"" riding into the sunset.  After the Rain uses its would-be romance story as the framework for something just as sweet and inspiring as a wholesome romance -- that being a story of healing and self-acceptance. In many cases, a romance isn't just about longing and lust but also about how love can potentially soothe a wounded heart and help a person come to terms with their own problems. This isn't always the case, but when things go right, a romance can heal and strengthen both people in the relationship, whether or not they start going steady or eventually marry. This is exactly the case with After the Rain. In this story, Akira Tachibana is passionate about running track, but a recent leg injury sidelined her, and she feels miserable about her everyday life as a high school student missing out on track meets. She busies herself by working at a restaurant named Garden, where she soon develops a crush on her kind-hearted manager, who gives off a paternal and nurturing vibe. Most likely, this is what drew Akira to him, as her heart needed healing and Mr. Kondo's personality is all about generosity and caring for others.  In the end, the two of them don't get together, but they didn't have to. Akira's leg and heart both recover, and soon after turning 18, she resumes running track and finds happiness once again. Meanwhile, Akira's youthful innocence and energy inspire Mr. Kondo to reignite his passion for literature and writing, which he had abandoned years ago. On his platonic dates with Akira, he often encouraged her to embrace literature and learning, but he benefited from this almost as much as Akira did and was much happier for it. RELATED: The Best Comedy High School Anime Series You Can Watch Right Now          How After The Rain Portrays A Restrained Romance                To begin with, After the Rain shows restraint by not showing any explicit scenes between Akira and Mr. Kondo -- in fact, it's highly unlikely that any such scenes took place at all, whether shown on-screen or not. This may be a romantic seinen manga/anime franchise, but the author saw no need to throw in some fan service just for the sake of it. Doing so would sabotage After the Rain's wholesome message about healing and might stir up unwanted controversy as well. It's clear that Akira's crush on Mr. Kondo is strong and genuine, especially when Akira directly tells Mr. Kondo about it. All the same, Mr. Kondo and the narrative alike hold back, knowing that Akira is off-limits to a man his age. Instead, Mr. Kondo acts more like a role model and parental figure for Akira. Akira is the only one with a crush, and this is largely portrayed as the kind of innocent crush schoolgirls get on their handsome, kind-hearted male teachers.  These harmless crushes don't lead to a serious romance, but they might inspire the amorous character to push themselves harder to live up to their crush's expectations of them, growing as a person in the process. This is the route After the Rain follows, and in turn, any fan of the series can follow its example and better themselves with the power of self-acceptance and healing.

But Oshiro doesn't like Raido very much.                  The following contains spoilers for Episode 2 of Aharen-San is Indecipherable, ""Are We Being Followed?"", now streaming on Crunchyroll.   Aharen-San is Indecipherable is a brand-new rom-com anime series in the Spring 2022 anime season, starring the petite Aharen Rain and her platonic male friend and classmate Raido. They befriended one another in Episode 1 as neighbors in class, but now in Episode 2, another character joins Aharen's tiny social circle.  Oshiro is a timid girl who has always watched over Aharen like a protective mother -- a dutiful self-appointed guardian who fears big guys like Raido. In Episode 2, Oshigo makes her presence known to Raido, and when they confront one another, a misunderstanding ensues. Raido's new friendship with Aharen certainly comes with its fair share of baggage. RELATED: How My Dress-Up Darling's Marin and Gojo Built Anime's Healthiest Friendship                In Episode 2 of Aharen-San, Raido and Aharen continue to slowly and sweetly develop their budding friendship, and already, Aharen makes it clear that Raido is special to her. Aharen is a shy kuudere-type character who feels strong affection for others but has trouble expressing it, but all the same, her actions often speak louder than words. For now, Raido is too dense to realize how much Aharen cares for him, but he might pick up on that eventually. Meanwhile, another girl, Oshiro, picks up on it immediately. She can tell that Aharen and Raido are spending an awful lot of time together lately, so she must do something.  In Episode 2, Oshiro constantly spies on Raido, and during lunch, Oshiro finally confronts him while taking Aharen's side. Oshiro explains that she has always watched over Aharen to protect her from scary people, and she believes that the rather brawny Raido is dangerous. Oshiro clearly means well, but both Raido and Aharen assure her that there's nothing to be worried about. Raido is a gentle giant who treats Aharen well, and in return, Aharen is deeply fond of him. However, Oshiro isn't entirely convinced until the end of the episode, when she watches Raido and Aharen walking home together from afar. Oshiro still has those protective feelings, but if she's watching them from far enough to require binoculars, she's also too far away to intervene if things go wrong. Evidently, Oshiro no longer sees Raido as a threat to Aharen's safety, and that's progress -- granted, not much, but progress all the same.  RELATED: Tokyo 24th Ward's Finale is Saved With the Power of Friendship                Oshiro's character arc is just beginning as of Episode 2 of Aharen-san is Indecipherble, but there are already some clues and hints as to what may be next for her and the rest of the cast. Characters like Oshiro don't easily give up on their defining character trait or attribute, even if these characters tone down their extreme behavior after their debut. Already, Oshiro trusts Raido a little more with Aharen, but it's unlikely that she will stop serving as Aharen's self-appointed guardian and mother hen anytime soon. She will likely keep this up, mainly for comic effect, but she might get more serious about it if other boys start hanging out with Aharen as well. Then Aharen might find herself explaining things all over again.  It's also possible that Oshiro may warm up to Raido and become his friend, although Aharen will probably always be number one in Oshiro's heart. Oshiro may decide that she's reluctant to have any boys around Aharen but that Raido can be the sole exception, and she might even trust him enough to have him share the duty of guarding Aharen. If so, that could strengthen Oshiro's and Raido's friendship, bonding over their mutual interest in Aharen. It also helps that Raido is a big and tough guy who could be intimidating if he wanted to, so Oshiro might value him as Aharen's best bodyguard from now on. Oshiro isn't big enough, strong enough or scary-looking enough to actually do much in Aharen's defense, so she can delegate that job to Raido to give herself some peace of mind. She certainly could use a break by now.

The following contains spoilers for Episode 1 of Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie, ""My Girlfriend is Super Cute,"" now streaming on Crunchyroll.   The spring 2022 anime season has introduced anime fans to many new and returning rom-com anime series, from the lovely Aharen-san is Indecipherable to familiar faces such as the shojo-style shonen Komi Can't Communicate and the romantic battle of wits of Kaguya-Sama: Love is War. Then there's Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie, another new series that rom-com fans are sure to enjoy.  In many regards, Shikimori is a conventional rom-com high school series like Horimiya, but even if it doesn't reinvent the wheel, its central pairing is unusual in a certain way that fans of TONIKAWA: Over the Moon For You are sure to recognize. In Shikimori, the main lovers are already in a solid relationship, so all conflict must be external, and already, Episode 1 proves that to be the case. RELATED: Aharen-San Episode 2 Showcases Aharen Raina's Sweet, Caring Side                Episode 1 of Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie goes to great lengths to establish the characters of Izumi and Shikimori, as well as their interpersonal dynamic, and it should all feel familiar to TONIKAWA fans. To begin with, Izumi is a gentle and caring male lead akin to Horimiya's Miyamura Izumi, who happens to have the same name as Shikimori's male lead. Both boys are noted for bucking the trend of being blunt and aggressive male leads, which can provide some much-needed respite from that archetype.  In a way, male leads like both Izumis and even Gojo Wakana are written for the ""female gaze,"" with them being ideal partners for girls who want a sensitive and affectionate partner rather than a bad boy. Gentle leads like Izumi won't appeal to every anime fan out there, but they help demonstrate that male leads are not all the same, and several anime seasons ago, TONIKAWA knew it too. Yuzaki Nasa, the male lead of TONIKAWA: Over the Moon For You, was a responsible, humble and generous boy who only cared about making his new bride, the mysterious Tsukasa, happy and comfortable. Some anime fans might find characters like Nasa and Izumi boring, but their fans will appreciate how generous and conflict-free these characters can be in their arcs, and it makes for an unusually stable central romance when compared to series such as Toradora! and Nisekoi.  Similarly, Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie and TONIKAWA both feature female co-leads who are ""stronger"" than the male lead by having more skills and a more proactive personality, and they are the ones who drive each scene and episode forward. These girls greatly appreciate their male partners for who they are, and this further stabilizes the relationship. So, if the main couple is frictionless, the conflict must come from somewhere else. RELATED: Aharen-San Episode 2 Showcases Aharen Raina's Sweet, Caring Side                Every story, even a gentle slice-of-life anime series, needs some form of conflict, as this is what drives a story and its characters forward in any genre or subgenre. In romances, the two main lovers may have any number of conflicts with one another, from unfaithfulness to a clash of personalities or simply disagreeing on how quickly their relationship should unfold, among other potential obstacles. Examples include the romance between Kyo and Tohru in Fruits Basket or the bickering main couple of Nisekoi, but Shikimori's main couple lacks conflict like that since they get along so well. If the anime doesn't want to bore its viewers, it can and should borrow from TONIKAWA's playbook.  TONIKAWA's main couple has zero friction, so the conflict was purely external, such as the main characters' apartment burning down in a freak accident and other characters testing or even doubting the validity of their marriage. To Nasa and Tsukasa, it was an ""us vs. the world"" conflict, and at this rate, Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie might do the same. After all, many of the students doubt whether Izumi really deserves a stellar girlfriend like Shikimori, and Shikimori and Izumi are slightly insecure about their respective roles in the relationship. If other characters take advantage of this while serving as antagonists, Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie will have all the conflict its viewers can handle. Challengers may soon appear, and Shikimori and Izumi must get ready to form a team to fend them off -- otherwise, their seemingly perfect relationship is doomed.

The following contains spoilers for Episode 1 of Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie, ""My Girlfriend is Super Cute,"" now streaming on Crunchyroll.   The spring 2022 anime season has introduced anime fans to many new and returning rom-com anime series, from the lovely Aharen-san is Indecipherable to familiar faces such as the shojo-style shonen Komi Can't Communicate and the romantic battle of wits of Kaguya-Sama: Love is War. Then there's Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie, another new series that rom-com fans are sure to enjoy.  In many regards, Shikimori is a conventional rom-com high school series like Horimiya, but even if it doesn't reinvent the wheel, its central pairing is unusual in a certain way that fans of TONIKAWA: Over the Moon For You are sure to recognize. In Shikimori, the main lovers are already in a solid relationship, so all conflict must be external, and already, Episode 1 proves that to be the case. RELATED: Aharen-San Episode 2 Showcases Aharen Raina's Sweet, Caring Side                Episode 1 of Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie goes to great lengths to establish the characters of Izumi and Shikimori, as well as their interpersonal dynamic, and it should all feel familiar to TONIKAWA fans. To begin with, Izumi is a gentle and caring male lead akin to Horimiya's Miyamura Izumi, who happens to have the same name as Shikimori's male lead. Both boys are noted for bucking the trend of being blunt and aggressive male leads, which can provide some much-needed respite from that archetype.  In a way, male leads like both Izumis and even Gojo Wakana are written for the ""female gaze,"" with them being ideal partners for girls who want a sensitive and affectionate partner rather than a bad boy. Gentle leads like Izumi won't appeal to every anime fan out there, but they help demonstrate that male leads are not all the same, and several anime seasons ago, TONIKAWA knew it too. Yuzaki Nasa, the male lead of TONIKAWA: Over the Moon For You, was a responsible, humble and generous boy who only cared about making his new bride, the mysterious Tsukasa, happy and comfortable. Some anime fans might find characters like Nasa and Izumi boring, but their fans will appreciate how generous and conflict-free these characters can be in their arcs, and it makes for an unusually stable central romance when compared to series such as Toradora! and Nisekoi.  Similarly, Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie and TONIKAWA both feature female co-leads who are ""stronger"" than the male lead by having more skills and a more proactive personality, and they are the ones who drive each scene and episode forward. These girls greatly appreciate their male partners for who they are, and this further stabilizes the relationship. So, if the main couple is frictionless, the conflict must come from somewhere else. RELATED: Aharen-San Episode 2 Showcases Aharen Raina's Sweet, Caring Side                Every story, even a gentle slice-of-life anime series, needs some form of conflict, as this is what drives a story and its characters forward in any genre or subgenre. In romances, the two main lovers may have any number of conflicts with one another, from unfaithfulness to a clash of personalities or simply disagreeing on how quickly their relationship should unfold, among other potential obstacles. Examples include the romance between Kyo and Tohru in Fruits Basket or the bickering main couple of Nisekoi, but Shikimori's main couple lacks conflict like that since they get along so well. If the anime doesn't want to bore its viewers, it can and should borrow from TONIKAWA's playbook.  TONIKAWA's main couple has zero friction, so the conflict was purely external, such as the main characters' apartment burning down in a freak accident and other characters testing or even doubting the validity of their marriage. To Nasa and Tsukasa, it was an ""us vs. the world"" conflict, and at this rate, Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie might do the same. After all, many of the students doubt whether Izumi really deserves a stellar girlfriend like Shikimori, and Shikimori and Izumi are slightly insecure about their respective roles in the relationship. If other characters take advantage of this while serving as antagonists, Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie will have all the conflict its viewers can handle. Challengers may soon appear, and Shikimori and Izumi must get ready to form a team to fend them off -- otherwise, their seemingly perfect relationship is doomed.

The following contains spoilers for Episode 1 of Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie, ""My Girlfriend is Super Cute,"" now streaming on Crunchyroll.   The spring 2022 anime season introduces a brand-new high school rom-com series titled Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie. This is a story of the gentle shonen lead Izumi and his popular, pink-haired girlfriend Shikimori, who can do anything she sets her mind to. Izumi appears happy in the relationship in Episode 1, but he's got a little problem.  Izumi is hopelessly clumsy, to the point his parents warn him about every hazard one could think of when walking to school. All throughout the premiere, Shikimori must defend her accident-prone boyfriend from harm, putting an amusing twist on the shojo stereotype of a clumsy female lead who literally falls into her male lover's arms. The tables have been turned. RELATED: Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie: Everything to Know Before the Anime Starts                The premiere episode of Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie introduces Izumi first, quickly establishing him as a kind but helpless boy who would get eaten alive if it weren't for his girlfriend Shikimori. Even Izumi's parents count on her to protect their son, making it clear this situation is nothing new. It seems, he has always been clumsy and vulnerable, so gaining Shikimori as his girlfriend is a serious boon.  This also establishes the main couple's power dynamic, with Shikimori being the powerful one and Izumi being the one who is simply happy to be there. Traditionally the male character is the stronger and more assertive, but recent anime series have tinkered with the formula by swapping the characters around, and Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie continues this. The story's very title alludes to it as well, pointing out that the gorgeous Shikimori is not only attractive -- she has serious skill and a strong will to match. On one hand, making Izumi so gentle and helpless might frustrate some fans who are more used to gung-ho shonen leads such as Kurosaki Ichigo, Uzumaki Naruto and Asta the swordsman, but recent anime such as Shikimori offer alternatives with male leads who are defined more by compassion and generosity instead, a move that may appeal to the ""female gaze."" This broadens the market appeal for shonen anime, and provides respite from an endless parade of ""I'll kick your butt"" meathead leads. It's not that strong male leads are unappealing or obsolete, but that archetype needs a chance to cool off and let other models of a male protagonist take the spotlight. That is the case with the clumsy but lovable Izumi.  RELATED: Aharen-San Episode 2 Showcases Aharen Raina's Sweet, Caring Side                Other events in Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie Episode 1 continue to reinforce this theme. While many anime depict a charmingly clumsy female who falls neatly into her male lover's arms, Shikimori reverses that -- and the characters themselves know it. Shikimori soon establishes herself as one of the spring season's best girls with her balance of good looks, a kind heart and a protective streak, almost acting like Izumi's big sister. She won't trip and fall into some hunk's arms -- more likely Izumi will trip and fall into her arms, and no doubt many fans are eager to see that happen. Strong female leads are more popular and prominent than ever, and a humorous series like Shikimori is bound to push the envelope as much as it can for laughs, including twisting old clichés into something new.  An example of this self-awareness takes place in a bowling alley. The clumsy Izumi can't throw a ball straight to save his life, but Shikimori sure can, and her female friends urge her to imitate his clumsiness. The idea is that by being a typical ""clumsy shojo girl,"" Shikimori will be cute and endearing in Izumi's eyes. Then Izumi cheers her on, so she feels empowered enough to score a perfect game instead. Shikimori identifies greatly with being strong, confident and cool; trying to be ""cute and clumsy"" simply isn't her thing. That should set the character's tone as Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie continues.

By Paige Villacin Published 22 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   Despite being such a popular genre, why do so few magical girl anime break into the mainstream of the western market?                  The Magical Girl genre has long since become one of many staples associated with anime -- so much so that it's frequently parodied not just by other anime, but by western cartoons as well. Despite this, very few magical girl series have actually broken through the mainstream. It certainly isn’t because the industry has been producing less magical girl anime, but rather, western publishers seem to be averse to localizing most of them.  This is a problem that’s perpetuated not just in anime, but the animation industry as a whole for many years. Shows with a male demographic will almost always receive preference over those targeted at girls. The few that are made with a female demographic in mind tend to go out of their way to appeal to a male audience as well, such as changing the title to give less focus on the female protagonist (ie: changing Miraculous Ladybug to The Adventures of Miraculous Ladybug and Cat Noir) or elevating a male character to a secondary protagonist position. RELATED: From Arina Tanemura to Clamp: Influential Shojo Artists of the Early 2000s                  One of the best-known anime that takes the above practice to heart is Cardcaptor Sakura. When it was first released in English in the west, its title was changed to Cardcaptors. This rename accomplished two things: it put less focus on the female protagonist, and it gave more importance to a male character. In the original series, Sakura is the only character to ever receive the title of “Cardcaptor”. In Nelvana’s English dub, it isn’t just Sakura who receives this title, but Syaoran (renamed Lee in the dub) as well. Lee is also elevated from supporting character to co-protagonist status, again to appeal to the male demographic. His romance with Sakura is completely scrapped, and any episodes that focused on the series' more slice-of-life aspects were completely removed in favor of more action-based storylines. In short, Nelvana repackaged this classic shoujo anime into a shounen series with a female lead.  Every few years, popular children’s anime geared toward boys will receive a new iteration featuring an entirely new cast. Digimon, Yu-Gi-Oh and Beyblade are some of the more popular ones that come to mind. Many of these have made their way to broadcast networks in the west -- in fact, the latest iteration of Beyblade is currently airing on Disney XD. The same treatment has been given to many popular children’s anime aimed at girls as well, ranging from magical girl anime to idol anime. However, most of these long-running franchises have never made their way to western television sets.  RELATED: Sailor Moon Knight Fan Art Is the Ultimate Lunar Hero Crossover                 It would be understandable if such programs were not successful, but many of these have proved popular enough to continue running for several decades. One prime example is Pretty Cure, a long-running magical girl anime that has been around for over 20 years. It’s one of Toei Animation’s most popular properties, rivaling even Sailor Moon in terms of cultural impact in its home country. Despite its massive success, only two of the series within this storied franchise have ever been picked up for English localization.  The original series, Futari Wa Pretty Cure, was picked up by several companies including Funimation, 4Kids and YTV. Only YTV has ever broadcast the show on television, but because it is a Canadian broadcasting channel, this means Futari Wa Pretty Cure was never shown in the US. It is, however, still available for streaming on Prime Video and Hulu. Doki Doki Pretty Cure was picked up by Hasbro and dubbed by Bang Zoom! Entertainment. It was renamed to the slightly more aggressive Glitter Force and is currently available for streaming on Netflix. Like most children’s anime from the early 2000s, the story was heavily cut and edited to remove any explicit references to Japanese culture as well as material deemed too “mature” for its target audience, such as references to death. As of this writing, this was the last Pretty Cure anime to be officially dubbed in English. While Crunchyroll has started streaming the newer entries in the franchise, no other companies have made any attempts to dub or market it to the western audience.  RELATED: Lady Gaga, Crunchyroll Team Up for New Apparel Collection                 While shoujo anime have not had as much trouble finding an audience in the west, one would be hard-pressed to find such shows airing on network television. Toonami has aired a few female-led shows in the past, but none were explicitly made with a female audience in mind. After the success of Sailor Moon, 4Kids made a few attempts to tap into the magical girl market by picking up Tokyo Mew Mew, or Mew Mew Power as it’s known in the west. It found some level of success, but not nearly to the same degree as Sailor Moon. A further attempt was made with yet another Toei Animation property, Ojamajo Doremi, which predictably received a new westernized name: Magical Doremi. It proved even less successful and suffered from consistently low ratings. 4Kids never finished airing the entire series, with the last 25 episodes going straight to the network’s website instead. 4Kids also gained the rights to Futari Wa Pretty Cure, but it never released any episodes before the series was eventually picked up by another distributor.  RELATED: A Decade After Sailor Moon Debuted, Its Director Created a Far Less Popular Sports Anime                 The failure of such anime can be attributed to a number of things -- none of which can be faulted to the shows themselves, but rather, mismanagement on the part of the companies distributing them. Magical Doremi aired at 7:30 am, too early in the morning for most kids to want to tune in on a Saturday. Cardcaptors received heavy backlash from fans of the original source material. When Pioneer gained the rights to distribute the original series on home video -- completely unedited and uncut in the original Japanese dub -- the sub-only DVDs outsold the dub-only DVDs by more than 10,000 units. Likewise, many long-time Pretty Cure fans responded negatively to Hasbro’s decisions to edit and westernize the English dub for Glitter Force -- a practice that in this day and age is no longer considered acceptable. Even the English dubs for the likes of Beyblade keep the original Japanese names and references intact.  It truly is a shame that more companies aren’t willing to put more time and interest in anime aimed at young girls. If they would simply put the same amount of effort into marketing such shows the way they do with Bakugan or Pokémon, there’s definite success to be had.

14-04-2022,animation,1,0,https://www.cbr.com/magical-girl-anime-marketing-difficulties-united-states/,Why Magical Girl Anime Is Difficult to Market in the US,"      Home Anime Why Is It So Hard to Market Magical Girl Anime in the US?    Why Is It So Hard to Market Magical Girl Anime in the US?  By Paige Villacin Published 22 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   Despite being such a popular genre, why do so few magical girl anime break into the mainstream of the western market?                  The Magical Girl genre has long since become one of many staples associated with anime -- so much so that it's frequently parodied not just by other anime, but by western cartoons as well. Despite this, very few magical girl series have actually broken through the mainstream. It certainly isn’t because the industry has been producing less magical girl anime, but rather, western publishers seem to be averse to localizing most of them.  This is a problem that’s perpetuated not just in anime, but the animation industry as a whole for many years. Shows with a male demographic will almost always receive preference over those targeted at girls. The few that are made with a female demographic in mind tend to go out of their way to appeal to a male audience as well, such as changing the title to give less focus on the female protagonist (ie: changing Miraculous Ladybug to The Adventures of Miraculous Ladybug and Cat Noir) or elevating a male character to a secondary protagonist position. RELATED: From Arina Tanemura to Clamp: Influential Shojo Artists of the Early 2000s                  One of the best-known anime that takes the above practice to heart is Cardcaptor Sakura. When it was first released in English in the west, its title was changed to Cardcaptors. This rename accomplished two things: it put less focus on the female protagonist, and it gave more importance to a male character. In the original series, Sakura is the only character to ever receive the title of “Cardcaptor”. In Nelvana’s English dub, it isn’t just Sakura who receives this title, but Syaoran (renamed Lee in the dub) as well. Lee is also elevated from supporting character to co-protagonist status, again to appeal to the male demographic. His romance with Sakura is completely scrapped, and any episodes that focused on the series' more slice-of-life aspects were completely removed in favor of more action-based storylines. In short, Nelvana repackaged this classic shoujo anime into a shounen series with a female lead.  Every few years, popular children’s anime geared toward boys will receive a new iteration featuring an entirely new cast. Digimon, Yu-Gi-Oh and Beyblade are some of the more popular ones that come to mind. Many of these have made their way to broadcast networks in the west -- in fact, the latest iteration of Beyblade is currently airing on Disney XD. The same treatment has been given to many popular children’s anime aimed at girls as well, ranging from magical girl anime to idol anime. However, most of these long-running franchises have never made their way to western television sets.  RELATED: Sailor Moon Knight Fan Art Is the Ultimate Lunar Hero Crossover                 It would be understandable if such programs were not successful, but many of these have proved popular enough to continue running for several decades. One prime example is Pretty Cure, a long-running magical girl anime that has been around for over 20 years. It’s one of Toei Animation’s most popular properties, rivaling even Sailor Moon in terms of cultural impact in its home country. Despite its massive success, only two of the series within this storied franchise have ever been picked up for English localization.  The original series, Futari Wa Pretty Cure, was picked up by several companies including Funimation, 4Kids and YTV. Only YTV has ever broadcast the show on television, but because it is a Canadian broadcasting channel, this means Futari Wa Pretty Cure was never shown in the US. It is, however, still available for streaming on Prime Video and Hulu. Doki Doki Pretty Cure was picked up by Hasbro and dubbed by Bang Zoom! Entertainment. It was renamed to the slightly more aggressive Glitter Force and is currently available for streaming on Netflix. Like most children’s anime from the early 2000s, the story was heavily cut and edited to remove any explicit references to Japanese culture as well as material deemed too “mature” for its target audience, such as references to death. As of this writing, this was the last Pretty Cure anime to be officially dubbed in English. While Crunchyroll has started streaming the newer entries in the franchise, no other companies have made any attempts to dub or market it to the western audience.  RELATED: Lady Gaga, Crunchyroll Team Up for New Apparel Collection                 While shoujo anime have not had as much trouble finding an audience in the west, one would be hard-pressed to find such shows airing on network television. Toonami has aired a few female-led shows in the past, but none were explicitly made with a female audience in mind. After the success of Sailor Moon, 4Kids made a few attempts to tap into the magical girl market by picking up Tokyo Mew Mew, or Mew Mew Power as it’s known in the west. It found some level of success, but not nearly to the same degree as Sailor Moon. A further attempt was made with yet another Toei Animation property, Ojamajo Doremi, which predictably received a new westernized name: Magical Doremi. It proved even less successful and suffered from consistently low ratings. 4Kids never finished airing the entire series, with the last 25 episodes going straight to the network’s website instead. 4Kids also gained the rights to Futari Wa Pretty Cure, but it never released any episodes before the series was eventually picked up by another distributor.  RELATED: A Decade After Sailor Moon Debuted, Its Director Created a Far Less Popular Sports Anime                 The failure of such anime can be attributed to a number of things -- none of which can be faulted to the shows themselves, but rather, mismanagement on the part of the companies distributing them. Magical Doremi aired at 7:30 am, too early in the morning for most kids to want to tune in on a Saturday. Cardcaptors received heavy backlash from fans of the original source material. When Pioneer gained the rights to distribute the original series on home video -- completely unedited and uncut in the original Japanese dub -- the sub-only DVDs outsold the dub-only DVDs by more than 10,000 units. Likewise, many long-time Pretty Cure fans responded negatively to Hasbro’s decisions to edit and westernize the English dub for Glitter Force -- a practice that in this day and age is no longer considered acceptable. Even the English dubs for the likes of Beyblade keep the original Japanese names and references intact.  It truly is a shame that more companies aren’t willing to put more time and interest in anime aimed at young girls. If they would simply put the same amount of effort into marketing such shows the way they do with Bakugan or Pokémon, there’s definite success to be had. There’s a plethora of magical girl and shoujo anime that will never be exported as a result. For now, magical girl aficionados will have to be content with streaming the latest iteration of Pretty Cure subbed.                  What Makes Tokyo Mew Mew So Special?

It had a rough start, but it picked up the pace around half way through. This is quite annoying for me, as I feel that there are so much opportunities for the plot to be made more interesting then. Also, the story lack common sense - even a lot of common sense sometimes. It would've played out much better if the plots are thought out more throughly, and it would, for me, turn out much more interesting and enjoyable. Also, I feel that the author over-conceptualize the topic of sex. Even myself being a teenager myself, I think that it is a little too much to the point that it doesn't make sense sometimes.  Another turn off for me is the teacher-student romance. I don't want to say much more about that as it would be a spoiler, but really?  For arts and animation nerds, we know it's definitely not perfect. I mean - come on: the color of shadow casting on the floor does not have the same color as it does on the human face, and the perspective of shadows are all wrong... It's really annoying, but it doesn't turn me off from the story so I don't really mind about that as much.  Enough ranting... Overall, this is quite a good show. I'm not sure how does it compare with the source material, but nevertheless, it's a fun and enjoyable. It's just lacking in ethics and common sense, but otherwise, good show. It had saved itself from a 6 from me as the screenplay is quite well written, and quite enjoyable at times. Voice acting is great, so there's not really a major turnoff.

I'm not sure how does it compare with the source material, but nevertheless, it's a fun and enjoyable. It's just lacking in ethics and common sense, but otherwise, good show.

You should consult with your own lawyer and/or see 17 U.S.C. § 512 of the United States Copyright Act to confirm your obligations to provide a valid notice of claimed infringement.Designated Agent Contact Information. TOM’s Designated Agent for notices of claimed infringement can be contacted at:Via E-mail: copyright@tokyootakumode.comVia Mail:Nagatacho GRID 2-5-3 Hirakawa-cho,Chiyoda-ku Tokyo, Japan 102-0093Counter Notification.If you receive a notification from TOM that material made available by you on or through the Services has been the subject of a Notification of Claimed Infringement, then you will have the right to provide TOM with what is called a ""Counter Notification.""

The Copyright Act provides that:any person who knowingly materially misrepresents under [Section 512 of the Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. § 512)] (1) that material or activity is infringing, or (2) that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification, shall be liable for any damages, including costs and attorneys’ fees, incurred by the alleged infringer, by any copyright owner or copyright owner’s authorized licensee, or by a service provider, who is injured by such misrepresentation, as the result of the service provider relying upon such misrepresentation in removing or disabling access to the material or activity claimed to be infringing, or in replacing the removed material or ceasing to disable access to it.17 U.S.C. § 512(f).TOM reserves the right to seek damages from any party that submits a notification of claimed infringement in violation of the law.For the avoidance of doubt, only notices submitted under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and the procedures set forth in this Section 18 should be sent to the Designated Agent at copyright@tokyootakumode.com or to the postal address identified above.  Any other comments, compliments, complaints or suggestions about TOM, the operation of the Services or any other matter should be sent to support@tokyootakumode.com.DISPUTE RESOLUTIONGeneral. In the interest of resolving disputes between you and TOM in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and TOM agree that any dispute arising out of or in any way related to these Terms or your use of the Services will be resolved by binding arbitration.  Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court.  Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts.  Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.  This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or in any way related to these Terms or your use of the Services, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms.  YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND TOM ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION AND THAT THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE SUBJECT TO AND GOVERNED BY THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT.Exceptions. Notwithstanding Section 19.1 above, nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court; (b) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (c) seek injunctive relief in aid of arbitration from a court of competent jurisdiction; or (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.Arbitrator. Any arbitration between you and TOM will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, ""AAA Rules"") of the American Arbitration Association (""AAA""), as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the AAA.  The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting TOM.  The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.Notice; Process. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by Mail (""Notice"").  TOM’s address for Notice is: Tokyo Otaku Mode Co. Ltd., Nagatacho GRID 2-5-3 Hirakawa-cho, Chiyoda-ku Tokyo, Japan 102-0093, Attn: Chief Executive Officer.  The Notice must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (""Demand"").  The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, then you or TOM may commence an arbitration proceeding.  During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or TOM must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.  If the dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor with a monetary award that exceeds the last written settlement amount offered by TOM prior to selection of an arbitrator, TOM will pay you the highest of the following: (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any; (ii) the last written settlement amount offered by TOM in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator’s award; or (iii) $15,000.Fees. If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, then TOM will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $15,000 or as set forth below, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules.  Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in Tokyo, Japan, but if the claim is for $15,000 or less, then you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.  If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse TOM for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.  Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.  Each party agrees that such written decision, and information exchanged during arbitration, will be kept confidential except to the extent necessary to enforce or permit limited judicial review of the award.  The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.No Class Actions. YOU AND TOM AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.  Further, unless both you and TOM agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.Modifications to this Arbitration Provision. Except as otherwise provided in these Terms, if TOM makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to TOM’s address for Notice, then you may reject the change by sending TOM written notice within 30 days of the change to TOM’s address for Notice, in which case this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected, will continue to govern any disputes between you and TOM.Enforceability. If Section 19.6 above is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this Section 19 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 19 will be null and void.MISCELLANEOUSGoverning Law; Entire Agreement. This is the entire agreement between you and TOM relating to the subject matter herein and supersedes all previous communications, representations, understandings and agreements, either oral or written, between the parties with respect to said subject matter.  These Terms shall not be modified except in a writing, signed by both parties, or by a change to these Terms made by TOM as authorized in these Terms.  These Terms will be governed solely by the laws of Japan, without regard to its conflicts of laws principles.  Waiver. A provision of these Terms may be waived only by a written instrument executed by the party entitled to the benefit of such provision.  The failure of TOM to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.Severability. If any provision of these Terms shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these Terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. Assignment. These Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by TOM without restriction.  Any assignment attempted to be made by you in violation of these Terms shall be void.  These Terms will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto, and permitted successors and assigns.No Agency. You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and TOM as a result of these Terms or use of the Services.Survival. The provisions of these Terms that are intended to survive the termination of these Terms by their nature will survive the termination of these Terms, including, but not limited to, Sections 4 (Privacy), 5 (Service Security), 7.4(d) (Survival of Rights for Removed User Content); 7.2-7.4 (Licenses), 8 (Monitoring and Removing Content; Reliance on User Content), 10 (Crowd-Sourced Projects), 11 (Prohibited Activities), 12 (Disclaimer of Content, Including User Content), 13 (Links to Third Party Sites), 14 (Indemnity), 15 (Additional Disclaimers), 16 (Limitations), 17 (Term and Termination), 19 (Dispute Resolution), and 20 (Miscellaneous).

Infringing activity will not be tolerated on or through the Services.TOM’s intellectual property policy is to (a) remove or disable access to Content or materials that TOM believes in good faith, upon notice from an intellectual property owner or their agent, is infringing the intellectual property of a third party by being made available through the Services, and (b) remove any Content posted to the Services by ""repeat infringers.""  TOM considers a ""repeat infringer"" to be any user that has uploaded User Content to the Services and for whom TOM has received more than two takedown notices compliant with the provisions of 17 U.S.C. § 512(c) with respect to such User Content.  TOM has discretion, however, to terminate the account of any user after receipt of a single notification of claimed infringement or upon TOM’s own determination.Procedure for Reporting Claimed Infringement.If you believe that any Content accessible on or through the Services infringes an intellectual property right you own or control, then please promptly send a ""Notification of Claimed Infringement"" containing the following information to the Designated Agent identified below.

You should consult with your own lawyer and/or see 17 U.S.C. § 512 of the United States Copyright Act to confirm your obligations to provide a valid notice of claimed infringement.Designated Agent Contact Information. TOM’s Designated Agent for notices of claimed infringement can be contacted at:Via E-mail: copyright@tokyootakumode.comVia Mail:Nagatacho GRID 2-5-3 Hirakawa-cho,Chiyoda-ku Tokyo, Japan 102-0093Counter Notification.If you receive a notification from TOM that material made available by you on or through the Services has been the subject of a Notification of Claimed Infringement, then you will have the right to provide TOM with what is called a ""Counter Notification.""  To be effective, a Counter Notification must be in writing, provided to TOM’s Designated Agent through one of the methods identified in Section 18.4, and include substantially the following information:A physical or electronic signature of the subscriber;Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled;A statement under penalty of perjury that the subscriber has a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled; andThe subscriber’s name, address, and telephone number, and a statement that the subscriber consents to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which the address is located, or if the subscriber’s address is outside of the United States, for any judicial district in which TOM may be found, and that the subscriber will accept service of process from the person who provided notification under Section 18.3 above or an agent of such person.A party submitting a Counter Notification should consult a lawyer or see 17 U.S.C. § 512 to confirm the party’s obligations to provide a valid counter notification under the Copyright Act.False Notifications of Claimed Infringement or Counter Notifications. The Copyright Act provides that:any person who knowingly materially misrepresents under [Section 512 of the Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. § 512)] (1) that material or activity is infringing, or (2) that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification, shall be liable for any damages, including costs and attorneys’ fees, incurred by the alleged infringer, by any copyright owner or copyright owner’s authorized licensee, or by a service provider, who is injured by such misrepresentation, as the result of the service provider relying upon such misrepresentation in removing or disabling access to the material or activity claimed to be infringing, or in replacing the removed material or ceasing to disable access to it.17 U.S.C. § 512(f).TOM reserves the right to seek damages from any party that submits a notification of claimed infringement in violation of the law.For the avoidance of doubt, only notices submitted under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and the procedures set forth in this Section 18 should be sent to the Designated Agent at copyright@tokyootakumode.com or to the postal address identified above.  Any other comments, compliments, complaints or suggestions about TOM, the operation of the Services or any other matter should be sent to support@tokyootakumode.com.DISPUTE RESOLUTIONGeneral. In the interest of resolving disputes between you and TOM in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and TOM agree that any dispute arising out of or in any way related to these Terms or your use of the Services will be resolved by binding arbitration.  Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court.  Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts.  Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.  This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or in any way related to these Terms or your use of the Services, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms.  YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND TOM ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION AND THAT THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE SUBJECT TO AND GOVERNED BY THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT.Exceptions. Notwithstanding Section 19.1 above, nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court; (b) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (c) seek injunctive relief in aid of arbitration from a court of competent jurisdiction; or (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.Arbitrator. Any arbitration between you and TOM will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, ""AAA Rules"") of the American Arbitration Association (""AAA""), as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the AAA.  The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting TOM.  The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.Notice; Process. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by Mail (""Notice"").  TOM’s address for Notice is: Tokyo Otaku Mode Co. Ltd., Nagatacho GRID 2-5-3 Hirakawa-cho, Chiyoda-ku Tokyo, Japan 102-0093, Attn: Chief Executive Officer.  The Notice must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (""Demand"").  The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, then you or TOM may commence an arbitration proceeding.  During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or TOM must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.  If the dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor with a monetary award that exceeds the last written settlement amount offered by TOM prior to selection of an arbitrator, TOM will pay you the highest of the following: (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any; (ii) the last written settlement amount offered by TOM in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator’s award; or (iii) $15,000.Fees. If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, then TOM will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $15,000 or as set forth below, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules.  Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in Tokyo, Japan, but if the claim is for $15,000 or less, then you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.  If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse TOM for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.  Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.  Each party agrees that such written decision, and information exchanged during arbitration, will be kept confidential except to the extent necessary to enforce or permit limited judicial review of the award.  The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.No Class Actions. YOU AND TOM AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.  Further, unless both you and TOM agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.Modifications to this Arbitration Provision. Except as otherwise provided in these Terms, if TOM makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to TOM’s address for Notice, then you may reject the change by sending TOM written notice within 30 days of the change to TOM’s address for Notice, in which case this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected, will continue to govern any disputes between you and TOM.Enforceability. If Section 19.6 above is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this Section 19 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 19 will be null and void.MISCELLANEOUSGoverning Law; Entire Agreement. This is the entire agreement between you and TOM relating to the subject matter herein and supersedes all previous communications, representations, understandings and agreements, either oral or written, between the parties with respect to said subject matter.  These Terms shall not be modified except in a writing, signed by both parties, or by a change to these Terms made by TOM as authorized in these Terms.  These Terms will be governed solely by the laws of Japan, without regard to its conflicts of laws principles.  Waiver. A provision of these Terms may be waived only by a written instrument executed by the party entitled to the benefit of such provision.  The failure of TOM to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.Severability. If any provision of these Terms shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these Terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. Assignment. These Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by TOM without restriction.  Any assignment attempted to be made by you in violation of these Terms shall be void.  These Terms will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto, and permitted successors and assigns.No Agency. You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and TOM as a result of these Terms or use of the Services.Survival. The provisions of these Terms that are intended to survive the termination of these Terms by their nature will survive the termination of these Terms, including, but not limited to, Sections 4 (Privacy), 5 (Service Security), 7.4(d) (Survival of Rights for Removed User Content); 7.2-7.4 (Licenses), 8 (Monitoring and Removing Content; Reliance on User Content), 10 (Crowd-Sourced Projects), 11 (Prohibited Activities), 12 (Disclaimer of Content, Including User Content), 13 (Links to Third Party Sites), 14 (Indemnity), 15 (Additional Disclaimers), 16 (Limitations), 17 (Term and Termination), 19 (Dispute Resolution), and 20 (Miscellaneous).

Fees take effect once they are accessible through the link set forth in the first sentence of this Section 10.6.Cancellation. In cases where TOM is not the Project Owner, TOM reserves the right in its sole discretion to require a Project Owner to cancel any of its Projects for any or no reason upon notice, including, without limitation, in cases where the Project Owner has breached these Terms.  Upon any cancellation under this Section 10.7, the applicable Project Owner must promptly arrange for Pledges to be refunded to Backers.Disclaimer.

If you wish to terminate your account on the Services, you may do so by sending an e-mail to support@tokyootakumode.com or using any other account termination functionality that may be offered through the Services.NOTICE AND PROCEDURE FOR MAKING CLAIMS OF COPYRIGHT OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENTSTOM respects the intellectual property of others and takes the protection of copyrights and all other intellectual property very seriously, and we ask our users to do the same.  Infringing activity will not be tolerated on or through the Services.TOM’s intellectual property policy is to (a) remove or disable access to Content or materials that TOM believes in good faith, upon notice from an intellectual property owner or their agent, is infringing the intellectual property of a third party by being made available through the Services, and (b) remove any Content posted to the Services by ""repeat infringers.""  TOM considers a ""repeat infringer"" to be any user that has uploaded User Content to the Services and for whom TOM has received more than two takedown notices compliant with the provisions of 17 U.S.C. § 512(c) with respect to such User Content.  TOM has discretion, however, to terminate the account of any user after receipt of a single notification of claimed infringement or upon TOM’s own determination.Procedure for Reporting Claimed Infringement.If you believe that any Content accessible on or through the Services infringes an intellectual property right you own or control, then please promptly send a ""Notification of Claimed Infringement"" containing the following information to the Designated Agent identified below.  Your communication must include substantially the following:A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the work(s) that has/have been allegedly infringed;Identification of works or materials being infringed, or, if multiple works are covered by a single notification, then a representative list of such works;Identification of the specific material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit TOM to locate the material;Information reasonably sufficient to permit TOM to contact you, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail address at which you may be contacted;A statement that you have a good faith belief that the use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; andA statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed. You should consult with your own lawyer and/or see 17 U.S.C. § 512 of the United States Copyright Act to confirm your obligations to provide a valid notice of claimed infringement.Designated Agent Contact Information. TOM’s Designated Agent for notices of claimed infringement can be contacted at:Via E-mail: copyright@tokyootakumode.comVia Mail:Nagatacho GRID 2-5-3 Hirakawa-cho,Chiyoda-ku Tokyo, Japan 102-0093Counter Notification.If you receive a notification from TOM that material made available by you on or through the Services has been the subject of a Notification of Claimed Infringement, then you will have the right to provide TOM with what is called a ""Counter Notification.""  To be effective, a Counter Notification must be in writing, provided to TOM’s Designated Agent through one of the methods identified in Section 18.4, and include substantially the following information:A physical or electronic signature of the subscriber;Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled;A statement under penalty of perjury that the subscriber has a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled; andThe subscriber’s name, address, and telephone number, and a statement that the subscriber consents to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which the address is located, or if the subscriber’s address is outside of the United States, for any judicial district in which TOM may be found, and that the subscriber will accept service of process from the person who provided notification under Section 18.3 above or an agent of such person.A party submitting a Counter Notification should consult a lawyer or see 17 U.S.C. § 512 to confirm the party’s obligations to provide a valid counter notification under the Copyright Act.False Notifications of Claimed Infringement or Counter Notifications. The Copyright Act provides that:any person who knowingly materially misrepresents under [Section 512 of the Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. § 512)] (1) that material or activity is infringing, or (2) that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification, shall be liable for any damages, including costs and attorneys’ fees, incurred by the alleged infringer, by any copyright owner or copyright owner’s authorized licensee, or by a service provider, who is injured by such misrepresentation, as the result of the service provider relying upon such misrepresentation in removing or disabling access to the material or activity claimed to be infringing, or in replacing the removed material or ceasing to disable access to it.17 U.S.C. § 512(f).TOM reserves the right to seek damages from any party that submits a notification of claimed infringement in violation of the law.For the avoidance of doubt, only notices submitted under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and the procedures set forth in this Section 18 should be sent to the Designated Agent at copyright@tokyootakumode.com or to the postal address identified above.  Any other comments, compliments, complaints or suggestions about TOM, the operation of the Services or any other matter should be sent to support@tokyootakumode.com.DISPUTE RESOLUTIONGeneral. In the interest of resolving disputes between you and TOM in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and TOM agree that any dispute arising out of or in any way related to these Terms or your use of the Services will be resolved by binding arbitration.  Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court.  Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts.  Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.  This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or in any way related to these Terms or your use of the Services, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms.  YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND TOM ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION AND THAT THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE SUBJECT TO AND GOVERNED BY THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT.Exceptions. Notwithstanding Section 19.1 above, nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court; (b) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (c) seek injunctive relief in aid of arbitration from a court of competent jurisdiction; or (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.Arbitrator. Any arbitration between you and TOM will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, ""AAA Rules"") of the American Arbitration Association (""AAA""), as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the AAA.  The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting TOM.  The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.Notice; Process. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by Mail (""Notice"").  TOM’s address for Notice is: Tokyo Otaku Mode Co. Ltd., Nagatacho GRID 2-5-3 Hirakawa-cho, Chiyoda-ku Tokyo, Japan 102-0093, Attn: Chief Executive Officer.  The Notice must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (""Demand"").  The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, then you or TOM may commence an arbitration proceeding.  During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or TOM must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.  If the dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor with a monetary award that exceeds the last written settlement amount offered by TOM prior to selection of an arbitrator, TOM will pay you the highest of the following: (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any; (ii) the last written settlement amount offered by TOM in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator’s award; or (iii) $15,000.Fees. If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, then TOM will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $15,000 or as set forth below, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules.  Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in Tokyo, Japan, but if the claim is for $15,000 or less, then you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.  If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse TOM for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.  Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.  Each party agrees that such written decision, and information exchanged during arbitration, will be kept confidential except to the extent necessary to enforce or permit limited judicial review of the award.  The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.No Class Actions. YOU AND TOM AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.  Further, unless both you and TOM agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.Modifications to this Arbitration Provision. Except as otherwise provided in these Terms, if TOM makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to TOM’s address for Notice, then you may reject the change by sending TOM written notice within 30 days of the change to TOM’s address for Notice, in which case this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected, will continue to govern any disputes between you and TOM.Enforceability. If Section 19.6 above is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this Section 19 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 19 will be null and void.MISCELLANEOUSGoverning Law; Entire Agreement. This is the entire agreement between you and TOM relating to the subject matter herein and supersedes all previous communications, representations, understandings and agreements, either oral or written, between the parties with respect to said subject matter.  These Terms shall not be modified except in a writing, signed by both parties, or by a change to these Terms made by TOM as authorized in these Terms.  These Terms will be governed solely by the laws of Japan, without regard to its conflicts of laws principles.  Waiver. A provision of these Terms may be waived only by a written instrument executed by the party entitled to the benefit of such provision.  The failure of TOM to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.Severability. If any provision of these Terms shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these Terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. Assignment. These Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by TOM without restriction.  Any assignment attempted to be made by you in violation of these Terms shall be void.  These Terms will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto, and permitted successors and assigns.No Agency. You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and TOM as a result of these Terms or use of the Services.Survival. The provisions of these Terms that are intended to survive the termination of these Terms by their nature will survive the termination of these Terms, including, but not limited to, Sections 4 (Privacy), 5 (Service Security), 7.4(d) (Survival of Rights for Removed User Content); 7.2-7.4 (Licenses), 8 (Monitoring and Removing Content; Reliance on User Content), 10 (Crowd-Sourced Projects), 11 (Prohibited Activities), 12 (Disclaimer of Content, Including User Content), 13 (Links to Third Party Sites), 14 (Indemnity), 15 (Additional Disclaimers), 16 (Limitations), 17 (Term and Termination), 19 (Dispute Resolution), and 20 (Miscellaneous). Headings.The heading references herein are for convenience purposes only, do not constitute a part of these Terms, and shall not be deemed to limit or affect any of the provisions hereof.E-mail Communications. You hereby authorize TOM to communicate with you about the Service via email during the Term and at least once following the Term to confirm any termination of these Terms.Contact Information for TOM.

It deals with themes from growing up to the importance of friendship, often along with graphic violence and some sexual undertones.It has been around for decades in Japan and gained a foothold in the West in the 1990s, but reached a new level of popularity around the world in the past few years.Image source, Gege Akutami/ShueishaImage caption, The film follows high school student Yuta OkkotsuNetflix says more than 100 million households around the world watched at least one anime title in the first nine months of 2020, a 50% increase from 2019. Meanwhile, anime only sites like Crunchyroll have also seen a rise in viewers.Shiro Yoshioka, a lecturer in Japanese studies at Newcastle University, says streaming sites have ""lowered the barrier to be a fan of anime significantly and has helped it become more mainstream than it used to be"".Jujutsu Kaisen 0 made almost $15m (£11m) at US and Canadian cinemas last weekend and another £825,000 in the UK and Ireland.'Masterful' film""This is a terrific opening,"" David A Gross, who runs movie consulting firm Franchise Entertainment Research, told Reuters. ""Reviews are exceptional for this and for all of Funimation/Crunchyroll movies. They have not missed.""Those reviews included one in The Guardian, which said the ""dazzling coming-of-age tale masterfully contemplates the knotty process of coming to terms with past traumas through a horror-fantasy lens"".Directed by Sunghoo Park, it has more graphic violence than some previous Japanese animations as a result of its darker themes and tone. The film comes after the success of Demon Slayer, which became the highest-grossing anime film worldwide, making $90m (£68m) outside Japan in 2021 despite being released during the pandemic.Image source, Gege Akutami/ShueishaImage caption, The manga/comic books the film was based on sold more than 60 million copies in JapanCrunchyroll released Jujutsu Kaisen 0 in US cinemas and has seen its streaming numbers go from one million paid subscribers in 2017 to five million last year. Sony bought the company for $1.175bn (£900m) in 2021.Chief content officer Asa Suehira said the growth of streaming and video games had led to ""more fans with a comfort and interest around adult dramatic animation"".Dr Yoshioka believes it is ""the complexity and difference from Western visual media that attract young people to anime"".He adds: ""There is still a mindset in the West that animation is for children, whereas in Japan, the genre is for audiences of all ages, and the content reflects that.""Dr Filippo Cervelli, a lecturer in modern Japanese literature at the SOAS University of London (School of Oriental and African Studies), has seen an increase in the number of students writing theses on anime.""This shows how anime are appreciated but are also seen as sources of cultural insights,"" he says. ""Many popular anime show Japanese urban backgrounds, Japanese food and other elements of daily life that can be new and attractive to UK audiences used to different architectures or daily rhythms.Image source, Gege Akutami/ShueishaImage caption, The Guardian described the film as ""bloody, action-packed and tragicomic all at once""For a growing number of parents, they may wonder whether the content their children are watching is appropriate.Vansh Gulati from Epic Dope, a site dedicated to all things anime, says it should not be confused with hentai - or Japanese animated pornography. ""Many parents think of anime to be porn disguised as aesthetic glitter-covered cartoons,"" he says.He advises that, like any other form of media, parents should monitor what their children watch. They can also read reviews, check age ratings and make sure they don't stray into shows rated for adults.Anna Parker-Naples, a parent of three, thinks anime has its benefits but it's important to know what your children are watching. ""Sometimes the way that death is portrayed, even if it's graphics, can be quite bloody and brutal. I think it's the adult themes woven into some of the stories.

The film comes after the success of Demon Slayer, which became the highest-grossing anime film worldwide, making $90m (£68m) outside Japan in 2021 despite being released during the pandemic.Image source, Gege Akutami/ShueishaImage caption, The manga/comic books the film was based on sold more than 60 million copies in JapanCrunchyroll released Jujutsu Kaisen 0 in US cinemas and has seen its streaming numbers go from one million paid subscribers in 2017 to five million last year. Sony bought the company for $1.175bn (£900m) in 2021.Chief content officer Asa Suehira said the growth of streaming and video games had led to ""more fans with a comfort and interest around adult dramatic animation"".Dr Yoshioka believes it is ""the complexity and difference from Western visual media that attract young people to anime"".He adds: ""There is still a mindset in the West that animation is for children, whereas in Japan, the genre is for audiences of all ages, and the content reflects that.""Dr Filippo Cervelli, a lecturer in modern Japanese literature at the SOAS University of London (School of Oriental and African Studies), has seen an increase in the number of students writing theses on anime.""This shows how anime are appreciated but are also seen as sources of cultural insights,"" he says.

They can also read reviews, check age ratings and make sure they don't stray into shows rated for adults.Anna Parker-Naples, a parent of three, thinks anime has its benefits but it's important to know what your children are watching. ""Sometimes the way that death is portrayed, even if it's graphics, can be quite bloody and brutal. I think it's the adult themes woven into some of the stories. We just never know at what point they're going to become overly violent.""We want to make sure we're on board with what they are watching. So quite often, we will watch a few episodes of the series before we let them watch something.""Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Some fans spend a lot of time drawing characters from or inspired by their favourite anime shows or manga booksOne of her children is drawn to the artistry of anime because some of it can be ""quite beautiful"", she adds.""For us, watching our children be inspired by something that they were then wanting to draw and be creative, we quite like that.""For some fans, especially for younger viewers, having something in common with other like-minded people brings about a sense of belonging and acceptance.""I think they sort of self-identify with all the people that watch anime.

In the wake of the attack, dozens of people gathered outside the premises of the studio, laying flowers and offering prayers. A crowdfunding campaign has so far raised more than $1.3m (£1.04m) to assist victims and their families.KyoAni produces films and graphic novels and is well regarded by fans for the quality of its productions.What do we know about the suspect?Police detained Shinji Aoba on suspicion of setting fire to the building. Mr Aoba allegedly accused the animation studio of plagiarising his novel. He was taken to hospital for treatment and had not been formally interviewed about his motive.Image source, AFPImage caption, Since the fire was put out, investigators have been inspecting the scene for evidencePublic broadcaster NHK reported that he had a criminal record and was previously jailed for stealing money from a convenience store. Kyoto Animation's president said he had recently received threatening letters but had no idea if they were connected to the attack. What happened?The fire broke out at the three-storey building at about 10:30 local time (01:35 GMT) on Thursday. Eyewitnesses described a loud explosion followed by the blaze, which people jumped out of windows to escape from.""It was like I was looking at hell,"" a local woman told Asahi Shimbun newspaper.Image source, AFPImage caption, Authorities said most of the victims died whilst trying to escape to the building's roofAround 70 people were in the building when the fire started, and some 36 people have reportedly been taken to hospital.Authorities said most of the victims were found piled up on a stairway leading from the building's third floor up to the roof, where they collapsed trying to escape.Image source, AFPImage caption, It took firefighters five hours to bring the blaze under control, reports saidKyodo news agency said firefighters had found the door to the roof was shut, leaving people trapped inside. A Kyoto fire official also told Reuters news agency that the building did not have any sprinklers or indoor fire hydrants – but did not need them to comply with Japan's fire code.Momoko Higuchi, a Tokyo-based architect, told Reuters that the blaze was probably made worse by the building's three-storey spiral staircase, which would have ""[acted] as a chimney.""""Because the fire was with petrol, the effect was like a bomb,"" Mr Higuchi added.The fire was put out and police were searching the site for evidence. Knives were reportedly found at the scene.Details of the victims were not immediately released but Kyoto police said 20 women and 12 men were among the dead. One person has not yet been identified. KyoAni is known for employing more women, particularly younger women, than is usual in the profession, industry lawyer Daisuke Okeda told the New York Times.Men aged over 35 still dominate the animation industry, Mr Okeda said, but twice as many women in their 20s work as animators compared with their male counterparts.In response to the incident, the studio has cancelled screenings for the trailer of its latest film, a spin-off of the popular swimming anime series Free. It has also delayed a collaboration with Keihan Main Line, a railway service between Kyoto and Osaka.Another Japanese animation studio, David Production, postponed the broadcast of its latest episode of Fire Force. The animated series centres on a group of firefighters who have the ability to manipulate fire.Who is Kyoto Animation?Kyoto Animation was founded in 1981 and has produced popular animation shows including K-On and The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. The studio also creates film versions of some of its popular franchises, and released the standalone feature A Silent Voice in 2016 to critical acclaim.One of KyoAni's series, Violet Evergarden, was picked up by Netflix for a global market. It also publishes many popular graphic novels, mainly about teenage school life.KyoAni: The beloved studio making distinctive artThe studio is known for paying its animators a regular salary, breaking with the industry's standard of paying per frame - which is seen as putting extreme pressure on staff. It is also the first successful studio outside Tokyo, Prof Ryusuke Hikawa from Meiji University told NHK.More on this storyArson attack at Japan anime studio kills 3318 July 2019Kyoto Animation studio on fire18 July 2019Top StoriesLive. Russian warship seriously damaged as Ukraine claims strikeDamaged Russian warship: What we knowPublished1 hour agoNZ court allows China extradition in landmark casePublished2 hours agoFeaturesUkraine's battle for justice over alleged Russian war crimesCollecting the dead in BuchaThe Olympic champion who turned his back on PutinWhy people get away with hate speech in IndiaHow Russia's war threatens Brazil's indigenous landThe rising cost of living crisis bites NepalDo we finally know the cause of multiple sclerosis?How we spot fake news from Ukraine.

He was taken to hospital for treatment and had not been formally interviewed about his motive.Image source, AFPImage caption, Since the fire was put out, investigators have been inspecting the scene for evidencePublic broadcaster NHK reported that he had a criminal record and was previously jailed for stealing money from a convenience store. Kyoto Animation's president said he had recently received threatening letters but had no idea if they were connected to the attack. What happened?The fire broke out at the three-storey building at about 10:30 local time (01:35 GMT) on Thursday. Eyewitnesses described a loud explosion followed by the blaze, which people jumped out of windows to escape from.""It was like I was looking at hell,"" a local woman told Asahi Shimbun newspaper.Image source, AFPImage caption, Authorities said most of the victims died whilst trying to escape to the building's roofAround 70 people were in the building when the fire started, and some 36 people have reportedly been taken to hospital.Authorities said most of the victims were found piled up on a stairway leading from the building's third floor up to the roof, where they collapsed trying to escape.Image source, AFPImage caption, It took firefighters five hours to bring the blaze under control, reports saidKyodo news agency said firefighters had found the door to the roof was shut, leaving people trapped inside. A Kyoto fire official also told Reuters news agency that the building did not have any sprinklers or indoor fire hydrants – but did not need them to comply with Japan's fire code.Momoko Higuchi, a Tokyo-based architect, told Reuters that the blaze was probably made worse by the building's three-storey spiral staircase, which would have ""[acted] as a chimney.""""Because the fire was with petrol, the effect was like a bomb,"" Mr Higuchi added.The fire was put out and police were searching the site for evidence. Knives were reportedly found at the scene.Details of the victims were not immediately released but Kyoto police said 20 women and 12 men were among the dead. One person has not yet been identified. KyoAni is known for employing more women, particularly younger women, than is usual in the profession, industry lawyer Daisuke Okeda told the New York Times.Men aged over 35 still dominate the animation industry, Mr Okeda said, but twice as many women in their 20s work as animators compared with their male counterparts.In response to the incident, the studio has cancelled screenings for the trailer of its latest film, a spin-off of the popular swimming anime series Free. It has also delayed a collaboration with Keihan Main Line, a railway service between Kyoto and Osaka.Another Japanese animation studio, David Production, postponed the broadcast of its latest episode of Fire Force. The animated series centres on a group of firefighters who have the ability to manipulate fire.Who is Kyoto Animation?Kyoto Animation was founded in 1981 and has produced popular animation shows including K-On and The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. The studio also creates film versions of some of its popular franchises, and released the standalone feature A Silent Voice in 2016 to critical acclaim.One of KyoAni's series, Violet Evergarden, was picked up by Netflix for a global market. It also publishes many popular graphic novels, mainly about teenage school life.KyoAni: The beloved studio making distinctive artThe studio is known for paying its animators a regular salary, breaking with the industry's standard of paying per frame - which is seen as putting extreme pressure on staff. It is also the first successful studio outside Tokyo, Prof Ryusuke Hikawa from Meiji University told NHK.More on this storyArson attack at Japan anime studio kills 3318 July 2019Kyoto Animation studio on fire18 July 2019Top StoriesLive. Russian warship seriously damaged as Ukraine claims strikeDamaged Russian warship: What we knowPublished1 hour agoNZ court allows China extradition in landmark casePublished2 hours agoFeaturesUkraine's battle for justice over alleged Russian war crimesCollecting the dead in BuchaThe Olympic champion who turned his back on PutinWhy people get away with hate speech in IndiaHow Russia's war threatens Brazil's indigenous landThe rising cost of living crisis bites NepalDo we finally know the cause of multiple sclerosis?How we spot fake news from Ukraine.

Eyewitnesses described a loud explosion followed by the blaze, which people jumped out of windows to escape from.""It was like I was looking at hell,"" a local woman told Asahi Shimbun newspaper.Image source, AFPImage caption, Authorities said most of the victims died whilst trying to escape to the building's roofAround 70 people were in the building when the fire started, and some 36 people have reportedly been taken to hospital.Authorities said most of the victims were found piled up on a stairway leading from the building's third floor up to the roof, where they collapsed trying to escape.Image source, AFPImage caption, It took firefighters five hours to bring the blaze under control, reports saidKyodo news agency said firefighters had found the door to the roof was shut, leaving people trapped inside. A Kyoto fire official also told Reuters news agency that the building did not have any sprinklers or indoor fire hydrants – but did not need them to comply with Japan's fire code.Momoko Higuchi, a Tokyo-based architect, told Reuters that the blaze was probably made worse by the building's three-storey spiral staircase, which would have ""[acted] as a chimney.""""Because the fire was with petrol, the effect was like a bomb,"" Mr Higuchi added.The fire was put out and police were searching the site for evidence. Knives were reportedly found at the scene.Details of the victims were not immediately released but Kyoto police said 20 women and 12 men were among the dead. One person has not yet been identified. KyoAni is known for employing more women, particularly younger women, than is usual in the profession, industry lawyer Daisuke Okeda told the New York Times.Men aged over 35 still dominate the animation industry, Mr Okeda said, but twice as many women in their 20s work as animators compared with their male counterparts.In response to the incident, the studio has cancelled screenings for the trailer of its latest film, a spin-off of the popular swimming anime series Free. It has also delayed a collaboration with Keihan Main Line, a railway service between Kyoto and Osaka.Another Japanese animation studio, David Production, postponed the broadcast of its latest episode of Fire Force. The animated series centres on a group of firefighters who have the ability to manipulate fire.Who is Kyoto Animation?Kyoto Animation was founded in 1981 and has produced popular animation shows including K-On and The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. The studio also creates film versions of some of its popular franchises, and released the standalone feature A Silent Voice in 2016 to critical acclaim.One of KyoAni's series, Violet Evergarden, was picked up by Netflix for a global market. It also publishes many popular graphic novels, mainly about teenage school life.KyoAni: The beloved studio making distinctive artThe studio is known for paying its animators a regular salary, breaking with the industry's standard of paying per frame - which is seen as putting extreme pressure on staff. It is also the first successful studio outside Tokyo, Prof Ryusuke Hikawa from Meiji University told NHK.More on this storyArson attack at Japan anime studio kills 3318 July 2019Kyoto Animation studio on fire18 July 2019",positive,en-GB,"{'https://www.bbc.com': 4, 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/accessibility/': 1, 'https://account.bbc.com/account?lang=en-GB&ptrt=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-49042992': 1, 'https://www.bbc.com/news': 3, 'https://www.bbc.com/sport': 3, 'https://www.bbc.com/reel': 3, 'https://www.bbc.com/worklife': 3, 'https://www.bbc.com/travel': 3, 'https://www.bbc.com/future': 3, 'https://www.bbc.com/culture': 3, 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/search': 1, 'https://www.bbc.com/culture/music': 2, 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/schedules/p00fzl9m': 2, 'https://www.bbc.com/weather': 2, 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds': 2, 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/usingthebbc/terms/can-i-share-things-from-the-bbc': 1, 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-49026944': 1, 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/world-europe-61101906': 1, 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-61103927': 1, 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-61102805': 1, 'https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20220411-the-managerial-obsession-with-busywork?utm_source=bbc-news&utm_medium=right-hand-slot': 1, 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/cbbc/quizzes/deadly-predators-which-deadly-predator-are-you-quiz#xtor=CS8-1000-%5BPromo_Box%5D-%5BNews_Promo%5D-%5BNews_Promo%5D-%5BPS_CBBC~N~~P_DeadlyPredatorsQuiz%5D': 1, 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m001495m/dodger-series-1-1-runaways?seriesId=m001495n#xtor=CS8-1000-%5BPromo_Box%5D-%5BNews_Promo%5D-%5BNews_Promo%5D-%5BPS_IPLAYER~N~m001495m~P_Dodger%5D': 1, 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/cbeebies/watch/cbeebies-get-creative-app#xtor=CS8-1000-%5BPromo_Box%5D-%5BNews_Promo%5D-%5BNews_Promo%5D-%5BPS_CBEEBIES~N~~P_GetCreativeApp%5D': 1, 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10628994': 1, 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/help-50068132': 1, 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10628323': 1, 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/20039682': 1, 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/usingthebbc/terms': 1, 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/aboutthebbc': 1, 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/usingthebbc/privacy': 1, 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/usingthebbc/cookies': 1, 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/accessibility': 1, 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/guidance': 1, 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/contact': 1, 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcnewsletter': 1, 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/help-41670342': 1, 'https://www.bbcglobalnews.com/home/': 1, 'https://www.bbc.com/usingthebbc/cookies/how-does-the-bbc-use-cookies-for-advertising/': 1, 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/editorialguidelines/guidance/feeds-and-links': 1}"

All of the anime community stands at your back. We will always catch you when you fall,"" are highlighting the special role the studio played for its fans. More victims are thought to be unaccounted for, while some 40 people are in hospital, reports say.Local police say they believe the fire was started by a man who broke into the studio on Thursday and ignited petrol. A special studio cultureKyoAni was founded in 1981 and has produced popular animation shows including K-On and The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya.The studio also released a standalone feature anime A Silent Voice, in 2016.

""It's very viewer-friendly.""The distinctive visual style and level of polish leads to a look that is instantly recognisable, Wolf said.""The studio makes very little in the way that is controversial... little that is violent or sexual. I can't imagine why anyone would want to attack it.""Some recent projects include Free, a show about a school boys' swimming team which has proved popular among women, and is set to have its own spin-off film to coincide with the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.A Silent Voice, on the other hand, is a stand-alone film based on a manga by Yoshitoki Oima. It is about a bully who torments a classmate with a hearing impairment, but later must come to terms with his actions when he is bullied himself. The Guardian gave it a four-star review, calling it ""a beguiling film: subtle, sensuous and delicate"".Aside from the quality of its content, the studio is also well regarded for the way it makes it. One Reddit user discussing the attack labelled it ""a beacon of what the anime industry should be"" for its staff policies and in-house training.That, Wolf said, was partly down to how their staff were paid.The studio is also known for paying its animators a regular salary, breaking with the industry's standard of paying per frame - which is seen as putting extreme pressure on staff. Tributes and donations""It's one of the best and largest animation firms in Japan,"" Tokyo-based film commentator Yuichi Maeda told Reuters news agency. ""With that loss of life, many of the best hands at animation in the nation are likely to be dead.""He said the studio's impact on the industry was much larger than the number of works it made would suggest. ""It's too painful to contemplate.""""It has a huge presence in animation here. To have this many people die at once will be a huge blow to the Japanese animation industry,"" he said.While KyoAni may be best known in Japan, news of the attack led to a huge outpouring of support from the anime community across the world.A GoFundMe campaign, started when the news broke, raised almost $100,000 (£80,000) in two hours, rising to more than $200,000 by 19:00 Tokyo time (10:00 GMT).It was started by Sentai Filmworks, a US-based distributor of Japanese cultural works. The vast majority of donations were small amounts of $50 or less from fans.It utterly breaks my heart after hearing what happened to #KyotoAnimation. It was through most of their titles that got me closer to the anime fandom, and made some of my favorite titles of all time.

14-04-2022,animation,7,0,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-49026944,Kyoto Animation: Fans heartbroken by deadly anime studio fire in Japan - BBC News,"Kyoto Animation: Fans heartbroken by deadly anime studio fire in JapanPublished18 July 2019SharecloseShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage source, AlamyImage caption, KyoAni's 2016 film A Silent Voice was critically well receivedFans around the globe have reacted with shock to the deadly fire at Japanese anime studio Kyoto Animation Co, known as KyoAni.Dozens were killed and injured in a blaze which is suspected to be an arson attack.Messages like, ""Stay strong KyoAni. All of the anime community stands at your back. We will always catch you when you fall,"" are highlighting the special role the studio played for its fans. More victims are thought to be unaccounted for, while some 40 people are in hospital, reports say.Local police say they believe the fire was started by a man who broke into the studio on Thursday and ignited petrol. A special studio cultureKyoAni was founded in 1981 and has produced popular animation shows including K-On and The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya.The studio also released a standalone feature anime A Silent Voice, in 2016. One of KyoAni's series, Violet Evergarden, was picked up by Netflix for a global market. #KyoAniStrong pic.twitter.com/nbLItFhEsF— Troy the Panda (@TheImpactPanda) July 18, 2019 The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on Twitter""One of the main things that stands out about Kyoto Animation is the quality of the animation itself,"" said Ian Wolf, an anime critic for Anime UK News. ""It's very viewer-friendly.""The distinctive visual style and level of polish leads to a look that is instantly recognisable, Wolf said.""The studio makes very little in the way that is controversial... little that is violent or sexual. I can't imagine why anyone would want to attack it.""Some recent projects include Free, a show about a school boys' swimming team which has proved popular among women, and is set to have its own spin-off film to coincide with the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.A Silent Voice, on the other hand, is a stand-alone film based on a manga by Yoshitoki Oima. It is about a bully who torments a classmate with a hearing impairment, but later must come to terms with his actions when he is bullied himself. The Guardian gave it a four-star review, calling it ""a beguiling film: subtle, sensuous and delicate"".Aside from the quality of its content, the studio is also well regarded for the way it makes it. One Reddit user discussing the attack labelled it ""a beacon of what the anime industry should be"" for its staff policies and in-house training.That, Wolf said, was partly down to how their staff were paid.The studio is also known for paying its animators a regular salary, breaking with the industry's standard of paying per frame - which is seen as putting extreme pressure on staff. Tributes and donations""It's one of the best and largest animation firms in Japan,"" Tokyo-based film commentator Yuichi Maeda told Reuters news agency. ""With that loss of life, many of the best hands at animation in the nation are likely to be dead.""He said the studio's impact on the industry was much larger than the number of works it made would suggest. ""It's too painful to contemplate.""""It has a huge presence in animation here. To have this many people die at once will be a huge blow to the Japanese animation industry,"" he said.While KyoAni may be best known in Japan, news of the attack led to a huge outpouring of support from the anime community across the world.A GoFundMe campaign, started when the news broke, raised almost $100,000 (£80,000) in two hours, rising to more than $200,000 by 19:00 Tokyo time (10:00 GMT).It was started by Sentai Filmworks, a US-based distributor of Japanese cultural works. The vast majority of donations were small amounts of $50 or less from fans.It utterly breaks my heart after hearing what happened to #KyotoAnimation. It was through most of their titles that got me closer to the anime fandom, and made some of my favorite titles of all time. Thank you KyoAni, for making my life a little more brighter. pic.twitter.com/bu1GB6VO59— Asher Edlin (@TheAfroOtaku) July 18, 2019 The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on Twitter""This company produced so many anime that helped shape me into who I am. Most of which were absolute masterpieces,"" wrote donor Darrian Harrison. ""KyoAni's works have been a part of my childhood,"" said LC Mendoza. Another donor, Mackenzie Haa, said Kyoto Animation ""is a model for the anime industry and deserves so much better than this.  I hope they come back stronger than ever after this tragedy"".Across the internet, fans are posting messages of condolence and support on discussion forums and message boards.Condolences to the staff at KyoAni https://t.co/1bdggx7ofd pic.twitter.com/NRR2u4aEdt— Maruse Rino (@maruse_rino) July 18, 2019 The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on TwitterThoughts with @kyoani!

She said the man was carrying two boxes that appeared to contain petrol cans.Two students also reported seeing a man on Wednesday evening dressed similarly to the suspect. One of the students said the man resembled Mr Aoba and was lying on a bench approximately 500m (1640ft) away from the office.What do we know about the suspect?Police detained Mr Aoba on suspicion of setting fire to the building. Mr Aoba had allegedly accused the animation studio of plagiarising his novel. People who witnessed Shinji Aoba's arrest said they heard him complaining that the company had stolen his ideas.Image source, ReutersImage caption, A crowdfunding campaign has raised more than $1.3m (£1.04m) to assist victims and their familiesHe was taken to hospital in Kyoto and, on Saturday, transferred to a hospital in Osaka. He has not yet been formally interviewed about his motive as police are waiting for him to recover from his injuries.Public broadcaster NHK reported that he had a criminal record and was previously jailed for stealing money from a convenience store. Kyoto Animation's president said he had recently received threatening letters but did not know if they were connected to the attack.What happened on Thursday?The fire broke out at the three-storey building at about 10:30 local time (01:35 GMT). Eyewitnesses described a loud explosion followed by a blaze, causing people to jump out of windows to escape.Police said the attacker entered the building and splashed flammable liquid from a bucket before setting it alight, and shouting: ""Die!""Authorities said most of the victims were found piled up on a stairway leading from the building's third floor up to the roof, where they collapsed trying to escape.Image source, ReutersImage caption, A firefighter inspects the interior of the torched Kyoto Animation buildingKyodo news agency said firefighters had found the door to the roof was shut, leaving people trapped inside. A Kyoto fire official also told Reuters news agency that the building did not have any sprinklers or indoor fire hydrants - but did not need them to comply with Japan's fire code.The fire was put out and police investigators searched the site for evidence.Kyoto Animation was founded in 1981 and has produced popular animation shows including K-On and The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. The studio also creates film versions of some of its popular franchises, and released the standalone feature A Silent Voice in 2016 to critical acclaim.More on this storyPolice name suspect in Japan animation studio fire19 July 2019Arson attack at Japan anime studio kills 3318 July 2019Kyoto Animation studio on fire18 July 2019Fans heartbroken by anime studio fire in Japan18 July 2019Top StoriesLive. Russian warship seriously damaged as Ukraine claims strikeDamaged Russian warship: What we knowPublished1 hour agoNZ court allows China extradition in landmark casePublished2 hours agoFeaturesUkraine's battle for justice over alleged Russian war crimesCollecting the dead in BuchaThe Olympic champion who turned his back on PutinWhy people get away with hate speech in IndiaHow Russia's war threatens Brazil's indigenous landThe rising cost of living crisis bites NepalDo we finally know the cause of multiple sclerosis?How we spot fake news from Ukraine.

14-04-2022,animation,2,0,https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/cowboy-bebop-netflix-live-action-review-b1960689.html,Cowboy Bebop Netflix: Live-action remake exposes the lingering snobbery about anime | The Independent,"Animation is a realm of boundless possibility. It is a mode of storytelling where no idea need go unexpressed, where no image is too fanciful to bring to life. When it comes to pushing the boundaries of animation, there aren’t too many better examples than Cowboy Bebop, the 1990s Japanese anime series about a band of interstellar bounty hunters. It’s often cited as an anime for people who otherwise wouldn’t touch it – a gateway drug to the form, compared to the tar heroin of something like Paranoia Agent or Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure. It is one of the finest examples of episodic animation to have ever been made.Despite this, or because of it, Cowboy Bebop has now been adapted into a live-action English-language series, arriving today on Netflix. Starring John Cho, Mustafa Shakir and Daniella Pineda, the remake has been met with excitement from fans of the original, but no small amount of trepidation. Though the series is painstakingly faithful to the anime in many regards – recreating its immediately recognisable opening credits beat for beat, for instance – early footage of the show also faced criticism for lacking the original’s visual elan. When the first reviews came in, they were roundly damning. But the problem with Bebop goes deeper than just a few drably lit backgrounds. It speaks to something fundamentally lacking in how anime is understood and valued in the west.There are many errant stereotypes about anime. That it’s for children. It’s too weird. It’s for nerds. It’s off-putting in its approach to sexuality. There are reasons for this, of course. Many of the most widely recognisable animes among western audiences have been made for children, such as Pokemon, Digimon and Dragon Ball Z. Some anime series and films are regressive or bizarre in their sexual politics, though not all. As for whether it’s for nerds? “Nerd culture” is just an epithet ascribed to material that exists outside the mainstream but lacks highbrow critical esteem. In recent years, the old signifiers of nerddom – superhero fiction, sci-fi films, video games – have been subsumed into the very heart of western mainstream culture. The conventional “nerd” stigma was then affixed to other, more niche pursuits, anime being one such. But anime can hardly be called a niche fascination any more, even in the west. The anime film Demon Slayer topped the global box office last year (admittedly in a year stunted by Covid), taking in more than half a billion dollars worldwide. Nearly $50m came from US cinemas; the UK contributed more than £1m in ticket sales (hardly a sensation – but not nothing, either).Bebop is not the only poorly received remake of an acclaimed anime to blight our screens in recent years. Ghost in the Shell took a seminal anime feature and bastardised it, controversially casting white American star Scarlett Johansson in the lead role. Western remakes of the seminal dystopian anime Akira and 2016’s hit body-switch romance Your Name are both supposedly in the works, with Taika Waititi somewhat ambiguously attached to make the former. There is, quite frankly, no reason for any of these projects to exist. Re-making them in live action is a transparent attempt to cash in on their greatness by repackaging it in a more widely marketable format, one that is sure to lose everything special and distinct about the originals. It’s telling that perhaps the best-known anime creator in the world, Studio Ghibli’s Hayao Miyazaki, has turned down a litany of adaptation offers for his films.Of course, the ill-fated live-action remake is not unique to anime. Disney are gradually ploughing through their catalogue of animated classics, re-imagining them as insipid CGI-laden remakes. The anime-inspired American series Avatar: The Last Airbender was adapted once, wretchedly, by M Night Shyamalan, with another Netflix live-action adaptation forthcoming. Though the stigma lessens with every generation that grows up in a post-Simpsons landscape, western animation still contends with many of the same inane prejudices as anime – that it is juvenile, that it is somehow less substantial than live-action fare. It’s just that anime faces the additional cultural barrier of being “foreign”, something that has always inhibited mainstream western audiences from enjoying some of film and TV’s very best.RecommendedJeff Bezos, The Wheel of Time and the futility of throwing cash at the tellySopranos’ Michael Imperioli and Steve Schirripa: ‘James Gandolfini never felt comfortable being the centre of attention’Gemma Whelan: ‘Pregnant women are not ill’I’m sure Cowboy Bebop’s defenders will point out that, at the very least, the new series will steer viewers towards the original (also available on Netflix). But that’s an awfully elaborate way to advertise a two-decade-old TV show. And it was doing just fine by itself, anyway. Cowboy Bebop was never meant to be source material for some glossier, more marketable re-hash. It was to be enjoyed on its own terms: as a dynamic, soulful whimsy that could only exist in animation.‘Cowboy Bebop’ is available to stream on Netflix from Friday 19 November",positive,en,"{'https://puzzles.independent.co.uk/?utm_campaign=navbar&utm_medium=nav&utm_source=navpuzzles': 1, 'https://www.indy100.com': 1, 'https://www.independentespanol.com/': 2, 'https://www.independent.co.uk/service/user-policies-a6184151.html': 2, 'https://www.independent.co.uk/service/cookie-policy-a6184186.html': 2, 'https://www.independent.co.uk/service/privacy-policy-a6184181.html': 2, 'https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en': 3, 'https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en': 3, 'https://www.independent.co.uk/vouchercodes/very': 2, 'https://www.independent.co.uk/vouchercodes/booking-com': 2, 'https://www.independent.co.uk/vouchercodes/debenhams': 2, 'https://www.independent.co.uk/vouchercodes/virgin-media': 2, 'https://www.independent.co.uk/vouchercodes/vodafone': 2, 'https://www.independent.co.uk': 5, 'https://independentjobs.independent.co.uk/': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/TheIndependentOnline': 1, 'https://twitter.com/Independent': 1, 'https://www.independentarabia.com/': 1, 'https://www.indyturk.com/': 1, 'https://www.independentpersian.com/': 1, 'https://www.independenturdu.com/': 1, 'https://www.standard.co.uk/': 1, 'http://en.novayagazeta.ru/': 1, 'https://www.independentadvertising.com/': 1, 'https://www.independentadvertising.com/licensing-and-syndication/': 1, 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-independent/jobs/': 1, 'https://static.independent.co.uk/static-assets/IDNMLModSlav0721.pdf': 1, 'https://independentnews.zendesk.com/hc/en-us': 1}"

14-04-2022,animation,2,0,https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/best-anime-on-netflix-b1863408.html,Nine of the best anime shows to stream on Netflix: From Demon Slayer to Parasyste | The Independent,"Despite first appearances, there is so much more to anime than just Studio Ghibli.While the likes of Howl’s Moving Castle and Kiki’s Delivery Service have rightfully managed to break through to Western audiences, a whole wealth of Japanese animation is still waiting to be discovered. And contrary to what Netflix’s singular “anime” category suggests, anime is vast and sprawling. The style spans numerous sub-genres and sub-sub-genres. From ultra-violent revenge tales and “chick flick-style” romances to emotional musings on adolescence and premises so wacky it’s tricky to describe them – anime has it all. In a year where we’ve needed new forms of entertainment more than ever, people’s viewing palettes have expanded to encompass new genres and new languages – but if you’re yet to try anime then you can find a list below of titles to start with. Spirited Away is just the tip of a beautifully animated iceberg. Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no YaibaDemon Slayer is one of the most successful anime shows right now. Its film adaptation last year became Japan’s biggest box office hit ever, usurping Studio Ghibli’s Spirited Away after two decades at the top. Demon Slayer tells the story of a young boy Tanjiro Kamado who seeks revenge after his family is slaughtered by demons who have also cursed his younger sister Nezuko. Demon Slayer (Netflix)Your Lie in AprilNot every anime is violent or action-packed; this tearjerker has more romantic inclinations. When a young piano prodigy named Kousei loses his mother – with whom he had a complicated relationship – he finds himself suddenly unable to hear the sound of his own playing. Then he meets Kaori Miyazono who helps him rediscover his passion for piano. The emotional component is only one aspect of the show’s appeal; its aesthetic as well as its musical qualities are second to none.NarutoIf you want to really sink your teeth into anime, the Naruto franchise is a good place to start. Naruto spans 720 episodes, 11 animated specials, 11 films and 700 chapters of manga. The show’s premise is simple enough: Naruto Uzumaki is a young ninja who works with friends to complete various missions. Naruto is one of the most beloved anime of all time, known for its character development and action sequences. Your Lie in April (Netflix)Devilman CrybabyThe limited series consists of only 10 episodes, meaning you can knock out Devilman Crybaby in one sitting. Equal parts nihilistic and tragic, the series is a testament to just how narratively rich anime can be. Worlds collide when Akira becomes Devilman, a hybrid-being with the power of a demon and a human soul. The series is infinitely less cheesy than its log-line admittedly sounds. ParasyteIn an unexpected turn of events, a teenager – Shinichi – and an alien worm – Migi – join forces to battle an onslaught of parasites that threaten to consume humans and take over the earth. Horror, gore and an offbeat sense of humour await viewers who stick it out past the absurd synopsis. Devilman Crybaby (Netflix)BakiNetflix describes Baki in two words: violent and exciting. Suffice to say, the series delivers on both. The show is a long-running franchise – based on Keisuke Itagaki’s popular manga Baki The Grappler – that has been given a new lease of life thanks to the streaming giant. Taking place directly after the events of the original anime, Baki is an outrageous and fun ride about a young martial arts master who must evade five death row convicts who are out to get him. Food Wars! Shokugeki No SomaIt’s difficult to describe the premise of Food Wars! without putting prospective viewers off. An aspiring young chef Yukihira Soma studies at the Totsuki Culinary Academy, where he faces off with other budding chefs in ridiculously over-the-top cooking battles that are called “food wars”. Slapstick comedy and a chef’s attention to detail make for a thoroughly entertaining, if bizarre, viewing experience. Be warned though, the idea of a “foodgasm” – a tasting experience so fulfilling, it’s described as sexual – is depicted rather graphically in this series.Food Wars! Shokugeki No Soma (Netflix)Your NameAlthough Your Name is a film and not a show, it would be remiss to leave this masterpiece off any anime list. This romantic fantasy film will win over anyone with lingering reservations about a beginner’s guide to anime. The premise is simple enough (a bored girl living in the countryside and a high-school boy in Tokyo suddenly and inexplicably begin to swap bodies), but is brought to life through stunning animation and superb voice acting. Also available to watch on Netflix is The Garden of Words by the same director Makoto Shinkai.

14-04-2022,animation,2,0,https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/japan-anime-belle-beauty-beast-b1924157.html,"In Japan’s anime universe, ‘Belle’ is rewriting Beauty and the Beast | The Independent","In her life in rural Japan, Suzu is a freckled and shy 17-year-old who is self-conscious about her looks and has lost her will to play music after her mum’s death.But in the virtual world, known as “U”, she transforms into Belle, an enchanting, global, pop superstar with flowing pink hair and a mesmerising facial design that resembles freckles.The animated film Belle – a hit in Japan that will make its UK debut at the BFI London Film Festival in October – also carries a bit of artistic rebellion.RecommendedLondon Film Festival 2021: From Spencer to Titane, the 12 best films at this year’s eventThe film’s message of female empowerment has gained attention for flipping the script on anime, Japan’s signature style of animated films and graphic novels that often portrays girls and women as weak, vacuous and hyper-sexualised. The message has resonated in Japan as growing numbers of women call for change – most recently laid bare in a string of sexist comments by high-ranking Olympics officials that drew a fierce backlash.“I feel that women characters in Japanese anime are often depicted through a lens of desire leading to their sexual exploitation and too much is brushed off as a freedom of expression,” the film’s director, Mamoru Hosoda, says at his Studio Chizu, his animation studio in a Tokyo suburb.  But problematic female representation in anime, especially in television shows aimed at males, has been a concern for gender equality advocatesFrom Disney princesses to Marvel superheroes, from anime to pop music, creators across genres are rethinking how to portray women and girls with agency and dignity and show that beauty does not mean having to be “perfect”. Global movements such as #MeToo have also underscored a sense of common purpose.Hosoda said he hopes to draw attention to the ways that Japanese animation has shaped the public’s perceptions of women and girls and what it means to be beautiful and powerful.“Such exploitation [has been] … justified with the notion that it’s happening in a fantasy world and not in reality. But I feel that, surely, such perceptions are connected and will influence our reality,” he says at his office, decorated with posters and figurines.Access unlimited streaming of movies and TV shows with Amazon Prime Video Sign up now for a 30-day free trialSign upJapanese animation, which includes anime and manga, is among the country’s biggest cultural exports and has become popular on digital streaming. But problematic female representation in anime, especially in television shows aimed at males, has been a concern for gender equality advocates. Such depictions are both overt – exaggerated breasts and barely clothed girls – and subtle, such as storylines in which girls are damsels in distress and secondary to boys.In recent years, directors such as Hosoda have sought to challenge views in Japanese society that can devalue women, says Akiko Sugawa, a professor in gender and anime studies at Yokohama National University.“Anime has the power to create and break gender stereotypes,” she says. Anime director Mamoru Hosoda at his office in Tokyo  ( The Washington Post by Shiho Fukada)Sugawa says there is still much room for improvement, including the need for more women and LGBTQ anime directors. “There are now more positive portrayals of LGBTQ characters, issues and works that pose questions about societal problems. And with the rise of more diverse directors and anime decision-makers, there’s hope for more change to come,” Sugawa says. Belle is a modern twist on the Disney classic Beauty and the Beast. After her mother dies while trying to save a child from danger, Suzu struggles to fit in at school. She joins the virtual world “U” as Belle, a talented performer with eye-catching outfits who instantaneously gains billions of followers.With the computer savvy of her female best friend and the emotional support of her late mother’s female friends, Suzu/Belle embarks on an adventure to help a mysterious beast. Along the way, Belle performs several songs that can now be heard throughout shopping districts of Tokyo. Since its release in July, Belle has become Japan’s third-highest-grossing film this year.Hosoda seeks to give women and girls greater depth and humanity than is normally depicted in anime. Through Suzu/Belle, he juxtaposes the way that the inner beauty of Suzu and dynamism of Belle coexist in one person. For Suzu, an introverted teenager, her online persona is not just an imagination or an escape but rather a part of herself that she eventually grows into. Hosoda says he wanted to give Belle more complexity, in the way the character of Beast in the Disney film was afforded that depth. “Just like the beast having a duality, I wanted Belle to also have two sides and focus on how the two sides come to play, ultimately leading to her self-growth,” he says. Mamoru Hosoda draws at his Studio Chizu in Tokyo ( The Washington Post by Shiho Fukada)Hosoda received a 14-minute standing ovation when his film premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in July. Belle has been replicated by “cosplayers”, who dress up as anime characters. The animated character Belle “performed” the film’s title song at the Fuji Rock Festival last month.On social media, Japanese fans have raved about the positive message, stunning visuals and catchy tunes. “Those who are feeling difficulty in their lives, those who want to change but can’t, I hope they see this film. It really helps you take a step forward,” one fan tweeted.Hosoda, 53, has long focused on the cyber world in his works, including the film versions of Digimon in1999 and 2000 and from his earliest feature films such as Summer Wars. He has depicted women and girls as independent and strong-willed characters, including the 2018 Mirai, a story about a boy who lashes out after his sister is born but learns the importance of family bonds. The film earned Hosoda an Oscar nomination for best animated feature film.But through Belle, Hosoda has delivered perhaps his most explicit message about female empowerment and the power of technology as a force for good. He says he was inspired by his five-year-old daughter, as he contemplates the future she faces. “She is still in preschool and is quite introverted, so I imagined how she was going to survive once she gets on social media and begins having all sorts of online interactions,” he says.

14-04-2022,animation,1,0,https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/cowboy-bebop-remake-netflix-live-action-anime-spike-spiegel-a8656351.html,Cowboy Bebop remake: Do we really need Netflix's live action series? | The Independent | The Independent,"In another step towards global media domination, Netflix today announced a live-action remake of the anime series Cowboy Bebop. To say that this is a risky venture would be an understatement. As the first anime ever to be broadcast in the United States, thanks to Adult Swim, it’s considered by many in the West (myself included) as their gateway into the world of Japanese animation. Its unique characters, setting and storyline, sublime score and finite run time (one season and one movie) is something that simply doesn’t come along very often and I urge each and every one of you to watch it. But this news raises a very interesting question: why produce a live-action remake?Cowboy Bebop - TrailerA Bebop live-action movie has been gossiped about for years on internet fan forums and respectable news sites, with actors such as Keanu Reeves rumoured to play Spike Spiegel in a Western adaptation. But, as with many internet rumours, these never came to pass. Clearly, it took a giant like Netflix (and Netflix’s money) to finally take the plunge and reproduce what many believe to be a near-sacred chapter of anime‘s history. For die-hard fans, and those who appreciate the overwhelming contribution Bebop has made to anime – and to how anime is perceived in the West – news of a live-action remake could be a cause of concern. However, there are glimmers of hope; Shinichiro Watanabe, Bebop’s original director has been brought on as a consultant on the project, which, if they listen to his guidance, will make the world of difference. His follow-ups of Samurai Champloo and Kids on the Slope are masterpieces, and Netflix getting him on the payroll is probably one of the most sensible aspects of this somewhat crazy project. However, the likes of set designers Shoji Kawamori and Isamu Imakake, and mecha designer Kimitoshi Yamane from the original anime all, at present anyway, seem missing from this initial announcement. Yes, Mr Watanabe was the spark that made the Bebop and Swordfish fly, but without the geniuses who helped craft his world, the ships and vehicles and the tech on display – we could be left with a lifeless series dressed up scraps trying to cosplay as its elder brother.When anime live-action remakes are done badly, or merely half-baked, they’re excruciating to watch. Take, for instance, the Dragon Ball Z movie or the slow-motion car-crash that was M Night Shyamalan‘s The Last Airbender. But, despite the overwhelming evidence that live-action anime adaptations or remakes don’t work, there have been some diamonds in the rough, and Bebop may turn out to be one of them. Shusuke Kaneko’s Death Note movies were, unlike the Netflix adaptation, a fairly faithful re-tread of the original manga and anime. This year’s Bleach movie, adapted from Kubo Tite’s hugely successful Shonen Jump manga, landed surprisingly well with both fans and newcomers alike (you can even watch it on Netflix). And, Park Chan-wook‘s incredible Oldboy is a hammer to the face of anyone who says that live-action adaptations don’t work – Oldboy was, in fact, a crime manga from 1996. Another detail that could make or break this venture for Netflix is the music – an aspect that many argue is the lifeblood of Cowboy Bebop. The amazing soundtrack written by Yoko Kanno and performed by her band Seatbelts raised Bebop from an exceptional anime to the high pedestal that fans place it on 30 years later. As you can probably tell from the title, the music is integral to the lore and fabric of the entire series. You could even go so far to say that remaking Bebop with a new soundtrack wouldn’t work – the songs are as much a part of the characters a their names and story arc themselves. Many will breathe a sigh of relief if Netflix announced that they were simply going to re-use Yoko Kanno and Seatbelts recordings, but I fear we may have to endure a “re-imagined” version of the opening theme “Tank”.Personally, I feel no one really asked for a live action re-make. When speaking to someone about “where to start with anime” the first answer is almost always stream Bebop - it’s 26 sessions (episodes) of pure perfection and an excellent starting place for anyone in the gargantuan world of anime. Netflix was already golden in many fans’ eyes for simply licensing the sub and dub of the series and streaming it on their service – we no longer had to go hunting for the DVD box sets. Which raises the real question: who is this remake for? I doubt it’s for the fans, despite having no new Bebop since 2003 they’re not crying out for more. It’s not for people who have never seen the series, unless Netflix has managed to create some sort of mind reading machine they haven’t told us about. So, is this live-action remake simply be for people who don’t like watching anime or animated shows? If that’s the case, who are these people, what do they have against animation and how can they ignore a plethora of interesting stories, settings and characters simply because of how they’re produced?Whatever happens, it seems thanks to Netflix we really will “see you space cowboy…”Sunrise / Netflix (Sunrise / Netflix) ",positive,en,"{'https://puzzles.independent.co.uk/?utm_campaign=navbar&utm_medium=nav&utm_source=navpuzzles': 1, 'https://www.indy100.com': 1, 'https://www.independentespanol.com/': 2, 'https://www.independent.co.uk/author/josh-withey': 1, 'https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/netflix': 1, 'https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/cowboy-bebop-netflix-live-action-tv-series-anime-tomorrow-studios-cast-release-a8655326.html': 1, 'https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/anime': 2, 'https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/m-night-shyamalan-0': 2, 'https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/death-note': 1, 'https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/park-chan-wook': 2, 'https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/oldboy': 1, 'https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/cowboy-bebop': 1, 'https://www.independent.co.uk/service/user-policies-a6184151.html': 2, 'https://www.independent.co.uk/service/cookie-policy-a6184186.html': 2, 'https://www.independent.co.uk/service/privacy-policy-a6184181.html': 2, 'https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en': 3, 'https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en': 3, 'https://www.independent.co.uk/vouchercodes/very': 2, 'https://www.independent.co.uk/vouchercodes/booking-com': 2, 'https://www.independent.co.uk/vouchercodes/debenhams': 2, 'https://www.independent.co.uk/vouchercodes/virgin-media': 2, 'https://www.independent.co.uk/vouchercodes/vodafone': 2, 'https://www.independent.co.uk': 5, 'https://independentjobs.independent.co.uk/': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/TheIndependentOnline': 1, 'https://twitter.com/Independent': 1, 'https://www.independentarabia.com/': 1, 'https://www.indyturk.com/': 1, 'https://www.independentpersian.com/': 1, 'https://www.independenturdu.com/': 1, 'https://www.standard.co.uk/': 1, 'http://en.novayagazeta.ru/': 1, 'https://www.independentadvertising.com/': 1, 'https://www.independentadvertising.com/licensing-and-syndication/': 1, 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-independent/jobs/': 1, 'https://static.independent.co.uk/static-assets/IDNMLModSlav0721.pdf': 1, 'https://independentnews.zendesk.com/hc/en-us': 1}"
