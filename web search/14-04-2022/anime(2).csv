14-04-2022,anime,2,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/preview-guide/2022/spring/the-dawn-of-the-witch/.183529,The Dawn of the Witch - The Spring 2022 Preview Guide - Anime News Network:SEA,"    The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Dawn of the Witch   Apr  8th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Dawn of the Witch ?                     Community score: 3.5              What is this?   The world is now at peace after having endured a conflict between the church and witches for 500 years. However, embers of war still burn in some regions of the world. Cervil is a hopeless student at the Kingdom of Wenias' College of Magic. Cervil has somehow lost all memory of his time before attending the college. The school's headmaster Albus sends him for special training to the southern part of the continent, where persecution against witches runs strong.    The Dawn of the Witch is based on Kakeru Kobashiri's light novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Dawn of the Witch did not make the best first impression on me. We're deep into premiere season, it's late, I'm tired, etc, and I'm out of patience for shows that introduces its female characters either thighs/crotch first or tits first. I have zero familiarity with Grimoire of Zero, and while this is a standalone spinoff, I definitely got the nagging feeling I was supposed to be familiar with at least a few of these faces.    Once I was ready to forgive the show its trespasses, I did actually find a lot to draw me in. The story starts at a magic academy in a region where magic is accepted, thanks to the end of a war several centuries ago. However, since there are still places where mages are treated as other, the academy's best student, worst student, and a 300-year-old witch with the body of a ten-year-old and garter-clad thighs are going on what boils down to a humanitarian mission to build a safe home for them. Oh, and Saybil, the worst student, needs this mission to be successful, or else he'll lose what memories he's accumulated since developing amnesia three years ago.    It's a decent sentiment with a good heart, and I was surprised by a clunky-but-well-intentioned moment when Saybil called his travel companion out on her microaggressions against their beastfallen classmate. And yet, it just doesn't quite gel. Not because the fan service was particularly obtrusive—other than those crotch-first and boob-first intros, it was actually quite low-key—but because there's just no chemistry between the characters. There was a lot of walking and talking, camping and talking, and so on, and I just wasn't having fun watching them banter. There wasn't much sense of a connection and any playfulness felt forced.    Maybe someone who already knows and likes Grimoire of Zero will get more out of Dawn of the Witch. For me, it feels like wasted potential.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                While I've never felt the need to go back and rewatch the Grimoire of Zero, I do have fond memories of the little witch and her giant teddy bear of a mercenary. So returning to this world, with or without Zero in the drivers seat, is a lot of fun. There are a lot of familiar faces (it's great to see Albus all grown up) and it's interesting to see how everything has progressed since the last time we were here.    As fun as all the connections are, the basic story is perfectly understandable even if you've never seen Grimoire of Zero. Our viewpoint character, Saybil, is an amnesic magic student (though, in a twist on the trope, the memory loss happened three years previously). His personal conflict is simple: he's the school's worst mage and if he can't improve he'll be kicked out of the academy. If this happens, his knowledge of magic will be erased from his mind—basically reverting him right back to his post-amnesia state.    Then we have the titular Dawn Witch herself, a 300-year-old with the body of a little girl. While I could do without the constant panty shots, she is an intriguing character. Though egotistical and entitled, she seems to have the wisdom to match. Her connection to her staff is likewise interesting—as is everyone's reactions to how she uses a witch-killing weapon for everyday menial tasks.    The only issue I had with the show is that it really needs to lay out some of its proper nouns and a bit more of its history. While terms like “mage” and “witch” are thrown about, we don't get any clear answer on the difference between them (if any exists). And while we know there was a war between witches and the church, a bit more of the specifics would help us understand the trouble our heroes have already found themselves in with the Witch Hunters. But, all in all, this episode lays some solid ground work and makes me want to see not only what is to come for Sable and Loux but how Zero is connected to everything as well.      James Beckett  Rating:                I feel a little embarrassed, because it wasn't more than a week ago that I suddenly found myself thinking, “Man, remember Grimoire of Zero?” I hadn't thought about the show in years, not since I reviewed it, but for some reason I found myself feeling ever so slightly nostalgic for the flawed but fun fantasy adventure. “I wonder whatever happened to that big ol' cat-man and his tiny witch girlfriend?” And yet, I was completely unaware going into Dawn of the Witch that this was actually a sequel to Grimoire of Zero, and it took me a minute to even realize it. I must have zoned out a little during the OP, since Zero and Mercenary make very clear and obvious appearances in it, but it was right around the part where a wolf-man named Holdem was yelling about a woman named Albus that I started to connect the dots.    Dawn of the Witch is a really direct sequel, as it turns out, despite jumping ahead a number of years in the timeline, not to mention the major shakeup in visual style on account of the new production team. I had to go back to watch the end of GoZ to refresh my memory, but that series does indeed end with young Albus starting up a brand-new magic academy in Wenias, and promising to build a world where witches and humans can live in peace. At the start of Dawn of the Witch, it seems like she's making headway on that goal, too, though there's still a long way to go. This is what gets our four main characters started on their journey, and it's also where my issues with Dawn of the Witch really take hold.    While it was surprisingly fun to catch up with this universe and see what's become of some of the characters since Grimoire ended, this premiere just doesn't do a great job of getting me to give a damn about its own story and cast. Saybil is a total nothing of a protagonist, and Loux is the grating and unlikable inverse of Zero. It doesn't help that the camera goes out of its way to zoom in on her crotch with absolutely no shame, or even a sense of proper framing. Holt and Kudo are barely developed outside of the fact that Holt is very busty and flirtatious with Saybil, which is odd considering that Saybil has no discernable personality whatsoever. Kudo is…a lizard. That's about it.    Nobody will ever mistake Grimoire of Zero for great television, and it says something that I went nearly five years before remembering that I spent a whole season watching and reviewing the show, but it was a decent fantasy anime all things considered. Dawn of the Witch hasn't elicited any reaction from me whatsoever, which is a very poor place for a series premiere to find itself in. Maybe the show will pick up once the new cast finds its footing, or if Zero and Mercenary return to liven up the proceedings. If that isn't the case, though, then Dawn of the Witch seems destined to be overshadowed by its older sibling, and it isn't like GoZ cast all that large of a shadow in the first place.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                If you weren't aware, The Dawn of the Witch is set in the same world as Grimoire of Zero, although I don't think that's any impediment to just jumping in here. There are probably some world-building elements that work better if you're familiar with Grimoire of Zero, and that particular book does get a mention in this episode, but it's otherwise a pretty standard sword-and-sorcery setup, with beastpeople (known as beastfallen), magic users, witch hunters, and a vaguely Medieval sensibility. Well, and there's the headmaster of a magic school named Albus, but maybe we won't dwell on that.    This episode suffers most from two things: being very much about setting the stage for the more interesting things to come and Loux being kind of annoying. Loux could be Beatrice's cousin from Re: Zero in some ways, and I do think the choice to use the archaic informal second person (thee/thou/thy) largely works for her attitude of superiority. She's absolutely the kind of person who would deliberately speak informally to everyone just to show that she considers herself above them, something that Hort and Saybil notice when she leaves them behind to go chase witch hunters. But she's the sort of character who could wear with length of use, which could be an issue if she's got too much time in the spotlight.    The fact that Loux is also used for the bottom half of the fanservice may also rub some people the wrong way. We get plenty of shots of her crotch as she sits with her legs splayed, which is mostly noticeable because of how ridiculous her skirt's design is. Hort takes over the top half of the fanservice with her shirt that's patterned so that her breasts look like a wrapped present, and it is kind of amusing how obviously the art is trying to have it all by the way Hort is always shown boobs-first while Loux is shown thighs-first. Mostly the issue is that Loux, despite being 300 years old, looks pretty darn prepubescent, because really, she can sit however is most comfortable for her. Not that Saybil notices any of this, being about as blank a slate as you can get and having no discernable personality whatsoever. It's frankly the least believable part of the episode that Hort likes him so much.    Mostly this episode just sort of exists. There are some hints that the story could improve once the tedious set up is finished, so this probably isn't one to just write off immediately. But on the other hand, Goodreads assures me that I've read the first volume of the manga version and I can't remember a darn thing about it. Make of that what you will.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               This show exists in a weird bit of adaptation limbo. It's based on a series of light novels that are themselves a sequel to the Grimoire of Zero novel series. I'm one of the 10 people who watched and still vaguely remember the 2017 Grimoire anime, but that show only covered the first couple volumes of a much longer story. So while I recognize some returning characters and understand the basic makeup of this particular fantasy world, I could not tell you how we got from the adventures of Tony the Tiger and his pint-sized witch gremlin to this new status quo. The good news is this is largely a new story, and anything immediately important is explained pretty quickly in this episode, so newcomers and non-LN readers alike should be able to follow along. The bad news is that doesn't make this episode any more interesting or entertaining.    The big issue with this new series is that it's centered on, by far, its least engaging character. Saybil's amnesia and mysterious past are supposed to entice you to learn more about him, but in practice he's a dead-eyed cipher who intakes exposition and outputs nothing of interest. Nearly any other character introduced here would be more engaging to follow as a protagonist, with the possible exception of the titular Witch of the Dawn, Loux. On top of being a 300-year-old little girl who can't stop flashing her panties to the camera, she's just an annoying presence who's only tolerable when she's acting her age instead of playing up her miniscule appearance. So the thought of watching her mentor our deadweight lead is deathly unappealing. That stands in stark contrast to Mercenary and Zero's dynamic in the first series, and it makes me question why these two are our leads when there's some perfectly engaging characters right next to them.    Maybe that's just because we barely get any time with Holt or Kudo so they don't have a chance to disappoint us, but just on the surface they both strike me as way more active, layered characters to build your story around. Holt is a star magic pupil who seemingly comes from a harsh background where she learned to put on a kind smile to avoid confrontation, which raises questions about her past that actually make her more interesting, unlike Saybil. Kudo, meanwhile, is a rough-mannered beast-man who nonetheless has a strong sense of justice and acts selflessly in his own way. Hell, just in this episode it's brought up that witches used to sacrifice beast-people, so the idea of one studying magic to become a witch is a rock-solid concept that all but begs for further exploration. Why, then, is his entire story this episode offscreen? Is has to be more interesting than watching our amnesiac sadboi hero vomit on a cart ride.    That's what really makes this premiere frustrating, on its own and as a follow-up to Grimoire of Zero. I know there's an interesting fantasy world behind all this, with a rich history just waiting to be explored, and presumably even more new things that have happened since the first anime wrapped up. If this were just some generic isekai world I could write it off as a dull waste of time and be done, but there's so much potential here that is just being left to rot. I might stick around for another episode or two, just to see if the elements I liked get some actual focus, but I can't give this much of a recommendation right now.     discuss this in the forum (291 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 3.5              What is this?   The world is now at peace after having endured a conflict between the church and witches for 500 years. However, embers of war still burn in some regions of the world. Cervil is a hopeless student at the Kingdom of Wenias' College of Magic. Cervil has somehow lost all memory of his time before attending the college. The school's headmaster Albus sends him for special training to the southern part of the continent, where persecution against witches runs strong.    The Dawn of the Witch is based on Kakeru Kobashiri's light novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Dawn of the Witch did not make the best first impression on me. We're deep into premiere season, it's late, I'm tired, etc, and I'm out of patience for shows that introduces its female characters either thighs/crotch first or tits first. I have zero familiarity with Grimoire of Zero, and while this is a standalone spinoff, I definitely got the nagging feeling I was supposed to be familiar with at least a few of these faces.    Once I was ready to forgive the show its trespasses, I did actually find a lot to draw me in. The story starts at a magic academy in a region where magic is accepted, thanks to the end of a war several centuries ago. However, since there are still places where mages are treated as other, the academy's best student, worst student, and a 300-year-old witch with the body of a ten-year-old and garter-clad thighs are going on what boils down to a humanitarian mission to build a safe home for them. Oh, and Saybil, the worst student, needs this mission to be successful, or else he'll lose what memories he's accumulated since developing amnesia three years ago.    It's a decent sentiment with a good heart, and I was surprised by a clunky-but-well-intentioned moment when Saybil called his travel companion out on her microaggressions against their beastfallen classmate. And yet, it just doesn't quite gel. Not because the fan service was particularly obtrusive—other than those crotch-first and boob-first intros, it was actually quite low-key—but because there's just no chemistry between the characters. There was a lot of walking and talking, camping and talking, and so on, and I just wasn't having fun watching them banter. There wasn't much sense of a connection and any playfulness felt forced.    Maybe someone who already knows and likes Grimoire of Zero will get more out of Dawn of the Witch. For me, it feels like wasted potential.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                While I've never felt the need to go back and rewatch the Grimoire of Zero, I do have fond memories of the little witch and her giant teddy bear of a mercenary. So returning to this world, with or without Zero in the drivers seat, is a lot of fun. There are a lot of familiar faces (it's great to see Albus all grown up) and it's interesting to see how everything has progressed since the last time we were here.    As fun as all the connections are, the basic story is perfectly understandable even if you've never seen Grimoire of Zero. Our viewpoint character, Saybil, is an amnesic magic student (though, in a twist on the trope, the memory loss happened three years previously). His personal conflict is simple: he's the school's worst mage and if he can't improve he'll be kicked out of the academy. If this happens, his knowledge of magic will be erased from his mind—basically reverting him right back to his post-amnesia state.    Then we have the titular Dawn Witch herself, a 300-year-old with the body of a little girl. While I could do without the constant panty shots, she is an intriguing character. Though egotistical and entitled, she seems to have the wisdom to match. Her connection to her staff is likewise interesting—as is everyone's reactions to how she uses a witch-killing weapon for everyday menial tasks.    The only issue I had with the show is that it really needs to lay out some of its proper nouns and a bit more of its history. While terms like “mage” and “witch” are thrown about, we don't get any clear answer on the difference between them (if any exists). And while we know there was a war between witches and the church, a bit more of the specifics would help us understand the trouble our heroes have already found themselves in with the Witch Hunters. But, all in all, this episode lays some solid ground work and makes me want to see not only what is to come for Sable and Loux but how Zero is connected to everything as well.      James Beckett  Rating:                I feel a little embarrassed, because it wasn't more than a week ago that I suddenly found myself thinking, “Man, remember Grimoire of Zero?” I hadn't thought about the show in years, not since I reviewed it, but for some reason I found myself feeling ever so slightly nostalgic for the flawed but fun fantasy adventure. “I wonder whatever happened to that big ol' cat-man and his tiny witch girlfriend?” And yet, I was completely unaware going into Dawn of the Witch that this was actually a sequel to Grimoire of Zero, and it took me a minute to even realize it. I must have zoned out a little during the OP, since Zero and Mercenary make very clear and obvious appearances in it, but it was right around the part where a wolf-man named Holdem was yelling about a woman named Albus that I started to connect the dots.    Dawn of the Witch is a really direct sequel, as it turns out, despite jumping ahead a number of years in the timeline, not to mention the major shakeup in visual style on account of the new production team. I had to go back to watch the end of GoZ to refresh my memory, but that series does indeed end with young Albus starting up a brand-new magic academy in Wenias, and promising to build a world where witches and humans can live in peace. At the start of Dawn of the Witch, it seems like she's making headway on that goal, too, though there's still a long way to go. This is what gets our four main characters started on their journey, and it's also where my issues with Dawn of the Witch really take hold.    While it was surprisingly fun to catch up with this universe and see what's become of some of the characters since Grimoire ended, this premiere just doesn't do a great job of getting me to give a damn about its own story and cast. Saybil is a total nothing of a protagonist, and Loux is the grating and unlikable inverse of Zero. It doesn't help that the camera goes out of its way to zoom in on her crotch with absolutely no shame, or even a sense of proper framing. Holt and Kudo are barely developed outside of the fact that Holt is very busty and flirtatious with Saybil, which is odd considering that Saybil has no discernable personality whatsoever.

Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               This show exists in a weird bit of adaptation limbo. It's based on a series of light novels that are themselves a sequel to the Grimoire of Zero novel series. I'm one of the 10 people who watched and still vaguely remember the 2017 Grimoire anime, but that show only covered the first couple volumes of a much longer story. So while I recognize some returning characters and understand the basic makeup of this particular fantasy world, I could not tell you how we got from the adventures of Tony the Tiger and his pint-sized witch gremlin to this new status quo. The good news is this is largely a new story, and anything immediately important is explained pretty quickly in this episode, so newcomers and non-LN readers alike should be able to follow along. The bad news is that doesn't make this episode any more interesting or entertaining.    The big issue with this new series is that it's centered on, by far, its least engaging character. Saybil's amnesia and mysterious past are supposed to entice you to learn more about him, but in practice he's a dead-eyed cipher who intakes exposition and outputs nothing of interest. Nearly any other character introduced here would be more engaging to follow as a protagonist, with the possible exception of the titular Witch of the Dawn, Loux. On top of being a 300-year-old little girl who can't stop flashing her panties to the camera, she's just an annoying presence who's only tolerable when she's acting her age instead of playing up her miniscule appearance. So the thought of watching her mentor our deadweight lead is deathly unappealing. That stands in stark contrast to Mercenary and Zero's dynamic in the first series, and it makes me question why these two are our leads when there's some perfectly engaging characters right next to them.    Maybe that's just because we barely get any time with Holt or Kudo so they don't have a chance to disappoint us, but just on the surface they both strike me as way more active, layered characters to build your story around. Holt is a star magic pupil who seemingly comes from a harsh background where she learned to put on a kind smile to avoid confrontation, which raises questions about her past that actually make her more interesting, unlike Saybil. Kudo, meanwhile, is a rough-mannered beast-man who nonetheless has a strong sense of justice and acts selflessly in his own way. Hell, just in this episode it's brought up that witches used to sacrifice beast-people, so the idea of one studying magic to become a witch is a rock-solid concept that all but begs for further exploration. Why, then, is his entire story this episode offscreen? Is has to be more interesting than watching our amnesiac sadboi hero vomit on a cart ride.    That's what really makes this premiere frustrating, on its own and as a follow-up to Grimoire of Zero. I know there's an interesting fantasy world behind all this, with a rich history just waiting to be explored, and presumably even more new things that have happened since the first anime wrapped up. If this were just some generic isekai world I could write it off as a dull waste of time and be done, but there's so much potential here that is just being left to rot. I might stick around for another episode or two, just to see if the elements I liked get some actual focus, but I can't give this much of a recommendation right now.     discuss this in the forum (291 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives    ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 3.5              What is this?   The world is now at peace after having endured a conflict between the church and witches for 500 years. However, embers of war still burn in some regions of the world. Cervil is a hopeless student at the Kingdom of Wenias' College of Magic. Cervil has somehow lost all memory of his time before attending the college. The school's headmaster Albus sends him for special training to the southern part of the continent, where persecution against witches runs strong.    The Dawn of the Witch is based on Kakeru Kobashiri's light novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Dawn of the Witch did not make the best first impression on me. We're deep into premiere season, it's late, I'm tired, etc, and I'm out of patience for shows that introduces its female characters either thighs/crotch first or tits first. I have zero familiarity with Grimoire of Zero, and while this is a standalone spinoff, I definitely got the nagging feeling I was supposed to be familiar with at least a few of these faces.    Once I was ready to forgive the show its trespasses, I did actually find a lot to draw me in. The story starts at a magic academy in a region where magic is accepted, thanks to the end of a war several centuries ago. However, since there are still places where mages are treated as other, the academy's best student, worst student, and a 300-year-old witch with the body of a ten-year-old and garter-clad thighs are going on what boils down to a humanitarian mission to build a safe home for them. Oh, and Saybil, the worst student, needs this mission to be successful, or else he'll lose what memories he's accumulated since developing amnesia three years ago.    It's a decent sentiment with a good heart, and I was surprised by a clunky-but-well-intentioned moment when Saybil called his travel companion out on her microaggressions against their beastfallen classmate. And yet, it just doesn't quite gel. Not because the fan service was particularly obtrusive—other than those crotch-first and boob-first intros, it was actually quite low-key—but because there's just no chemistry between the characters. There was a lot of walking and talking, camping and talking, and so on, and I just wasn't having fun watching them banter. There wasn't much sense of a connection and any playfulness felt forced.    Maybe someone who already knows and likes Grimoire of Zero will get more out of Dawn of the Witch. For me, it feels like wasted potential.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                While I've never felt the need to go back and rewatch the Grimoire of Zero, I do have fond memories of the little witch and her giant teddy bear of a mercenary. So returning to this world, with or without Zero in the drivers seat, is a lot of fun. There are a lot of familiar faces (it's great to see Albus all grown up) and it's interesting to see how everything has progressed since the last time we were here.    As fun as all the connections are, the basic story is perfectly understandable even if you've never seen Grimoire of Zero. Our viewpoint character, Saybil, is an amnesic magic student (though, in a twist on the trope, the memory loss happened three years previously). His personal conflict is simple: he's the school's worst mage and if he can't improve he'll be kicked out of the academy. If this happens, his knowledge of magic will be erased from his mind—basically reverting him right back to his post-amnesia state.    Then we have the titular Dawn Witch herself, a 300-year-old with the body of a little girl. While I could do without the constant panty shots, she is an intriguing character. Though egotistical and entitled, she seems to have the wisdom to match. Her connection to her staff is likewise interesting—as is everyone's reactions to how she uses a witch-killing weapon for everyday menial tasks.    The only issue I had with the show is that it really needs to lay out some of its proper nouns and a bit more of its history. While terms like “mage” and “witch” are thrown about, we don't get any clear answer on the difference between them (if any exists). And while we know there was a war between witches and the church, a bit more of the specifics would help us understand the trouble our heroes have already found themselves in with the Witch Hunters. But, all in all, this episode lays some solid ground work and makes me want to see not only what is to come for Sable and Loux but how Zero is connected to everything as well.      James Beckett  Rating:                I feel a little embarrassed, because it wasn't more than a week ago that I suddenly found myself thinking, “Man, remember Grimoire of Zero?” I hadn't thought about the show in years, not since I reviewed it, but for some reason I found myself feeling ever so slightly nostalgic for the flawed but fun fantasy adventure. “I wonder whatever happened to that big ol' cat-man and his tiny witch girlfriend?” And yet, I was completely unaware going into Dawn of the Witch that this was actually a sequel to Grimoire of Zero, and it took me a minute to even realize it. I must have zoned out a little during the OP, since Zero and Mercenary make very clear and obvious appearances in it, but it was right around the part where a wolf-man named Holdem was yelling about a woman named Albus that I started to connect the dots.    Dawn of the Witch is a really direct sequel, as it turns out, despite jumping ahead a number of years in the timeline, not to mention the major shakeup in visual style on account of the new production team. I had to go back to watch the end of GoZ to refresh my memory, but that series does indeed end with young Albus starting up a brand-new magic academy in Wenias, and promising to build a world where witches and humans can live in peace. At the start of Dawn of the Witch, it seems like she's making headway on that goal, too, though there's still a long way to go. This is what gets our four main characters started on their journey, and it's also where my issues with Dawn of the Witch really take hold.    While it was surprisingly fun to catch up with this universe and see what's become of some of the characters since Grimoire ended, this premiere just doesn't do a great job of getting me to give a damn about its own story and cast. Saybil is a total nothing of a protagonist, and Loux is the grating and unlikable inverse of Zero. It doesn't help that the camera goes out of its way to zoom in on her crotch with absolutely no shame, or even a sense of proper framing. Holt and Kudo are barely developed outside of the fact that Holt is very busty and flirtatious with Saybil, which is odd considering that Saybil has no discernable personality whatsoever. Kudo is…a lizard. That's about it.    Nobody will ever mistake Grimoire of Zero for great television, and it says something that I went nearly five years before remembering that I spent a whole season watching and reviewing the show, but it was a decent fantasy anime all things considered. Dawn of the Witch hasn't elicited any reaction from me whatsoever, which is a very poor place for a series premiere to find itself in. Maybe the show will pick up once the new cast finds its footing, or if Zero and Mercenary return to liven up the proceedings. If that isn't the case, though, then Dawn of the Witch seems destined to be overshadowed by its older sibling, and it isn't like GoZ cast all that large of a shadow in the first place.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                If you weren't aware, The Dawn of the Witch is set in the same world as Grimoire of Zero, although I don't think that's any impediment to just jumping in here. There are probably some world-building elements that work better if you're familiar with Grimoire of Zero, and that particular book does get a mention in this episode, but it's otherwise a pretty standard sword-and-sorcery setup, with beastpeople (known as beastfallen), magic users, witch hunters, and a vaguely Medieval sensibility. Well, and there's the headmaster of a magic school named Albus, but maybe we won't dwell on that.    This episode suffers most from two things: being very much about setting the stage for the more interesting things to come and Loux being kind of annoying. Loux could be Beatrice's cousin from Re: Zero in some ways, and I do think the choice to use the archaic informal second person (thee/thou/thy) largely works for her attitude of superiority. She's absolutely the kind of person who would deliberately speak informally to everyone just to show that she considers herself above them, something that Hort and Saybil notice when she leaves them behind to go chase witch hunters. But she's the sort of character who could wear with length of use, which could be an issue if she's got too much time in the spotlight.    The fact that Loux is also used for the bottom half of the fanservice may also rub some people the wrong way. We get plenty of shots of her crotch as she sits with her legs splayed, which is mostly noticeable because of how ridiculous her skirt's design is. Hort takes over the top half of the fanservice with her shirt that's patterned so that her breasts look like a wrapped present, and it is kind of amusing how obviously the art is trying to have it all by the way Hort is always shown boobs-first while Loux is shown thighs-first. Mostly the issue is that Loux, despite being 300 years old, looks pretty darn prepubescent, because really, she can sit however is most comfortable for her. Not that Saybil notices any of this, being about as blank a slate as you can get and having no discernable personality whatsoever. It's frankly the least believable part of the episode that Hort likes him so much.    Mostly this episode just sort of exists. There are some hints that the story could improve once the tedious set up is finished, so this probably isn't one to just write off immediately. But on the other hand, Goodreads assures me that I've read the first volume of the manga version and I can't remember a darn thing about it. Make of that what you will.

14-04-2022,anime,2,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/preview-guide/2022/spring/the-dawn-of-the-witch/.183529,The Dawn of the Witch - The Spring 2022 Preview Guide - Anime News Network:SEA,"            How would you rate episode 1 of The Dawn of the Witch ?                     Community score: 3.5              What is this?   The world is now at peace after having endured a conflict between the church and witches for 500 years. However, embers of war still burn in some regions of the world. Cervil is a hopeless student at the Kingdom of Wenias' College of Magic. Cervil has somehow lost all memory of his time before attending the college. The school's headmaster Albus sends him for special training to the southern part of the continent, where persecution against witches runs strong.    The Dawn of the Witch is based on Kakeru Kobashiri's light novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Dawn of the Witch did not make the best first impression on me. We're deep into premiere season, it's late, I'm tired, etc, and I'm out of patience for shows that introduces its female characters either thighs/crotch first or tits first. I have zero familiarity with Grimoire of Zero, and while this is a standalone spinoff, I definitely got the nagging feeling I was supposed to be familiar with at least a few of these faces.    Once I was ready to forgive the show its trespasses, I did actually find a lot to draw me in. The story starts at a magic academy in a region where magic is accepted, thanks to the end of a war several centuries ago. However, since there are still places where mages are treated as other, the academy's best student, worst student, and a 300-year-old witch with the body of a ten-year-old and garter-clad thighs are going on what boils down to a humanitarian mission to build a safe home for them. Oh, and Saybil, the worst student, needs this mission to be successful, or else he'll lose what memories he's accumulated since developing amnesia three years ago.    It's a decent sentiment with a good heart, and I was surprised by a clunky-but-well-intentioned moment when Saybil called his travel companion out on her microaggressions against their beastfallen classmate. And yet, it just doesn't quite gel. Not because the fan service was particularly obtrusive—other than those crotch-first and boob-first intros, it was actually quite low-key—but because there's just no chemistry between the characters. There was a lot of walking and talking, camping and talking, and so on, and I just wasn't having fun watching them banter. There wasn't much sense of a connection and any playfulness felt forced.    Maybe someone who already knows and likes Grimoire of Zero will get more out of Dawn of the Witch. For me, it feels like wasted potential.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                While I've never felt the need to go back and rewatch the Grimoire of Zero, I do have fond memories of the little witch and her giant teddy bear of a mercenary. So returning to this world, with or without Zero in the drivers seat, is a lot of fun. There are a lot of familiar faces (it's great to see Albus all grown up) and it's interesting to see how everything has progressed since the last time we were here.    As fun as all the connections are, the basic story is perfectly understandable even if you've never seen Grimoire of Zero. Our viewpoint character, Saybil, is an amnesic magic student (though, in a twist on the trope, the memory loss happened three years previously). His personal conflict is simple: he's the school's worst mage and if he can't improve he'll be kicked out of the academy. If this happens, his knowledge of magic will be erased from his mind—basically reverting him right back to his post-amnesia state.    Then we have the titular Dawn Witch herself, a 300-year-old with the body of a little girl. While I could do without the constant panty shots, she is an intriguing character. Though egotistical and entitled, she seems to have the wisdom to match. Her connection to her staff is likewise interesting—as is everyone's reactions to how she uses a witch-killing weapon for everyday menial tasks.    The only issue I had with the show is that it really needs to lay out some of its proper nouns and a bit more of its history. While terms like “mage” and “witch” are thrown about, we don't get any clear answer on the difference between them (if any exists). And while we know there was a war between witches and the church, a bit more of the specifics would help us understand the trouble our heroes have already found themselves in with the Witch Hunters. But, all in all, this episode lays some solid ground work and makes me want to see not only what is to come for Sable and Loux but how Zero is connected to everything as well.      James Beckett  Rating:                I feel a little embarrassed, because it wasn't more than a week ago that I suddenly found myself thinking, “Man, remember Grimoire of Zero?” I hadn't thought about the show in years, not since I reviewed it, but for some reason I found myself feeling ever so slightly nostalgic for the flawed but fun fantasy adventure. “I wonder whatever happened to that big ol' cat-man and his tiny witch girlfriend?” And yet, I was completely unaware going into Dawn of the Witch that this was actually a sequel to Grimoire of Zero, and it took me a minute to even realize it. I must have zoned out a little during the OP, since Zero and Mercenary make very clear and obvious appearances in it, but it was right around the part where a wolf-man named Holdem was yelling about a woman named Albus that I started to connect the dots.    Dawn of the Witch is a really direct sequel, as it turns out, despite jumping ahead a number of years in the timeline, not to mention the major shakeup in visual style on account of the new production team. I had to go back to watch the end of GoZ to refresh my memory, but that series does indeed end with young Albus starting up a brand-new magic academy in Wenias, and promising to build a world where witches and humans can live in peace. At the start of Dawn of the Witch, it seems like she's making headway on that goal, too, though there's still a long way to go. This is what gets our four main characters started on their journey, and it's also where my issues with Dawn of the Witch really take hold.    While it was surprisingly fun to catch up with this universe and see what's become of some of the characters since Grimoire ended, this premiere just doesn't do a great job of getting me to give a damn about its own story and cast. Saybil is a total nothing of a protagonist, and Loux is the grating and unlikable inverse of Zero. It doesn't help that the camera goes out of its way to zoom in on her crotch with absolutely no shame, or even a sense of proper framing. Holt and Kudo are barely developed outside of the fact that Holt is very busty and flirtatious with Saybil, which is odd considering that Saybil has no discernable personality whatsoever. Kudo is…a lizard. That's about it.    Nobody will ever mistake Grimoire of Zero for great television, and it says something that I went nearly five years before remembering that I spent a whole season watching and reviewing the show, but it was a decent fantasy anime all things considered. Dawn of the Witch hasn't elicited any reaction from me whatsoever, which is a very poor place for a series premiere to find itself in. Maybe the show will pick up once the new cast finds its footing, or if Zero and Mercenary return to liven up the proceedings. If that isn't the case, though, then Dawn of the Witch seems destined to be overshadowed by its older sibling, and it isn't like GoZ cast all that large of a shadow in the first place.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                If you weren't aware, The Dawn of the Witch is set in the same world as Grimoire of Zero, although I don't think that's any impediment to just jumping in here. There are probably some world-building elements that work better if you're familiar with Grimoire of Zero, and that particular book does get a mention in this episode, but it's otherwise a pretty standard sword-and-sorcery setup, with beastpeople (known as beastfallen), magic users, witch hunters, and a vaguely Medieval sensibility. Well, and there's the headmaster of a magic school named Albus, but maybe we won't dwell on that.    This episode suffers most from two things: being very much about setting the stage for the more interesting things to come and Loux being kind of annoying. Loux could be Beatrice's cousin from Re: Zero in some ways, and I do think the choice to use the archaic informal second person (thee/thou/thy) largely works for her attitude of superiority. She's absolutely the kind of person who would deliberately speak informally to everyone just to show that she considers herself above them, something that Hort and Saybil notice when she leaves them behind to go chase witch hunters. But she's the sort of character who could wear with length of use, which could be an issue if she's got too much time in the spotlight.    The fact that Loux is also used for the bottom half of the fanservice may also rub some people the wrong way. We get plenty of shots of her crotch as she sits with her legs splayed, which is mostly noticeable because of how ridiculous her skirt's design is. Hort takes over the top half of the fanservice with her shirt that's patterned so that her breasts look like a wrapped present, and it is kind of amusing how obviously the art is trying to have it all by the way Hort is always shown boobs-first while Loux is shown thighs-first. Mostly the issue is that Loux, despite being 300 years old, looks pretty darn prepubescent, because really, she can sit however is most comfortable for her. Not that Saybil notices any of this, being about as blank a slate as you can get and having no discernable personality whatsoever. It's frankly the least believable part of the episode that Hort likes him so much.    Mostly this episode just sort of exists. There are some hints that the story could improve once the tedious set up is finished, so this probably isn't one to just write off immediately. But on the other hand, Goodreads assures me that I've read the first volume of the manga version and I can't remember a darn thing about it. Make of that what you will.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               This show exists in a weird bit of adaptation limbo. It's based on a series of light novels that are themselves a sequel to the Grimoire of Zero novel series. I'm one of the 10 people who watched and still vaguely remember the 2017 Grimoire anime, but that show only covered the first couple volumes of a much longer story. So while I recognize some returning characters and understand the basic makeup of this particular fantasy world, I could not tell you how we got from the adventures of Tony the Tiger and his pint-sized witch gremlin to this new status quo. The good news is this is largely a new story, and anything immediately important is explained pretty quickly in this episode, so newcomers and non-LN readers alike should be able to follow along. The bad news is that doesn't make this episode any more interesting or entertaining.    The big issue with this new series is that it's centered on, by far, its least engaging character. Saybil's amnesia and mysterious past are supposed to entice you to learn more about him, but in practice he's a dead-eyed cipher who intakes exposition and outputs nothing of interest. Nearly any other character introduced here would be more engaging to follow as a protagonist, with the possible exception of the titular Witch of the Dawn, Loux. On top of being a 300-year-old little girl who can't stop flashing her panties to the camera, she's just an annoying presence who's only tolerable when she's acting her age instead of playing up her miniscule appearance. So the thought of watching her mentor our deadweight lead is deathly unappealing. That stands in stark contrast to Mercenary and Zero's dynamic in the first series, and it makes me question why these two are our leads when there's some perfectly engaging characters right next to them.    Maybe that's just because we barely get any time with Holt or Kudo so they don't have a chance to disappoint us, but just on the surface they both strike me as way more active, layered characters to build your story around. Holt is a star magic pupil who seemingly comes from a harsh background where she learned to put on a kind smile to avoid confrontation, which raises questions about her past that actually make her more interesting, unlike Saybil. Kudo, meanwhile, is a rough-mannered beast-man who nonetheless has a strong sense of justice and acts selflessly in his own way. Hell, just in this episode it's brought up that witches used to sacrifice beast-people, so the idea of one studying magic to become a witch is a rock-solid concept that all but begs for further exploration. Why, then, is his entire story this episode offscreen? Is has to be more interesting than watching our amnesiac sadboi hero vomit on a cart ride.    That's what really makes this premiere frustrating, on its own and as a follow-up to Grimoire of Zero. I know there's an interesting fantasy world behind all this, with a rich history just waiting to be explored, and presumably even more new things that have happened since the first anime wrapped up. If this were just some generic isekai world I could write it off as a dull waste of time and be done, but there's so much potential here that is just being left to rot. I might stick around for another episode or two, just to see if the elements I liked get some actual focus, but I can't give this much of a recommendation right now.

Community score: 3.4              What is this?   Kotone is a mage who ends up working at a real estate agency in a fantasy world. Kotone helps various clients, from a necromancer to a guild receptionist raising a pegasus, find a place to call home.    RPG Real Estate is based on  Chiyo Kenmotsu's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Wednesdays.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis    Rating:                Oh look, a light-hearted anime about cute girls in a fantasy world running a real estate agency. As they eat food, meet people, and go on everyday adventures, the show pokes fun at RPG tropes like adventurers looting people's homes or the prevalence of bikini armor. The first episode even comes with a good moral for those in the service industry: listen to what the client wants, not what you think they'll want based on appearances.    But here's the thing about RPG Real Estate: it's not really a fantasy story despite its outward appearance. Rather, it's a social commentary on modern Japan. With the fantasy aspect stripped away, Kotone is just your average Japanese college graduate. She studied hard, graduated—and then gave up on her dreams and is moving to Tokyo to get a job that has nothing to do with what she studied. Upon arrival, her first challenge is finding an affordable place for an entry level (read: underpaid) worker in the most expensive city in the country.    Of course, all the places she can afford have some sort of terrible downside. One has a shared living space (where people are guaranteed to steal your stuff). Another is an ill-maintained high-rise that lacks an elevator. And, worst of all, the last apartment has *gasp* foreigner neighbors! Oh, you didn't catch that? Yeah, demi-humans are non-Japanese people in this fantasy analogy. They're look different, have “strange” customs, and don't speak the same language, after all.    I've lived in Japan for 17 years now and am on my sixth apartment. I can't count the number of places that wouldn't rent to me because I was a foreigner. (Many rental ads even go so far as to list “no foreigners” right along with “no pets” and “no musical instruments” in their rental requirements.) So I appreciate this anime has the inclusive message that having foreigner neighbors isn't a downside. Rather, the foreigners are seen as kind and welcoming. Heck, the real-estate agency even has a foreigner of their own, Fa, who can breach the language barrier—making RPG Real Estate a company that actively supports the city's foreigner population. (Though the fact that Fa is portrayed as a child due to her not understanding local customs [like the need for clothes] is a whole different can of worms.) But frankly, when it comes to Japan addressing their institutionalized xenophobia and speaking out against it, I'll take what I can get.      Nicholas Dupree    Rating:                Stop me if you've heard this one before: an adaptation of a Manga Time Kirara “Cute Girls” manga, featuring a handful of candy-colored anime girls who are ostensibly teenagers but look no older than 10, where they have low stakes comedic outings and occasionally wind up in fanservicey outfits. But what if I told you this time the cute girls were in a generic RPG fantasy world, and they occasionally made very tired jokes about the kinds of houses you see in fantasy settings? If that sounds like a good time, then you have far more patience than me for RPG Real Estate.    Watching this show felt like trying to eat a bag of dollar-store cotton candy as fast as possible. I feel mean for saying that after loving the equally saccharine Healer Girl and enjoying other low-stakes comedies like Aharen-san this season, but something in the execution here just doesn't work. The characters are too flat (no not like that) and simple to be entertaining in their own right, and the premise of an RPG Real Estate company wears thin surprisingly quickly. By the second house tour of the episode they aren't even really making RPG-specific gags about the houses anymore, and the entire humor of the premise starts feeling like an afterthought.    So okay, then this is maybe meant to be more of a workplace comedy, where the joke is that the girls are basically an adventuring party doing mundane paperwork and real estate things. But that only really works if the characters are funny or have good chemistry, and that's not the case here. Nobody's personality is very strong or memorable, and their conversations are pretty dull. The only one who stands out is Fa, the monster girl who exists somewhere between child and pet, and whose gimmick is she hates wearing clothes and is always trying to strip naked while at work. That's not a great joke, but I unfortunately remember it, and that qualifies her for the funniest thing in this premiere.    So without character-based humor or a unique hook, all that's really left is if you just want to watch these generic girls get shipteased together, and there's certainly plenty of that. Fa and Kotone share a bath together. Rakira gets blushy when Kotone calls her pretty, and her adventuring outfit is a tube top and mini-skirt combo with the show literally calling her an exhibitionist. At the end of the episode Rakira and Rufria sleep in the same bed so the latter can be “comforted” after a rough day at work. It's about as blatant as you can get, but without any personality and with the blobby artstyle, it all comes across like smacking plastic dolls together and making kissy sounds. But honestly even that sounds more engaging than watching another episode of this. I'm not immediately opposed to this style of show, but RPG Real Estate is too vacuous to work.       Rebecca Silverman   Rating:                If you've been waiting for you CGCT show, here it is! RPG Real Estate has all the hallmarks of a genre standby: women who all look impressively young, a bathing scene with soap bubble censorship, an adorable theme, and a little yuri bait. And really, I'm being unkind with the censorship statement, because while the bubbles are strategically placed, the bathing scene isn't meant to be particularly prurient, and it isn't really framed as such – it's really just Fa and Kotone taking a bath.    The concept is probably the best part of the episode. While it's a bit of a stretch that the real estate agency RPG is actually called “Rent Plan Guide Real Estate,” the way it functions is like a much more adorable Dragon Goes House-Hunting. The idea is that fifteen years after, for all intents and purposes, the game ended (i. e. world peace was achieved), the fantasy realm functions an awful lot like our boring old world, and that means that everyone needs a place to live. But there are still entertaining vestiges of the old sword-and-sorcery way of life that pop up, such as a house that's also a dungeon or one that requires you to just let adventurers to come in and riffle through your drawers and take your stuff as “loot.” There are also remnants of how the world used to work in that everyone still has classes that can be used if necessary – Kotone is a wizard, Rufuria is a priest, and Rakira is a warrior. But there are little bits of commentary on those scattered throughout the episode, with the standout moment being when Kotone sees Rakira in her warrior uniform – a bra top and short-shorts – and remarks that it doesn't appear to be quite enough armor to be of any use.    The story itself is mostly in the soothing and sweet vein, which certainly isn't a bad thing. The stakes are low-key, with the main plot of the episode revolving around finding homes for two people, with a little lesson about listening to what the customer actually wants as opposed to what you think they want thrown in. Fa runs the risk of being kind of annoying (although she has a real point about her tail making wearing clothes tailored for humans uncomfortable), but for the greater part this is pleasantly bright and gentle, which is absolutely not a terrible thing if you'd just like to relax with some fantasy.     discuss this in the forum (291 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Richard Eisenbeis    Rating:                Oh look, a light-hearted anime about cute girls in a fantasy world running a real estate agency. As they eat food, meet people, and go on everyday adventures, the show pokes fun at RPG tropes like adventurers looting people's homes or the prevalence of bikini armor. The first episode even comes with a good moral for those in the service industry: listen to what the client wants, not what you think they'll want based on appearances.    But here's the thing about RPG Real Estate: it's not really a fantasy story despite its outward appearance. Rather, it's a social commentary on modern Japan. With the fantasy aspect stripped away, Kotone is just your average Japanese college graduate. She studied hard, graduated—and then gave up on her dreams and is moving to Tokyo to get a job that has nothing to do with what she studied. Upon arrival, her first challenge is finding an affordable place for an entry level (read: underpaid) worker in the most expensive city in the country.    Of course, all the places she can afford have some sort of terrible downside. One has a shared living space (where people are guaranteed to steal your stuff). Another is an ill-maintained high-rise that lacks an elevator. And, worst of all, the last apartment has *gasp* foreigner neighbors! Oh, you didn't catch that? Yeah, demi-humans are non-Japanese people in this fantasy analogy. They're look different, have “strange” customs, and don't speak the same language, after all.    I've lived in Japan for 17 years now and am on my sixth apartment. I can't count the number of places that wouldn't rent to me because I was a foreigner. (Many rental ads even go so far as to list “no foreigners” right along with “no pets” and “no musical instruments” in their rental requirements.) So I appreciate this anime has the inclusive message that having foreigner neighbors isn't a downside. Rather, the foreigners are seen as kind and welcoming. Heck, the real-estate agency even has a foreigner of their own, Fa, who can breach the language barrier—making RPG Real Estate a company that actively supports the city's foreigner population. (Though the fact that Fa is portrayed as a child due to her not understanding local customs [like the need for clothes] is a whole different can of worms.) But frankly, when it comes to Japan addressing their institutionalized xenophobia and speaking out against it, I'll take what I can get.      Nicholas Dupree    Rating:                Stop me if you've heard this one before: an adaptation of a Manga Time Kirara “Cute Girls” manga, featuring a handful of candy-colored anime girls who are ostensibly teenagers but look no older than 10, where they have low stakes comedic outings and occasionally wind up in fanservicey outfits. But what if I told you this time the cute girls were in a generic RPG fantasy world, and they occasionally made very tired jokes about the kinds of houses you see in fantasy settings? If that sounds like a good time, then you have far more patience than me for RPG Real Estate.    Watching this show felt like trying to eat a bag of dollar-store cotton candy as fast as possible. I feel mean for saying that after loving the equally saccharine Healer Girl and enjoying other low-stakes comedies like Aharen-san this season, but something in the execution here just doesn't work. The characters are too flat (no not like that) and simple to be entertaining in their own right, and the premise of an RPG Real Estate company wears thin surprisingly quickly. By the second house tour of the episode they aren't even really making RPG-specific gags about the houses anymore, and the entire humor of the premise starts feeling like an afterthought.    So okay, then this is maybe meant to be more of a workplace comedy, where the joke is that the girls are basically an adventuring party doing mundane paperwork and real estate things. But that only really works if the characters are funny or have good chemistry, and that's not the case here. Nobody's personality is very strong or memorable, and their conversations are pretty dull. The only one who stands out is Fa, the monster girl who exists somewhere between child and pet, and whose gimmick is she hates wearing clothes and is always trying to strip naked while at work. That's not a great joke, but I unfortunately remember it, and that qualifies her for the funniest thing in this premiere.    So without character-based humor or a unique hook, all that's really left is if you just want to watch these generic girls get shipteased together, and there's certainly plenty of that. Fa and Kotone share a bath together. Rakira gets blushy when Kotone calls her pretty, and her adventuring outfit is a tube top and mini-skirt combo with the show literally calling her an exhibitionist. At the end of the episode Rakira and Rufria sleep in the same bed so the latter can be “comforted” after a rough day at work. It's about as blatant as you can get, but without any personality and with the blobby artstyle, it all comes across like smacking plastic dolls together and making kissy sounds.

Nicholas Dupree    Rating:                Stop me if you've heard this one before: an adaptation of a Manga Time Kirara “Cute Girls” manga, featuring a handful of candy-colored anime girls who are ostensibly teenagers but look no older than 10, where they have low stakes comedic outings and occasionally wind up in fanservicey outfits. But what if I told you this time the cute girls were in a generic RPG fantasy world, and they occasionally made very tired jokes about the kinds of houses you see in fantasy settings? If that sounds like a good time, then you have far more patience than me for RPG Real Estate.    Watching this show felt like trying to eat a bag of dollar-store cotton candy as fast as possible. I feel mean for saying that after loving the equally saccharine Healer Girl and enjoying other low-stakes comedies like Aharen-san this season, but something in the execution here just doesn't work. The characters are too flat (no not like that) and simple to be entertaining in their own right, and the premise of an RPG Real Estate company wears thin surprisingly quickly. By the second house tour of the episode they aren't even really making RPG-specific gags about the houses anymore, and the entire humor of the premise starts feeling like an afterthought.    So okay, then this is maybe meant to be more of a workplace comedy, where the joke is that the girls are basically an adventuring party doing mundane paperwork and real estate things. But that only really works if the characters are funny or have good chemistry, and that's not the case here. Nobody's personality is very strong or memorable, and their conversations are pretty dull. The only one who stands out is Fa, the monster girl who exists somewhere between child and pet, and whose gimmick is she hates wearing clothes and is always trying to strip naked while at work. That's not a great joke, but I unfortunately remember it, and that qualifies her for the funniest thing in this premiere.    So without character-based humor or a unique hook, all that's really left is if you just want to watch these generic girls get shipteased together, and there's certainly plenty of that. Fa and Kotone share a bath together. Rakira gets blushy when Kotone calls her pretty, and her adventuring outfit is a tube top and mini-skirt combo with the show literally calling her an exhibitionist. At the end of the episode Rakira and Rufria sleep in the same bed so the latter can be “comforted” after a rough day at work. It's about as blatant as you can get, but without any personality and with the blobby artstyle, it all comes across like smacking plastic dolls together and making kissy sounds. But honestly even that sounds more engaging than watching another episode of this. I'm not immediately opposed to this style of show, but RPG Real Estate is too vacuous to work.       Rebecca Silverman   Rating:                If you've been waiting for you CGCT show, here it is! RPG Real Estate has all the hallmarks of a genre standby: women who all look impressively young, a bathing scene with soap bubble censorship, an adorable theme, and a little yuri bait. And really, I'm being unkind with the censorship statement, because while the bubbles are strategically placed, the bathing scene isn't meant to be particularly prurient, and it isn't really framed as such – it's really just Fa and Kotone taking a bath.    The concept is probably the best part of the episode. While it's a bit of a stretch that the real estate agency RPG is actually called “Rent Plan Guide Real Estate,” the way it functions is like a much more adorable Dragon Goes House-Hunting. The idea is that fifteen years after, for all intents and purposes, the game ended (i. e. world peace was achieved), the fantasy realm functions an awful lot like our boring old world, and that means that everyone needs a place to live. But there are still entertaining vestiges of the old sword-and-sorcery way of life that pop up, such as a house that's also a dungeon or one that requires you to just let adventurers to come in and riffle through your drawers and take your stuff as “loot.” There are also remnants of how the world used to work in that everyone still has classes that can be used if necessary – Kotone is a wizard, Rufuria is a priest, and Rakira is a warrior. But there are little bits of commentary on those scattered throughout the episode, with the standout moment being when Kotone sees Rakira in her warrior uniform – a bra top and short-shorts – and remarks that it doesn't appear to be quite enough armor to be of any use.    The story itself is mostly in the soothing and sweet vein, which certainly isn't a bad thing. The stakes are low-key, with the main plot of the episode revolving around finding homes for two people, with a little lesson about listening to what the customer actually wants as opposed to what you think they want thrown in. Fa runs the risk of being kind of annoying (although she has a real point about her tail making wearing clothes tailored for humans uncomfortable), but for the greater part this is pleasantly bright and gentle, which is absolutely not a terrible thing if you'd just like to relax with some fantasy.

It was never my favorite work by Yuki Kaori (that's Shounen zanzou, and Earl Cain, that amazing hot mess that I think has never gotten the attention and respect it absolutely deserves), but I do remember reading it - even though I can barely remember anything from the story, only that it ended up kind of collapsing on itself the way these overly ambitious melodramas tend to, that special ""this stopped making sense two volumes ago and I don't think I fully understand what's going on anymore and how it's even relevant, but damn if it's not really dramatic"" way. I don't think I'm going to re-read it, but I do look forward to this new installment.   I wonder why it's getting a sequel/spinoff right now, though. (And why not Cain?! all Cain got was a few pages of epilogue way back that provided a complete closure, no fair.)   ETA:     Quote:    Viz Media has also published Yuki's Count Cain, The Cain Saga, Fairy Cube, Godchild, and Grand Guignol Orchestra manga in English.           Wait, what? Why does the list mention Cain three times? :O      Back to top                  Triltaison    Joined: 03 Jul 2011 		    Posts: 531       Posted: Mon Apr 11, 2022 12:17 pm              SHD wrote:      Wait, what?

If I recall correctly, the original Count Cain series was called just that and then ""The Cain Saga"" labeling was added to include Godchild after it debuted. ""The Cain Saga"" should be treated as just a franchise page that links the other two related series like  ""Gundam"" or whatever. To add to the confusion, Kaine is an entirely unrelated work and was never released in English.   Anyway! I'm rather looking forward to this new release. Angel Sanctuary is a series I really enjoyed once upon a time and it gives me a reason to go dust it off my shelves and give it another read. I've always lamented the lack of a real anime adaptation for it (3 episode OVA for 20 books pfffft), so maybe one might happen if there's enough interest in this new series.

I still have all the volumes of the original series, which is as insanely twisted a story as it is strangely beautiful (not to mention creative/imaginative like one wouldn't believe). Maybe it'll get republished should this new series get licensed? It's a distinct classic that deserves to be read and remembered. Either way, I'm genuinely looking forward to Kaori Yuki's follow-up!

I don't know about current printings, but as far as US releases go, Viz published the first four Earl Cain (the UK doesn't have counts) stories in five volumes as The Cain Saga and Godchild as a separate title. (They also started publishing Godchild before the earlier books.) I don't see any ""saga"" branding on Japanese releases, so it seems like The Cain Saga is just the title Viz went with for everything before Godchild.   Looking forward to more Angel Sanctuary, although I can't imagine what could top the existing ending in terms of bizarre revelations.

Yeah, that's right. The Saga thing was advertised in Shojo Beat magazine at the time as the continuing adventures of Cain or somesuch thing. They discontinued running Godchild in the magazine and starting running promos for the other as a prequel around then. You're right that it was a distinctly Viz thing, but it was advertised as though it were a franchise. Probably just preparing in case Godchild also got a sequel.

It's most definitely not a case of ""related series in the same franchise"" or anything, there's an actual overarching plot going on in there! Yes, there was a hiatus between Red Ram and God Child, so God Child starts with a quick re-introduction of the main characters and the status quo, but it's not a standalone work at all. Hell, in the Japanese edition the whole thing is called ""Earl Cain series"" and that's that, the very first volume (The Forgotten Juliet) already has that branding. According to the original Hakusensha publication that I own:   Earl Cain series 1 - Wasurerareta Juliet (The Forgotten Juliet)  Earl Cain series 2 - Shounen no fuka suru oto (Sound of a Boy Hatching - how could anyone read say, God Child without having read this?!)  Earl Cain series 3 - Kafka  Earl Cain series 4 - Akai hitsuji no kokuin (The Sign of the Red Ram)  Earl Cain series 5 - God Child      Triltaison wrote:    To add to the confusion, Kaine is an entirely unrelated work and was never released in English.           How does Kaine come into the picture, though? It's as you said completely unrelated, it was never released in any way that could be connected to Earl Cain.

We got Godchild first in the US, so our story was out of order and a little confusing. The first half of Godchild serialized in Shojo Beat magazine, then it moved to releasing straight as collected graphic novels. The original Cain volumes came out at the same time as the last half of Godchild. Continuing issues of Shojo Beat and later Godchild volumes advertised the other Cain volumes as a prequel and/or standalone volumes. Each volume was titled with the same names as you listed, which is why 4 had a part 1 and 2 (instead of just being volume 5).   Kaine just happens to have a similar sounding title, but different spelling. It never got released in the US officially, but during the early internet days before Cain was licensed at all a lot of Western fans thought it was related somehow. I remember many fansites spreading misinformation about it back when all the information in English was a poor quality image of the cover and a title. It's probably been scanlated for well over a decade at this point and that's not a source of confusion anymore, but it used to be a hotly debated thing in the days of Angelfire websites and webrings. *shrug* I'm just old and remember all that junk.

It was never my favorite work by Yuki Kaori (that's Shounen zanzou, and Earl Cain, that amazing hot mess that I think has never gotten the attention and respect it absolutely deserves), but I do remember reading it - even though I can barely remember anything from the story, only that it ended up kind of collapsing on itself the way these overly ambitious melodramas tend to, that special ""this stopped making sense two volumes ago and I don't think I fully understand what's going on anymore and how it's even relevant, but damn if it's not really dramatic"" way. I don't think I'm going to re-read it, but I do look forward to this new installment.   I wonder why it's getting a sequel/spinoff right now, though. (And why not Cain?! all Cain got was a few pages of epilogue way back that provided a complete closure, no fair.)

I don't know about current printings, but as far as US releases go, Viz published the first four Earl Cain (the UK doesn't have counts) stories in five volumes as The Cain Saga and Godchild as a separate title. (They also started publishing Godchild before the earlier books.) I don't see any ""saga"" branding on Japanese releases, so it seems like The Cain Saga is just the title Viz went with for everything before Godchild.   Looking forward to more Angel Sanctuary, although I can't imagine what could top the existing ending in terms of bizarre revelations.

Yeah, that's right. The Saga thing was advertised in Shojo Beat magazine at the time as the continuing adventures of Cain or somesuch thing. They discontinued running Godchild in the magazine and starting running promos for the other as a prequel around then. You're right that it was a distinctly Viz thing, but it was advertised as though it were a franchise. Probably just preparing in case Godchild also got a sequel.

Yes, there was a hiatus between Red Ram and God Child, so God Child starts with a quick re-introduction of the main characters and the status quo, but it's not a standalone work at all.

We got Godchild first in the US, so our story was out of order and a little confusing. The first half of Godchild serialized in Shojo Beat magazine, then it moved to releasing straight as collected graphic novels. The original Cain volumes came out at the same time as the last half of Godchild. Continuing issues of Shojo Beat and later Godchild volumes advertised the other Cain volumes as a prequel and/or standalone volumes. Each volume was titled with the same names as you listed, which is why 4 had a part 1 and 2 (instead of just being volume 5).   Kaine just happens to have a similar sounding title, but different spelling. It never got released in the US officially, but during the early internet days before Cain was licensed at all a lot of Western fans thought it was related somehow. I remember many fansites spreading misinformation about it back when all the information in English was a poor quality image of the cover and a title. It's probably been scanlated for well over a decade at this point and that's not a source of confusion anymore, but it used to be a hotly debated thing in the days of Angelfire websites and webrings. *shrug* I'm just old and remember all that junk.

To add to the confusion, Kaine is an entirely unrelated work and was never released in English.           I don't know about current printings, but as far as US releases go, Viz published the first four Earl Cain (the UK doesn't have counts) stories in five volumes as The Cain Saga and Godchild as a separate title. (They also started publishing Godchild before the earlier books.) I don't see any ""saga"" branding on Japanese releases, so it seems like The Cain Saga is just the title Viz went with for everything before Godchild.   Looking forward to more Angel Sanctuary, although I can't imagine what could top the existing ending in terms of bizarre revelations.

Yeah, that's right. The Saga thing was advertised in Shojo Beat magazine at the time as the continuing adventures of Cain or somesuch thing. They discontinued running Godchild in the magazine and starting running promos for the other as a prequel around then. You're right that it was a distinctly Viz thing, but it was advertised as though it were a franchise. Probably just preparing in case Godchild also got a sequel.

It's most definitely not a case of ""related series in the same franchise"" or anything, there's an actual overarching plot going on in there! Yes, there was a hiatus between Red Ram and God Child, so God Child starts with a quick re-introduction of the main characters and the status quo, but it's not a standalone work at all. Hell, in the Japanese edition the whole thing is called ""Earl Cain series"" and that's that, the very first volume (The Forgotten Juliet) already has that branding. According to the original Hakusensha publication that I own:   Earl Cain series 1 - Wasurerareta Juliet (The Forgotten Juliet)  Earl Cain series 2 - Shounen no fuka suru oto (Sound of a Boy Hatching - how could anyone read say, God Child without having read this?!)  Earl Cain series 3 - Kafka  Earl Cain series 4 - Akai hitsuji no kokuin (The Sign of the Red Ram)  Earl Cain series 5 - God Child      Triltaison wrote:    To add to the confusion, Kaine is an entirely unrelated work and was never released in English.           How does Kaine come into the picture, though? It's as you said completely unrelated, it was never released in any way that could be connected to Earl Cain.

We got Godchild first in the US, so our story was out of order and a little confusing. The first half of Godchild serialized in Shojo Beat magazine, then it moved to releasing straight as collected graphic novels. The original Cain volumes came out at the same time as the last half of Godchild. Continuing issues of Shojo Beat and later Godchild volumes advertised the other Cain volumes as a prequel and/or standalone volumes. Each volume was titled with the same names as you listed, which is why 4 had a part 1 and 2 (instead of just being volume 5).   Kaine just happens to have a similar sounding title, but different spelling. It never got released in the US officially, but during the early internet days before Cain was licensed at all a lot of Western fans thought it was related somehow. I remember many fansites spreading misinformation about it back when all the information in English was a poor quality image of the cover and a title. It's probably been scanlated for well over a decade at this point and that's not a source of confusion anymore, but it used to be a hotly debated thing in the days of Angelfire websites and webrings. *shrug* I'm just old and remember all that junk.

Angel Sanctuary is a series I really enjoyed once upon a time and it gives me a reason to go dust it off my shelves and give it another read. I've always lamented the lack of a real anime adaptation for it (3 episode OVA for 20 books pfffft), so maybe one might happen if there's enough interest in this new series.

14-04-2022,anime,1,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/preview-guide/2022/spring/skeleton-knight-in-another-world/.183617,Skeleton Knight in Another World - The Spring 2022 Preview Guide - Anime News Network:SEA,"    The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Skeleton Knight in Another World   Apr  8th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Skeleton Knight in Another World ?                     Community score: 3.4              What is this?   A gamer falls asleep—only to wake up in the world of the game he was playing. Arc has the powerful skills and weapons of his character, but there's just one problem, he's stuck looking like that character, too. An adventure in a fantastical new land awaits him, if he can get used to being a walking skeleton.    Skeleton Knight in Another World is based on  Ennki Hakari's light novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Jesus Christ. I started up Skeleton Knight in Another World determined that I wouldn't just repeat everything my fellow reviewers were saying, but that rape scene really casts a pall over the entire episode, doesn't it? Let's leave behind for a second that it's tawdry and potentially triggering and holy fuck Crunchyroll, couldn't you have tried to head it off with a warning screen for at least a couple seconds? Okay? Let's move on from that. It's still a spectacularly bad choice purely in terms of mood, character, and narrative structure.    Once the ridiculously graphic scene ends, the show jumps back to Arc waking up one day in a bunch of high-level gear from his favorite MMORPG with access to super powerful magic skills. But uh-oh! He's a skeleton! So he farts around getting excited about his powers and going gaga over an elf. He needs to interact with people in town without letting them know he's a skeleton, which I imagine is a lot like those dreams where you forget to put on clothes and now you're walking around naked trying to find something to wear before someone notices. I found its mishmash of isekai clichés boring, but I'm sure someone out there would like it, and overall it's pretty inoffensive.    Oh but wait! Back to the graphic rape! And all at once we've gone from silly skeleton antics to rape again, but this time we get to see Arc debating whether or not he should intervene. In a brutal rape. When he knows for a fact he's ridiculously overpowered. His hemming and hawing is even presented as comical, as he ponders whether it would be like entering PVP. It's extreme tonal whiplash, and the heaviness of the subject matter is out of place and totally overshadows everything else that happens. It's also a really, really bad look for Arc, especially as Tomoaki Maeno continues his goofy performance as Arc talks himself up between shots of the bandits ripping off the girl's piss-stained pantaloons, and her maid's breasts jiggling as another bandit slams her face into the ground.    And then, after a short scene of him accompanying them, we're back to goofy skeleton man enjoying some tasty food while trying not to let anyone notice he's a skeleton!! So funny!!    So, you know, it's not just about being offended about on-screen rape being used for cheap shock value. It's just a bad narrative choice all around, and deserves to be criticized for that in addition to being crass.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Holy crap. Hit that play button and you get both barrels, don't you? So let's get this out of the way first. I'm not going to say rape can't be used as a plot device, but it should be used carefully—and be integral to the plot/characters when used. It should not be used for simple shock value or for shorthand to show us the hero is good because he kills rapists.    Moving on, can I say how nice it is to see someone who's having fun being whisked away to a fantasy world as the game character they've put so much into? There's some real joy in seeing Arc play with his powers and get pumped up about seeing a real-life elf. Even better is that, even with his excitement, he's still smart enough to realize the immediate issues he has to face. Arc is way overpowered, sure, but he can't even afford a meal, and he has no idea how to clean and cook his own food.    So it makes sense that he would immediately think to do what he already has some knowledge of: become an adventurer. He doesn't complain about the entry test, and the lack of “epic quests” doesn't really matter to him as long as he can get enough for food and a place to stay. It makes him rather likeable as a character. He's not a gun-ho fool nor is he an angsty complainer. He's just a guy enjoying the cards fate has dealt him.    The bandit scene, despite its subject matter, works well on a character development level for Arc. When coming upon the bandits, Arc doesn't intervene immediately. It isn't because he doesn't care about those being harmed but rather because he thinks he might lose. This is interesting because it shows that he doesn't see the bandits as NPCs or monsters; he sees them as other players. Not only does this mean he views them as real people, but it also makes him associate what's going on with PVP—and in PVP, numbers almost always matter more than gear. That said, he does eventually step in because he feels he has to—he sees the women as real people too, after all. The whole internal conflict speaks volumes about how he views the world he has become trapped in.    Other than that, I liked the little touches the episode threw in here and there, from people noticing his armor and deciding he was a knight to him questioning why he didn't feel bad about slaughtering the bandits despite it being the first time he had ever taken a life. The subversion of him peaking over at the women not because he's a horny asshole but because he wants to make sure they aren't looking while he excitedly loots the bodies was fantastic—and can I just say I love his oversized armor with its giant pauldrons? Him riding a horse was a great visual gag. All in all, despite the rough start, I really enjoyed this episode and can't wait to see where things go from here as he inevitably forms a party and answers the call to adventure.      James Beckett  Rating:                Skeleton Knight in Another World might just be a front-runner for two Preview Guide World Records, though they are dubious achievements indeed. First off, we have the elephant in the room, which is the “Shortest Ever Gap Between A Content Warning And The Content In Question” Award. The literal first shot of this series is of a surprisingly graphic sexual assault, and I don't know what is worse: That the scene is so lascivious and needlessly cruel right off the bat, or that we're forced to watch this twice in a show that is ostensibly a breezy isekai comedy. It isn't more than five seconds after the rapists are violently vivisected in front of their already traumatized victims that we transition to the show's cheesy OP, which I must remind you serves to introduce a main character whose sole defining character trait is that he's a goofy-looking cartoon skeleton. It is as catastrophic failure to read the room as I've seen in a long ass time, and there are a good many viewers who will understandably recoil in disgust and reject this anime outright before the opening credits finish.    The second award that Skeleton Knight in Another World is up for is a far less offensive one, though it also represents a problem that you can't simply fast-forward through. It's the “You Don't Even Really Need To Watch This Show, Because Literally Everything You Could Ever Possibly Need To Know About It Is Right There In The Title” Award! If you take the “…in Another World” half of this anime's title into consideration, then practically every single element of this premiere will fall into place, immediately, in your own head, before you even set eyes on it (except perhaps for the terrible and stupid rape scene, but you get my point).    The main character is somehow reborn into a real, flesh-and-blood universe that just so happens to perfectly mirror his favorite generic fantasy MMORPG. He is improbably strong and gifted in literally every aspect of the game, and he also spends a bunch of time breaking down his “in- game” stats sheet and skill set, as if that is somehow a substitute for having actual world-building and a plot. He then meanders around, talking to people and narrating to himself about this completely bizarre and insane scenario that we've all seen play out so many times before. He also might be a genuine sociopath, since he is completely unfazed by the horrible suffering and pain that he witnesses and inflicts upon others, and seems to live only to hoard loot from the mangled corpses he leaves behind. The ”Skeleton” part of the title tells you that the main character is a skeleton.    And look, I'm a fair critic, and I will give Skeleton Knight in Another World credit where it is due: It is somewhat amusing when when the skeleton guy makes goofy faces and gets unreasonably excited about loot. I chuckled once, near the end of the episode, because of the funny skeleton faces on the screen. For that alone, I will grant this premiere a bonus half-star to its rating. Everything else about it sucks, though, so it can wear its two Premiere Guide World Record badges like the marks of dishonor that they are.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               If any other show this season has a worse start than Skeleton Knight I'll be horribly surprised. It's not “just” that this premiere starts off, from the literal first second, with an attempted rape sequence. Nor is it “just” that said scene is gratuitous and directed with an eye for titillation for the audience, and is a cheap attempt at setting up paper thin bad guys from our hero to kill. It's that this would be a gross and crummy opening for a dark fantasy like Goblin Slayer, but it's a truly abysmal first impression for a premiere that is 90% goofy bullshit with our skeleton gamer protagonist Himbo-ing his way through a bog standard isekai setup.    Because that's what nearly this whole episode is actually about. Our hero, Arc, wakes up in a skeleton body and a suit of magic armor, realizes he's been isekai'd, and basically stumbles through a tutorial fetch quest with his overpowered skills, laughing all the way. And while the actual story is generic as hell, Arc himself makes a pretty good introduction. He's just excited to be in this new world, doesn't think to ask any questions about how it happened, and rolls through every new discovery with an almost infectious zest for fantasy life. It still slows down too much when he's shuffling through his various video game skills, and the world itself is devoid of anything interesting, but I could honestly picture myself following this literal bonehead for a few episodes, especially if the wacky slapstick from the OP animation is an honest promise.    But all that goodwill died once we circled back around to that rape scene. It's just such a lazy, shameless bit of shock-jock writing that stops the episode in its tracks. It exists solely to create some indisputably evil bandits for our hero to gallantly kill, letting him take lives without guilt (literally, the show admits this right after) and gaining him the affection of the victimized waif he saved. It's the same kind of hacky, exploitative garbage that showed up to ruin Sword Art Online every season like clockwork, and it's especially out of place in what is otherwise a goofy comedy. Plus, it's all made even worse when we see the attack from Arc's perspective and know he could have stepped in sooner, but was busy fretting over his chances in a PVP fight and waited until literally the last second. Then once it's over we're right back to silly funtimes with The Bone Boi as he celebrates his new life in this fantasy world, making the entire thing feel like a bad joke.    So congrats to the story for ensuring I'm not going to bother with any more of it. Ya took any charm or fun you managed to generate and threw it in the garbage. If other viewers have more tolerance for this kind of crap writing, maybe it's worth sticking it out and see if this is a one-time aberration. But for me, there's nothing interesting or special enough in the rest of this show to risk sitting through another scene like that.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Do you have a boilerplate isekai story to tell that borrows heavily from about four hundred other similar series? Do you need a way to spice it up and get eyes on your project? Well then, may I suggest not using rape to do that? Skeleton Knight in Another World's first episode opens with a graphic (or at least graphic enough) rape scene that comes back almost shot-for-shot at about the fourteen-minute mark. It does establish that our hero, who is helpfully not the rapist, is a good guy, because he saves Lady Lauren and her maid Rita, but there seems to be no reason to show us the exact same scene of sexual violence twice in the same episode. The opening salvo seems to be a cheap bid to make viewers pay attention, and while I do recall the same scene happening in the source material, that's not an excuse. If your story's not interesting enough to appeal to viewers without shocking them, maybe you should rethink your plot.    That out of the way, the rest of the episode is also a bit shocking – shockingly bland, that is. Arc, the eponymous skeleton knight, fell asleep playing his game and woke up as his character, only he forgot that he went with the skeleton build when he was creating him, so now he's afraid to take his armor off in public. If he wanted to be a bad guy like his bone-related cousin Ainz from Overlord, he'd be all set, but in this story, his character is a holy knight, so the whole skeleton thing is a bit of a problem. So is the fact that everyone sees his ridiculously nice and powerful armor and assumes that he's gainfully employed, because that armor's all he's got and he's hungry. Watching him try to integrate himself into a very run-of-the-mill town is the most amusing part of the episode, because he's both making things up on the fly and getting random backstory assigned to him by townsfolk.    He's also incredibly excited to be having his very own isekai experience, although he doesn't phrase it that way. Arc's disappointed that his new world seems more plain old Medieval than fantasy based on Medieval Europe, and any little bit of fantasy that he can find is thrilling to him, be that an elf, an orc, or the fact that he can use magic. (Why he doesn't use his fire magic to roast himself some food is never answered.) Of course, he teleports himself right off a cliff trying to figure out how to use it, but that actually sounds about right for how this would work.    If the sexual assault had been left out, this would be an okay-ish show. Not innovative, but bland in an inoffensive way. But it does have the rape scene and that is enough to make me say that steering clear is the better option here, because a combination of insipid and offensive doesn't leave this with a whole lot to recommend it.     discuss this in the forum (291 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

The opening salvo seems to be a cheap bid to make viewers pay attention, and while I do recall the same scene happening in the source material, that's not an excuse. If your story's not interesting enough to appeal to viewers without shocking them, maybe you should rethink your plot.    That out of the way, the rest of the episode is also a bit shocking – shockingly bland, that is. Arc, the eponymous skeleton knight, fell asleep playing his game and woke up as his character, only he forgot that he went with the skeleton build when he was creating him, so now he's afraid to take his armor off in public. If he wanted to be a bad guy like his bone-related cousin Ainz from Overlord, he'd be all set, but in this story, his character is a holy knight, so the whole skeleton thing is a bit of a problem. So is the fact that everyone sees his ridiculously nice and powerful armor and assumes that he's gainfully employed, because that armor's all he's got and he's hungry. Watching him try to integrate himself into a very run-of-the-mill town is the most amusing part of the episode, because he's both making things up on the fly and getting random backstory assigned to him by townsfolk.    He's also incredibly excited to be having his very own isekai experience, although he doesn't phrase it that way. Arc's disappointed that his new world seems more plain old Medieval than fantasy based on Medieval Europe, and any little bit of fantasy that he can find is thrilling to him, be that an elf, an orc, or the fact that he can use magic. (Why he doesn't use his fire magic to roast himself some food is never answered.) Of course, he teleports himself right off a cliff trying to figure out how to use it, but that actually sounds about right for how this would work.    If the sexual assault had been left out, this would be an okay-ish show. Not innovative, but bland in an inoffensive way. But it does have the rape scene and that is enough to make me say that steering clear is the better option here, because a combination of insipid and offensive doesn't leave this with a whole lot to recommend it.     discuss this in the forum (291 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives     ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 3.4              What is this?   A gamer falls asleep—only to wake up in the world of the game he was playing. Arc has the powerful skills and weapons of his character, but there's just one problem, he's stuck looking like that character, too. An adventure in a fantastical new land awaits him, if he can get used to being a walking skeleton.    Skeleton Knight in Another World is based on  Ennki Hakari's light novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Jesus Christ. I started up Skeleton Knight in Another World determined that I wouldn't just repeat everything my fellow reviewers were saying, but that rape scene really casts a pall over the entire episode, doesn't it? Let's leave behind for a second that it's tawdry and potentially triggering and holy fuck Crunchyroll, couldn't you have tried to head it off with a warning screen for at least a couple seconds? Okay? Let's move on from that. It's still a spectacularly bad choice purely in terms of mood, character, and narrative structure.    Once the ridiculously graphic scene ends, the show jumps back to Arc waking up one day in a bunch of high-level gear from his favorite MMORPG with access to super powerful magic skills. But uh-oh! He's a skeleton! So he farts around getting excited about his powers and going gaga over an elf. He needs to interact with people in town without letting them know he's a skeleton, which I imagine is a lot like those dreams where you forget to put on clothes and now you're walking around naked trying to find something to wear before someone notices. I found its mishmash of isekai clichés boring, but I'm sure someone out there would like it, and overall it's pretty inoffensive.    Oh but wait! Back to the graphic rape! And all at once we've gone from silly skeleton antics to rape again, but this time we get to see Arc debating whether or not he should intervene. In a brutal rape. When he knows for a fact he's ridiculously overpowered. His hemming and hawing is even presented as comical, as he ponders whether it would be like entering PVP. It's extreme tonal whiplash, and the heaviness of the subject matter is out of place and totally overshadows everything else that happens. It's also a really, really bad look for Arc, especially as Tomoaki Maeno continues his goofy performance as Arc talks himself up between shots of the bandits ripping off the girl's piss-stained pantaloons, and her maid's breasts jiggling as another bandit slams her face into the ground.    And then, after a short scene of him accompanying them, we're back to goofy skeleton man enjoying some tasty food while trying not to let anyone notice he's a skeleton!! So funny!!    So, you know, it's not just about being offended about on-screen rape being used for cheap shock value. It's just a bad narrative choice all around, and deserves to be criticized for that in addition to being crass.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Holy crap. Hit that play button and you get both barrels, don't you? So let's get this out of the way first. I'm not going to say rape can't be used as a plot device, but it should be used carefully—and be integral to the plot/characters when used. It should not be used for simple shock value or for shorthand to show us the hero is good because he kills rapists.    Moving on, can I say how nice it is to see someone who's having fun being whisked away to a fantasy world as the game character they've put so much into? There's some real joy in seeing Arc play with his powers and get pumped up about seeing a real-life elf. Even better is that, even with his excitement, he's still smart enough to realize the immediate issues he has to face. Arc is way overpowered, sure, but he can't even afford a meal, and he has no idea how to clean and cook his own food.    So it makes sense that he would immediately think to do what he already has some knowledge of: become an adventurer. He doesn't complain about the entry test, and the lack of “epic quests” doesn't really matter to him as long as he can get enough for food and a place to stay. It makes him rather likeable as a character. He's not a gun-ho fool nor is he an angsty complainer. He's just a guy enjoying the cards fate has dealt him.    The bandit scene, despite its subject matter, works well on a character development level for Arc. When coming upon the bandits, Arc doesn't intervene immediately. It isn't because he doesn't care about those being harmed but rather because he thinks he might lose. This is interesting because it shows that he doesn't see the bandits as NPCs or monsters; he sees them as other players. Not only does this mean he views them as real people, but it also makes him associate what's going on with PVP—and in PVP, numbers almost always matter more than gear. That said, he does eventually step in because he feels he has to—he sees the women as real people too, after all. The whole internal conflict speaks volumes about how he views the world he has become trapped in.    Other than that, I liked the little touches the episode threw in here and there, from people noticing his armor and deciding he was a knight to him questioning why he didn't feel bad about slaughtering the bandits despite it being the first time he had ever taken a life. The subversion of him peaking over at the women not because he's a horny asshole but because he wants to make sure they aren't looking while he excitedly loots the bodies was fantastic—and can I just say I love his oversized armor with its giant pauldrons? Him riding a horse was a great visual gag. All in all, despite the rough start, I really enjoyed this episode and can't wait to see where things go from here as he inevitably forms a party and answers the call to adventure.      James Beckett  Rating:                Skeleton Knight in Another World might just be a front-runner for two Preview Guide World Records, though they are dubious achievements indeed. First off, we have the elephant in the room, which is the “Shortest Ever Gap Between A Content Warning And The Content In Question” Award. The literal first shot of this series is of a surprisingly graphic sexual assault, and I don't know what is worse: That the scene is so lascivious and needlessly cruel right off the bat, or that we're forced to watch this twice in a show that is ostensibly a breezy isekai comedy. It isn't more than five seconds after the rapists are violently vivisected in front of their already traumatized victims that we transition to the show's cheesy OP, which I must remind you serves to introduce a main character whose sole defining character trait is that he's a goofy-looking cartoon skeleton. It is as catastrophic failure to read the room as I've seen in a long ass time, and there are a good many viewers who will understandably recoil in disgust and reject this anime outright before the opening credits finish.    The second award that Skeleton Knight in Another World is up for is a far less offensive one, though it also represents a problem that you can't simply fast-forward through. It's the “You Don't Even Really Need To Watch This Show, Because Literally Everything You Could Ever Possibly Need To Know About It Is Right There In The Title” Award! If you take the “…in Another World” half of this anime's title into consideration, then practically every single element of this premiere will fall into place, immediately, in your own head, before you even set eyes on it (except perhaps for the terrible and stupid rape scene, but you get my point).    The main character is somehow reborn into a real, flesh-and-blood universe that just so happens to perfectly mirror his favorite generic fantasy MMORPG. He is improbably strong and gifted in literally every aspect of the game, and he also spends a bunch of time breaking down his “in- game” stats sheet and skill set, as if that is somehow a substitute for having actual world-building and a plot. He then meanders around, talking to people and narrating to himself about this completely bizarre and insane scenario that we've all seen play out so many times before. He also might be a genuine sociopath, since he is completely unfazed by the horrible suffering and pain that he witnesses and inflicts upon others, and seems to live only to hoard loot from the mangled corpses he leaves behind. The ”Skeleton” part of the title tells you that the main character is a skeleton.    And look, I'm a fair critic, and I will give Skeleton Knight in Another World credit where it is due: It is somewhat amusing when when the skeleton guy makes goofy faces and gets unreasonably excited about loot. I chuckled once, near the end of the episode, because of the funny skeleton faces on the screen. For that alone, I will grant this premiere a bonus half-star to its rating. Everything else about it sucks, though, so it can wear its two Premiere Guide World Record badges like the marks of dishonor that they are.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               If any other show this season has a worse start than Skeleton Knight I'll be horribly surprised. It's not “just” that this premiere starts off, from the literal first second, with an attempted rape sequence. Nor is it “just” that said scene is gratuitous and directed with an eye for titillation for the audience, and is a cheap attempt at setting up paper thin bad guys from our hero to kill. It's that this would be a gross and crummy opening for a dark fantasy like Goblin Slayer, but it's a truly abysmal first impression for a premiere that is 90% goofy bullshit with our skeleton gamer protagonist Himbo-ing his way through a bog standard isekai setup.    Because that's what nearly this whole episode is actually about. Our hero, Arc, wakes up in a skeleton body and a suit of magic armor, realizes he's been isekai'd, and basically stumbles through a tutorial fetch quest with his overpowered skills, laughing all the way. And while the actual story is generic as hell, Arc himself makes a pretty good introduction. He's just excited to be in this new world, doesn't think to ask any questions about how it happened, and rolls through every new discovery with an almost infectious zest for fantasy life. It still slows down too much when he's shuffling through his various video game skills, and the world itself is devoid of anything interesting, but I could honestly picture myself following this literal bonehead for a few episodes, especially if the wacky slapstick from the OP animation is an honest promise.    But all that goodwill died once we circled back around to that rape scene. It's just such a lazy, shameless bit of shock-jock writing that stops the episode in its tracks. It exists solely to create some indisputably evil bandits for our hero to gallantly kill, letting him take lives without guilt (literally, the show admits this right after) and gaining him the affection of the victimized waif he saved. It's the same kind of hacky, exploitative garbage that showed up to ruin Sword Art Online every season like clockwork, and it's especially out of place in what is otherwise a goofy comedy. Plus, it's all made even worse when we see the attack from Arc's perspective and know he could have stepped in sooner, but was busy fretting over his chances in a PVP fight and waited until literally the last second. Then once it's over we're right back to silly funtimes with The Bone Boi as he celebrates his new life in this fantasy world, making the entire thing feel like a bad joke.    So congrats to the story for ensuring I'm not going to bother with any more of it. Ya took any charm or fun you managed to generate and threw it in the garbage. If other viewers have more tolerance for this kind of crap writing, maybe it's worth sticking it out and see if this is a one-time aberration. But for me, there's nothing interesting or special enough in the rest of this show to risk sitting through another scene like that.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Do you have a boilerplate isekai story to tell that borrows heavily from about four hundred other similar series?

He's also incredibly excited to be having his very own isekai experience, although he doesn't phrase it that way. Arc's disappointed that his new world seems more plain old Medieval than fantasy based on Medieval Europe, and any little bit of fantasy that he can find is thrilling to him, be that an elf, an orc, or the fact that he can use magic. (Why he doesn't use his fire magic to roast himself some food is never answered.) Of course, he teleports himself right off a cliff trying to figure out how to use it, but that actually sounds about right for how this would work.    If the sexual assault had been left out, this would be an okay-ish show. Not innovative, but bland in an inoffensive way. But it does have the rape scene and that is enough to make me say that steering clear is the better option here, because a combination of insipid and offensive doesn't leave this with a whole lot to recommend it.     discuss this in the forum (291 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives   ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 3.4              What is this?   A gamer falls asleep—only to wake up in the world of the game he was playing. Arc has the powerful skills and weapons of his character, but there's just one problem, he's stuck looking like that character, too. An adventure in a fantastical new land awaits him, if he can get used to being a walking skeleton.    Skeleton Knight in Another World is based on  Ennki Hakari's light novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Jesus Christ. I started up Skeleton Knight in Another World determined that I wouldn't just repeat everything my fellow reviewers were saying, but that rape scene really casts a pall over the entire episode, doesn't it? Let's leave behind for a second that it's tawdry and potentially triggering and holy fuck Crunchyroll, couldn't you have tried to head it off with a warning screen for at least a couple seconds? Okay? Let's move on from that. It's still a spectacularly bad choice purely in terms of mood, character, and narrative structure.    Once the ridiculously graphic scene ends, the show jumps back to Arc waking up one day in a bunch of high-level gear from his favorite MMORPG with access to super powerful magic skills. But uh-oh! He's a skeleton! So he farts around getting excited about his powers and going gaga over an elf. He needs to interact with people in town without letting them know he's a skeleton, which I imagine is a lot like those dreams where you forget to put on clothes and now you're walking around naked trying to find something to wear before someone notices. I found its mishmash of isekai clichés boring, but I'm sure someone out there would like it, and overall it's pretty inoffensive.    Oh but wait! Back to the graphic rape! And all at once we've gone from silly skeleton antics to rape again, but this time we get to see Arc debating whether or not he should intervene. In a brutal rape. When he knows for a fact he's ridiculously overpowered. His hemming and hawing is even presented as comical, as he ponders whether it would be like entering PVP. It's extreme tonal whiplash, and the heaviness of the subject matter is out of place and totally overshadows everything else that happens. It's also a really, really bad look for Arc, especially as Tomoaki Maeno continues his goofy performance as Arc talks himself up between shots of the bandits ripping off the girl's piss-stained pantaloons, and her maid's breasts jiggling as another bandit slams her face into the ground.    And then, after a short scene of him accompanying them, we're back to goofy skeleton man enjoying some tasty food while trying not to let anyone notice he's a skeleton!! So funny!!    So, you know, it's not just about being offended about on-screen rape being used for cheap shock value. It's just a bad narrative choice all around, and deserves to be criticized for that in addition to being crass.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Holy crap. Hit that play button and you get both barrels, don't you? So let's get this out of the way first. I'm not going to say rape can't be used as a plot device, but it should be used carefully—and be integral to the plot/characters when used. It should not be used for simple shock value or for shorthand to show us the hero is good because he kills rapists.    Moving on, can I say how nice it is to see someone who's having fun being whisked away to a fantasy world as the game character they've put so much into? There's some real joy in seeing Arc play with his powers and get pumped up about seeing a real-life elf. Even better is that, even with his excitement, he's still smart enough to realize the immediate issues he has to face. Arc is way overpowered, sure, but he can't even afford a meal, and he has no idea how to clean and cook his own food.    So it makes sense that he would immediately think to do what he already has some knowledge of: become an adventurer. He doesn't complain about the entry test, and the lack of “epic quests” doesn't really matter to him as long as he can get enough for food and a place to stay. It makes him rather likeable as a character. He's not a gun-ho fool nor is he an angsty complainer. He's just a guy enjoying the cards fate has dealt him.    The bandit scene, despite its subject matter, works well on a character development level for Arc. When coming upon the bandits, Arc doesn't intervene immediately. It isn't because he doesn't care about those being harmed but rather because he thinks he might lose. This is interesting because it shows that he doesn't see the bandits as NPCs or monsters; he sees them as other players. Not only does this mean he views them as real people, but it also makes him associate what's going on with PVP—and in PVP, numbers almost always matter more than gear. That said, he does eventually step in because he feels he has to—he sees the women as real people too, after all. The whole internal conflict speaks volumes about how he views the world he has become trapped in.    Other than that, I liked the little touches the episode threw in here and there, from people noticing his armor and deciding he was a knight to him questioning why he didn't feel bad about slaughtering the bandits despite it being the first time he had ever taken a life. The subversion of him peaking over at the women not because he's a horny asshole but because he wants to make sure they aren't looking while he excitedly loots the bodies was fantastic—and can I just say I love his oversized armor with its giant pauldrons? Him riding a horse was a great visual gag. All in all, despite the rough start, I really enjoyed this episode and can't wait to see where things go from here as he inevitably forms a party and answers the call to adventure.      James Beckett  Rating:                Skeleton Knight in Another World might just be a front-runner for two Preview Guide World Records, though they are dubious achievements indeed. First off, we have the elephant in the room, which is the “Shortest Ever Gap Between A Content Warning And The Content In Question” Award. The literal first shot of this series is of a surprisingly graphic sexual assault, and I don't know what is worse: That the scene is so lascivious and needlessly cruel right off the bat, or that we're forced to watch this twice in a show that is ostensibly a breezy isekai comedy. It isn't more than five seconds after the rapists are violently vivisected in front of their already traumatized victims that we transition to the show's cheesy OP, which I must remind you serves to introduce a main character whose sole defining character trait is that he's a goofy-looking cartoon skeleton. It is as catastrophic failure to read the room as I've seen in a long ass time, and there are a good many viewers who will understandably recoil in disgust and reject this anime outright before the opening credits finish.    The second award that Skeleton Knight in Another World is up for is a far less offensive one, though it also represents a problem that you can't simply fast-forward through. It's the “You Don't Even Really Need To Watch This Show, Because Literally Everything You Could Ever Possibly Need To Know About It Is Right There In The Title” Award! If you take the “…in Another World” half of this anime's title into consideration, then practically every single element of this premiere will fall into place, immediately, in your own head, before you even set eyes on it (except perhaps for the terrible and stupid rape scene, but you get my point).    The main character is somehow reborn into a real, flesh-and-blood universe that just so happens to perfectly mirror his favorite generic fantasy MMORPG. He is improbably strong and gifted in literally every aspect of the game, and he also spends a bunch of time breaking down his “in- game” stats sheet and skill set, as if that is somehow a substitute for having actual world-building and a plot. He then meanders around, talking to people and narrating to himself about this completely bizarre and insane scenario that we've all seen play out so many times before. He also might be a genuine sociopath, since he is completely unfazed by the horrible suffering and pain that he witnesses and inflicts upon others, and seems to live only to hoard loot from the mangled corpses he leaves behind. The ”Skeleton” part of the title tells you that the main character is a skeleton.    And look, I'm a fair critic, and I will give Skeleton Knight in Another World credit where it is due: It is somewhat amusing when when the skeleton guy makes goofy faces and gets unreasonably excited about loot. I chuckled once, near the end of the episode, because of the funny skeleton faces on the screen. For that alone, I will grant this premiere a bonus half-star to its rating. Everything else about it sucks, though, so it can wear its two Premiere Guide World Record badges like the marks of dishonor that they are.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               If any other show this season has a worse start than Skeleton Knight I'll be horribly surprised. It's not “just” that this premiere starts off, from the literal first second, with an attempted rape sequence. Nor is it “just” that said scene is gratuitous and directed with an eye for titillation for the audience, and is a cheap attempt at setting up paper thin bad guys from our hero to kill. It's that this would be a gross and crummy opening for a dark fantasy like Goblin Slayer, but it's a truly abysmal first impression for a premiere that is 90% goofy bullshit with our skeleton gamer protagonist Himbo-ing his way through a bog standard isekai setup.    Because that's what nearly this whole episode is actually about. Our hero, Arc, wakes up in a skeleton body and a suit of magic armor, realizes he's been isekai'd, and basically stumbles through a tutorial fetch quest with his overpowered skills, laughing all the way. And while the actual story is generic as hell, Arc himself makes a pretty good introduction. He's just excited to be in this new world, doesn't think to ask any questions about how it happened, and rolls through every new discovery with an almost infectious zest for fantasy life. It still slows down too much when he's shuffling through his various video game skills, and the world itself is devoid of anything interesting, but I could honestly picture myself following this literal bonehead for a few episodes, especially if the wacky slapstick from the OP animation is an honest promise.    But all that goodwill died once we circled back around to that rape scene. It's just such a lazy, shameless bit of shock-jock writing that stops the episode in its tracks. It exists solely to create some indisputably evil bandits for our hero to gallantly kill, letting him take lives without guilt (literally, the show admits this right after) and gaining him the affection of the victimized waif he saved. It's the same kind of hacky, exploitative garbage that showed up to ruin Sword Art Online every season like clockwork, and it's especially out of place in what is otherwise a goofy comedy. Plus, it's all made even worse when we see the attack from Arc's perspective and know he could have stepped in sooner, but was busy fretting over his chances in a PVP fight and waited until literally the last second. Then once it's over we're right back to silly funtimes with The Bone Boi as he celebrates his new life in this fantasy world, making the entire thing feel like a bad joke.    So congrats to the story for ensuring I'm not going to bother with any more of it. Ya took any charm or fun you managed to generate and threw it in the garbage. If other viewers have more tolerance for this kind of crap writing, maybe it's worth sticking it out and see if this is a one-time aberration. But for me, there's nothing interesting or special enough in the rest of this show to risk sitting through another scene like that.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Do you have a boilerplate isekai story to tell that borrows heavily from about four hundred other similar series? Do you need a way to spice it up and get eyes on your project? Well then, may I suggest not using rape to do that? Skeleton Knight in Another World's first episode opens with a graphic (or at least graphic enough) rape scene that comes back almost shot-for-shot at about the fourteen-minute mark. It does establish that our hero, who is helpfully not the rapist, is a good guy, because he saves Lady Lauren and her maid Rita, but there seems to be no reason to show us the exact same scene of sexual violence twice in the same episode. The opening salvo seems to be a cheap bid to make viewers pay attention, and while I do recall the same scene happening in the source material, that's not an excuse. If your story's not interesting enough to appeal to viewers without shocking them, maybe you should rethink your plot.    That out of the way, the rest of the episode is also a bit shocking – shockingly bland, that is. Arc, the eponymous skeleton knight, fell asleep playing his game and woke up as his character, only he forgot that he went with the skeleton build when he was creating him, so now he's afraid to take his armor off in public. If he wanted to be a bad guy like his bone-related cousin Ainz from Overlord, he'd be all set, but in this story, his character is a holy knight, so the whole skeleton thing is a bit of a problem. So is the fact that everyone sees his ridiculously nice and powerful armor and assumes that he's gainfully employed, because that armor's all he's got and he's hungry. Watching him try to integrate himself into a very run-of-the-mill town is the most amusing part of the episode, because he's both making things up on the fly and getting random backstory assigned to him by townsfolk.

The main character, Danblf, transforms into a young girl and journeys through a changed world set 30 years later. ANN spoke to the novel author Hirotsugu Ryusen, as well as director Keitaro Motonaga and screenwriter Takamitsu Kouno about how they brought the virtual world to life.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   (For author Hirotsugu Ryusen) The protagonist enters the game world only to realize that many years have passed within the game. What inspired this part of the story's premise?   RYUSEN: I like pure fantasy, but I also like it when modern technology has been arranged in a fantasy-like way. As I was thinking about how to create a setting where it wouldn't be strange for those elements to exist, I took inspiration from other novels I was reading at the time. I thought it would be neat to create a time skip and make the former players, who already possess modern knowledge, accomplish various feats ahead of time.    Also, because of the influence of those players, special modern words have spread throughout society in those 30 years. It gave me some looseness to play with words to an extent.     The novel explains the VRMMORPG setting in a lot of detail. What was your approach to creating the world?   RYUSEN: The foundation was built on the MMORPG I was engrossed in at the time. By referring to the knowledge and experiences I accumulated from that MMO, I was able to work out my ideal world for a game. I've also enjoyed creating worlds for a long time. I note down the details of a fictional game when I think of them, and when I combined them on this opportunity, this is what I got.     Are you the kind of writer who begins thinking about the world or the characters first?   RYUSEN: If I had to say, I suppose I start with the world… My ideal world. The people who live there. And the characters who stand out among them. I suppose that's how it goes.     What is the appeal of young girls who refer to themselves as ""washi""?   RYUSEN: I wonder, indeed… When I think about it, I never actually considered what was the appeal. I was just drawn to it hazily. I don't quite get it, but I like it. That can happen, right?    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   (For director Keitaro Motonaga)  Regarding the depiction of the VRMMORPG world, did you use any existing MMORPGs or other games as references?   MOTONAGA: I tried out a few titles my friend recommended to me and used them as references. For the things I referenced inside the game, I made sure not to make the resemblance too strong.     What sort of things did you keep in mind in order to depict Mira's cuteness?   MOTONAGA: I didn't want her to just be cute. Since she used to be Danblf, I kept Danblf's movements in mind, like how she carries herself when she stands. For example, she puts her hands on her hips or crosses her arms. Through those Danblf-like mannerisms, I tried to show Mira's cuteness.     How did you decide on the worldview of the anime? What kind of directions did you give to the art director?   MOTONAGA: That's a secret! (laughs) Anyway, I wanted the world to look beautiful, with a crisp and clean air. I asked him to be conscious of beautiful European streets and the World Heritage sites, and to capture the vibes around those places. That's all I asked for.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project    What inspired the montage at the end of episode 1?   MOTONAGA: I wanted to make Mira's signature line “I am cute” (said with an old man's first-person pronoun “washi”) stand out. I wondered if there was a way I could express it, and the montage was what I came up with.    That wasn't the only thing, of course. Like I mentioned before, I asked the art director to convey the vibes of beautiful European streets. By not having any spoken lines, we could show off the world and its atmosphere.    (For series composition writer Takamitsu Kouno) What was your first impression of the original work?   KOUNO: I thought it was wonderful. What makes it outstandingly original is that it's a game world where the existing skills, magic, towns, and kingdoms have all been shaped by the hands of players. I also think it's great how the story is based around the actions of the protagonist Danblf/Mira.     What did you keep in mind this time when writing the script?   KOUNO: The protagonist Mira is a beautiful and lovely girl. However, she was originally the dignified wise sage Danblf. And behind that is a player acting out a role. What was the best way to depict this amusing, peculiar, complicated, and mysterious figure? That was the first thing I turned my attention to. Specifically, I took care not to make Mira exhibit “girlish” mannerisms, words, or actions.    When the player is presenting himself as the wise sage Danblf, he is taking care to roleplay in a dignified manner. That doesn't change even when he turns into Mira. That's why the biggest thing I kept in mind when writing the script was how to act out Mira.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   How did you balance the amount of information in the novel with the action? The series also has a lot of characters, so what did you keep in mind to make each of them stand out in the anime?   KOUNO: The amount of material you can cover in 12 anime episodes that are 20 minutes long is limited, no matter how you slice it. Because of this, we consulted with the original creator's side at the script meetings in order to decide on the most absolutely essential information and scenes to prioritize. In order to ensure that the numerous guest characters have impact in the anime, we took care to depict not just their dialogue but also to give them action that leaves an impression.     Which characters did you particularly enjoy writing the lines for?   KOUNO: I especially enjoyed writing Mira and Solomon's interactions. Before Mira became known as one of the nine sages or Solomon established the kingdom of Arkite, they were both friendly in the real world. That makes their conversations very amusing. Even though they're in the dreadful situation of being stuck in a game world, I think the fact that Mira, Solomon, and the others can smile through it all is rooted in how they've stuck together through thick and thin.

The main character, Danblf, transforms into a young girl and journeys through a changed world set 30 years later. ANN spoke to the novel author Hirotsugu Ryusen, as well as director Keitaro Motonaga and screenwriter Takamitsu Kouno about how they brought the virtual world to life.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   (For author Hirotsugu Ryusen) The protagonist enters the game world only to realize that many years have passed within the game. What inspired this part of the story's premise?   RYUSEN: I like pure fantasy, but I also like it when modern technology has been arranged in a fantasy-like way. As I was thinking about how to create a setting where it wouldn't be strange for those elements to exist, I took inspiration from other novels I was reading at the time. I thought it would be neat to create a time skip and make the former players, who already possess modern knowledge, accomplish various feats ahead of time.    Also, because of the influence of those players, special modern words have spread throughout society in those 30 years. It gave me some looseness to play with words to an extent.     The novel explains the VRMMORPG setting in a lot of detail. What was your approach to creating the world?   RYUSEN: The foundation was built on the MMORPG I was engrossed in at the time. By referring to the knowledge and experiences I accumulated from that MMO, I was able to work out my ideal world for a game. I've also enjoyed creating worlds for a long time. I note down the details of a fictional game when I think of them, and when I combined them on this opportunity, this is what I got.     Are you the kind of writer who begins thinking about the world or the characters first?   RYUSEN: If I had to say, I suppose I start with the world… My ideal world. The people who live there. And the characters who stand out among them. I suppose that's how it goes.     What is the appeal of young girls who refer to themselves as ""washi""?   RYUSEN: I wonder, indeed… When I think about it, I never actually considered what was the appeal. I was just drawn to it hazily. I don't quite get it, but I like it. That can happen, right?    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   (For director Keitaro Motonaga)  Regarding the depiction of the VRMMORPG world, did you use any existing MMORPGs or other games as references?   MOTONAGA: I tried out a few titles my friend recommended to me and used them as references. For the things I referenced inside the game, I made sure not to make the resemblance too strong.     What sort of things did you keep in mind in order to depict Mira's cuteness?   MOTONAGA: I didn't want her to just be cute. Since she used to be Danblf, I kept Danblf's movements in mind, like how she carries herself when she stands. For example, she puts her hands on her hips or crosses her arms. Through those Danblf-like mannerisms, I tried to show Mira's cuteness.     How did you decide on the worldview of the anime? What kind of directions did you give to the art director?   MOTONAGA: That's a secret! (laughs) Anyway, I wanted the world to look beautiful, with a crisp and clean air. I asked him to be conscious of beautiful European streets and the World Heritage sites, and to capture the vibes around those places. That's all I asked for.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project    What inspired the montage at the end of episode 1?   MOTONAGA: I wanted to make Mira's signature line “I am cute” (said with an old man's first-person pronoun “washi”) stand out. I wondered if there was a way I could express it, and the montage was what I came up with.    That wasn't the only thing, of course. Like I mentioned before, I asked the art director to convey the vibes of beautiful European streets. By not having any spoken lines, we could show off the world and its atmosphere.    (For series composition writer Takamitsu Kouno) What was your first impression of the original work?   KOUNO: I thought it was wonderful. What makes it outstandingly original is that it's a game world where the existing skills, magic, towns, and kingdoms have all been shaped by the hands of players. I also think it's great how the story is based around the actions of the protagonist Danblf/Mira.     What did you keep in mind this time when writing the script?   KOUNO: The protagonist Mira is a beautiful and lovely girl. However, she was originally the dignified wise sage Danblf. And behind that is a player acting out a role. What was the best way to depict this amusing, peculiar, complicated, and mysterious figure? That was the first thing I turned my attention to. Specifically, I took care not to make Mira exhibit “girlish” mannerisms, words, or actions.    When the player is presenting himself as the wise sage Danblf, he is taking care to roleplay in a dignified manner. That doesn't change even when he turns into Mira. That's why the biggest thing I kept in mind when writing the script was how to act out Mira.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   How did you balance the amount of information in the novel with the action? The series also has a lot of characters, so what did you keep in mind to make each of them stand out in the anime?   KOUNO: The amount of material you can cover in 12 anime episodes that are 20 minutes long is limited, no matter how you slice it. Because of this, we consulted with the original creator's side at the script meetings in order to decide on the most absolutely essential information and scenes to prioritize. In order to ensure that the numerous guest characters have impact in the anime, we took care to depict not just their dialogue but also to give them action that leaves an impression.     Which characters did you particularly enjoy writing the lines for?   KOUNO: I especially enjoyed writing Mira and Solomon's interactions. Before Mira became known as one of the nine sages or Solomon established the kingdom of Arkite, they were both friendly in the real world. That makes their conversations very amusing. Even though they're in the dreadful situation of being stuck in a game world, I think the fact that Mira, Solomon, and the others can smile through it all is rooted in how they've stuck together through thick and thin. Through their conversations, I depicted them as not just game friends, but as real-life friends.

The main character, Danblf, transforms into a young girl and journeys through a changed world set 30 years later. ANN spoke to the novel author Hirotsugu Ryusen, as well as director Keitaro Motonaga and screenwriter Takamitsu Kouno about how they brought the virtual world to life.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   (For author Hirotsugu Ryusen) The protagonist enters the game world only to realize that many years have passed within the game. What inspired this part of the story's premise?   RYUSEN: I like pure fantasy, but I also like it when modern technology has been arranged in a fantasy-like way. As I was thinking about how to create a setting where it wouldn't be strange for those elements to exist, I took inspiration from other novels I was reading at the time. I thought it would be neat to create a time skip and make the former players, who already possess modern knowledge, accomplish various feats ahead of time.    Also, because of the influence of those players, special modern words have spread throughout society in those 30 years. It gave me some looseness to play with words to an extent.     The novel explains the VRMMORPG setting in a lot of detail. What was your approach to creating the world?   RYUSEN: The foundation was built on the MMORPG I was engrossed in at the time. By referring to the knowledge and experiences I accumulated from that MMO, I was able to work out my ideal world for a game. I've also enjoyed creating worlds for a long time. I note down the details of a fictional game when I think of them, and when I combined them on this opportunity, this is what I got.     Are you the kind of writer who begins thinking about the world or the characters first?   RYUSEN: If I had to say, I suppose I start with the world… My ideal world. The people who live there. And the characters who stand out among them. I suppose that's how it goes.     What is the appeal of young girls who refer to themselves as ""washi""?   RYUSEN: I wonder, indeed… When I think about it, I never actually considered what was the appeal. I was just drawn to it hazily. I don't quite get it, but I like it. That can happen, right?    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   (For director Keitaro Motonaga)  Regarding the depiction of the VRMMORPG world, did you use any existing MMORPGs or other games as references?   MOTONAGA: I tried out a few titles my friend recommended to me and used them as references. For the things I referenced inside the game, I made sure not to make the resemblance too strong.     What sort of things did you keep in mind in order to depict Mira's cuteness?   MOTONAGA: I didn't want her to just be cute. Since she used to be Danblf, I kept Danblf's movements in mind, like how she carries herself when she stands. For example, she puts her hands on her hips or crosses her arms. Through those Danblf-like mannerisms, I tried to show Mira's cuteness.     How did you decide on the worldview of the anime? What kind of directions did you give to the art director?   MOTONAGA: That's a secret! (laughs) Anyway, I wanted the world to look beautiful, with a crisp and clean air. I asked him to be conscious of beautiful European streets and the World Heritage sites, and to capture the vibes around those places. That's all I asked for.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project    What inspired the montage at the end of episode 1?   MOTONAGA: I wanted to make Mira's signature line “I am cute” (said with an old man's first-person pronoun “washi”) stand out. I wondered if there was a way I could express it, and the montage was what I came up with.    That wasn't the only thing, of course. Like I mentioned before, I asked the art director to convey the vibes of beautiful European streets. By not having any spoken lines, we could show off the world and its atmosphere.    (For series composition writer Takamitsu Kouno) What was your first impression of the original work?   KOUNO: I thought it was wonderful. What makes it outstandingly original is that it's a game world where the existing skills, magic, towns, and kingdoms have all been shaped by the hands of players. I also think it's great how the story is based around the actions of the protagonist Danblf/Mira.     What did you keep in mind this time when writing the script?   KOUNO: The protagonist Mira is a beautiful and lovely girl. However, she was originally the dignified wise sage Danblf. And behind that is a player acting out a role. What was the best way to depict this amusing, peculiar, complicated, and mysterious figure? That was the first thing I turned my attention to. Specifically, I took care not to make Mira exhibit “girlish” mannerisms, words, or actions.    When the player is presenting himself as the wise sage Danblf, he is taking care to roleplay in a dignified manner. That doesn't change even when he turns into Mira. That's why the biggest thing I kept in mind when writing the script was how to act out Mira.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   How did you balance the amount of information in the novel with the action? The series also has a lot of characters, so what did you keep in mind to make each of them stand out in the anime?   KOUNO: The amount of material you can cover in 12 anime episodes that are 20 minutes long is limited, no matter how you slice it. Because of this, we consulted with the original creator's side at the script meetings in order to decide on the most absolutely essential information and scenes to prioritize. In order to ensure that the numerous guest characters have impact in the anime, we took care to depict not just their dialogue but also to give them action that leaves an impression.     Which characters did you particularly enjoy writing the lines for?   KOUNO: I especially enjoyed writing Mira and Solomon's interactions. Before Mira became known as one of the nine sages or Solomon established the kingdom of Arkite, they were both friendly in the real world. That makes their conversations very amusing. Even though they're in the dreadful situation of being stuck in a game world, I think the fact that Mira, Solomon, and the others can smile through it all is rooted in how they've stuck together through thick and thin. Through their conversations, I depicted them as not just game friends, but as real-life friends.    She Professed Herself Pupil of the Wise Man is streaming on Funimation.

Community score: 3.6              What is this?   Those that use ""voice medicine,"" the ability to heal injuries and cure illnesses with song, are called ""healers."" There are three apprentice healers working at the Karasuma Voice Treatment Center. Kana Fujii, an energetic girl who sets the tone, the strong-willed lady Reimi Itsushiro, and Hibiki Morishima who is caring but firm. These three first year high school girls are training after school to become full-fledged Healers. With the addition of Sonia Yanagi, a returnee who is a certified C-level healer, the girls are singing songs of healing as they work towards their dreams.    Healer Girl is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Mondays.      How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                While the first episode of Healer Girl is an enjoyable enough introduction to our typical cute girl trio—i.e., the well-intentioned screw-up, the calm one, and the overly serious one—what really captured my attention was the world they exist in. Healer Girl is a world in which singing is an accepted form of medical treatment with results on par with Western medicine. This is a fun idea—it's basically a form of magic being incorporated into everyday society. More interesting still is that natural talent is apparently a prerequisite for healing through singing—though even recordings of these healers will give at least some relief. As a person who loves hard magic systems (i.e., magic systems with concrete rules on how and why they work the way they do), it was a blast to learn about the girls' singing powers.    At the same time, however, the central conflict of the episode doesn't make sense. The show is structured around the conceit that magical singers are basically doctors. As such, they can't heal without a license. But why? The reason doctors need licenses is that, when dealing with invasive medical procedures or dangerous medications, an ignorant person could do far more harm than good.  But can a magical song hurt a patient? We see no sign of this as, according to the character dialogue, the only downside of poor singing is that it makes the treatment less effective.    I'm guessing that what Kana did in the climax counts as first aid rather than healing, but it made me wonder where exactly the line is. (It also made me wonder if a normal first aid kit in this world comes with a non-prescription MP3 player to help in emergencies.)    If it comes off like I dislike the show, let me assure you that I'm not. It's the opposite, actually.  I enjoyed the show so much that I am invested in the world it is trying to build—that is why these issues stand out. I want this world to feel as real as possible.    And as for the music, while I wouldn't call the songs bangers, they were decent enough. But what I absolutely loved more than the songs themselves was the extensive use of diegetic music. When the girls break into song in public, they are actually singing and the people around them act accordingly. And, due to their profession, their constant singing makes total sense. (As a onetime musical theater/choir kid, let me tell you, randomly singing at your friends is actually rather normal.) It adds yet another layer to the world-building and makes it feel even more, well, real. And while it has some plot holes that need filling, it's a world I am loving spending time in.        Caitlin Moore  Rating:               Oh wow, a musical anime! I hope it'll be just like my favorite anime, Lost Song!    Just kidding. Lost Song has never been and never will be anyone's favorite anime. Healer Girl, on the other hand, stands a pretty chance of becoming beloved by at least some and, if it keeps on track, maybe even many. This sweet little musical series, with its bright, colorful aesthetic and strong direction with dynamic camera work by industry veteran Yasuhiro Irie, has presented a strong premiere, even if it's not totally my thing.    While I wasn't particularly drawn in by the character writing – Karin is a pretty typical overenthusiastic but gifted newbie with her two best friends to corral her – the world fascinated me. Musical healing exists right alongside Eastern and Western medicine, and is presented as empirically effective. A kid has a scraped knee, Karin sings to him, his knee heals, all is well. Not a lot of room for skepticism there. I have so many questions, but in a good, “I'm curious about this worldbuilding” way rather than the way of “this makes no sense if you think about it for ten seconds.” Why would people choose the more invasive forms of medicine over musical healing? Clearly this form of medicine has its limits, since their instructor sent their client, an old woman with respiratory problems, to a hospital. What are they? Is there an in-universe reason for why all the healers are girls?    My biggest issue lies in the music. Plainly put, it's bland. It's like the most boring, forgettable Disney soundtrack ever conceived, and I'm not convinced that it can carry the show. Oh sure, the number where the girls start singing to each other about why they want to become healers is kind of fun, but it's unfocused and there doesn't seem to be much reason for it to be a song. It's more like an opera's libretto than anything you'd find in the standard structure of a musical.    Still, I doubt that'll be enough to put off most of the people who will be drawn in by this.        James Beckett  Rating:               I freaking love musicals. One of my longtime dreams has been to see a studio produce a big-budget, no- holds-barred Broadway-style musical. I'm not talking about an idol series or a show about a rock band, or an episode of a slice-of-life anime where the kids put on a concert for their culture festival. I'm talking about the pure, undiluted cheese that comes from regular characters interrupting the story to break out into perfectly choreographed dance numbers, belt their hearts out, and then move on as if nothing completely insane has just happened. Does anyone here remember Galavant? That show rules. I basically want an anime Galavant.    Healer Girl is not anime Galavant, sadly, but it's the closest we've gotten to the dream, gosh darn it, and it made me extremely happy anyways. Our main trio are all well-drawn, both literally and as likable character archetypes, and they all possess the nearly unbearable levels of sincerity it takes to make it as the leads of a musical, not to mention some incredibly toned diaphragms, and the whole “Being able to magically heal the wounds of the sick with nothing but the power of music” thing. The show looks good, it's cute and charming when it needs to be, and most importantly, it's got the tunes it needs to back up its premise.    Now, if I'm being honest, the style of singing we get in this premiere is just a bit treacly for my taste, and I was a little put off by some of the strange mixing choices—not only are the girls' voices auto-tuned to heck and back, but the universe provides a somewhat tinny and perfectly synched backing soundtrack whenever Kana and her friends open their mouths. In short, it both looks and sounds less like the characters are themselves singing, and more like they're all lip-syncing to some poorly mixed audio already in progress. And yes, I know that technically I'm just defining how voice-over works in animation, but I'm talking about the effect of the production. It often doesn't quite feel like the music and the characters are operating on the same aural plane of existence, if that makes any sense.    Still, I won't complain too much, because it was very fun to watch the girls get to know each other and show off their vocal skills, and some of the banter we get is the closest that I've ever seen an anime get to a Broadway styled patter song. Plus, we get to spend a half-hour in a world where, when a little kid's grandmother collapses on the floor, she really can be saved with the power of a good show tune. That's the kind of world I want to live in, if only in weekly chunks of about twenty-three minutes each. Healer Girl may not be quite the full-scale song-and-dance production that I've been waiting for, but it's a damned good time for anyone that needs an extra dose of musical healing this season.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               We get a lot of music-related anime – mostly idol shows – but it's exceedingly rare that we get a full-on West Side Story-style Capital-M Musical anime. While Healer Girl doesn't go all the way into that territory, it gets pretty darn close, and the result is a vibrant and earnest little treat. You're just going to need a stomach for unerringly saccharine sentimentality to get through it.    Make no mistake: if you're the kind of person who starts to grimace when characters snap their gaze into the middle distance and start singing their feelings, you will find nothing but pain here. Healer Girl is such a bubbly show in tone, aesthetic, and presentation, that it has no place for a concept so cynical as cringe. It's dancing forward down the street, humming a pop ballad too loudly with its airpods on full blast, and you can either trot along to its tune or hastily cross the street to avoid it.    Me, I love musicals, even if this show's audio sensibilities aren't really my jam. But that's more than made up for by the wonderful, colorful, constantly expressive animation that brings these characters and their songs to life. The way each of them moves, especially in their flowy “Healer” robes, is just a delight to take in. The characters themselves are likable enough, though not particularly deep or novel. But the way they're characterized through movement, how they physically interact with each other and the world around them, is just so charming that it overrides any writing deficiencies.    And because there's not a speck of cynicism in Healer Girl's body, that all manages to make Kana and her friends really fun to just watch, whether they're healing the sick or goofing around to avoid filling out paperwork. My favorite scene is easily the one where Kana asks her fellow apprentices why they chose to be Healers, and they all start spontaneously singing their motivations. It's campy, silly, and caps off with Hibiki getting so caught up in singing about her admiration for their teacher that nothing can stop her. It takes what could be a by-the-books bit of character exposition and turns it into something with way more personality, and if the rest of the show can add touches like that, I think this will turn out to be a wonderful little show.    There are most certainly people who will be put off by the chord this show is striking, and I totally get that. Healer Girl is prancing right on the line between earnest iyashikei and irritating pabulum, and no amount of stellar production is going to make you like something you find annoyingly pwecious. But at least for this first episode, I'm happy to sing along with this sugary sweet bubblegum bop.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               It's not exactly a secret that singing can sometimes help to calm you down or otherwise affect your mood, and I'm not just saying that because my mother took The King and I's advice about whistling a happy tune to forget you're afraid pretty literally. (Because who doesn't want terrible musical accompaniment on a harrowing boat trip?) Healer Girl may be taking the concept a bit too far, though, with its fancy third branch of medicine and an apprenticeship program to train girls into fully-fledged musical healers. Do male voices not work as well? Are there no accredited musical medical schools? Who knows? It's a musical, pesky things like serious questions aren't necessary here.    And this really is a fairly classic musical. While there's singing to heal a variety of ailments, we also have a couple of instances where people just burst into song to explain things like why they got into musical healing in the first place, and before we know what's going on in that opening scene, Kana walking down the street singing at full blast and the stunned facial expressions of the folks on the street certainly looks like something straight out of a self-aware musical. Even the basic plot of Kana's inability to wait until her training is complete before she heals people feels a bit like the stuff of Broadway, or at least the Disney Channel, especially since there aren't any real repercussions for her doing so twice this episode. It's just fortunate that she's as talented as she is enthusiastic, because otherwise the whole thing with Yui's grandmother could have gone downhill fast.    How much you will like this is absolutely going to hinge on your ability to suspend your disbelief. Not that it's any less ridiculous than any number of other plot premises we've seen over the years; it's more the way that it's executed. I do very much appreciate that we don't get a lot of long-winded explanations about what the whole musical healing thing is, and that Karasuma and Shoko (the masters to the girls' apprentices) go to what is clearly an academic conference is an important bit of world-building because it establishes musical medicine as a real and serious profession in the story's world rather than a fringe belief. But at the end of the day it's still a story about a very perky, nearly TSTL high school girl singing at people to make their boo-boos go away. And it is worth mentioning that all but one of the cases that we see in this episode appear to be scrapes and scratches, even those treated by Karasuma. Possibly this is to save up the drama for Grandma's collapse in the end of the episode, which isn't a terrible plan, but it does feel a little odd, since normally a scrape is more a trip to the pharmacy than the doctor.    I'm not sure I'm interested in watching more of this. Kana's naivete is a bit much, watching Reimi pant after her teacher isn't as funny as it wants to be, and the episode didn't really sell me on the lure of musical healing. But I'm also not really a music or a musical person, so if those things are more appealing to you, I think this could turn out to be pretty fun.     discuss this in the forum (291 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

And as for the music, while I wouldn't call the songs bangers, they were decent enough. But what I absolutely loved more than the songs themselves was the extensive use of diegetic music. When the girls break into song in public, they are actually singing and the people around them act accordingly. And, due to their profession, their constant singing makes total sense. (As a onetime musical theater/choir kid, let me tell you, randomly singing at your friends is actually rather normal.) It adds yet another layer to the world-building and makes it feel even more, well, real. And while it has some plot holes that need filling, it's a world I am loving spending time in.        Caitlin Moore  Rating:               Oh wow, a musical anime! I hope it'll be just like my favorite anime, Lost Song!    Just kidding. Lost Song has never been and never will be anyone's favorite anime. Healer Girl, on the other hand, stands a pretty chance of becoming beloved by at least some and, if it keeps on track, maybe even many. This sweet little musical series, with its bright, colorful aesthetic and strong direction with dynamic camera work by industry veteran Yasuhiro Irie, has presented a strong premiere, even if it's not totally my thing.    While I wasn't particularly drawn in by the character writing – Karin is a pretty typical overenthusiastic but gifted newbie with her two best friends to corral her – the world fascinated me. Musical healing exists right alongside Eastern and Western medicine, and is presented as empirically effective. A kid has a scraped knee, Karin sings to him, his knee heals, all is well. Not a lot of room for skepticism there. I have so many questions, but in a good, “I'm curious about this worldbuilding” way rather than the way of “this makes no sense if you think about it for ten seconds.” Why would people choose the more invasive forms of medicine over musical healing? Clearly this form of medicine has its limits, since their instructor sent their client, an old woman with respiratory problems, to a hospital. What are they? Is there an in-universe reason for why all the healers are girls?    My biggest issue lies in the music. Plainly put, it's bland. It's like the most boring, forgettable Disney soundtrack ever conceived, and I'm not convinced that it can carry the show. Oh sure, the number where the girls start singing to each other about why they want to become healers is kind of fun, but it's unfocused and there doesn't seem to be much reason for it to be a song. It's more like an opera's libretto than anything you'd find in the standard structure of a musical.    Still, I doubt that'll be enough to put off most of the people who will be drawn in by this.        James Beckett  Rating:               I freaking love musicals. One of my longtime dreams has been to see a studio produce a big-budget, no- holds-barred Broadway-style musical. I'm not talking about an idol series or a show about a rock band, or an episode of a slice-of-life anime where the kids put on a concert for their culture festival. I'm talking about the pure, undiluted cheese that comes from regular characters interrupting the story to break out into perfectly choreographed dance numbers, belt their hearts out, and then move on as if nothing completely insane has just happened. Does anyone here remember Galavant? That show rules. I basically want an anime Galavant.    Healer Girl is not anime Galavant, sadly, but it's the closest we've gotten to the dream, gosh darn it, and it made me extremely happy anyways. Our main trio are all well-drawn, both literally and as likable character archetypes, and they all possess the nearly unbearable levels of sincerity it takes to make it as the leads of a musical, not to mention some incredibly toned diaphragms, and the whole “Being able to magically heal the wounds of the sick with nothing but the power of music” thing. The show looks good, it's cute and charming when it needs to be, and most importantly, it's got the tunes it needs to back up its premise.    Now, if I'm being honest, the style of singing we get in this premiere is just a bit treacly for my taste, and I was a little put off by some of the strange mixing choices—not only are the girls' voices auto-tuned to heck and back, but the universe provides a somewhat tinny and perfectly synched backing soundtrack whenever Kana and her friends open their mouths. In short, it both looks and sounds less like the characters are themselves singing, and more like they're all lip-syncing to some poorly mixed audio already in progress. And yes, I know that technically I'm just defining how voice-over works in animation, but I'm talking about the effect of the production. It often doesn't quite feel like the music and the characters are operating on the same aural plane of existence, if that makes any sense.    Still, I won't complain too much, because it was very fun to watch the girls get to know each other and show off their vocal skills, and some of the banter we get is the closest that I've ever seen an anime get to a Broadway styled patter song. Plus, we get to spend a half-hour in a world where, when a little kid's grandmother collapses on the floor, she really can be saved with the power of a good show tune. That's the kind of world I want to live in, if only in weekly chunks of about twenty-three minutes each. Healer Girl may not be quite the full-scale song-and-dance production that I've been waiting for, but it's a damned good time for anyone that needs an extra dose of musical healing this season.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               We get a lot of music-related anime – mostly idol shows – but it's exceedingly rare that we get a full-on West Side Story-style Capital-M Musical anime. While Healer Girl doesn't go all the way into that territory, it gets pretty darn close, and the result is a vibrant and earnest little treat. You're just going to need a stomach for unerringly saccharine sentimentality to get through it.    Make no mistake: if you're the kind of person who starts to grimace when characters snap their gaze into the middle distance and start singing their feelings, you will find nothing but pain here. Healer Girl is such a bubbly show in tone, aesthetic, and presentation, that it has no place for a concept so cynical as cringe. It's dancing forward down the street, humming a pop ballad too loudly with its airpods on full blast, and you can either trot along to its tune or hastily cross the street to avoid it.    Me, I love musicals, even if this show's audio sensibilities aren't really my jam. But that's more than made up for by the wonderful, colorful, constantly expressive animation that brings these characters and their songs to life. The way each of them moves, especially in their flowy “Healer” robes, is just a delight to take in. The characters themselves are likable enough, though not particularly deep or novel. But the way they're characterized through movement, how they physically interact with each other and the world around them, is just so charming that it overrides any writing deficiencies.    And because there's not a speck of cynicism in Healer Girl's body, that all manages to make Kana and her friends really fun to just watch, whether they're healing the sick or goofing around to avoid filling out paperwork. My favorite scene is easily the one where Kana asks her fellow apprentices why they chose to be Healers, and they all start spontaneously singing their motivations. It's campy, silly, and caps off with Hibiki getting so caught up in singing about her admiration for their teacher that nothing can stop her. It takes what could be a by-the-books bit of character exposition and turns it into something with way more personality, and if the rest of the show can add touches like that, I think this will turn out to be a wonderful little show.    There are most certainly people who will be put off by the chord this show is striking, and I totally get that. Healer Girl is prancing right on the line between earnest iyashikei and irritating pabulum, and no amount of stellar production is going to make you like something you find annoyingly pwecious. But at least for this first episode, I'm happy to sing along with this sugary sweet bubblegum bop.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               It's not exactly a secret that singing can sometimes help to calm you down or otherwise affect your mood, and I'm not just saying that because my mother took The King and I's advice about whistling a happy tune to forget you're afraid pretty literally. (Because who doesn't want terrible musical accompaniment on a harrowing boat trip?) Healer Girl may be taking the concept a bit too far, though, with its fancy third branch of medicine and an apprenticeship program to train girls into fully-fledged musical healers. Do male voices not work as well? Are there no accredited musical medical schools? Who knows? It's a musical, pesky things like serious questions aren't necessary here.    And this really is a fairly classic musical. While there's singing to heal a variety of ailments, we also have a couple of instances where people just burst into song to explain things like why they got into musical healing in the first place, and before we know what's going on in that opening scene, Kana walking down the street singing at full blast and the stunned facial expressions of the folks on the street certainly looks like something straight out of a self-aware musical. Even the basic plot of Kana's inability to wait until her training is complete before she heals people feels a bit like the stuff of Broadway, or at least the Disney Channel, especially since there aren't any real repercussions for her doing so twice this episode. It's just fortunate that she's as talented as she is enthusiastic, because otherwise the whole thing with Yui's grandmother could have gone downhill fast.    How much you will like this is absolutely going to hinge on your ability to suspend your disbelief. Not that it's any less ridiculous than any number of other plot premises we've seen over the years; it's more the way that it's executed. I do very much appreciate that we don't get a lot of long-winded explanations about what the whole musical healing thing is, and that Karasuma and Shoko (the masters to the girls' apprentices) go to what is clearly an academic conference is an important bit of world-building because it establishes musical medicine as a real and serious profession in the story's world rather than a fringe belief. But at the end of the day it's still a story about a very perky, nearly TSTL high school girl singing at people to make their boo-boos go away. And it is worth mentioning that all but one of the cases that we see in this episode appear to be scrapes and scratches, even those treated by Karasuma. Possibly this is to save up the drama for Grandma's collapse in the end of the episode, which isn't a terrible plan, but it does feel a little odd, since normally a scrape is more a trip to the pharmacy than the doctor.    I'm not sure I'm interested in watching more of this. Kana's naivete is a bit much, watching Reimi pant after her teacher isn't as funny as it wants to be, and the episode didn't really sell me on the lure of musical healing. But I'm also not really a music or a musical person, so if those things are more appealing to you, I think this could turn out to be pretty fun.     discuss this in the forum (291 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives     ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 3.6              What is this?   Those that use ""voice medicine,"" the ability to heal injuries and cure illnesses with song, are called ""healers."" There are three apprentice healers working at the Karasuma Voice Treatment Center. Kana Fujii, an energetic girl who sets the tone, the strong-willed lady Reimi Itsushiro, and Hibiki Morishima who is caring but firm. These three first year high school girls are training after school to become full-fledged Healers. With the addition of Sonia Yanagi, a returnee who is a certified C-level healer, the girls are singing songs of healing as they work towards their dreams.    Healer Girl is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Mondays.      How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                While the first episode of Healer Girl is an enjoyable enough introduction to our typical cute girl trio—i.e., the well-intentioned screw-up, the calm one, and the overly serious one—what really captured my attention was the world they exist in. Healer Girl is a world in which singing is an accepted form of medical treatment with results on par with Western medicine. This is a fun idea—it's basically a form of magic being incorporated into everyday society. More interesting still is that natural talent is apparently a prerequisite for healing through singing—though even recordings of these healers will give at least some relief. As a person who loves hard magic systems (i.e., magic systems with concrete rules on how and why they work the way they do), it was a blast to learn about the girls' singing powers.    At the same time, however, the central conflict of the episode doesn't make sense. The show is structured around the conceit that magical singers are basically doctors. As such, they can't heal without a license. But why? The reason doctors need licenses is that, when dealing with invasive medical procedures or dangerous medications, an ignorant person could do far more harm than good.  But can a magical song hurt a patient? We see no sign of this as, according to the character dialogue, the only downside of poor singing is that it makes the treatment less effective.    I'm guessing that what Kana did in the climax counts as first aid rather than healing, but it made me wonder where exactly the line is. (It also made me wonder if a normal first aid kit in this world comes with a non-prescription MP3 player to help in emergencies.)    If it comes off like I dislike the show, let me assure you that I'm not. It's the opposite, actually.  I enjoyed the show so much that I am invested in the world it is trying to build—that is why these issues stand out. I want this world to feel as real as possible.

Still, I doubt that'll be enough to put off most of the people who will be drawn in by this.        James Beckett  Rating:               I freaking love musicals. One of my longtime dreams has been to see a studio produce a big-budget, no- holds-barred Broadway-style musical. I'm not talking about an idol series or a show about a rock band, or an episode of a slice-of-life anime where the kids put on a concert for their culture festival. I'm talking about the pure, undiluted cheese that comes from regular characters interrupting the story to break out into perfectly choreographed dance numbers, belt their hearts out, and then move on as if nothing completely insane has just happened. Does anyone here remember Galavant? That show rules. I basically want an anime Galavant.    Healer Girl is not anime Galavant, sadly, but it's the closest we've gotten to the dream, gosh darn it, and it made me extremely happy anyways. Our main trio are all well-drawn, both literally and as likable character archetypes, and they all possess the nearly unbearable levels of sincerity it takes to make it as the leads of a musical, not to mention some incredibly toned diaphragms, and the whole “Being able to magically heal the wounds of the sick with nothing but the power of music” thing. The show looks good, it's cute and charming when it needs to be, and most importantly, it's got the tunes it needs to back up its premise.    Now, if I'm being honest, the style of singing we get in this premiere is just a bit treacly for my taste, and I was a little put off by some of the strange mixing choices—not only are the girls' voices auto-tuned to heck and back, but the universe provides a somewhat tinny and perfectly synched backing soundtrack whenever Kana and her friends open their mouths. In short, it both looks and sounds less like the characters are themselves singing, and more like they're all lip-syncing to some poorly mixed audio already in progress. And yes, I know that technically I'm just defining how voice-over works in animation, but I'm talking about the effect of the production. It often doesn't quite feel like the music and the characters are operating on the same aural plane of existence, if that makes any sense.    Still, I won't complain too much, because it was very fun to watch the girls get to know each other and show off their vocal skills, and some of the banter we get is the closest that I've ever seen an anime get to a Broadway styled patter song. Plus, we get to spend a half-hour in a world where, when a little kid's grandmother collapses on the floor, she really can be saved with the power of a good show tune. That's the kind of world I want to live in, if only in weekly chunks of about twenty-three minutes each. Healer Girl may not be quite the full-scale song-and-dance production that I've been waiting for, but it's a damned good time for anyone that needs an extra dose of musical healing this season.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               We get a lot of music-related anime – mostly idol shows – but it's exceedingly rare that we get a full-on West Side Story-style Capital-M Musical anime. While Healer Girl doesn't go all the way into that territory, it gets pretty darn close, and the result is a vibrant and earnest little treat. You're just going to need a stomach for unerringly saccharine sentimentality to get through it.    Make no mistake: if you're the kind of person who starts to grimace when characters snap their gaze into the middle distance and start singing their feelings, you will find nothing but pain here. Healer Girl is such a bubbly show in tone, aesthetic, and presentation, that it has no place for a concept so cynical as cringe. It's dancing forward down the street, humming a pop ballad too loudly with its airpods on full blast, and you can either trot along to its tune or hastily cross the street to avoid it.    Me, I love musicals, even if this show's audio sensibilities aren't really my jam. But that's more than made up for by the wonderful, colorful, constantly expressive animation that brings these characters and their songs to life. The way each of them moves, especially in their flowy “Healer” robes, is just a delight to take in. The characters themselves are likable enough, though not particularly deep or novel. But the way they're characterized through movement, how they physically interact with each other and the world around them, is just so charming that it overrides any writing deficiencies.    And because there's not a speck of cynicism in Healer Girl's body, that all manages to make Kana and her friends really fun to just watch, whether they're healing the sick or goofing around to avoid filling out paperwork. My favorite scene is easily the one where Kana asks her fellow apprentices why they chose to be Healers, and they all start spontaneously singing their motivations. It's campy, silly, and caps off with Hibiki getting so caught up in singing about her admiration for their teacher that nothing can stop her. It takes what could be a by-the-books bit of character exposition and turns it into something with way more personality, and if the rest of the show can add touches like that, I think this will turn out to be a wonderful little show.    There are most certainly people who will be put off by the chord this show is striking, and I totally get that. Healer Girl is prancing right on the line between earnest iyashikei and irritating pabulum, and no amount of stellar production is going to make you like something you find annoyingly pwecious. But at least for this first episode, I'm happy to sing along with this sugary sweet bubblegum bop.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               It's not exactly a secret that singing can sometimes help to calm you down or otherwise affect your mood, and I'm not just saying that because my mother took The King and I's advice about whistling a happy tune to forget you're afraid pretty literally. (Because who doesn't want terrible musical accompaniment on a harrowing boat trip?) Healer Girl may be taking the concept a bit too far, though, with its fancy third branch of medicine and an apprenticeship program to train girls into fully-fledged musical healers. Do male voices not work as well? Are there no accredited musical medical schools? Who knows? It's a musical, pesky things like serious questions aren't necessary here.    And this really is a fairly classic musical. While there's singing to heal a variety of ailments, we also have a couple of instances where people just burst into song to explain things like why they got into musical healing in the first place, and before we know what's going on in that opening scene, Kana walking down the street singing at full blast and the stunned facial expressions of the folks on the street certainly looks like something straight out of a self-aware musical. Even the basic plot of Kana's inability to wait until her training is complete before she heals people feels a bit like the stuff of Broadway, or at least the Disney Channel, especially since there aren't any real repercussions for her doing so twice this episode. It's just fortunate that she's as talented as she is enthusiastic, because otherwise the whole thing with Yui's grandmother could have gone downhill fast.    How much you will like this is absolutely going to hinge on your ability to suspend your disbelief. Not that it's any less ridiculous than any number of other plot premises we've seen over the years; it's more the way that it's executed. I do very much appreciate that we don't get a lot of long-winded explanations about what the whole musical healing thing is, and that Karasuma and Shoko (the masters to the girls' apprentices) go to what is clearly an academic conference is an important bit of world-building because it establishes musical medicine as a real and serious profession in the story's world rather than a fringe belief. But at the end of the day it's still a story about a very perky, nearly TSTL high school girl singing at people to make their boo-boos go away. And it is worth mentioning that all but one of the cases that we see in this episode appear to be scrapes and scratches, even those treated by Karasuma. Possibly this is to save up the drama for Grandma's collapse in the end of the episode, which isn't a terrible plan, but it does feel a little odd, since normally a scrape is more a trip to the pharmacy than the doctor.    I'm not sure I'm interested in watching more of this. Kana's naivete is a bit much, watching Reimi pant after her teacher isn't as funny as it wants to be, and the episode didn't really sell me on the lure of musical healing. But I'm also not really a music or a musical person, so if those things are more appealing to you, I think this could turn out to be pretty fun.     discuss this in the forum (291 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives   ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 3.6              What is this?   Those that use ""voice medicine,"" the ability to heal injuries and cure illnesses with song, are called ""healers."" There are three apprentice healers working at the Karasuma Voice Treatment Center. Kana Fujii, an energetic girl who sets the tone, the strong-willed lady Reimi Itsushiro, and Hibiki Morishima who is caring but firm. These three first year high school girls are training after school to become full-fledged Healers. With the addition of Sonia Yanagi, a returnee who is a certified C-level healer, the girls are singing songs of healing as they work towards their dreams.    Healer Girl is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Mondays.      How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                While the first episode of Healer Girl is an enjoyable enough introduction to our typical cute girl trio—i.e., the well-intentioned screw-up, the calm one, and the overly serious one—what really captured my attention was the world they exist in. Healer Girl is a world in which singing is an accepted form of medical treatment with results on par with Western medicine. This is a fun idea—it's basically a form of magic being incorporated into everyday society. More interesting still is that natural talent is apparently a prerequisite for healing through singing—though even recordings of these healers will give at least some relief. As a person who loves hard magic systems (i.e., magic systems with concrete rules on how and why they work the way they do), it was a blast to learn about the girls' singing powers.    At the same time, however, the central conflict of the episode doesn't make sense. The show is structured around the conceit that magical singers are basically doctors. As such, they can't heal without a license. But why? The reason doctors need licenses is that, when dealing with invasive medical procedures or dangerous medications, an ignorant person could do far more harm than good.  But can a magical song hurt a patient? We see no sign of this as, according to the character dialogue, the only downside of poor singing is that it makes the treatment less effective.    I'm guessing that what Kana did in the climax counts as first aid rather than healing, but it made me wonder where exactly the line is. (It also made me wonder if a normal first aid kit in this world comes with a non-prescription MP3 player to help in emergencies.)    If it comes off like I dislike the show, let me assure you that I'm not. It's the opposite, actually.  I enjoyed the show so much that I am invested in the world it is trying to build—that is why these issues stand out. I want this world to feel as real as possible.    And as for the music, while I wouldn't call the songs bangers, they were decent enough. But what I absolutely loved more than the songs themselves was the extensive use of diegetic music. When the girls break into song in public, they are actually singing and the people around them act accordingly. And, due to their profession, their constant singing makes total sense. (As a onetime musical theater/choir kid, let me tell you, randomly singing at your friends is actually rather normal.) It adds yet another layer to the world-building and makes it feel even more, well, real. And while it has some plot holes that need filling, it's a world I am loving spending time in.        Caitlin Moore  Rating:               Oh wow, a musical anime! I hope it'll be just like my favorite anime, Lost Song!    Just kidding. Lost Song has never been and never will be anyone's favorite anime. Healer Girl, on the other hand, stands a pretty chance of becoming beloved by at least some and, if it keeps on track, maybe even many. This sweet little musical series, with its bright, colorful aesthetic and strong direction with dynamic camera work by industry veteran Yasuhiro Irie, has presented a strong premiere, even if it's not totally my thing.    While I wasn't particularly drawn in by the character writing – Karin is a pretty typical overenthusiastic but gifted newbie with her two best friends to corral her – the world fascinated me. Musical healing exists right alongside Eastern and Western medicine, and is presented as empirically effective. A kid has a scraped knee, Karin sings to him, his knee heals, all is well. Not a lot of room for skepticism there. I have so many questions, but in a good, “I'm curious about this worldbuilding” way rather than the way of “this makes no sense if you think about it for ten seconds.” Why would people choose the more invasive forms of medicine over musical healing? Clearly this form of medicine has its limits, since their instructor sent their client, an old woman with respiratory problems, to a hospital. What are they? Is there an in-universe reason for why all the healers are girls?    My biggest issue lies in the music. Plainly put, it's bland. It's like the most boring, forgettable Disney soundtrack ever conceived, and I'm not convinced that it can carry the show. Oh sure, the number where the girls start singing to each other about why they want to become healers is kind of fun, but it's unfocused and there doesn't seem to be much reason for it to be a song. It's more like an opera's libretto than anything you'd find in the standard structure of a musical.

Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               We get a lot of music-related anime – mostly idol shows – but it's exceedingly rare that we get a full-on West Side Story-style Capital-M Musical anime. While Healer Girl doesn't go all the way into that territory, it gets pretty darn close, and the result is a vibrant and earnest little treat. You're just going to need a stomach for unerringly saccharine sentimentality to get through it.    Make no mistake: if you're the kind of person who starts to grimace when characters snap their gaze into the middle distance and start singing their feelings, you will find nothing but pain here. Healer Girl is such a bubbly show in tone, aesthetic, and presentation, that it has no place for a concept so cynical as cringe. It's dancing forward down the street, humming a pop ballad too loudly with its airpods on full blast, and you can either trot along to its tune or hastily cross the street to avoid it.    Me, I love musicals, even if this show's audio sensibilities aren't really my jam. But that's more than made up for by the wonderful, colorful, constantly expressive animation that brings these characters and their songs to life. The way each of them moves, especially in their flowy “Healer” robes, is just a delight to take in. The characters themselves are likable enough, though not particularly deep or novel. But the way they're characterized through movement, how they physically interact with each other and the world around them, is just so charming that it overrides any writing deficiencies.    And because there's not a speck of cynicism in Healer Girl's body, that all manages to make Kana and her friends really fun to just watch, whether they're healing the sick or goofing around to avoid filling out paperwork. My favorite scene is easily the one where Kana asks her fellow apprentices why they chose to be Healers, and they all start spontaneously singing their motivations. It's campy, silly, and caps off with Hibiki getting so caught up in singing about her admiration for their teacher that nothing can stop her. It takes what could be a by-the-books bit of character exposition and turns it into something with way more personality, and if the rest of the show can add touches like that, I think this will turn out to be a wonderful little show.    There are most certainly people who will be put off by the chord this show is striking, and I totally get that. Healer Girl is prancing right on the line between earnest iyashikei and irritating pabulum, and no amount of stellar production is going to make you like something you find annoyingly pwecious. But at least for this first episode, I'm happy to sing along with this sugary sweet bubblegum bop.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               It's not exactly a secret that singing can sometimes help to calm you down or otherwise affect your mood, and I'm not just saying that because my mother took The King and I's advice about whistling a happy tune to forget you're afraid pretty literally. (Because who doesn't want terrible musical accompaniment on a harrowing boat trip?) Healer Girl may be taking the concept a bit too far, though, with its fancy third branch of medicine and an apprenticeship program to train girls into fully-fledged musical healers. Do male voices not work as well? Are there no accredited musical medical schools? Who knows? It's a musical, pesky things like serious questions aren't necessary here.    And this really is a fairly classic musical. While there's singing to heal a variety of ailments, we also have a couple of instances where people just burst into song to explain things like why they got into musical healing in the first place, and before we know what's going on in that opening scene, Kana walking down the street singing at full blast and the stunned facial expressions of the folks on the street certainly looks like something straight out of a self-aware musical. Even the basic plot of Kana's inability to wait until her training is complete before she heals people feels a bit like the stuff of Broadway, or at least the Disney Channel, especially since there aren't any real repercussions for her doing so twice this episode. It's just fortunate that she's as talented as she is enthusiastic, because otherwise the whole thing with Yui's grandmother could have gone downhill fast.    How much you will like this is absolutely going to hinge on your ability to suspend your disbelief. Not that it's any less ridiculous than any number of other plot premises we've seen over the years; it's more the way that it's executed. I do very much appreciate that we don't get a lot of long-winded explanations about what the whole musical healing thing is, and that Karasuma and Shoko (the masters to the girls' apprentices) go to what is clearly an academic conference is an important bit of world-building because it establishes musical medicine as a real and serious profession in the story's world rather than a fringe belief. But at the end of the day it's still a story about a very perky, nearly TSTL high school girl singing at people to make their boo-boos go away. And it is worth mentioning that all but one of the cases that we see in this episode appear to be scrapes and scratches, even those treated by Karasuma. Possibly this is to save up the drama for Grandma's collapse in the end of the episode, which isn't a terrible plan, but it does feel a little odd, since normally a scrape is more a trip to the pharmacy than the doctor.    I'm not sure I'm interested in watching more of this. Kana's naivete is a bit much, watching Reimi pant after her teacher isn't as funny as it wants to be, and the episode didn't really sell me on the lure of musical healing. But I'm also not really a music or a musical person, so if those things are more appealing to you, I think this could turn out to be pretty fun.

Community score: 3.6              What is this?   Office worker Leon is reincarnated into a particularly punishing dating sim video game, where women reign supreme and only beautiful men have a seat at the table. But Leon has a secret weapon: he remembers everything from his past life, which includes a complete playthrough of the very game in which he is now trapped. Watch Leon spark a revolution to change this new world in order to fulfill his ultimate desire of living a quiet, easy life in the countryside.    Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs is based on Yomu Mishima's light novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Sundays.      How was the first episode?   Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               This seems to be the season for me to be making statements like this, but I liked this story (tale type?) more when it was Past Life Countess, Present Life Otome Game NPC?!. Both series have a similar premise: someone is reincarnated in the world of an otome game as a random background character and have to do their best to get the kind of life they want. In the case of this show (based on the light novels of the same name), Leon seems to mostly want to overcome the disadvantages of his upbringing, which are apparently being both the son of his father's mistress and being born male. The latter does raise an eyebrow from me, because I can't think of any otome games that I've played that have that sort of world set up; naturally this doesn't mean that they don't exist, but it's the kind of detail that makes me wonder if the writer(s) have a whole lot of familiarity with otome games in the first place.    The show feels most concerned with the apparently bizarre nature of the game world he's been reincarnated into, which has elements of both fantasy and science fiction, but that's another mild red flag, because those two genres absolutely coexist in the otome games Steam Prison and Code:Realize.    Even if that wasn't the case, however, there's negligible time spent discovering what exactly Leon is after in going to the fancy academy from the game. Perhaps he does want to marry well, but the loot that he brings back from his foray to steal the game's goodies before the plot of the game begins would seem to negate that need, and he also doesn't seem interested in making a play for the heroine. In fact, he actively dislikes the characters from the game, as we see in his playthrough before he falls down the stairs and dies, which may be the single most original moment here because he's not being creamed by everyone's favorite motor vehicle. Watching Leon play the game is probably the most entertaining piece of the entire episode as he gets increasingly frustrated with its mechanics and characters, but even that is marred by the fact that he's doing it for his sister so that she doesn't have to. Does YouTube not exist in their world? Because last I checked, that was a good way to get to watch the cutscenes from video games without having to play them yourself.    The plot doesn't have a terrible concept, and goodness knows that isekai (otome game or otherwise) is ripe for parody and deconstruction at this stage. But as with The Executioner and Her Way of Life, I don't find this the most compelling telling of this particular story. Plus I'm very concerned that the story's “women have all the power” set up is going to be used as a way for the hero to frame himself as a perpetual victim, and I'm not a fan of that for any gender. This just is kind of a muddle, and that's a shame.        James Beckett  Rating:               I've come to learn that, of all the variations of the modern isekai anime that have cropped up over the years, I tend to prefer the ones where characters get trapped in dating sims and the like. The generic MMORPG worlds that so many of the other isekai trade in bore me to tears, and the stories tend to lack focus and direction on account of the open-ended natures of the video games that the stories are riffing on. When a gal or guy gets reincarnated into a dating sim, though, we have a set cast of characters and plot with more momentum right off the bat, and the characters' knowledge of the game has to be a little more specific than simply having memorized a thousand menus and sub-systems. Granted, the point of cribbing from the tropes of popular dating sims still lies in the fact that the isekai stories are treading familiar ground, but if we must operate entirely within the bumper-lanes of old clichés, I'll settle for the somewhat more entertaining clichés.    For those reasons, I ended up having an okay time with Trapped in a Dating Sim, even if it never left me feeling particularly excited or intrigued. A lot of my reservations come from the episode being such an exposition dump; we don't even meet the other central characters of the dating game that Leon has found himself stuck in until the very final shots of the premiere. Until then, it's the Leon the Loner show from top to bottom. He's not an awful protagonist, but he's nothing new to the genre, either. He's prickly and socially awkward, but he also can't be too much of an asshole, since we still have to be impressed with how much he breaks the game using his Earthbound knowledge of its systems and plot. This means that the story of this premiere is essentially a linear chronicle of how Leon inserts himself into the main plot of the game, with most scenes consisting of Leon monologuing in explicit detail what he knows about the game, how he's going to manipulate it, etc. This is the kind of stuff I almost never find interesting, because it assumes that the joy of the isekai premise comes from having the protagonist narrate the condensed Wiki-entry version of a video game, and not, you know, letting us just watch the story happen in peace.    Still, the setting itself has some cool stuff going for it, namely in how it mixes the elements of its typical fantasy setting with mechs and other sci-fi trappings—always a nice touch. It could also very well be that the story picks up speed once Leon arrives at the academy where the game truly takes place and starts to mingle with all of the characters; it's hard to judge how strong a dating-game style story is going to be when you don't even know most of the ensemble yet. I might stick with Trapped in a Dating Sim for another episode or two, just to see if it ends up winning me over. I doubt it will be as fun as My Next Life as a Villainess, but who knows? Stranger things have happened!        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               We haven't really seen it reflected in anime yet, but in LN and manga scenes, the isekai subgenre is absolutely rife with Otome Game Villainess stories. You can throw a rock in any direction and are just as liable to hit a book about being reincarnated as the mean girl character in a video game as anything else. So it makes sense with that particular gimmick's proliferation that you'd start seeing stories intentionally twisting it for novelty. Thus we have this show, which attempts to pull the perspective away from the stereotypical nobles and upper class, and instead focus on what it's like to be an anonymous background character in one of these stories. Or, well, it sort of tries that, then gets bored immediately with that premise and more or less turns into a typical male-led isekai in the span of half an episode. Whoops.    The biggest weakness for this show is it just doesn't feel like its creators knew all that much about otome games. Stories like My Next Life as a Villainess or I'm in Love with the Villainess use their familiarity with the subgenre to gently (and sometimes harshly) mock the established conventions of them, but you get the impression those are jokes borne from somebody who deeply enjoys that type of media and spends a lot of time thinking about them. This show, on the other hand, doesn't seem to know much about the genre besides there being a female PC and a lot of hot dudes for her to sweet talk. Everything else is crammed in from other facets of gaming – RTS battles, power armor, sci-fi style airships, micro-transactions, all stuff that shows up in other games that has to be ham-fistedly crammed in here because that's what the creators are more familiar with.    I say all this not to call the creators phonies, but because that muddling of its own premise kind of kills the joke. This isn't a parody of otome games or a critical look at the genre from a new point of view, so none of its observations or gags have any teeth. Wow show, you're right, there sure are a lot of haughty pretty boys in games made for women. You really got them there. And yeah, some games aren't balanced very well so you're forced to spend real money on them. Can't remember ever playing an otome game where that was the case but uh, good dunk on...mobile games? What are we parodying here, again?    This even comes down to our protagonist, who spends three full days 100%ing the central game – not because he is a guy who likes otome games, but because his pushy little sister blackmailed him into playing it for her. Because she wants to see the ending CGs but doesn't actually want to play the game to get it, and apparently can't use Google to just look them up? It's a clunky, contrived way to allow a guy who hates otome games to still have all the knowledge necessary to cheat the system and get ahead in life, making him fundamentally identical to a regular isekai hero. So we've taken three lefts to make a right and arrive at a plain wayne isekai story, only now our male lead will have to build a harem of doting anime girls by showing up those handsome gigachads who make up the typical love interests.    Then there's the frankly flaccid attempts at role reversal with the game world's gender politics. See, in this game, it's women who hold all the power! So now MEN are the ones forced into loveless political marriages where they serve older, richer WOMEN who all have disposable male paramours. See, it's clever, because they did CTRL+F for the word “patriarchy” and then replaced the P with an M. My first impression upon seeing that part of the premise was that this would be a cringe-inducing setup for a victim complex to further fuel the main character's resentful snark, but I've read enough of the manga adaptation to know that's largely not the case. But that doesn't stop it from feeling like a lazy way to build a paper-thin world, which isn't a whole lot better.    Combined with stiff, sub-par animation and pacing that leaps from moment to moment with a bald-faced desperation, this one winds up a total mess. It's at once overstuffed and totally lacking in ideas, and has the gall to have its own protagonist complain about how much its world and story suck like it's somebody else's fault. It's just a flop all around.        Caitlin Moore  Rating:               There's a particular type of guy out there who is seethingly angry at the idea of things that exist to play into women's fantasies. He doesn't take issue with media aimed at delivering male fantasies, oh no, but the very concept of media where the central aim is allowing women to indulge in the fantasy of being desirable to a range of hot men? Oh no, that cannot stand! Such things are truly detestable, and any girl who likes them is a shallow bitch.    I can't say that's for sure the case with whoever wrote Trapped in a Dating Sim, but it sure does come across that way. The protagonist, now known as Leon, beefed it on the staircase after his little sister blackmailed him into playing an otome game for three days straight while she went on Hawaii because… she wanted to hear the end conversation? Why not just go look it up? Why would she even care about it decontextualized from the rest of the game? (Or maybe that's just me.) What is this terrible secret she's holding over his head? Our little pre-Leon seems baffled that the game would have JRPG/science fiction/strategy elements, but considering my favorite genre of game is “visual novel with gameplay elements,” it doesn't seem remotely shocking. And why would it make him actively angry?    Then there's the issue of the matriarchal society. Why would that even be a thing in a dating sim? It's such a bizarre detail that has existed in absolutely none of the games I've played. That's the part that made me really get the feeling that whoever created this nonsense has never actually played an otome game, but is super angry that they exist. Pre-Leon grouses that the girls in the game are way too powerful, which shows up in the game world as women subjecting men to the exact same social oppression that women in the real world have been suffering under for centuries. Now, if it seemed like it had any actual intention of examining how things like economics arranged marriages between girls and much older men, that would be one thing, but it just leaves it as one of the reasons being in this world sucks for average men.    I hate being able to see the seams of constructed worlds, where you can see the structures designed specifically for the main character to chafe at and systems designed specifically to screw them over individually. And honestly, most of the episode's plot, with him going off on a little sidequest to get his DLC super-powerful fighter plane and enough money to sidestep his arranged marriage, felt like little more than a digression. The next one, where he starts attending the academy, will probably feel entirely different.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               As someone who loves games—including JRPGs and dating sims—I greatly enjoyed this first episode. Over the years we've had numerous anime about being reincarnated in good games. The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is the opposite: what it would be like to be trapped in a terrible one.    Let's break down the game we see in this anime. To start with, it suffers from the shotgun approach to game design. Alto Liebe may be a dating sim first and foremost, but it also features both turn-based dungeon crawling and strategy RPG mecha battles. Worse yet, the difficulty for these parts of the game is ridiculously unbalanced. The game is literally designed around its cash shop—forcing players to dump even more real-world money into the game if they want to be able to beat it.    The actual story for the game makes things even worse. When the game was just a game, things didn't really need to make sense. You could have fantasy magic, sci-fi mecha, and a feudal society together in the same story. You could even have an ending where the player character ends up with a harmonious harem made up of the kingdom's finest young men. The problem is that when this becomes a fully-realized world, everything becomes taken to their logical extremes.    This is the world our “hero” (and I use that term loosely) Leon finds himself in. The pay-to-win aspect of the game means that not only are the enemies in the world so strong that he almost dies on his first adventure (despite exploiting the enemies' weaknesses) but also that society is obsessed with money. But far worse is that, to contrive a happy reverse harem ending, the world suffers from a ludicrous level of ingrained misandry—with human men relegated to the status of third-class citizens. Leon himself is set to be married off to a 50-year-old black widow who will send him to the front lines to die for a quick insurance payout.    The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is a joke—and that's the point. It's cliché and underwritten to the extreme. It's a hell to live in. Because of this, we can get behind Leon and his rather assholish nature. His drive to be as far away from the main plot as possible is understandable—at least in the background he might find something resembling normalcy. Of course, it almost certainly won't be that simple and I look forward to watching Leon bust through numerous dating sim and RPG game tropes as the weeks go on.     discuss this in the forum (291 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 3.6              What is this?   Office worker Leon is reincarnated into a particularly punishing dating sim video game, where women reign supreme and only beautiful men have a seat at the table. But Leon has a secret weapon: he remembers everything from his past life, which includes a complete playthrough of the very game in which he is now trapped. Watch Leon spark a revolution to change this new world in order to fulfill his ultimate desire of living a quiet, easy life in the countryside.    Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs is based on Yomu Mishima's light novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Sundays.      How was the first episode?   Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               This seems to be the season for me to be making statements like this, but I liked this story (tale type?) more when it was Past Life Countess, Present Life Otome Game NPC?!. Both series have a similar premise: someone is reincarnated in the world of an otome game as a random background character and have to do their best to get the kind of life they want. In the case of this show (based on the light novels of the same name), Leon seems to mostly want to overcome the disadvantages of his upbringing, which are apparently being both the son of his father's mistress and being born male. The latter does raise an eyebrow from me, because I can't think of any otome games that I've played that have that sort of world set up; naturally this doesn't mean that they don't exist, but it's the kind of detail that makes me wonder if the writer(s) have a whole lot of familiarity with otome games in the first place.    The show feels most concerned with the apparently bizarre nature of the game world he's been reincarnated into, which has elements of both fantasy and science fiction, but that's another mild red flag, because those two genres absolutely coexist in the otome games Steam Prison and Code:Realize.    Even if that wasn't the case, however, there's negligible time spent discovering what exactly Leon is after in going to the fancy academy from the game. Perhaps he does want to marry well, but the loot that he brings back from his foray to steal the game's goodies before the plot of the game begins would seem to negate that need, and he also doesn't seem interested in making a play for the heroine. In fact, he actively dislikes the characters from the game, as we see in his playthrough before he falls down the stairs and dies, which may be the single most original moment here because he's not being creamed by everyone's favorite motor vehicle. Watching Leon play the game is probably the most entertaining piece of the entire episode as he gets increasingly frustrated with its mechanics and characters, but even that is marred by the fact that he's doing it for his sister so that she doesn't have to. Does YouTube not exist in their world? Because last I checked, that was a good way to get to watch the cutscenes from video games without having to play them yourself.    The plot doesn't have a terrible concept, and goodness knows that isekai (otome game or otherwise) is ripe for parody and deconstruction at this stage. But as with The Executioner and Her Way of Life, I don't find this the most compelling telling of this particular story. Plus I'm very concerned that the story's “women have all the power” set up is going to be used as a way for the hero to frame himself as a perpetual victim, and I'm not a fan of that for any gender. This just is kind of a muddle, and that's a shame.        James Beckett  Rating:               I've come to learn that, of all the variations of the modern isekai anime that have cropped up over the years, I tend to prefer the ones where characters get trapped in dating sims and the like. The generic MMORPG worlds that so many of the other isekai trade in bore me to tears, and the stories tend to lack focus and direction on account of the open-ended natures of the video games that the stories are riffing on. When a gal or guy gets reincarnated into a dating sim, though, we have a set cast of characters and plot with more momentum right off the bat, and the characters' knowledge of the game has to be a little more specific than simply having memorized a thousand menus and sub-systems. Granted, the point of cribbing from the tropes of popular dating sims still lies in the fact that the isekai stories are treading familiar ground, but if we must operate entirely within the bumper-lanes of old clichés, I'll settle for the somewhat more entertaining clichés.    For those reasons, I ended up having an okay time with Trapped in a Dating Sim, even if it never left me feeling particularly excited or intrigued. A lot of my reservations come from the episode being such an exposition dump; we don't even meet the other central characters of the dating game that Leon has found himself stuck in until the very final shots of the premiere. Until then, it's the Leon the Loner show from top to bottom. He's not an awful protagonist, but he's nothing new to the genre, either. He's prickly and socially awkward, but he also can't be too much of an asshole, since we still have to be impressed with how much he breaks the game using his Earthbound knowledge of its systems and plot. This means that the story of this premiere is essentially a linear chronicle of how Leon inserts himself into the main plot of the game, with most scenes consisting of Leon monologuing in explicit detail what he knows about the game, how he's going to manipulate it, etc. This is the kind of stuff I almost never find interesting, because it assumes that the joy of the isekai premise comes from having the protagonist narrate the condensed Wiki-entry version of a video game, and not, you know, letting us just watch the story happen in peace.    Still, the setting itself has some cool stuff going for it, namely in how it mixes the elements of its typical fantasy setting with mechs and other sci-fi trappings—always a nice touch. It could also very well be that the story picks up speed once Leon arrives at the academy where the game truly takes place and starts to mingle with all of the characters; it's hard to judge how strong a dating-game style story is going to be when you don't even know most of the ensemble yet. I might stick with Trapped in a Dating Sim for another episode or two, just to see if it ends up winning me over. I doubt it will be as fun as My Next Life as a Villainess, but who knows?

He's prickly and socially awkward, but he also can't be too much of an asshole, since we still have to be impressed with how much he breaks the game using his Earthbound knowledge of its systems and plot. This means that the story of this premiere is essentially a linear chronicle of how Leon inserts himself into the main plot of the game, with most scenes consisting of Leon monologuing in explicit detail what he knows about the game, how he's going to manipulate it, etc. This is the kind of stuff I almost never find interesting, because it assumes that the joy of the isekai premise comes from having the protagonist narrate the condensed Wiki-entry version of a video game, and not, you know, letting us just watch the story happen in peace.    Still, the setting itself has some cool stuff going for it, namely in how it mixes the elements of its typical fantasy setting with mechs and other sci-fi trappings—always a nice touch. It could also very well be that the story picks up speed once Leon arrives at the academy where the game truly takes place and starts to mingle with all of the characters; it's hard to judge how strong a dating-game style story is going to be when you don't even know most of the ensemble yet. I might stick with Trapped in a Dating Sim for another episode or two, just to see if it ends up winning me over. I doubt it will be as fun as My Next Life as a Villainess, but who knows? Stranger things have happened!        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               We haven't really seen it reflected in anime yet, but in LN and manga scenes, the isekai subgenre is absolutely rife with Otome Game Villainess stories. You can throw a rock in any direction and are just as liable to hit a book about being reincarnated as the mean girl character in a video game as anything else. So it makes sense with that particular gimmick's proliferation that you'd start seeing stories intentionally twisting it for novelty. Thus we have this show, which attempts to pull the perspective away from the stereotypical nobles and upper class, and instead focus on what it's like to be an anonymous background character in one of these stories. Or, well, it sort of tries that, then gets bored immediately with that premise and more or less turns into a typical male-led isekai in the span of half an episode. Whoops.    The biggest weakness for this show is it just doesn't feel like its creators knew all that much about otome games. Stories like My Next Life as a Villainess or I'm in Love with the Villainess use their familiarity with the subgenre to gently (and sometimes harshly) mock the established conventions of them, but you get the impression those are jokes borne from somebody who deeply enjoys that type of media and spends a lot of time thinking about them. This show, on the other hand, doesn't seem to know much about the genre besides there being a female PC and a lot of hot dudes for her to sweet talk. Everything else is crammed in from other facets of gaming – RTS battles, power armor, sci-fi style airships, micro-transactions, all stuff that shows up in other games that has to be ham-fistedly crammed in here because that's what the creators are more familiar with.    I say all this not to call the creators phonies, but because that muddling of its own premise kind of kills the joke. This isn't a parody of otome games or a critical look at the genre from a new point of view, so none of its observations or gags have any teeth. Wow show, you're right, there sure are a lot of haughty pretty boys in games made for women. You really got them there. And yeah, some games aren't balanced very well so you're forced to spend real money on them. Can't remember ever playing an otome game where that was the case but uh, good dunk on...mobile games? What are we parodying here, again?    This even comes down to our protagonist, who spends three full days 100%ing the central game – not because he is a guy who likes otome games, but because his pushy little sister blackmailed him into playing it for her. Because she wants to see the ending CGs but doesn't actually want to play the game to get it, and apparently can't use Google to just look them up? It's a clunky, contrived way to allow a guy who hates otome games to still have all the knowledge necessary to cheat the system and get ahead in life, making him fundamentally identical to a regular isekai hero. So we've taken three lefts to make a right and arrive at a plain wayne isekai story, only now our male lead will have to build a harem of doting anime girls by showing up those handsome gigachads who make up the typical love interests.    Then there's the frankly flaccid attempts at role reversal with the game world's gender politics. See, in this game, it's women who hold all the power! So now MEN are the ones forced into loveless political marriages where they serve older, richer WOMEN who all have disposable male paramours. See, it's clever, because they did CTRL+F for the word “patriarchy” and then replaced the P with an M. My first impression upon seeing that part of the premise was that this would be a cringe-inducing setup for a victim complex to further fuel the main character's resentful snark, but I've read enough of the manga adaptation to know that's largely not the case. But that doesn't stop it from feeling like a lazy way to build a paper-thin world, which isn't a whole lot better.    Combined with stiff, sub-par animation and pacing that leaps from moment to moment with a bald-faced desperation, this one winds up a total mess. It's at once overstuffed and totally lacking in ideas, and has the gall to have its own protagonist complain about how much its world and story suck like it's somebody else's fault. It's just a flop all around.        Caitlin Moore  Rating:               There's a particular type of guy out there who is seethingly angry at the idea of things that exist to play into women's fantasies. He doesn't take issue with media aimed at delivering male fantasies, oh no, but the very concept of media where the central aim is allowing women to indulge in the fantasy of being desirable to a range of hot men? Oh no, that cannot stand! Such things are truly detestable, and any girl who likes them is a shallow bitch.    I can't say that's for sure the case with whoever wrote Trapped in a Dating Sim, but it sure does come across that way. The protagonist, now known as Leon, beefed it on the staircase after his little sister blackmailed him into playing an otome game for three days straight while she went on Hawaii because… she wanted to hear the end conversation? Why not just go look it up? Why would she even care about it decontextualized from the rest of the game? (Or maybe that's just me.) What is this terrible secret she's holding over his head? Our little pre-Leon seems baffled that the game would have JRPG/science fiction/strategy elements, but considering my favorite genre of game is “visual novel with gameplay elements,” it doesn't seem remotely shocking. And why would it make him actively angry?    Then there's the issue of the matriarchal society. Why would that even be a thing in a dating sim? It's such a bizarre detail that has existed in absolutely none of the games I've played. That's the part that made me really get the feeling that whoever created this nonsense has never actually played an otome game, but is super angry that they exist. Pre-Leon grouses that the girls in the game are way too powerful, which shows up in the game world as women subjecting men to the exact same social oppression that women in the real world have been suffering under for centuries. Now, if it seemed like it had any actual intention of examining how things like economics arranged marriages between girls and much older men, that would be one thing, but it just leaves it as one of the reasons being in this world sucks for average men.    I hate being able to see the seams of constructed worlds, where you can see the structures designed specifically for the main character to chafe at and systems designed specifically to screw them over individually. And honestly, most of the episode's plot, with him going off on a little sidequest to get his DLC super-powerful fighter plane and enough money to sidestep his arranged marriage, felt like little more than a digression. The next one, where he starts attending the academy, will probably feel entirely different.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               As someone who loves games—including JRPGs and dating sims—I greatly enjoyed this first episode. Over the years we've had numerous anime about being reincarnated in good games. The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is the opposite: what it would be like to be trapped in a terrible one.    Let's break down the game we see in this anime. To start with, it suffers from the shotgun approach to game design. Alto Liebe may be a dating sim first and foremost, but it also features both turn-based dungeon crawling and strategy RPG mecha battles. Worse yet, the difficulty for these parts of the game is ridiculously unbalanced. The game is literally designed around its cash shop—forcing players to dump even more real-world money into the game if they want to be able to beat it.    The actual story for the game makes things even worse. When the game was just a game, things didn't really need to make sense. You could have fantasy magic, sci-fi mecha, and a feudal society together in the same story. You could even have an ending where the player character ends up with a harmonious harem made up of the kingdom's finest young men. The problem is that when this becomes a fully-realized world, everything becomes taken to their logical extremes.    This is the world our “hero” (and I use that term loosely) Leon finds himself in. The pay-to-win aspect of the game means that not only are the enemies in the world so strong that he almost dies on his first adventure (despite exploiting the enemies' weaknesses) but also that society is obsessed with money. But far worse is that, to contrive a happy reverse harem ending, the world suffers from a ludicrous level of ingrained misandry—with human men relegated to the status of third-class citizens. Leon himself is set to be married off to a 50-year-old black widow who will send him to the front lines to die for a quick insurance payout.    The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is a joke—and that's the point. It's cliché and underwritten to the extreme. It's a hell to live in. Because of this, we can get behind Leon and his rather assholish nature. His drive to be as far away from the main plot as possible is understandable—at least in the background he might find something resembling normalcy. Of course, it almost certainly won't be that simple and I look forward to watching Leon bust through numerous dating sim and RPG game tropes as the weeks go on.     discuss this in the forum (291 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives    ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 3.6              What is this?   Office worker Leon is reincarnated into a particularly punishing dating sim video game, where women reign supreme and only beautiful men have a seat at the table. But Leon has a secret weapon: he remembers everything from his past life, which includes a complete playthrough of the very game in which he is now trapped. Watch Leon spark a revolution to change this new world in order to fulfill his ultimate desire of living a quiet, easy life in the countryside.    Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs is based on Yomu Mishima's light novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Sundays.      How was the first episode?   Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               This seems to be the season for me to be making statements like this, but I liked this story (tale type?) more when it was Past Life Countess, Present Life Otome Game NPC?!. Both series have a similar premise: someone is reincarnated in the world of an otome game as a random background character and have to do their best to get the kind of life they want. In the case of this show (based on the light novels of the same name), Leon seems to mostly want to overcome the disadvantages of his upbringing, which are apparently being both the son of his father's mistress and being born male. The latter does raise an eyebrow from me, because I can't think of any otome games that I've played that have that sort of world set up; naturally this doesn't mean that they don't exist, but it's the kind of detail that makes me wonder if the writer(s) have a whole lot of familiarity with otome games in the first place.    The show feels most concerned with the apparently bizarre nature of the game world he's been reincarnated into, which has elements of both fantasy and science fiction, but that's another mild red flag, because those two genres absolutely coexist in the otome games Steam Prison and Code:Realize.    Even if that wasn't the case, however, there's negligible time spent discovering what exactly Leon is after in going to the fancy academy from the game. Perhaps he does want to marry well, but the loot that he brings back from his foray to steal the game's goodies before the plot of the game begins would seem to negate that need, and he also doesn't seem interested in making a play for the heroine. In fact, he actively dislikes the characters from the game, as we see in his playthrough before he falls down the stairs and dies, which may be the single most original moment here because he's not being creamed by everyone's favorite motor vehicle. Watching Leon play the game is probably the most entertaining piece of the entire episode as he gets increasingly frustrated with its mechanics and characters, but even that is marred by the fact that he's doing it for his sister so that she doesn't have to. Does YouTube not exist in their world? Because last I checked, that was a good way to get to watch the cutscenes from video games without having to play them yourself.    The plot doesn't have a terrible concept, and goodness knows that isekai (otome game or otherwise) is ripe for parody and deconstruction at this stage. But as with The Executioner and Her Way of Life, I don't find this the most compelling telling of this particular story. Plus I'm very concerned that the story's “women have all the power” set up is going to be used as a way for the hero to frame himself as a perpetual victim, and I'm not a fan of that for any gender. This just is kind of a muddle, and that's a shame.        James Beckett  Rating:               I've come to learn that, of all the variations of the modern isekai anime that have cropped up over the years, I tend to prefer the ones where characters get trapped in dating sims and the like. The generic MMORPG worlds that so many of the other isekai trade in bore me to tears, and the stories tend to lack focus and direction on account of the open-ended natures of the video games that the stories are riffing on. When a gal or guy gets reincarnated into a dating sim, though, we have a set cast of characters and plot with more momentum right off the bat, and the characters' knowledge of the game has to be a little more specific than simply having memorized a thousand menus and sub-systems. Granted, the point of cribbing from the tropes of popular dating sims still lies in the fact that the isekai stories are treading familiar ground, but if we must operate entirely within the bumper-lanes of old clichés, I'll settle for the somewhat more entertaining clichés.    For those reasons, I ended up having an okay time with Trapped in a Dating Sim, even if it never left me feeling particularly excited or intrigued. A lot of my reservations come from the episode being such an exposition dump; we don't even meet the other central characters of the dating game that Leon has found himself stuck in until the very final shots of the premiere. Until then, it's the Leon the Loner show from top to bottom. He's not an awful protagonist, but he's nothing new to the genre, either.

The generic MMORPG worlds that so many of the other isekai trade in bore me to tears, and the stories tend to lack focus and direction on account of the open-ended natures of the video games that the stories are riffing on. When a gal or guy gets reincarnated into a dating sim, though, we have a set cast of characters and plot with more momentum right off the bat, and the characters' knowledge of the game has to be a little more specific than simply having memorized a thousand menus and sub-systems. Granted, the point of cribbing from the tropes of popular dating sims still lies in the fact that the isekai stories are treading familiar ground, but if we must operate entirely within the bumper-lanes of old clichés, I'll settle for the somewhat more entertaining clichés.    For those reasons, I ended up having an okay time with Trapped in a Dating Sim, even if it never left me feeling particularly excited or intrigued. A lot of my reservations come from the episode being such an exposition dump; we don't even meet the other central characters of the dating game that Leon has found himself stuck in until the very final shots of the premiere. Until then, it's the Leon the Loner show from top to bottom. He's not an awful protagonist, but he's nothing new to the genre, either. He's prickly and socially awkward, but he also can't be too much of an asshole, since we still have to be impressed with how much he breaks the game using his Earthbound knowledge of its systems and plot. This means that the story of this premiere is essentially a linear chronicle of how Leon inserts himself into the main plot of the game, with most scenes consisting of Leon monologuing in explicit detail what he knows about the game, how he's going to manipulate it, etc. This is the kind of stuff I almost never find interesting, because it assumes that the joy of the isekai premise comes from having the protagonist narrate the condensed Wiki-entry version of a video game, and not, you know, letting us just watch the story happen in peace.    Still, the setting itself has some cool stuff going for it, namely in how it mixes the elements of its typical fantasy setting with mechs and other sci-fi trappings—always a nice touch. It could also very well be that the story picks up speed once Leon arrives at the academy where the game truly takes place and starts to mingle with all of the characters; it's hard to judge how strong a dating-game style story is going to be when you don't even know most of the ensemble yet. I might stick with Trapped in a Dating Sim for another episode or two, just to see if it ends up winning me over. I doubt it will be as fun as My Next Life as a Villainess, but who knows? Stranger things have happened!        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               We haven't really seen it reflected in anime yet, but in LN and manga scenes, the isekai subgenre is absolutely rife with Otome Game Villainess stories. You can throw a rock in any direction and are just as liable to hit a book about being reincarnated as the mean girl character in a video game as anything else. So it makes sense with that particular gimmick's proliferation that you'd start seeing stories intentionally twisting it for novelty. Thus we have this show, which attempts to pull the perspective away from the stereotypical nobles and upper class, and instead focus on what it's like to be an anonymous background character in one of these stories. Or, well, it sort of tries that, then gets bored immediately with that premise and more or less turns into a typical male-led isekai in the span of half an episode. Whoops.    The biggest weakness for this show is it just doesn't feel like its creators knew all that much about otome games. Stories like My Next Life as a Villainess or I'm in Love with the Villainess use their familiarity with the subgenre to gently (and sometimes harshly) mock the established conventions of them, but you get the impression those are jokes borne from somebody who deeply enjoys that type of media and spends a lot of time thinking about them. This show, on the other hand, doesn't seem to know much about the genre besides there being a female PC and a lot of hot dudes for her to sweet talk. Everything else is crammed in from other facets of gaming – RTS battles, power armor, sci-fi style airships, micro-transactions, all stuff that shows up in other games that has to be ham-fistedly crammed in here because that's what the creators are more familiar with.    I say all this not to call the creators phonies, but because that muddling of its own premise kind of kills the joke. This isn't a parody of otome games or a critical look at the genre from a new point of view, so none of its observations or gags have any teeth. Wow show, you're right, there sure are a lot of haughty pretty boys in games made for women. You really got them there. And yeah, some games aren't balanced very well so you're forced to spend real money on them. Can't remember ever playing an otome game where that was the case but uh, good dunk on...mobile games? What are we parodying here, again?    This even comes down to our protagonist, who spends three full days 100%ing the central game – not because he is a guy who likes otome games, but because his pushy little sister blackmailed him into playing it for her. Because she wants to see the ending CGs but doesn't actually want to play the game to get it, and apparently can't use Google to just look them up? It's a clunky, contrived way to allow a guy who hates otome games to still have all the knowledge necessary to cheat the system and get ahead in life, making him fundamentally identical to a regular isekai hero. So we've taken three lefts to make a right and arrive at a plain wayne isekai story, only now our male lead will have to build a harem of doting anime girls by showing up those handsome gigachads who make up the typical love interests.    Then there's the frankly flaccid attempts at role reversal with the game world's gender politics. See, in this game, it's women who hold all the power! So now MEN are the ones forced into loveless political marriages where they serve older, richer WOMEN who all have disposable male paramours. See, it's clever, because they did CTRL+F for the word “patriarchy” and then replaced the P with an M. My first impression upon seeing that part of the premise was that this would be a cringe-inducing setup for a victim complex to further fuel the main character's resentful snark, but I've read enough of the manga adaptation to know that's largely not the case. But that doesn't stop it from feeling like a lazy way to build a paper-thin world, which isn't a whole lot better.    Combined with stiff, sub-par animation and pacing that leaps from moment to moment with a bald-faced desperation, this one winds up a total mess. It's at once overstuffed and totally lacking in ideas, and has the gall to have its own protagonist complain about how much its world and story suck like it's somebody else's fault. It's just a flop all around.        Caitlin Moore  Rating:               There's a particular type of guy out there who is seethingly angry at the idea of things that exist to play into women's fantasies. He doesn't take issue with media aimed at delivering male fantasies, oh no, but the very concept of media where the central aim is allowing women to indulge in the fantasy of being desirable to a range of hot men? Oh no, that cannot stand! Such things are truly detestable, and any girl who likes them is a shallow bitch.    I can't say that's for sure the case with whoever wrote Trapped in a Dating Sim, but it sure does come across that way. The protagonist, now known as Leon, beefed it on the staircase after his little sister blackmailed him into playing an otome game for three days straight while she went on Hawaii because… she wanted to hear the end conversation? Why not just go look it up? Why would she even care about it decontextualized from the rest of the game? (Or maybe that's just me.) What is this terrible secret she's holding over his head? Our little pre-Leon seems baffled that the game would have JRPG/science fiction/strategy elements, but considering my favorite genre of game is “visual novel with gameplay elements,” it doesn't seem remotely shocking. And why would it make him actively angry?    Then there's the issue of the matriarchal society. Why would that even be a thing in a dating sim? It's such a bizarre detail that has existed in absolutely none of the games I've played. That's the part that made me really get the feeling that whoever created this nonsense has never actually played an otome game, but is super angry that they exist. Pre-Leon grouses that the girls in the game are way too powerful, which shows up in the game world as women subjecting men to the exact same social oppression that women in the real world have been suffering under for centuries. Now, if it seemed like it had any actual intention of examining how things like economics arranged marriages between girls and much older men, that would be one thing, but it just leaves it as one of the reasons being in this world sucks for average men.    I hate being able to see the seams of constructed worlds, where you can see the structures designed specifically for the main character to chafe at and systems designed specifically to screw them over individually. And honestly, most of the episode's plot, with him going off on a little sidequest to get his DLC super-powerful fighter plane and enough money to sidestep his arranged marriage, felt like little more than a digression. The next one, where he starts attending the academy, will probably feel entirely different.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               As someone who loves games—including JRPGs and dating sims—I greatly enjoyed this first episode. Over the years we've had numerous anime about being reincarnated in good games. The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is the opposite: what it would be like to be trapped in a terrible one.    Let's break down the game we see in this anime. To start with, it suffers from the shotgun approach to game design. Alto Liebe may be a dating sim first and foremost, but it also features both turn-based dungeon crawling and strategy RPG mecha battles. Worse yet, the difficulty for these parts of the game is ridiculously unbalanced. The game is literally designed around its cash shop—forcing players to dump even more real-world money into the game if they want to be able to beat it.    The actual story for the game makes things even worse. When the game was just a game, things didn't really need to make sense. You could have fantasy magic, sci-fi mecha, and a feudal society together in the same story. You could even have an ending where the player character ends up with a harmonious harem made up of the kingdom's finest young men. The problem is that when this becomes a fully-realized world, everything becomes taken to their logical extremes.    This is the world our “hero” (and I use that term loosely) Leon finds himself in. The pay-to-win aspect of the game means that not only are the enemies in the world so strong that he almost dies on his first adventure (despite exploiting the enemies' weaknesses) but also that society is obsessed with money. But far worse is that, to contrive a happy reverse harem ending, the world suffers from a ludicrous level of ingrained misandry—with human men relegated to the status of third-class citizens. Leon himself is set to be married off to a 50-year-old black widow who will send him to the front lines to die for a quick insurance payout.    The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is a joke—and that's the point. It's cliché and underwritten to the extreme. It's a hell to live in. Because of this, we can get behind Leon and his rather assholish nature. His drive to be as far away from the main plot as possible is understandable—at least in the background he might find something resembling normalcy. Of course, it almost certainly won't be that simple and I look forward to watching Leon bust through numerous dating sim and RPG game tropes as the weeks go on.

Community score: 3.6              What is this?   Office worker Leon is reincarnated into a particularly punishing dating sim video game, where women reign supreme and only beautiful men have a seat at the table. But Leon has a secret weapon: he remembers everything from his past life, which includes a complete playthrough of the very game in which he is now trapped. Watch Leon spark a revolution to change this new world in order to fulfill his ultimate desire of living a quiet, easy life in the countryside.    Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs is based on Yomu Mishima's light novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Sundays.      How was the first episode?   Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               This seems to be the season for me to be making statements like this, but I liked this story (tale type?) more when it was Past Life Countess, Present Life Otome Game NPC?!. Both series have a similar premise: someone is reincarnated in the world of an otome game as a random background character and have to do their best to get the kind of life they want. In the case of this show (based on the light novels of the same name), Leon seems to mostly want to overcome the disadvantages of his upbringing, which are apparently being both the son of his father's mistress and being born male. The latter does raise an eyebrow from me, because I can't think of any otome games that I've played that have that sort of world set up; naturally this doesn't mean that they don't exist, but it's the kind of detail that makes me wonder if the writer(s) have a whole lot of familiarity with otome games in the first place.    The show feels most concerned with the apparently bizarre nature of the game world he's been reincarnated into, which has elements of both fantasy and science fiction, but that's another mild red flag, because those two genres absolutely coexist in the otome games Steam Prison and Code:Realize.    Even if that wasn't the case, however, there's negligible time spent discovering what exactly Leon is after in going to the fancy academy from the game. Perhaps he does want to marry well, but the loot that he brings back from his foray to steal the game's goodies before the plot of the game begins would seem to negate that need, and he also doesn't seem interested in making a play for the heroine. In fact, he actively dislikes the characters from the game, as we see in his playthrough before he falls down the stairs and dies, which may be the single most original moment here because he's not being creamed by everyone's favorite motor vehicle. Watching Leon play the game is probably the most entertaining piece of the entire episode as he gets increasingly frustrated with its mechanics and characters, but even that is marred by the fact that he's doing it for his sister so that she doesn't have to. Does YouTube not exist in their world? Because last I checked, that was a good way to get to watch the cutscenes from video games without having to play them yourself.    The plot doesn't have a terrible concept, and goodness knows that isekai (otome game or otherwise) is ripe for parody and deconstruction at this stage. But as with The Executioner and Her Way of Life, I don't find this the most compelling telling of this particular story. Plus I'm very concerned that the story's “women have all the power” set up is going to be used as a way for the hero to frame himself as a perpetual victim, and I'm not a fan of that for any gender. This just is kind of a muddle, and that's a shame.

Konosuba: God's Blessing on this Wonderful World! TRPG is published by Yen Press.      Review:            Ah, finally a review that leans into both my lifelong hobbies: anime and tabletop RPGs (or TRPGs in short). I'm always curious to see what happens when the two worlds entwine, but beyond my personal interest, this being an official English release of a Japanese TRPG already makes it worth checking out on its own. Though it's pretty common for video games from other languages/regions to receive official English translations, the same cannot be said of tabletop games. Japanese language TRPGs with official English releases are few and far between – with Tenra Bansho Zero's 2013 Kickstarter likely being the most prominent example. So I was excited to pick this up if for no other reason than to encourage future translations of tabletop titles (fingers crossed for a release of Sword World one of these days...).    I won't go too in-depth into KONOSUBA as I'm sure most reading this are already quite familiar with the series. But in brief, KONOSUBA is a story about a young man named Kazuma Sato who dies and is reincarnated into an alternate fantasy world. Forming a party with the goddess Aqua, the wizard Megumin, and the crusader Darkness, Kazuma and Co. embark on quests, fight giant monsters, and generally get into wacky situations. It's an action-comedy romp that revels in the tropes of many modern RPG games, which of course makes TRPG a natural fit.    In terms of gameplay, this TRPG boasts a very straightforward system. Most actions are resolved by rolling 2d6 and adding them together, usually with a modifier based on an attribute. You try to meet or beat a target number against passive opposition (such as picking a lock or trying to listen through a wall) or try to beat an opposed roll against active opposition (such as trying to attack an opponent). Additional d6s can be added to the pool via abilities – most commonly the expenditure of Blessings, the game's Luck mechanic – and they are also added to the total. If any two dice show 6s that makes for a critical (regardless of how many dice were rolled), and you get a fumble if all the dice show 1s. This makes spending Blessings a way to fish for criticals and lower chances of fumbles at the same time. The use of d6s rather than d20s and other polyhedral dice may shock some readers since the d20 is almost synonymous with the hobby, but it is not completely unheard of, and the ""odd"" polyhedral dice can be expensive to purchase and difficult to find in regions outside the US. 2d6 rolls also tend to be more forgiving and consistent compared to the d20 which is notoriously ""swingy"" in turns of the table feel.    Characters are defined by their race, class, and origin. This is likely a familiar framework if you have any experience with other fantasy TRPGs, but there are some fun twists here. First of all, while the way race is handled can be a thorny issue in many RPGs, I like the KONOSUBA TRPG's approach. The three races presented are Reincarnated Person, Native Inhabitant, and Crimson Magic Clan. It's simple and functional, allowing for some variety in character creation while largely avoiding some of the more negative tropes associated with race in RPGs.    Classes are largely what you would expect. There are warriors, thieves, wizards, and the like, as well as advanced classes that can be taken down the road as your character levels up. Classes are defined by the list of Skills that they can take, which are less similar to skills in games like D&D (which are usually modifiers to certain in-world mundane actions, like Stealth or Athletics) and more analogous to what would be considered powers or spells. The KONOSUBA TRPG's skills can range from a wizard's fireball to a priest's healing to a warrior covering a friend from damage; like its source material, the skill system is clearly inspired by MMORPGs which often gives all classes a suite of powers that operate more or less in the same space. Each Skill is a discreet little block of text, much like a spell list might be in other games, with listed timing for when to use it, effects, cost in mana or MP, etc. In this way it is actually somewhat similar to the 4th edition of D&D, which was also criticized of being too MMO-like (though, for my money, it was also a terrific game).    Origins, Blessings, and Cheats round out the player characters. Origins are basically simple story-bits that help you find out how you got to where you are and what your long-term goal might be. Blessings are essentially a fate or reroll mechanic, where you have a pool of extra dice to add to rolls (or you can spend them to reroll checks entirely). Cheats are a special optional rule that have lots of tantalizing benefits and drawbacks that can be quite flavorful, but the game makes it clear that those wanting a more grounded experience might not want to use them as they can break things wide open. Personally, I found the Cheats quite charming and in line with the flavor of the show, and while the game can be played without them, I imagine most fans of the series will want to use them.    Combat is pretty straightforward and obviously where the meat of the rules are focused. Characters act in order of initiative based on Action Points (which is a flat initiative value and not, in fact, a pool of points that are spent). They get a move, minor, and major action, which are spent for the round once they act. Distances are abstracted and measured in ""engagements"" similar to zones from other games. Characters who are close to one another are in an Engagement and generally feels similar to most fantasy TRPGs that have concepts like attacks of opportunity, zones of control, etc. Other RPG strategies like taking cover, taking hits for other party members, or allowing warriors to tank and pull aggro are also implemented. If you've played any fantasy RPG of the past few decades you'll likely feel right at home with the basics.    As such, the KONOSUBA TRPG is largely what I would consider a traditional tabletop game, heavily leaning into the gamist and simulationist spaces of game design. There is not a whole lot in the way of manipulation of narrative beyond Blessings and Cheats, and players familiar with RPGs (of tabletop or video game variety) will probably feel right at home. It also lacks a lot of the overt story-centric focus of games like Fate, Powered by the Apocalypse titles, or Forged in the Dark games. It's a small, light, comfortable little game.    But that's not to say it isn't without its fun flourishes. For example, when handing out XP at the end of a session, even the gamemaster earns experience points. This is then applied to whatever characters the gamemaster has, with the understanding that in future sessions someone else will run and they will get to play their character who has been quietly leveling up in the background. The implication is that there will be some rotation of GM-ing responsibilities within the same campaign; not completely unheard of, but certainly not the norm at most tables I have been at. Still, I like that this is baked into the core rules and there's a sense that even the GM is making progress week to week, something which is often left out of most games.    This translates to the reading of the book as well. The game is north of 300 pages; it is an easy, digest-sized read jam-packed with an example adventure, plenty of pre-made adventure hooks, a touch of background information, full monster bestiary and trap list, gamemastering advice, and more. That said, there are some elements which may cause hang-ups, most prominently the opening replay. A replay – also known as an actual play – serves as the opener to the book, where we get a detailed account of a game session featuring guest star player characters. This group includes Natsumi Akatsuki, the creator of the original light novel series. We get detailed writeups on each of the characters, full custom art for them, and the full transcription of their adventure. While most modern TRPGs include a few pages of example text from a session to give a sense of the tempo of the game, these tend to be brief. In KONOSUBA's case, however, we get a complete session that comprises 80+ pages; in other words, 25% of the book is dedicated to someone else's session, and while players new to TRPG may appreciate such an inclusion, I'm not sure it's worth the space it takes up (especially when recordings of real play sessions are easily accessible online).    There are also a few readability issues to note. First off, the book is very affordable but that comes at the expense of production value. It is priced and formatted like a manga or light novel release in paperback – there are a few color pages early on, but it is largely black and white print on middling quality paper. The layout and usability is also a bit of a mess. While everything flows pretty logically as you read, it is very difficult to reference concepts. In making a character and testing the mechanics I found myself flipping around the book constantly, and while there are some reference sheets, just remembering where everything is placed in the book can be a challenge. Then again, the book is cheap enough that you could probably grab multiple copies for your table and mark them up for easy reference.    I have to make a particular note about the digital version of the book, too. An affordable pdf version is available on BookWalker (roughly $8.00 USD at the time of this writing), but as with the physical release, the quality leaves much to be desired. For one, the scan at the time of this writing is atrocious. It's so low res that trying to zoom in even slightly on a mobile device will strain your eyes. Furthermore, there's no bookmarking or any of the other modern conveniences we've come to enjoy from modern TRPG pdf releases in recent years. Sure it is cheap, and looks fine on a regular monitor, but most players (in my experience) like to have a pdf on a phone or tablet in addition to a physical book at the table, which allows the to individually look up rules while someone else is using the physical book. Simply put, I don't think the pdf is legible for that use due to how low-quality the scan is at this time, and that makes its utility next to zero.    The issue of complexity is also one to mention. In my experience, lighter games are great for new players and/or shorter campaigns and one-shots. The more complex the game, the more support there tends to be for long-term play. The KONOSUBA TRPG has breadth for sure but not a terrible amount of depth, and the mechanics can feel repetitive after a few sessions. Certainly things like changing class or gaining an advanced class may keep things fresh, but I can easily see players falling into patterns of using the same skills over and over without much variety.    That said, simplicity lends to expandability, and many early, simple games like white box D&D flourished because people were constantly homebrewing new rules, spells, and ideas into the very basic framework the game provided. Any GM or player willing to put in a bit of time with the KONOSUBA TRPG could likely generate tons of new skills and abilities, or fun sub-systems for domain management, running a business, entirely new classes, and more. There's also plenty of design space to come up with creative uses for Blessings or new Cheats to create that much-needed variety long-term play often requires. And though it is a fairly generic fantasy RPG in most respects, that makes it very easy to port over adventures or ideas from the plethora of other fantasy games on the market.    Overall, this is a terrific little gem that I think will please most KONOSUBA fans. While it is a simple little game, I think that like its source material there is just enough charm to make it a fun experience for at least a few sessions – and with a bit of work, perhaps many more.

It's an action-comedy romp that revels in the tropes of many modern RPG games, which of course makes TRPG a natural fit.    In terms of gameplay, this TRPG boasts a very straightforward system. Most actions are resolved by rolling 2d6 and adding them together, usually with a modifier based on an attribute. You try to meet or beat a target number against passive opposition (such as picking a lock or trying to listen through a wall) or try to beat an opposed roll against active opposition (such as trying to attack an opponent). Additional d6s can be added to the pool via abilities – most commonly the expenditure of Blessings, the game's Luck mechanic – and they are also added to the total. If any two dice show 6s that makes for a critical (regardless of how many dice were rolled), and you get a fumble if all the dice show 1s. This makes spending Blessings a way to fish for criticals and lower chances of fumbles at the same time. The use of d6s rather than d20s and other polyhedral dice may shock some readers since the d20 is almost synonymous with the hobby, but it is not completely unheard of, and the ""odd"" polyhedral dice can be expensive to purchase and difficult to find in regions outside the US. 2d6 rolls also tend to be more forgiving and consistent compared to the d20 which is notoriously ""swingy"" in turns of the table feel.    Characters are defined by their race, class, and origin. This is likely a familiar framework if you have any experience with other fantasy TRPGs, but there are some fun twists here. First of all, while the way race is handled can be a thorny issue in many RPGs, I like the KONOSUBA TRPG's approach. The three races presented are Reincarnated Person, Native Inhabitant, and Crimson Magic Clan. It's simple and functional, allowing for some variety in character creation while largely avoiding some of the more negative tropes associated with race in RPGs.    Classes are largely what you would expect. There are warriors, thieves, wizards, and the like, as well as advanced classes that can be taken down the road as your character levels up. Classes are defined by the list of Skills that they can take, which are less similar to skills in games like D&D (which are usually modifiers to certain in-world mundane actions, like Stealth or Athletics) and more analogous to what would be considered powers or spells. The KONOSUBA TRPG's skills can range from a wizard's fireball to a priest's healing to a warrior covering a friend from damage; like its source material, the skill system is clearly inspired by MMORPGs which often gives all classes a suite of powers that operate more or less in the same space. Each Skill is a discreet little block of text, much like a spell list might be in other games, with listed timing for when to use it, effects, cost in mana or MP, etc. In this way it is actually somewhat similar to the 4th edition of D&D, which was also criticized of being too MMO-like (though, for my money, it was also a terrific game).    Origins, Blessings, and Cheats round out the player characters. Origins are basically simple story-bits that help you find out how you got to where you are and what your long-term goal might be. Blessings are essentially a fate or reroll mechanic, where you have a pool of extra dice to add to rolls (or you can spend them to reroll checks entirely). Cheats are a special optional rule that have lots of tantalizing benefits and drawbacks that can be quite flavorful, but the game makes it clear that those wanting a more grounded experience might not want to use them as they can break things wide open. Personally, I found the Cheats quite charming and in line with the flavor of the show, and while the game can be played without them, I imagine most fans of the series will want to use them.    Combat is pretty straightforward and obviously where the meat of the rules are focused. Characters act in order of initiative based on Action Points (which is a flat initiative value and not, in fact, a pool of points that are spent). They get a move, minor, and major action, which are spent for the round once they act. Distances are abstracted and measured in ""engagements"" similar to zones from other games. Characters who are close to one another are in an Engagement and generally feels similar to most fantasy TRPGs that have concepts like attacks of opportunity, zones of control, etc. Other RPG strategies like taking cover, taking hits for other party members, or allowing warriors to tank and pull aggro are also implemented. If you've played any fantasy RPG of the past few decades you'll likely feel right at home with the basics.    As such, the KONOSUBA TRPG is largely what I would consider a traditional tabletop game, heavily leaning into the gamist and simulationist spaces of game design. There is not a whole lot in the way of manipulation of narrative beyond Blessings and Cheats, and players familiar with RPGs (of tabletop or video game variety) will probably feel right at home. It also lacks a lot of the overt story-centric focus of games like Fate, Powered by the Apocalypse titles, or Forged in the Dark games. It's a small, light, comfortable little game.    But that's not to say it isn't without its fun flourishes. For example, when handing out XP at the end of a session, even the gamemaster earns experience points. This is then applied to whatever characters the gamemaster has, with the understanding that in future sessions someone else will run and they will get to play their character who has been quietly leveling up in the background. The implication is that there will be some rotation of GM-ing responsibilities within the same campaign; not completely unheard of, but certainly not the norm at most tables I have been at. Still, I like that this is baked into the core rules and there's a sense that even the GM is making progress week to week, something which is often left out of most games.    This translates to the reading of the book as well. The game is north of 300 pages; it is an easy, digest-sized read jam-packed with an example adventure, plenty of pre-made adventure hooks, a touch of background information, full monster bestiary and trap list, gamemastering advice, and more. That said, there are some elements which may cause hang-ups, most prominently the opening replay. A replay – also known as an actual play – serves as the opener to the book, where we get a detailed account of a game session featuring guest star player characters. This group includes Natsumi Akatsuki, the creator of the original light novel series. We get detailed writeups on each of the characters, full custom art for them, and the full transcription of their adventure. While most modern TRPGs include a few pages of example text from a session to give a sense of the tempo of the game, these tend to be brief. In KONOSUBA's case, however, we get a complete session that comprises 80+ pages; in other words, 25% of the book is dedicated to someone else's session, and while players new to TRPG may appreciate such an inclusion, I'm not sure it's worth the space it takes up (especially when recordings of real play sessions are easily accessible online).    There are also a few readability issues to note. First off, the book is very affordable but that comes at the expense of production value. It is priced and formatted like a manga or light novel release in paperback – there are a few color pages early on, but it is largely black and white print on middling quality paper. The layout and usability is also a bit of a mess. While everything flows pretty logically as you read, it is very difficult to reference concepts. In making a character and testing the mechanics I found myself flipping around the book constantly, and while there are some reference sheets, just remembering where everything is placed in the book can be a challenge. Then again, the book is cheap enough that you could probably grab multiple copies for your table and mark them up for easy reference.    I have to make a particular note about the digital version of the book, too. An affordable pdf version is available on BookWalker (roughly $8.00 USD at the time of this writing), but as with the physical release, the quality leaves much to be desired. For one, the scan at the time of this writing is atrocious. It's so low res that trying to zoom in even slightly on a mobile device will strain your eyes. Furthermore, there's no bookmarking or any of the other modern conveniences we've come to enjoy from modern TRPG pdf releases in recent years. Sure it is cheap, and looks fine on a regular monitor, but most players (in my experience) like to have a pdf on a phone or tablet in addition to a physical book at the table, which allows the to individually look up rules while someone else is using the physical book. Simply put, I don't think the pdf is legible for that use due to how low-quality the scan is at this time, and that makes its utility next to zero.    The issue of complexity is also one to mention. In my experience, lighter games are great for new players and/or shorter campaigns and one-shots. The more complex the game, the more support there tends to be for long-term play. The KONOSUBA TRPG has breadth for sure but not a terrible amount of depth, and the mechanics can feel repetitive after a few sessions. Certainly things like changing class or gaining an advanced class may keep things fresh, but I can easily see players falling into patterns of using the same skills over and over without much variety.    That said, simplicity lends to expandability, and many early, simple games like white box D&D flourished because people were constantly homebrewing new rules, spells, and ideas into the very basic framework the game provided. Any GM or player willing to put in a bit of time with the KONOSUBA TRPG could likely generate tons of new skills and abilities, or fun sub-systems for domain management, running a business, entirely new classes, and more. There's also plenty of design space to come up with creative uses for Blessings or new Cheats to create that much-needed variety long-term play often requires. And though it is a fairly generic fantasy RPG in most respects, that makes it very easy to port over adventures or ideas from the plethora of other fantasy games on the market.    Overall, this is a terrific little gem that I think will please most KONOSUBA fans. While it is a simple little game, I think that like its source material there is just enough charm to make it a fun experience for at least a few sessions – and with a bit of work, perhaps many more.

Community score: 4.7            Honestly, y'all are lucky to be getting an actual review here. A sizable portion of my brain was tempted to forego writing anything coherent and just post confetti gifs and this video before calling it a day. But editorial probably wouldn't be cool with that, so now I'm left to figure out how to package this bundle of squees and d'awws into something resembling a formal review.    Because really, this entire episode is a singleminded lead-up to the confession scene we've been waiting weeks to see. Like sure, there are some nice moments in the build-up. It's nice to get Hanzawa giving a concerned warning about the possible microaggressions that come with being a gay couple in a heteronormative society, and it's funny watching Hirano playing intermediary because these two idiots still haven't exchanged cell phone numbers. There's an especially nice moment showing Sasaki's internalized his lesson about boundaries from the previous arc, and he gives a direct apology about it later. Considering this particular moment was a misunderstanding I was worried the show would brush it off with Miyano insisting it wasn't a big deal, but they offer a lot more nuance to it, and emphasize that the key is for both our boys to honestly, earnestly communicate with one another.    And boy do they communicate once Miyano catches up with Sasaki. Like several unbroken minutes of him gushing out every feeling he's ever had about the guy, finally saying all the things left frustratingly unsaid across the show. It's a seriously charming moment that's only eclipsed by the ridiculously tender kiss scene that follows. It's already rare for romance anime to actually get to the kissing portion of their central relationship, but even when they do it's almost never with this level of intimacy in its staging and character animation. Just the way they animate the characters' fingers overlapping, interlocking, and separating communicates so much of their emotions without a word.    And that's basically all she wrote for SasaMiya. After three months of slow burn build up we climax (no, not like that) with a beautiful kiss, a little bit of humor as falling action, and then wave goodbye with the promise of some new anime project in the future. It's about as fitting a conclusion as you can ask for from this kind of show, but it's also not a ton to analyze. It's just really, really nice to see these two finally get together and share such a wonderful moment.    That's also more or less where I stand with SasaMiya. It's infectiously cute, mellow, and altogether pleasant. It's brought to life through some impeccable direction and a laser-focus on delivering low-stakes humor and romance. If you're looking for something to watch that goes down like warm porridge, this about as close to that ideal as you can get. And as a side-note, if you're in the mood for more and are up for a girls-centric story, maybe check out the Kase-san and... Cherry Blossoms OVA. So long as you've got patience, you're sure to be rewarded by both.

If you're looking for something to watch that goes down like warm porridge, this about as close to that ideal as you can get. And as a side-note, if you're in the mood for more and are up for a girls-centric story, maybe check out the Kase-san and... Cherry Blossoms OVA. So long as you've got patience, you're sure to be rewarded by both.     Rating:     Sasaki and Miyano is currently streaming on Funimation.   <prevEpisodes 1-2 Episode 3 Episode 4 Episode 5 Episode 6 Episode 7 Episode 8 Episode 9 Episode 10 Episode 11 Episode 12  ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4, 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAXZbfLzJUg': 1, 'https://www.funimation.com/shows/sasaki-and-miyano/': 1}"

Review:         Synopsis:          When super-powered school girl A-ko isn't rushing to class with her cry-baby friend C-ko, she's destroying school property in her battles with B-ko. Her carefree days of wanton destruction are about to get a serious wrench thrown in them however, when an alien menace descends on her futuristic hometown of Graviton City.    We're revisiting the 1986 classic from Discotek, issued in high-definition for the first time with all the bells and whistles!      Review:            I'm here to answer three questions looming over this release. Is Project A-ko worth watching for newcomers? If you have seen it before, is this edition worth your time? Lastly, what are the special features that make this the ""perfect edition?""    For the uninitiated, Project A-ko is a 1986 anime film that was widely successful in Japan and groundbreaking for the U.S. market. This isn't a piece of quaint retro media; it was formative to early English-language fandom as one of the first anime fans could (legally) get on tape. It was initially pitched as a direct-to-video release as part of the Cream Lemon erotica series, but producers must have seen its potential for wider appeal, and it was reworked as a mainstream title with a bit of spicy content left in. By and large though, Project A-ko is a sci-fi comedy full of impressive action set pieces, mechanical designs, and physical humor that surprisingly still holds up over 30 years later.    The film's premise is pretty straightforward: Super-powered A-ko lives in Graviton City, a place in the near future that has experienced a surge in technological development after recovering from a meteor strike. She and her childhood friend C-ko are new high school students and perpetually late for class. The crybaby C-ko immediately catches the attention of the wealthy queen bee and part-time inventor B-ko who makes it her mission to defeat A-ko and claim B-ko for herself. In the background, an alien ship is approaching Graviton City in search of their missing princess.    Much of the film's charm is thanks to its commitment to the bit. If that means five slightly varying sequences of A-ko thundering through a neighborhood and crashing into the alien spy D, so be it. Will she ever lose to B-ko in their quickly escalating face offs? Probably not, but director Katsuhiko Nishijima (who was only 24 at the time) and the rest of the animation crew know how to defy viewer's expectations. A build-up to a fight is just as likely to end in a quick leg sweep as it is to turn into a full-out brawl.    If I had to levy any criticisms at the queer-charged narrative, it's that the pacing can be a bit all over the place. There are a few beats that feel like the story is drawing out for time until it finally gets to the explosive climax, but Project A-ko runs on spectacle. Just as the audience feels inclined to groan at yet another ""race to school before the bell"" sequence, the movie changes it up with a different diversion. My other primary complaint is that the joke reveal that all the aliens are women hasn't aged well. It isn't malicious, but it does feel dated to a time when ""manly women"" (and all the baggage that came with it) were a common punchline.    Visually, this is the best Project A-ko has ever (and perhaps will ever) look. There's a great feature over on Crunchyroll by Paul Chapman that discusses the wild story of how Discotek pulled off this remaster. The condensed version, as was told to me by Justin Sevakis, is that the team was remastering the film manually through a new process (referred to on Discotek releases as AstroRes) that was pitched to them out of the UK. At that time, the original 35mm film was considered lost. As the restoration process marched on, Robert Woodhead, the founder and owner of AnimEigo, would become the unsung hero of the release. Through what was discovered to be a filing error, Woodhead found the original 35mm film elements of Project A-ko.    The results are fantastic. I had seen the the CPM release of A-ko back in the early aughts and was lucky enough to be at the Otakon viewing last year. Watching it again at home, the clean-up work and color correction are stellar. From A-ko's hair to the giant spaceships, there's a deeper richness to the hues that create a superior and more enjoyable experience. At the risk of sounding like I'm repeating my praises from Discotek's Memories release, this is worth viewing just for the animation alone. But it's the special features that really sell it.    Project A-ko's unique history extends to its musical score. The anime features three vocal tracks and a score composed and produced by Joey Carbone and Richie Zito with performances by Anne Livingston, Samantha Newark, Valerie Stevenson, and George Doering. There's a great 30-minute documentary with Carbone, Zito, Livingston, and Newark that discusses how they were brought on to the project and their specific places in music history. I'm not an 80s pop music buff, so consider how surprised I was to learn that besides some bopping tracks, the creators were heavily influential in mainstream music. The special features are full of interesting insights like this, whether it's a 1980s behind-the-scenes doc shot by a Japanese film crew in Los Angeles or a quick playthrough of an abandoned CD-Rom game. These are features that aren't just nice to have but provide a full context of why Project A-ko has its place as a seminal part of anime history.    Project A-ko is a good romp. Personally, I recommend watching it with friends while eating fried chicken to get the perfect vibes. Throw it in when the world feels a little too much and let A-ko's physical hijinks clear up your bad day.

Keep in mind that these rankings are based on how people rated individual episodes of the current season, not on the overall quality or popularity of the series. Only the titles legally streaming in North America and popular enough are being ranked, so the bottom of the list might represent 'watchable' rather than 'bad'. See the notes for further details.   For the last week we're comparing all the final episodes With the week of March 26-31, the Winter 2022 season is now over. But many of the series already ended the previous week, so we're adding an extra ""final"" week where all the last episodes are ranked against each other. With this we can see which series ended on a strong note and which ones ended more weakly. That means the ""final ep."" column is a repeat of the last episode from Mar 19-25 or Mar 26-31. And the ""prev week change"" is the difference in position between the ""final ep."" column and the penultimate episode.  Episode Rankings for the final episodes Along the actual ranking for this week's episodes, this graph chronicles the change in position from week to week. While some series are stable, others swing wildly in the rankings depending on the strength of each episode. When a series has no episode for a given week, the previous week's episode is used instead as a placeholder. The first episode of each series is considered as part of the first week, even if it really streamed during the second week.

Keep in mind that these rankings are based on how people rated individual episodes of the current season, not on the overall quality or popularity of the series. Only the titles legally streaming in North America and popular enough are being ranked, so the bottom of the list might represent 'watchable' rather than 'bad'. See the notes for further details.   For the last week we're comparing all the final episodes With the week of March 26-31, the Winter 2022 season is now over. But many of the series already ended the previous week, so we're adding an extra ""final"" week where all the last episodes are ranked against each other. With this we can see which series ended on a strong note and which ones ended more weakly. That means the ""final ep."" column is a repeat of the last episode from Mar 19-25 or Mar 26-31. And the ""prev week change"" is the difference in position between the ""final ep."" column and the penultimate episode.  Episode Rankings for the final episodes Along the actual ranking for this week's episodes, this graph chronicles the change in position from week to week. While some series are stable, others swing wildly in the rankings depending on the strength of each episode. When a series has no episode for a given week, the previous week's episode is used instead as a placeholder.

This somewhat compensates for the fact that the first episode of each series has more votes, which favors series that started strongly.

This roughly means that if, out of all people who rated both A and B, 60% preferred A, it will be ranked higher than B.

If a series has no episode for a given week, we use the rating data for the previous week's episode in order to compute the weekly ranking. This is not officially counted as a position in the ranking (it has no impact on the cumulative ranking), but it makes it easier to compare weeks if they each have the same number of series ranked.   It should be noted that long-running series (and sequels) have an advantage in the sense that only people who like the series are still watching it, and they are likely to give each episode a high rating.

Keep in mind that these rankings are based on how people rated individual episodes of the current season, not on the overall quality or popularity of the series.

For the last week we're comparing all the final episodes With the week of March 26-31, the Winter 2022 season is now over. But many of the series already ended the previous week, so we're adding an extra ""final"" week where all the last episodes are ranked against each other. With this we can see which series ended on a strong note and which ones ended more weakly. That means the ""final ep."" column is a repeat of the last episode from Mar 19-25 or Mar 26-31. And the ""prev week change"" is the difference in position between the ""final ep."" column and the penultimate episode.

With the last episode duplicated in the ""final ep."" column, it means that the votes for the last episode of each series are counted twice, which intentionally gives a boost to series that ended strongly. This somewhat compensates for the fact that the first episode of each series has more votes, which favors series that started strongly.

ANN makes no claims regarding statistical significance or invulnerability to spam.   The rankings are computed using the Schulze method, with the variation that unrated titles are considered as abstentions instead of lower than the rated titles. This roughly means that if, out of all people who rated both A and B, 60% preferred A, it will be ranked higher than B.   The rankings indicate relative quality (A is preferred to B), not absolute quality (B is good/bad). While the titles are ranked from 'best' to 'worst', sometimes the difference between #1 and #10 can be very thin. So if your favorite is near the bottom of the list, don't take it personally. It doesn't mean it's a bad show, it just means that ANN readers, on average, have preferred the ones above.   If a series has no episode for a given week, we use the rating data for the previous week's episode in order to compute the weekly ranking. This is not officially counted as a position in the ranking (it has no impact on the cumulative ranking), but it makes it easier to compare weeks if they each have the same number of series ranked.   It should be noted that long-running series (and sequels) have an advantage in the sense that only people who like the series are still watching it, and they are likely to give each episode a high rating. But if such a series is going through a low-quality filler arc, the season will get low rankings that are not indicative of the true overall quality of the series.

14-04-2022,anime,2,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/weekly-ranking/2022/winter/.182540,The Best and Worst of Winter 2022 - Anime News Network:SEA,"     Let's have a look at what ANN readers consider the best (and worst) of the season, based on the polls you can find in our Daily Streaming Reviews and on the Your Score page with the latest simulcasts.   Keep in mind that these rankings are based on how people rated individual episodes of the current season, not on the overall quality or popularity of the series. Only the titles legally streaming in North America and popular enough are being ranked, so the bottom of the list might represent 'watchable' rather than 'bad'. See the notes for further details.   For the last week we're comparing all the final episodes With the week of March 26-31, the Winter 2022 season is now over. But many of the series already ended the previous week, so we're adding an extra ""final"" week where all the last episodes are ranked against each other. With this we can see which series ended on a strong note and which ones ended more weakly. That means the ""final ep."" column is a repeat of the last episode from Mar 19-25 or Mar 26-31. And the ""prev week change"" is the difference in position between the ""final ep."" column and the penultimate episode.  Episode Rankings for the final episodes Along the actual ranking for this week's episodes, this graph chronicles the change in position from week to week. While some series are stable, others swing wildly in the rankings depending on the strength of each episode. When a series has no episode for a given week, the previous week's episode is used instead as a placeholder. The first episode of each series is considered as part of the first week, even if it really streamed during the second week.

Community score: 4.1              What is this?   Nagomu is a man who left his home in Kyoto and his family's confectionary shop when he became a musician. Upon hearing that his father has been hospitalized though, he comes back home to take over the family business. However, while he was gone, a young girl named Itsuka started working at the shop. The whereabouts of Itsuka's parents is unknown, and she has no other relatives, and Nagomu finds himself as foster parent for Itsuka. Itsuka, on the other hand, dislikes Nagomu for abandoning the family to become a musician. She proclaims that it will be her who will take over the shop one day instead of Nagomu.    Deaimon: Recipe for Happiness is based on Rin Asano's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Wednesdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                 While perhaps Usagi Drop is the most obvious comparison, Deaimon reminded me most of Poco's Udon World, a lovely series about a man who moves back home to take over his family's udon shop and finds himself caring for a young tanuki as a father figure that no one watched. It's cozy and gentle, exploring the intersection and tensions between modern adulthood and maintaining family and cultural traditions. Nagomu always genuinely loved the wagashi he made, but his love was a bit too intense and he ended up pursuing a career as a musician instead. Now that his band has broken up, he comes home and has to renavigate his relationship with his family, with wagashi, and with this new little interloper named Itsuka.    Okay, “interloper” is a little rude and not even really representative of how Nagumo or the show's narrative regard her. After all, it's not like Itsuka chose to be there; she was abandoned by her parents, left in the hands of basically strangers, and feels obligated to work far harder than any ten-year-old should need to. The way the two play off each other is sweet. Nagumo is a huge goof, a big puppyish man full of nothing but love, enthusiasm, and a willingness to make a fool of himself, while Itsuka is far too serious and hardworking for her age, denying her own childhood due to her sense of obligation and trauma over abandonment.    I've seen this described as “dadime” (a portmanteau of ""dad"" and ""anime""), which is one of my personal weaknesses. While Nagumo is old enough to be Itsuka's father, I don't think it's quite accurate. He's more of a big brother than a dad, but either way, he's exactly what Itsuka needs. I look forward to seeing their relationship unfold.      James Beckett  Rating:                 I'm the kind of guy that's awfully susceptible to the allure of “Dad Simulators” like The Walking Dead games or The Last of Us, though I haven't had so much luck with such subject matter in anime outside of a select few titles (Hinamatsuri comes to mind, and maybe Kakushigoto). Maybe that means I just have an unhealthy fixation on grimdark tragedies stuffed with zombies and betrayal, or maybe I just have a hard time vibing with the overly cutesy approach that comedy anime tend to approach the concept with. I also love the culinary arts, though, and I was interested to see if Deaimon clicked with me because of the educational potential.    I wasn't one hundred percent on board with the central dynamic that Nagomu and Itsuka shared at first, but they could become quite endearing given enough time. There's not much to say about Nagomu at first, a rather run-of-the-mill sort of guy that fails to inspire a whole lot of interest on his own, and Itsuka's arrival as the supposed “true” heir of the family confectionary came across as a bit contrived for my tastes. The best of these surrogate-father-meets-unlikely-daughter stories make the two characters seem like a natural fit for one another, even when they're at odds, and I just wasn't sure if this pair had that level of chemistry.    By the end of the episode, though, I was feeling more positively about the story. Itsuka is trying her gosh best to do a good job, and she deserves a pat on the head, damn it. The way that she and Nagomu are able to slowly forge their familial bond is predictable but eventually rather sweet. I could see Deaimon growing on me a lot of its protagonists continue to develop and grow at a solid pace. I don't know if this anime is going to skyrocket to the top of my watchlist, but I'll gladly check out another episode or two, just in case it ends up being a surprise success after all.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                 Plot-wise, this anime is quite simple: a man moves back into his parents' home to help out with the family business only to discover they have taken in an orphan. Needless to say, rather than being plot-driven, this anime is character-driven. And although it has only 22 minutes of runtime, Deaimon does some darn good character building.    On one hand we have Nogamu: the man with no shame. He wears his heart on his sleeve and lets criticism bounce off of him like it's nothing. What's interesting is that he did have someone whose words he took to heart: his late grandfather. The reason he left the family business in the first place, despite loving it dearly, was overhearing his grandfather say he wasn't suited for the job. And rather than confronting his grandfather, he ran away to Tokyo to become a musician instead.    Our secondary lead, Itsuka has also built her world around the words of the most important person in her life: her father. Unwilling or unable to continue his life as a single father, Itsuka's father abandoned her with Nogamu's family, telling the young girl that she was useless shortly before disappearing into the night. Thus, Itsuka is determined to be useful—to show the world that she is not only self-sufficient but can be depended on when troubles arise. Of course, despite the pain and anger in her heart, it's clear that her reason for becoming this way isn't to prove her father wrong but rather the irrational hope that should she succeed, her father will return for her. It's heartbreaking, especially when you remember she actively goes to the train station after school looking for men with guitars (the image she has of her father).    And what's interesting is that while Nogamu's mother wants him to take on a fatherly role in Itsuka's life, that's not what she needs now. What she needs is a friend who can understand what she's going through—someone who understands that the words of someone you love can shape your entire world. That is what Nogamu an Itsuka share and that will be the basis for their relationship as things continue forward. It's a solid emotional core to build a series around and I look forward to seeing how things go next week.      Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                 Alright, time for another Dad anime! It's been a little while since we last got a show about a single 30-something dude suddenly becoming a parental figure to a young girl, and since we still haven't gotten a second season of Barakamon, this cozy little muffin of a show will have to do. I use muffin because I know precisely nothing about traditional Japanese sweets. But I do know a thing or two about found family shows, and so far Deiamon's off to a decent, if unexceptional start.    Though the Dad Anime bit may be a little premature. Sure, the show itself is insistent about it – Itsuka first meets Nagomu by mistaking him for her absentee father, and Nagomu's own mother basically asks him to become the girl's surrogate parent. But Nagomu himself doesn't really have Dad energy, adoptive or otherwise. He's got the vibe of an adult older brother who went off to do his own thing after college, or sometimes he's kind of Steve from Blue's Clues where he seems as much like a child as the actual 10-year-old. This gives him a somewhat unique dynamic with Itsuka that can be pretty charming at its best, but can also feel too vague to give their interactions the bite necessary to carry a lot of this episode.    Itsuka, on the other hand, is all but certainly going to carry this show if the premiere is anything to go on. Her personal conflict of feeling she has to be “useful” in order to maintain her place at the shop – and with her loving caretakers – speaks to some serious trauma. And seeing her slowly come to accept the unconditional love of her new home and family could be heartwarming as all get-out. So if they can build a good rapport between here and Nagomu, I think there's room for a really nice show in here.    I just wish the way we got to all that was a little less clumsy. There's a scene where, unprompted, Nagomu just unloads his entire backstory for leaving the family business for a full decade, and it's all built on how he gets really upset over selling his family's beloved sweets to other people. Meanwhile the climactic conflict comes from some random person prank calling the store with a fake order, and I guess none of the adults at the store thought to get contact information or take any sort of deposit before committing to a big(?) order of sweets. It's an awkward and contrived way to have Itsuka mess up without actually messing up, so that it can be easily resolved in time for credits to roll, which makes the resolution feel artificial. In a show that is built on personal emotions and relationships, that's a bad sign.    But those could just be growing pains from having to get all of this out in a single episode, and I'd like it if the show could find its footing. It's no Barakamon, but few things are. If it can get its act together, Deiamon could be plenty sweet and filling.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                At least one star of this rating is for the scrumptious looking traditional Japanese sweets. That's important, since the show is set in a traditional confectionery, but even so each little manju and treat is a beautiful work of art that simultaneously makes you want to eat them and to carefully display them on the mantelpiece. I fully admit that I have a very, very sweet tooth, but even if I didn't the glimpses we get of the confections are just lovely.    That stands to be what this series is as a whole – just lovely, although certainly not without its angst. The confectionery, run by an older couple, is also home to two young people who are trying to work through some pretty heavy subjects in their lives. Nagomu, finally returning home after ten years, is coping with what looks an awful lot like a failed career as some sort of chestnut-themed singer while also coming to terms with the overheard conversation that sent him packing a decade ago. That almost pales in comparison to poor little Itsuka, whose father, a distant acquaintance of the shop owners, basically dumped her with them a year ago. That's put Itsuka in an unbearable position – a piece of her seems to know that the couple regards her as their grandchild and truly love her, but she also feels like she has to go above and beyond to make herself “valuable” to them, to prove that she deserves her place in their home. Presumably telling her that she would someday inherit the confectionary was intended to show her that they had no intention of throwing her out; instead it's become an additional burden on the girl, who now feels that she must be an even more determined worker to prove that she's allowed to be their grandchild.    That she'd see Nagumo as a threat since he's actually blood-related family makes a lot of sense, and not just to Itsuka. Her adoptive grandmother is well aware of how hard Itsuka is working herself and of the insecurities plaguing her, and while her request that Nagumo parent the girl (who, heartbreakingly, still looks for her missing dad at the train station frequently) is a bit much, it's also easy to see that she thinks she's helping both of them. And really, Nagumo is well-placed to help Itsuka deal with things, because he's the one she's afraid is usurping her place. It's all very poignant, and while those of us burned by the Bunny Drop manga's second half may be leery, I think this is going to be sweet in a few senses of the word.     discuss this in the forum (291 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 4.1              What is this?   Nagomu is a man who left his home in Kyoto and his family's confectionary shop when he became a musician. Upon hearing that his father has been hospitalized though, he comes back home to take over the family business. However, while he was gone, a young girl named Itsuka started working at the shop. The whereabouts of Itsuka's parents is unknown, and she has no other relatives, and Nagomu finds himself as foster parent for Itsuka. Itsuka, on the other hand, dislikes Nagomu for abandoning the family to become a musician. She proclaims that it will be her who will take over the shop one day instead of Nagomu.    Deaimon: Recipe for Happiness is based on Rin Asano's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Wednesdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                 While perhaps Usagi Drop is the most obvious comparison, Deaimon reminded me most of Poco's Udon World, a lovely series about a man who moves back home to take over his family's udon shop and finds himself caring for a young tanuki as a father figure that no one watched. It's cozy and gentle, exploring the intersection and tensions between modern adulthood and maintaining family and cultural traditions. Nagomu always genuinely loved the wagashi he made, but his love was a bit too intense and he ended up pursuing a career as a musician instead. Now that his band has broken up, he comes home and has to renavigate his relationship with his family, with wagashi, and with this new little interloper named Itsuka.    Okay, “interloper” is a little rude and not even really representative of how Nagumo or the show's narrative regard her. After all, it's not like Itsuka chose to be there; she was abandoned by her parents, left in the hands of basically strangers, and feels obligated to work far harder than any ten-year-old should need to. The way the two play off each other is sweet. Nagumo is a huge goof, a big puppyish man full of nothing but love, enthusiasm, and a willingness to make a fool of himself, while Itsuka is far too serious and hardworking for her age, denying her own childhood due to her sense of obligation and trauma over abandonment.    I've seen this described as “dadime” (a portmanteau of ""dad"" and ""anime""), which is one of my personal weaknesses. While Nagumo is old enough to be Itsuka's father, I don't think it's quite accurate. He's more of a big brother than a dad, but either way, he's exactly what Itsuka needs. I look forward to seeing their relationship unfold.      James Beckett  Rating:                 I'm the kind of guy that's awfully susceptible to the allure of “Dad Simulators” like The Walking Dead games or The Last of Us, though I haven't had so much luck with such subject matter in anime outside of a select few titles (Hinamatsuri comes to mind, and maybe Kakushigoto). Maybe that means I just have an unhealthy fixation on grimdark tragedies stuffed with zombies and betrayal, or maybe I just have a hard time vibing with the overly cutesy approach that comedy anime tend to approach the concept with. I also love the culinary arts, though, and I was interested to see if Deaimon clicked with me because of the educational potential.    I wasn't one hundred percent on board with the central dynamic that Nagomu and Itsuka shared at first, but they could become quite endearing given enough time. There's not much to say about Nagomu at first, a rather run-of-the-mill sort of guy that fails to inspire a whole lot of interest on his own, and Itsuka's arrival as the supposed “true” heir of the family confectionary came across as a bit contrived for my tastes. The best of these surrogate-father-meets-unlikely-daughter stories make the two characters seem like a natural fit for one another, even when they're at odds, and I just wasn't sure if this pair had that level of chemistry.    By the end of the episode, though, I was feeling more positively about the story. Itsuka is trying her gosh best to do a good job, and she deserves a pat on the head, damn it. The way that she and Nagomu are able to slowly forge their familial bond is predictable but eventually rather sweet. I could see Deaimon growing on me a lot of its protagonists continue to develop and grow at a solid pace. I don't know if this anime is going to skyrocket to the top of my watchlist, but I'll gladly check out another episode or two, just in case it ends up being a surprise success after all.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                 Plot-wise, this anime is quite simple: a man moves back into his parents' home to help out with the family business only to discover they have taken in an orphan. Needless to say, rather than being plot-driven, this anime is character-driven. And although it has only 22 minutes of runtime, Deaimon does some darn good character building.    On one hand we have Nogamu: the man with no shame. He wears his heart on his sleeve and lets criticism bounce off of him like it's nothing. What's interesting is that he did have someone whose words he took to heart: his late grandfather. The reason he left the family business in the first place, despite loving it dearly, was overhearing his grandfather say he wasn't suited for the job. And rather than confronting his grandfather, he ran away to Tokyo to become a musician instead.    Our secondary lead, Itsuka has also built her world around the words of the most important person in her life: her father. Unwilling or unable to continue his life as a single father, Itsuka's father abandoned her with Nogamu's family, telling the young girl that she was useless shortly before disappearing into the night. Thus, Itsuka is determined to be useful—to show the world that she is not only self-sufficient but can be depended on when troubles arise. Of course, despite the pain and anger in her heart, it's clear that her reason for becoming this way isn't to prove her father wrong but rather the irrational hope that should she succeed, her father will return for her. It's heartbreaking, especially when you remember she actively goes to the train station after school looking for men with guitars (the image she has of her father).    And what's interesting is that while Nogamu's mother wants him to take on a fatherly role in Itsuka's life, that's not what she needs now. What she needs is a friend who can understand what she's going through—someone who understands that the words of someone you love can shape your entire world. That is what Nogamu an Itsuka share and that will be the basis for their relationship as things continue forward. It's a solid emotional core to build a series around and I look forward to seeing how things go next week.      Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                 Alright, time for another Dad anime!

Community score: 4.1              What is this?   Nagomu is a man who left his home in Kyoto and his family's confectionary shop when he became a musician. Upon hearing that his father has been hospitalized though, he comes back home to take over the family business. However, while he was gone, a young girl named Itsuka started working at the shop. The whereabouts of Itsuka's parents is unknown, and she has no other relatives, and Nagomu finds himself as foster parent for Itsuka. Itsuka, on the other hand, dislikes Nagomu for abandoning the family to become a musician. She proclaims that it will be her who will take over the shop one day instead of Nagomu.    Deaimon: Recipe for Happiness is based on Rin Asano's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Wednesdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                 While perhaps Usagi Drop is the most obvious comparison, Deaimon reminded me most of Poco's Udon World, a lovely series about a man who moves back home to take over his family's udon shop and finds himself caring for a young tanuki as a father figure that no one watched. It's cozy and gentle, exploring the intersection and tensions between modern adulthood and maintaining family and cultural traditions. Nagomu always genuinely loved the wagashi he made, but his love was a bit too intense and he ended up pursuing a career as a musician instead. Now that his band has broken up, he comes home and has to renavigate his relationship with his family, with wagashi, and with this new little interloper named Itsuka.    Okay, “interloper” is a little rude and not even really representative of how Nagumo or the show's narrative regard her. After all, it's not like Itsuka chose to be there; she was abandoned by her parents, left in the hands of basically strangers, and feels obligated to work far harder than any ten-year-old should need to. The way the two play off each other is sweet. Nagumo is a huge goof, a big puppyish man full of nothing but love, enthusiasm, and a willingness to make a fool of himself, while Itsuka is far too serious and hardworking for her age, denying her own childhood due to her sense of obligation and trauma over abandonment.    I've seen this described as “dadime” (a portmanteau of ""dad"" and ""anime""), which is one of my personal weaknesses. While Nagumo is old enough to be Itsuka's father, I don't think it's quite accurate. He's more of a big brother than a dad, but either way, he's exactly what Itsuka needs. I look forward to seeing their relationship unfold.      James Beckett  Rating:                 I'm the kind of guy that's awfully susceptible to the allure of “Dad Simulators” like The Walking Dead games or The Last of Us, though I haven't had so much luck with such subject matter in anime outside of a select few titles (Hinamatsuri comes to mind, and maybe Kakushigoto). Maybe that means I just have an unhealthy fixation on grimdark tragedies stuffed with zombies and betrayal, or maybe I just have a hard time vibing with the overly cutesy approach that comedy anime tend to approach the concept with. I also love the culinary arts, though, and I was interested to see if Deaimon clicked with me because of the educational potential.    I wasn't one hundred percent on board with the central dynamic that Nagomu and Itsuka shared at first, but they could become quite endearing given enough time. There's not much to say about Nagomu at first, a rather run-of-the-mill sort of guy that fails to inspire a whole lot of interest on his own, and Itsuka's arrival as the supposed “true” heir of the family confectionary came across as a bit contrived for my tastes. The best of these surrogate-father-meets-unlikely-daughter stories make the two characters seem like a natural fit for one another, even when they're at odds, and I just wasn't sure if this pair had that level of chemistry.    By the end of the episode, though, I was feeling more positively about the story. Itsuka is trying her gosh best to do a good job, and she deserves a pat on the head, damn it. The way that she and Nagomu are able to slowly forge their familial bond is predictable but eventually rather sweet. I could see Deaimon growing on me a lot of its protagonists continue to develop and grow at a solid pace. I don't know if this anime is going to skyrocket to the top of my watchlist, but I'll gladly check out another episode or two, just in case it ends up being a surprise success after all.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                 Plot-wise, this anime is quite simple: a man moves back into his parents' home to help out with the family business only to discover they have taken in an orphan. Needless to say, rather than being plot-driven, this anime is character-driven. And although it has only 22 minutes of runtime, Deaimon does some darn good character building.    On one hand we have Nogamu: the man with no shame. He wears his heart on his sleeve and lets criticism bounce off of him like it's nothing. What's interesting is that he did have someone whose words he took to heart: his late grandfather. The reason he left the family business in the first place, despite loving it dearly, was overhearing his grandfather say he wasn't suited for the job. And rather than confronting his grandfather, he ran away to Tokyo to become a musician instead.    Our secondary lead, Itsuka has also built her world around the words of the most important person in her life: her father. Unwilling or unable to continue his life as a single father, Itsuka's father abandoned her with Nogamu's family, telling the young girl that she was useless shortly before disappearing into the night. Thus, Itsuka is determined to be useful—to show the world that she is not only self-sufficient but can be depended on when troubles arise. Of course, despite the pain and anger in her heart, it's clear that her reason for becoming this way isn't to prove her father wrong but rather the irrational hope that should she succeed, her father will return for her. It's heartbreaking, especially when you remember she actively goes to the train station after school looking for men with guitars (the image she has of her father).    And what's interesting is that while Nogamu's mother wants him to take on a fatherly role in Itsuka's life, that's not what she needs now. What she needs is a friend who can understand what she's going through—someone who understands that the words of someone you love can shape your entire world. That is what Nogamu an Itsuka share and that will be the basis for their relationship as things continue forward. It's a solid emotional core to build a series around and I look forward to seeing how things go next week.      Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                 Alright, time for another Dad anime! It's been a little while since we last got a show about a single 30-something dude suddenly becoming a parental figure to a young girl, and since we still haven't gotten a second season of Barakamon, this cozy little muffin of a show will have to do. I use muffin because I know precisely nothing about traditional Japanese sweets. But I do know a thing or two about found family shows, and so far Deiamon's off to a decent, if unexceptional start.    Though the Dad Anime bit may be a little premature. Sure, the show itself is insistent about it – Itsuka first meets Nagomu by mistaking him for her absentee father, and Nagomu's own mother basically asks him to become the girl's surrogate parent. But Nagomu himself doesn't really have Dad energy, adoptive or otherwise. He's got the vibe of an adult older brother who went off to do his own thing after college, or sometimes he's kind of Steve from Blue's Clues where he seems as much like a child as the actual 10-year-old. This gives him a somewhat unique dynamic with Itsuka that can be pretty charming at its best, but can also feel too vague to give their interactions the bite necessary to carry a lot of this episode.    Itsuka, on the other hand, is all but certainly going to carry this show if the premiere is anything to go on. Her personal conflict of feeling she has to be “useful” in order to maintain her place at the shop – and with her loving caretakers – speaks to some serious trauma. And seeing her slowly come to accept the unconditional love of her new home and family could be heartwarming as all get-out. So if they can build a good rapport between here and Nagomu, I think there's room for a really nice show in here.    I just wish the way we got to all that was a little less clumsy. There's a scene where, unprompted, Nagomu just unloads his entire backstory for leaving the family business for a full decade, and it's all built on how he gets really upset over selling his family's beloved sweets to other people. Meanwhile the climactic conflict comes from some random person prank calling the store with a fake order, and I guess none of the adults at the store thought to get contact information or take any sort of deposit before committing to a big(?) order of sweets. It's an awkward and contrived way to have Itsuka mess up without actually messing up, so that it can be easily resolved in time for credits to roll, which makes the resolution feel artificial. In a show that is built on personal emotions and relationships, that's a bad sign.    But those could just be growing pains from having to get all of this out in a single episode, and I'd like it if the show could find its footing. It's no Barakamon, but few things are. If it can get its act together, Deiamon could be plenty sweet and filling.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                At least one star of this rating is for the scrumptious looking traditional Japanese sweets. That's important, since the show is set in a traditional confectionery, but even so each little manju and treat is a beautiful work of art that simultaneously makes you want to eat them and to carefully display them on the mantelpiece. I fully admit that I have a very, very sweet tooth, but even if I didn't the glimpses we get of the confections are just lovely.    That stands to be what this series is as a whole – just lovely, although certainly not without its angst. The confectionery, run by an older couple, is also home to two young people who are trying to work through some pretty heavy subjects in their lives. Nagomu, finally returning home after ten years, is coping with what looks an awful lot like a failed career as some sort of chestnut-themed singer while also coming to terms with the overheard conversation that sent him packing a decade ago. That almost pales in comparison to poor little Itsuka, whose father, a distant acquaintance of the shop owners, basically dumped her with them a year ago. That's put Itsuka in an unbearable position – a piece of her seems to know that the couple regards her as their grandchild and truly love her, but she also feels like she has to go above and beyond to make herself “valuable” to them, to prove that she deserves her place in their home. Presumably telling her that she would someday inherit the confectionary was intended to show her that they had no intention of throwing her out; instead it's become an additional burden on the girl, who now feels that she must be an even more determined worker to prove that she's allowed to be their grandchild.    That she'd see Nagumo as a threat since he's actually blood-related family makes a lot of sense, and not just to Itsuka. Her adoptive grandmother is well aware of how hard Itsuka is working herself and of the insecurities plaguing her, and while her request that Nagumo parent the girl (who, heartbreakingly, still looks for her missing dad at the train station frequently) is a bit much, it's also easy to see that she thinks she's helping both of them. And really, Nagumo is well-placed to help Itsuka deal with things, because he's the one she's afraid is usurping her place. It's all very poignant, and while those of us burned by the Bunny Drop manga's second half may be leery, I think this is going to be sweet in a few senses of the word.     discuss this in the forum (291 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives   ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

And rather than confronting his grandfather, he ran away to Tokyo to become a musician instead.    Our secondary lead, Itsuka has also built her world around the words of the most important person in her life: her father. Unwilling or unable to continue his life as a single father, Itsuka's father abandoned her with Nogamu's family, telling the young girl that she was useless shortly before disappearing into the night. Thus, Itsuka is determined to be useful—to show the world that she is not only self-sufficient but can be depended on when troubles arise. Of course, despite the pain and anger in her heart, it's clear that her reason for becoming this way isn't to prove her father wrong but rather the irrational hope that should she succeed, her father will return for her. It's heartbreaking, especially when you remember she actively goes to the train station after school looking for men with guitars (the image she has of her father).    And what's interesting is that while Nogamu's mother wants him to take on a fatherly role in Itsuka's life, that's not what she needs now. What she needs is a friend who can understand what she's going through—someone who understands that the words of someone you love can shape your entire world. That is what Nogamu an Itsuka share and that will be the basis for their relationship as things continue forward. It's a solid emotional core to build a series around and I look forward to seeing how things go next week.      Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                 Alright, time for another Dad anime! It's been a little while since we last got a show about a single 30-something dude suddenly becoming a parental figure to a young girl, and since we still haven't gotten a second season of Barakamon, this cozy little muffin of a show will have to do. I use muffin because I know precisely nothing about traditional Japanese sweets. But I do know a thing or two about found family shows, and so far Deiamon's off to a decent, if unexceptional start.    Though the Dad Anime bit may be a little premature. Sure, the show itself is insistent about it – Itsuka first meets Nagomu by mistaking him for her absentee father, and Nagomu's own mother basically asks him to become the girl's surrogate parent. But Nagomu himself doesn't really have Dad energy, adoptive or otherwise. He's got the vibe of an adult older brother who went off to do his own thing after college, or sometimes he's kind of Steve from Blue's Clues where he seems as much like a child as the actual 10-year-old. This gives him a somewhat unique dynamic with Itsuka that can be pretty charming at its best, but can also feel too vague to give their interactions the bite necessary to carry a lot of this episode.    Itsuka, on the other hand, is all but certainly going to carry this show if the premiere is anything to go on. Her personal conflict of feeling she has to be “useful” in order to maintain her place at the shop – and with her loving caretakers – speaks to some serious trauma. And seeing her slowly come to accept the unconditional love of her new home and family could be heartwarming as all get-out. So if they can build a good rapport between here and Nagomu, I think there's room for a really nice show in here.    I just wish the way we got to all that was a little less clumsy. There's a scene where, unprompted, Nagomu just unloads his entire backstory for leaving the family business for a full decade, and it's all built on how he gets really upset over selling his family's beloved sweets to other people. Meanwhile the climactic conflict comes from some random person prank calling the store with a fake order, and I guess none of the adults at the store thought to get contact information or take any sort of deposit before committing to a big(?) order of sweets. It's an awkward and contrived way to have Itsuka mess up without actually messing up, so that it can be easily resolved in time for credits to roll, which makes the resolution feel artificial. In a show that is built on personal emotions and relationships, that's a bad sign.    But those could just be growing pains from having to get all of this out in a single episode, and I'd like it if the show could find its footing. It's no Barakamon, but few things are. If it can get its act together, Deiamon could be plenty sweet and filling.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                At least one star of this rating is for the scrumptious looking traditional Japanese sweets. That's important, since the show is set in a traditional confectionery, but even so each little manju and treat is a beautiful work of art that simultaneously makes you want to eat them and to carefully display them on the mantelpiece. I fully admit that I have a very, very sweet tooth, but even if I didn't the glimpses we get of the confections are just lovely.    That stands to be what this series is as a whole – just lovely, although certainly not without its angst. The confectionery, run by an older couple, is also home to two young people who are trying to work through some pretty heavy subjects in their lives. Nagomu, finally returning home after ten years, is coping with what looks an awful lot like a failed career as some sort of chestnut-themed singer while also coming to terms with the overheard conversation that sent him packing a decade ago. That almost pales in comparison to poor little Itsuka, whose father, a distant acquaintance of the shop owners, basically dumped her with them a year ago. That's put Itsuka in an unbearable position – a piece of her seems to know that the couple regards her as their grandchild and truly love her, but she also feels like she has to go above and beyond to make herself “valuable” to them, to prove that she deserves her place in their home. Presumably telling her that she would someday inherit the confectionary was intended to show her that they had no intention of throwing her out; instead it's become an additional burden on the girl, who now feels that she must be an even more determined worker to prove that she's allowed to be their grandchild.    That she'd see Nagumo as a threat since he's actually blood-related family makes a lot of sense, and not just to Itsuka. Her adoptive grandmother is well aware of how hard Itsuka is working herself and of the insecurities plaguing her, and while her request that Nagumo parent the girl (who, heartbreakingly, still looks for her missing dad at the train station frequently) is a bit much, it's also easy to see that she thinks she's helping both of them. And really, Nagumo is well-placed to help Itsuka deal with things, because he's the one she's afraid is usurping her place. It's all very poignant, and while those of us burned by the Bunny Drop manga's second half may be leery, I think this is going to be sweet in a few senses of the word.

14-04-2022,anime,2,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/preview-guide/2022/spring/love-after-world-domination/.183623,Love After World Domination - The Spring 2022 Preview Guide - Anime News Network:SEA,"    The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Love After World Domination   Apr  9th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Love After World Domination ?                     Community score: 4.0              What is this?   Fudo Aikawa and Desumi Magahara are in love. There's only one small problem: they are mortal enemies. Fudo is the red ranger and leader of the fighting force Gelato 5, while Desumi is the reaper princess of the evil organization Gekko. To make matters worse, neither of them have ever been in a relationship before. They have to keep their budding romance a secret, while figuring out how to be in a relationship and juggle their real life responsibilities along the way.    Love After World Domination is based on Hiroshi Noda and Takahiro Wakamatsu's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?   James Beckett  Rating:                Look, what do you want from me? Love After World Domination is an extremely cute and surprisingly well-produced romantic comedy featuring two catastrophically dorky young lovers that are fighting their way through the awkwardness of their own inexperience because they like each other so gosh darned much, and it's a loving homage/spoof of Super Sentai. This show was literally made specifically for me. I am not a strong man. There was never any chance that I would be able to resist the charms of this one.    I could just make this review a straightforward list of the things I loved about this premiere. The sentai team is themed after gelato flavors, which is hilarious; the fight scenes are actually pretty fun and cool-looking; one of the evil minions is a giant bear; Fudo the Red Gelato is King Himbo of Good Boy Mountain; Desumi's little skull mask is cute as heck, and she also has a chonky cat that she loves, which makes her perfect girlfriend material.    Honestly, I only have one real complaint with Love After World Domination, and it isn't even entirely fair to the show's own qualities. It just had the unfortunate luck of coming after Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic on today's schedule, and 99% of every other rom-com anime out there would pale in comparison to that show. Love After World Domination is plenty cute, and plenty funny, but it is standing in the shadow of one of the GOATs that is operating at the peak of its powers, which is bound to make it seem maybe a touch modest in comparison.    I suppose that this is also one of those productions that could easily suffer from diminishing returns, especially if the animation starts to suffer and the show has to rely on the same round of jokes about dating etiquette and Super Sentai tropes. Then again, real Super Sentai series have gotten by on recycling tried and true cliches on a limited budget for, like, 50 years straight, so I doubt LAWD will have too difficult a time at keeping things fresh. Either way, I had a rollicking good time with this premiere, and I'm going to add it to this season's growing list of must-watch comedies.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Love After World Domination is one of those premieres that I enjoyed for the most part but worry about the longevity of the concept. As it stands, the first episode really only has two core jokes—if they can even be called that. The first is the ultra-cute love story between Fudo and Desumi. While they are battlefield enemies engaging in a scandalous relationship, the crux of the humor comes from the fact that neither of them know a thing about romance. They clearly like each other, but are basically resorting to Google to figure out how this “dating” thing works. It's cute, innocent fun with a sprinkle of social commentary (like when it pokes fun at the creepiness of cyber-stalking your crush and how it changes the traditional dating process).    The other core joke of the show is its parody of the Japanese superhero genre, tokusatsu. This is also where the show falters a bit. While its five gelato-flavored heroes and their appropriately themed attacks seem like an attempt to make fun of the general concept of tokusatsu, it's not really out of the realm of believability for an actual toku show to be themed like this. I mean, Kamen Rider Gaim, penned by Madoka Magica creator Gen Urobuchi, was fruit-themed, after all. Moreover, there is no subversion of Japanese superhero tropes here. Everyone is 100% serious about what is going on—from the villains who stand back and make speeches even as the rangers go to town on the low level mooks, to the rangers who are earnest and friendly even when off duty. Because of this, the show feels painfully predictable and almost boring whenever its not solidly focused on the relationship between Fudo and Desumi.    So even though I have a soft spot for both Power Rangers and hero/villain romances, I'm not really as into this anime as I feel I should be. Even within this premiere alone, it feels like the concept is already running out of steam. I don't see myself coming back for more next week, though I may check out a bit of the manga and see if that is able to change my mind.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Move over, Romeo and Juliet. Fudo and Desumi are here to show you how real star-crossed lovers do it: by not just having feuding families, but being on completely opposite sides of a major fight. Or at least a ridiculous fight? Even if the superheroes weren't the Gelato 5 – complete with flavor-themed colors – and the villains seeking to take over the world didn't employ a giant talking bear named Culverin Bear, there's not much about the two warring sides for us to take seriously. Even the people populating the story's world don't – when Gekko attacks a public park, the screams for help from the general public are…let's go with “underwhelming.” Simply put, this is equal parts super sentai sendup and gooey romcom, and it looks like those two things are going to mesh just as well here as they do in the source manga.    The central romance is between Desumi, AKA Reaper Princess, and Fudo, Red Gelato (strawberry flavor). Fudo falls in love at first sight, which is impressive since his “first sight” is of Desumi in her battle “gear,” which consists of fancy lingerie and a face-hiding mask. (So maybe not impressive.) But there's a real sense that it's not so much that he fell in love with what he saw as he did with her fighting skills and her parting words, which are about his battle prowess. Since there's a definite sense that the rest of the Gelato 5 think he's just some muscle head, Desumi's remarks may be the nicest thing anyone's said to him about all that training he's done. Likewise, Fudo's heartfelt confession to her is clearly her first brush with romance and she's flattered and more than a little charmed by his earnestness.    It's a cute mix of tropes made even more fun by their efforts at hiding the fact that they're dating from both Gelato 5 and Gekko, although technically Fudo did get permission from Professor Gelato to ask Desumi out. Not that the good professor knew who Fudo was crushing on when he urged him to go forth and speak his feelings, something Fudo may be realizing in hindsight. Or he may not; Fudo's perhaps not the sharpest tool in the proverbial shed. When you combine that with Desumi's incredible naivete in matters romantic (holding hands practically sends her into a fainting fit), it's the recipe for peach-pink love – at least as far as Pink Gelato's definition of the color goes.    While there are some awkward things about the character designs – specifically the way people fit into their clothes, or don't, as the case may be – this looks better than I was expecting and the animation is up to some flashy fights and over-the-top transformation scenes. As a fan of the manga, I'm happy with how this looks in its first episode, and I'm looking forward to seeing more.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Finally, some good god damn food. Don't get me wrong: I enjoyed Aharen-san wa Hakarenai perfectly fine, and I'm looking forward to some other romcoms that have yet to debut. But I have been craving another goofy-ass show about a pair of idiots blushing their way into the next dimension, and this show has given me all I could ever ask for.    There's really not a whole lot else to dig into here, though. I could try to talk about how hard the show goes on its Super Sentai parody, complete with a full five-person transformation sequence where our gelato-themed Power Rangers sound off increasingly goofy battle cries. But I'm far from an expert on this stuff so all I can say is that I refuse to believe pistachio is “the flavor of peace” no matter how hard Gelato Green insists. And outside of some sharp gags and moments of parody, this entire premiere is just watching our adorable, awkward leads together – either when they're already dating or when Fudo first made his confession. That means most of this episode is just iterations on a single joke that, while funny and well-delivered, also means you have to really like that joke to get onboard with it.    The production does help a lot in keeping that joke fresh, though. Unlike the similarly toku-themed Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department, this show actually has the production values to show off some cool fight choreography to go along with its jokes, and it especially has room to make our dorky central couple expressive and appealing to watch. This is just some A+ romcom blushing, and it makes the two of them tip-toeing through the “steps” of dating fun to watch all on its own. There's even room to add some actual detail to their fanservice, like making sure Desumi has her garters on right to avoid a bathroom death trap. In a year that's already featured World’s End Harem and its horny JPEG artifacts, having cheesecake that actually knows how to properly present itself shouldn't be taken for granted, so if this show's gonna be a little horny I'm glad they actually know what they're doing.    I'm not going to tell you this show is deep or thought-provoking or even particularly romantic, but what I will say is I had a big dumb grin on my face the entire episode. I love these losers and I want to see them go on a hundred secret dates where they suddenly have to turn a kiss into a clashing headbutt to avoid suspicion. I want to see them send flirty texts in code that make it look like threatening letters. This show was made for me, and I plan to embrace it with both arms.     discuss this in the forum (291 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Even the people populating the story's world don't – when Gekko attacks a public park, the screams for help from the general public are…let's go with “underwhelming.” Simply put, this is equal parts super sentai sendup and gooey romcom, and it looks like those two things are going to mesh just as well here as they do in the source manga.    The central romance is between Desumi, AKA Reaper Princess, and Fudo, Red Gelato (strawberry flavor). Fudo falls in love at first sight, which is impressive since his “first sight” is of Desumi in her battle “gear,” which consists of fancy lingerie and a face-hiding mask. (So maybe not impressive.) But there's a real sense that it's not so much that he fell in love with what he saw as he did with her fighting skills and her parting words, which are about his battle prowess. Since there's a definite sense that the rest of the Gelato 5 think he's just some muscle head, Desumi's remarks may be the nicest thing anyone's said to him about all that training he's done. Likewise, Fudo's heartfelt confession to her is clearly her first brush with romance and she's flattered and more than a little charmed by his earnestness.    It's a cute mix of tropes made even more fun by their efforts at hiding the fact that they're dating from both Gelato 5 and Gekko, although technically Fudo did get permission from Professor Gelato to ask Desumi out. Not that the good professor knew who Fudo was crushing on when he urged him to go forth and speak his feelings, something Fudo may be realizing in hindsight. Or he may not; Fudo's perhaps not the sharpest tool in the proverbial shed. When you combine that with Desumi's incredible naivete in matters romantic (holding hands practically sends her into a fainting fit), it's the recipe for peach-pink love – at least as far as Pink Gelato's definition of the color goes.    While there are some awkward things about the character designs – specifically the way people fit into their clothes, or don't, as the case may be – this looks better than I was expecting and the animation is up to some flashy fights and over-the-top transformation scenes. As a fan of the manga, I'm happy with how this looks in its first episode, and I'm looking forward to seeing more.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Finally, some good god damn food. Don't get me wrong: I enjoyed Aharen-san wa Hakarenai perfectly fine, and I'm looking forward to some other romcoms that have yet to debut. But I have been craving another goofy-ass show about a pair of idiots blushing their way into the next dimension, and this show has given me all I could ever ask for.    There's really not a whole lot else to dig into here, though. I could try to talk about how hard the show goes on its Super Sentai parody, complete with a full five-person transformation sequence where our gelato-themed Power Rangers sound off increasingly goofy battle cries. But I'm far from an expert on this stuff so all I can say is that I refuse to believe pistachio is “the flavor of peace” no matter how hard Gelato Green insists. And outside of some sharp gags and moments of parody, this entire premiere is just watching our adorable, awkward leads together – either when they're already dating or when Fudo first made his confession. That means most of this episode is just iterations on a single joke that, while funny and well-delivered, also means you have to really like that joke to get onboard with it.    The production does help a lot in keeping that joke fresh, though. Unlike the similarly toku-themed Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department, this show actually has the production values to show off some cool fight choreography to go along with its jokes, and it especially has room to make our dorky central couple expressive and appealing to watch. This is just some A+ romcom blushing, and it makes the two of them tip-toeing through the “steps” of dating fun to watch all on its own. There's even room to add some actual detail to their fanservice, like making sure Desumi has her garters on right to avoid a bathroom death trap. In a year that's already featured World’s End Harem and its horny JPEG artifacts, having cheesecake that actually knows how to properly present itself shouldn't be taken for granted, so if this show's gonna be a little horny I'm glad they actually know what they're doing.    I'm not going to tell you this show is deep or thought-provoking or even particularly romantic, but what I will say is I had a big dumb grin on my face the entire episode. I love these losers and I want to see them go on a hundred secret dates where they suddenly have to turn a kiss into a clashing headbutt to avoid suspicion. I want to see them send flirty texts in code that make it look like threatening letters. This show was made for me, and I plan to embrace it with both arms.     discuss this in the forum (291 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives    ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 4.0              What is this?   Fudo Aikawa and Desumi Magahara are in love. There's only one small problem: they are mortal enemies. Fudo is the red ranger and leader of the fighting force Gelato 5, while Desumi is the reaper princess of the evil organization Gekko. To make matters worse, neither of them have ever been in a relationship before. They have to keep their budding romance a secret, while figuring out how to be in a relationship and juggle their real life responsibilities along the way.    Love After World Domination is based on Hiroshi Noda and Takahiro Wakamatsu's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?   James Beckett  Rating:                Look, what do you want from me? Love After World Domination is an extremely cute and surprisingly well-produced romantic comedy featuring two catastrophically dorky young lovers that are fighting their way through the awkwardness of their own inexperience because they like each other so gosh darned much, and it's a loving homage/spoof of Super Sentai. This show was literally made specifically for me. I am not a strong man. There was never any chance that I would be able to resist the charms of this one.    I could just make this review a straightforward list of the things I loved about this premiere. The sentai team is themed after gelato flavors, which is hilarious; the fight scenes are actually pretty fun and cool-looking; one of the evil minions is a giant bear; Fudo the Red Gelato is King Himbo of Good Boy Mountain; Desumi's little skull mask is cute as heck, and she also has a chonky cat that she loves, which makes her perfect girlfriend material.    Honestly, I only have one real complaint with Love After World Domination, and it isn't even entirely fair to the show's own qualities. It just had the unfortunate luck of coming after Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic on today's schedule, and 99% of every other rom-com anime out there would pale in comparison to that show. Love After World Domination is plenty cute, and plenty funny, but it is standing in the shadow of one of the GOATs that is operating at the peak of its powers, which is bound to make it seem maybe a touch modest in comparison.    I suppose that this is also one of those productions that could easily suffer from diminishing returns, especially if the animation starts to suffer and the show has to rely on the same round of jokes about dating etiquette and Super Sentai tropes. Then again, real Super Sentai series have gotten by on recycling tried and true cliches on a limited budget for, like, 50 years straight, so I doubt LAWD will have too difficult a time at keeping things fresh. Either way, I had a rollicking good time with this premiere, and I'm going to add it to this season's growing list of must-watch comedies.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Love After World Domination is one of those premieres that I enjoyed for the most part but worry about the longevity of the concept. As it stands, the first episode really only has two core jokes—if they can even be called that. The first is the ultra-cute love story between Fudo and Desumi. While they are battlefield enemies engaging in a scandalous relationship, the crux of the humor comes from the fact that neither of them know a thing about romance. They clearly like each other, but are basically resorting to Google to figure out how this “dating” thing works. It's cute, innocent fun with a sprinkle of social commentary (like when it pokes fun at the creepiness of cyber-stalking your crush and how it changes the traditional dating process).    The other core joke of the show is its parody of the Japanese superhero genre, tokusatsu. This is also where the show falters a bit. While its five gelato-flavored heroes and their appropriately themed attacks seem like an attempt to make fun of the general concept of tokusatsu, it's not really out of the realm of believability for an actual toku show to be themed like this. I mean, Kamen Rider Gaim, penned by Madoka Magica creator Gen Urobuchi, was fruit-themed, after all. Moreover, there is no subversion of Japanese superhero tropes here. Everyone is 100% serious about what is going on—from the villains who stand back and make speeches even as the rangers go to town on the low level mooks, to the rangers who are earnest and friendly even when off duty. Because of this, the show feels painfully predictable and almost boring whenever its not solidly focused on the relationship between Fudo and Desumi.    So even though I have a soft spot for both Power Rangers and hero/villain romances, I'm not really as into this anime as I feel I should be. Even within this premiere alone, it feels like the concept is already running out of steam. I don't see myself coming back for more next week, though I may check out a bit of the manga and see if that is able to change my mind.

I mean, Kamen Rider Gaim, penned by Madoka Magica creator Gen Urobuchi, was fruit-themed, after all. Moreover, there is no subversion of Japanese superhero tropes here. Everyone is 100% serious about what is going on—from the villains who stand back and make speeches even as the rangers go to town on the low level mooks, to the rangers who are earnest and friendly even when off duty. Because of this, the show feels painfully predictable and almost boring whenever its not solidly focused on the relationship between Fudo and Desumi.    So even though I have a soft spot for both Power Rangers and hero/villain romances, I'm not really as into this anime as I feel I should be. Even within this premiere alone, it feels like the concept is already running out of steam. I don't see myself coming back for more next week, though I may check out a bit of the manga and see if that is able to change my mind.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Move over, Romeo and Juliet. Fudo and Desumi are here to show you how real star-crossed lovers do it: by not just having feuding families, but being on completely opposite sides of a major fight. Or at least a ridiculous fight? Even if the superheroes weren't the Gelato 5 – complete with flavor-themed colors – and the villains seeking to take over the world didn't employ a giant talking bear named Culverin Bear, there's not much about the two warring sides for us to take seriously. Even the people populating the story's world don't – when Gekko attacks a public park, the screams for help from the general public are…let's go with “underwhelming.” Simply put, this is equal parts super sentai sendup and gooey romcom, and it looks like those two things are going to mesh just as well here as they do in the source manga.    The central romance is between Desumi, AKA Reaper Princess, and Fudo, Red Gelato (strawberry flavor). Fudo falls in love at first sight, which is impressive since his “first sight” is of Desumi in her battle “gear,” which consists of fancy lingerie and a face-hiding mask. (So maybe not impressive.) But there's a real sense that it's not so much that he fell in love with what he saw as he did with her fighting skills and her parting words, which are about his battle prowess. Since there's a definite sense that the rest of the Gelato 5 think he's just some muscle head, Desumi's remarks may be the nicest thing anyone's said to him about all that training he's done. Likewise, Fudo's heartfelt confession to her is clearly her first brush with romance and she's flattered and more than a little charmed by his earnestness.    It's a cute mix of tropes made even more fun by their efforts at hiding the fact that they're dating from both Gelato 5 and Gekko, although technically Fudo did get permission from Professor Gelato to ask Desumi out. Not that the good professor knew who Fudo was crushing on when he urged him to go forth and speak his feelings, something Fudo may be realizing in hindsight. Or he may not; Fudo's perhaps not the sharpest tool in the proverbial shed. When you combine that with Desumi's incredible naivete in matters romantic (holding hands practically sends her into a fainting fit), it's the recipe for peach-pink love – at least as far as Pink Gelato's definition of the color goes.    While there are some awkward things about the character designs – specifically the way people fit into their clothes, or don't, as the case may be – this looks better than I was expecting and the animation is up to some flashy fights and over-the-top transformation scenes. As a fan of the manga, I'm happy with how this looks in its first episode, and I'm looking forward to seeing more.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Finally, some good god damn food. Don't get me wrong: I enjoyed Aharen-san wa Hakarenai perfectly fine, and I'm looking forward to some other romcoms that have yet to debut. But I have been craving another goofy-ass show about a pair of idiots blushing their way into the next dimension, and this show has given me all I could ever ask for.    There's really not a whole lot else to dig into here, though. I could try to talk about how hard the show goes on its Super Sentai parody, complete with a full five-person transformation sequence where our gelato-themed Power Rangers sound off increasingly goofy battle cries. But I'm far from an expert on this stuff so all I can say is that I refuse to believe pistachio is “the flavor of peace” no matter how hard Gelato Green insists. And outside of some sharp gags and moments of parody, this entire premiere is just watching our adorable, awkward leads together – either when they're already dating or when Fudo first made his confession. That means most of this episode is just iterations on a single joke that, while funny and well-delivered, also means you have to really like that joke to get onboard with it.    The production does help a lot in keeping that joke fresh, though. Unlike the similarly toku-themed Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department, this show actually has the production values to show off some cool fight choreography to go along with its jokes, and it especially has room to make our dorky central couple expressive and appealing to watch. This is just some A+ romcom blushing, and it makes the two of them tip-toeing through the “steps” of dating fun to watch all on its own. There's even room to add some actual detail to their fanservice, like making sure Desumi has her garters on right to avoid a bathroom death trap. In a year that's already featured World’s End Harem and its horny JPEG artifacts, having cheesecake that actually knows how to properly present itself shouldn't be taken for granted, so if this show's gonna be a little horny I'm glad they actually know what they're doing.    I'm not going to tell you this show is deep or thought-provoking or even particularly romantic, but what I will say is I had a big dumb grin on my face the entire episode. I love these losers and I want to see them go on a hundred secret dates where they suddenly have to turn a kiss into a clashing headbutt to avoid suspicion. I want to see them send flirty texts in code that make it look like threatening letters. This show was made for me, and I plan to embrace it with both arms.

Community score: 4.6              What is this?   Kaguya Shinomiya and Miyuki Shirogane are two geniuses who stand atop their prestigious academy's student council, making them the elite among elite. But it's lonely at the top and each has fallen for the other. There's just one huge problem standing in the way of lovey-dovey bliss—they're both too prideful to be the first to confess their romantic feelings and thus become the “loser” in the competition of love.    Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic is the latest entry in the television anime based on Aka Akasaka's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                I can't believe that in one day, two of my favorite romances had new seasons start! Premiere season is tough, but days like this make it worth it. Kaguya-sama: Love is War has returned for a third season, picking right back where the previous season left off, and boy, am I glad to see these kids with all their weird little quirks and foibles again.    I wasn't totally sold on Miko Iino by the end of the previous season, unsure of where she would fit into the group dynamic with rigid prudishness as her primary character trait. So of course, the episode leads with a skit between her and Ishigami, who once upon a time was one of the worst characters but is now one of the best. Miko's strange listening habits, and Ishigami's attempt at taking the fall for her, made her feel more like a little weirdo, and by now, a bit of weirdness is basically a requirement to be a student council member.    This is important because there's a playfulness inherent to Kaguya-sama that Iino's rigidity seemed antithetical to, but ended up on full display for the rest of the episode. Teenagers aren't my area of expertise, but they're still kids, and kids need to play! They need to be awkward and obsess over things like read receipts on messaging apps and boast and set up arm-wrestling tournaments instead of doing their actual work. Their personalities are exaggerated and caricatured, but few comedies capture those special moments where you get a strange idea and just keep going with it.    That playfulness extends to the visual presentation as well. The animation in this season has so far been fairly middle of the road, and thus I haven't commented on it much, but Kaguya-sama has some of the best goddamn direction and animation in the medium. Mamoru Hatakeyama and his team almost always manage to elevate the manga's punchlines into something special, and they held nothing back this episode. From the camel wandering around in the background as Iino studies, to Shirogane's shifting body language as he realizes he has the upper hand on Kaguya over the phone, to making the picture quality look like a VHS transfer – every frame has something joyful and unexpected. Big gags and subtle expressions alike have been animated with equal levels of care.    If you haven't watched Kaguya-sama: Love is War yet… why not? It's seriously one of the best anime comedies ever made. Why deprive yourself?       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               After having watched two full seasons, it's become perfectly clear that Kaguya-sama isn't for me (except in the rare cases where it is). Being mostly a series of short gags—usually involving instant karma as one of the student council members attempts to assert dominance over the others in some way—means that there's not much to further develop the characters or progress the love story between Shinomiya and Shirogane. The episodes of the series I most enjoy tend to be the final few of the season where meaningful things happen and there is real drama and tangible stakes. This season premiere was most certainly not one of those episodes.    Now, that's not to say I don't find the humor of the show funny in its own right. From Ishigami futilely trying to stop Iino from embarrassing herself to Shinomiya's ignorance about the differences between email and texting, there are a ton of great gags in this episode. The final self-contained story about the arm wrestling tournament takes things to a whole other level—especially with its post-credits scene showing that Fujiwara was just talking trash the whole time and couldn't win without cheating.    But what takes all these gags to the next level is the animation that merges what's really going on with what the characters are thinking to create something as funny as it is surreal. From the large camel making noises in Iino's ear to the mountain of bodybuilders supporting Shinomiya, it's all but impossible not to laugh.    So while Kaguya-sama isn't my cup of tea in general, I wouldn't say that this is a bad episode. In fact, it is pretty much the epitome of what Kaguya-sama is at its essence. If you ever need a laugh, Kaguya-sama is eager to deliver—just don't expect anything more.       James Beckett  Rating:               One of the “benefits” of being a teacher is getting to essentially serve as a kind of covert anthropologist that specializes in that most elusive and influential of species: The modern teenager. I'm like Jane Goodall; I live among them, in their native environment, and since they give absolutely zero shits about what I think, I have free reign to study the peculiar social rituals and developmental adaptations that these hormonal and aggressive pack animals undergo. As such, I feel like I can say, with legitimately authoritative expertise, that one of the things that makes Kaguya-sama: Love is War such a smashing success is how well it understands the interior lives of teenagers. Specifically, it has a comprehensive understanding of all the ridiculously dumb shit that teenagers will do to and with one another when left to their own devices. More importantly, it gets that all of this inane tomfoolery, no matter how stupid, will feel to a teenager like the most earth-shatteringly consequential events that will ever occur in their lifetimes.    Kaguya-sama: Love is War –Ultra Romantic– is essentially more of the same, in that regard. The goofy kids of Shuchiin Academy's student council spend their days getting into the most ridiculous of shenanigans, while Kaguya and Miyuki sloooooooowly progress along their romantic destinies with one another. “More of the same” can come across as a backhanded compliment, but that couldn't be further from the truth in the case of an anime like Kaguya-sama, considering that the “same” in question happens to be some of the most consistently hilarious and expertly animated comedy in the business.    Each of the three sketches in this premiere does what Kaguya-sama does best, in that they take painfully relatable, everyday scenarios and crank the intensity so far past the eleven mark that the the dial may as well be ripped clean off. The opening sketch is perhaps the weakest of the three, since it focuses on Yu trying to deal with Miko not realizing that people can hear the weird crap she listens to when she's studying, and neither of these characters are the strongest of the ensemble. The joke about Miko's weird listening habits is also just not terribly funny, though that might be because that my own ADHD has had me go to some truly strange and avant garde places in search of distracting sounds to play when I'm trying to focus.    The other two scenes are golden, though, and they show off a wide variety of Kaguya-sama's strengths. The “Read Receipts” sketch is a masterpiece of observational humor, mining Kaguya's technological naivety and featuring Miyuki in full-on petty-goblin mode. It's one of those bits where the show manages to generate horror movie levels of tension on behalf of these loveably awkward children and their inability to just have a normal conversation. We also get a lot of good Ai content, which is always a bonus.    The “Arm Wrestling” sketch is just as hilarious, mostly because it's one of those showcases that gets the whole cast in on a silly mess-around that allows the artists at A-1 Pictures to really strut their stuff. It would already have been funny to have Chika get so obsessed with putting on an arm- wrestling contest, but Kaguya-sama goes the extra mile by animating the ever-loving hell out of it all. I demand a raise specifically for whoever got to handle the cut where Miyuki's face nearly implodes against the fury of Kaguya's sweat-hands fury (we've all been there, girl, there's no shame in it).    Do you honestly need me to tell you that Kaguya-sama's third season is mandatory viewing for this spring? Of course not. It's proven itself time and time again. Still, in case it needs to be said: Yes, the show is great, and you should absolutely watch it. Duh-doy, Britta.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               There really is nothing else quite like Kaguya-sama is there? Even as a self-proclaimed connoisseur of romcoms, it's hard to think of another series that managed to take such a simple premise and spin it into one of the most infectiously hilarious – and consistent – anime comedies of the past decade. But whatever alchemy is happening between the source material and the always exuberant adaptation team is still firing on all cylinders, and they've come back from season two without missing a step.    The series isn't resting on its laurels for this sequel either. It'd be easy to throw us back in with a classic Kaguya vs Shirogane battle, but instead they used the opportunity to demonstrate just how much good the previous season did for the show's weakest characters. Not only are Ishigami and Iino capable of carrying a skit almost entirely on their own, but they're able to do it in a way that capitalizes on all of  Ishigami's growth from the previous arc, going from the show's go-to punching bag to the kind of selfless idiot-genius that butters this show's bread. It's an unconventional way to welcome viewers back, but nonetheless promises to be just as hilarious as always.    From there, it's the same Kaguya-sama that steamrolled through our hearts in the previous seasons. The characters are still a blast, and the direction is as committed as ever to ridiculous, eclectic, and endlessly creative visual gags to sell every joke. It's not doing anything particularly new for the series, but that's a “don't mess with perfection” situation if ever there was one. I can attest to having a stupid smile plastered on my face across the entire premiere, and I busted out laughing as these kids tried to Death Note their way through being left on read, or when an homage to the soundtrack of Over The Top started playing during their arm-wrestling tournament. It's the kind of layered, high-effort joke that sets this show apart from the rest of its subgenre, and it's just so nice to have it back.    If you've missed this runaway train of a show, there probably aren't enough creatively directed romantic mind games in the world to convince you at this point. But if you're already a fan who was just worried the magic might have run out after all this time, you've got nothing to worry about. Kaguya-sama is back and in championship form once again.     discuss this in the forum (291 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 4.6              What is this?   Kaguya Shinomiya and Miyuki Shirogane are two geniuses who stand atop their prestigious academy's student council, making them the elite among elite. But it's lonely at the top and each has fallen for the other. There's just one huge problem standing in the way of lovey-dovey bliss—they're both too prideful to be the first to confess their romantic feelings and thus become the “loser” in the competition of love.    Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic is the latest entry in the television anime based on Aka Akasaka's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                I can't believe that in one day, two of my favorite romances had new seasons start! Premiere season is tough, but days like this make it worth it. Kaguya-sama: Love is War has returned for a third season, picking right back where the previous season left off, and boy, am I glad to see these kids with all their weird little quirks and foibles again.    I wasn't totally sold on Miko Iino by the end of the previous season, unsure of where she would fit into the group dynamic with rigid prudishness as her primary character trait. So of course, the episode leads with a skit between her and Ishigami, who once upon a time was one of the worst characters but is now one of the best. Miko's strange listening habits, and Ishigami's attempt at taking the fall for her, made her feel more like a little weirdo, and by now, a bit of weirdness is basically a requirement to be a student council member.    This is important because there's a playfulness inherent to Kaguya-sama that Iino's rigidity seemed antithetical to, but ended up on full display for the rest of the episode. Teenagers aren't my area of expertise, but they're still kids, and kids need to play! They need to be awkward and obsess over things like read receipts on messaging apps and boast and set up arm-wrestling tournaments instead of doing their actual work. Their personalities are exaggerated and caricatured, but few comedies capture those special moments where you get a strange idea and just keep going with it.    That playfulness extends to the visual presentation as well. The animation in this season has so far been fairly middle of the road, and thus I haven't commented on it much, but Kaguya-sama has some of the best goddamn direction and animation in the medium. Mamoru Hatakeyama and his team almost always manage to elevate the manga's punchlines into something special, and they held nothing back this episode. From the camel wandering around in the background as Iino studies, to Shirogane's shifting body language as he realizes he has the upper hand on Kaguya over the phone, to making the picture quality look like a VHS transfer – every frame has something joyful and unexpected. Big gags and subtle expressions alike have been animated with equal levels of care.    If you haven't watched Kaguya-sama: Love is War yet… why not? It's seriously one of the best anime comedies ever made. Why deprive yourself?       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               After having watched two full seasons, it's become perfectly clear that Kaguya-sama isn't for me (except in the rare cases where it is). Being mostly a series of short gags—usually involving instant karma as one of the student council members attempts to assert dominance over the others in some way—means that there's not much to further develop the characters or progress the love story between Shinomiya and Shirogane. The episodes of the series I most enjoy tend to be the final few of the season where meaningful things happen and there is real drama and tangible stakes. This season premiere was most certainly not one of those episodes.    Now, that's not to say I don't find the humor of the show funny in its own right. From Ishigami futilely trying to stop Iino from embarrassing herself to Shinomiya's ignorance about the differences between email and texting, there are a ton of great gags in this episode. The final self-contained story about the arm wrestling tournament takes things to a whole other level—especially with its post-credits scene showing that Fujiwara was just talking trash the whole time and couldn't win without cheating.    But what takes all these gags to the next level is the animation that merges what's really going on with what the characters are thinking to create something as funny as it is surreal. From the large camel making noises in Iino's ear to the mountain of bodybuilders supporting Shinomiya, it's all but impossible not to laugh.    So while Kaguya-sama isn't my cup of tea in general, I wouldn't say that this is a bad episode. In fact, it is pretty much the epitome of what Kaguya-sama is at its essence. If you ever need a laugh, Kaguya-sama is eager to deliver—just don't expect anything more.       James Beckett  Rating:               One of the “benefits” of being a teacher is getting to essentially serve as a kind of covert anthropologist that specializes in that most elusive and influential of species: The modern teenager. I'm like Jane Goodall; I live among them, in their native environment, and since they give absolutely zero shits about what I think, I have free reign to study the peculiar social rituals and developmental adaptations that these hormonal and aggressive pack animals undergo. As such, I feel like I can say, with legitimately authoritative expertise, that one of the things that makes Kaguya-sama: Love is War such a smashing success is how well it understands the interior lives of teenagers. Specifically, it has a comprehensive understanding of all the ridiculously dumb shit that teenagers will do to and with one another when left to their own devices. More importantly, it gets that all of this inane tomfoolery, no matter how stupid, will feel to a teenager like the most earth-shatteringly consequential events that will ever occur in their lifetimes.    Kaguya-sama: Love is War –Ultra Romantic– is essentially more of the same, in that regard. The goofy kids of Shuchiin Academy's student council spend their days getting into the most ridiculous of shenanigans, while Kaguya and Miyuki sloooooooowly progress along their romantic destinies with one another. “More of the same” can come across as a backhanded compliment, but that couldn't be further from the truth in the case of an anime like Kaguya-sama, considering that the “same” in question happens to be some of the most consistently hilarious and expertly animated comedy in the business.    Each of the three sketches in this premiere does what Kaguya-sama does best, in that they take painfully relatable, everyday scenarios and crank the intensity so far past the eleven mark that the the dial may as well be ripped clean off. The opening sketch is perhaps the weakest of the three, since it focuses on Yu trying to deal with Miko not realizing that people can hear the weird crap she listens to when she's studying, and neither of these characters are the strongest of the ensemble. The joke about Miko's weird listening habits is also just not terribly funny, though that might be because that my own ADHD has had me go to some truly strange and avant garde places in search of distracting sounds to play when I'm trying to focus.    The other two scenes are golden, though, and they show off a wide variety of Kaguya-sama's strengths. The “Read Receipts” sketch is a masterpiece of observational humor, mining Kaguya's technological naivety and featuring Miyuki in full-on petty-goblin mode. It's one of those bits where the show manages to generate horror movie levels of tension on behalf of these loveably awkward children and their inability to just have a normal conversation. We also get a lot of good Ai content, which is always a bonus.    The “Arm Wrestling” sketch is just as hilarious, mostly because it's one of those showcases that gets the whole cast in on a silly mess-around that allows the artists at A-1 Pictures to really strut their stuff. It would already have been funny to have Chika get so obsessed with putting on an arm- wrestling contest, but Kaguya-sama goes the extra mile by animating the ever-loving hell out of it all. I demand a raise specifically for whoever got to handle the cut where Miyuki's face nearly implodes against the fury of Kaguya's sweat-hands fury (we've all been there, girl, there's no shame in it).    Do you honestly need me to tell you that Kaguya-sama's third season is mandatory viewing for this spring? Of course not. It's proven itself time and time again. Still, in case it needs to be said: Yes, the show is great, and you should absolutely watch it. Duh-doy, Britta.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               There really is nothing else quite like Kaguya-sama is there? Even as a self-proclaimed connoisseur of romcoms, it's hard to think of another series that managed to take such a simple premise and spin it into one of the most infectiously hilarious – and consistent – anime comedies of the past decade. But whatever alchemy is happening between the source material and the always exuberant adaptation team is still firing on all cylinders, and they've come back from season two without missing a step.    The series isn't resting on its laurels for this sequel either. It'd be easy to throw us back in with a classic Kaguya vs Shirogane battle, but instead they used the opportunity to demonstrate just how much good the previous season did for the show's weakest characters. Not only are Ishigami and Iino capable of carrying a skit almost entirely on their own, but they're able to do it in a way that capitalizes on all of  Ishigami's growth from the previous arc, going from the show's go-to punching bag to the kind of selfless idiot-genius that butters this show's bread. It's an unconventional way to welcome viewers back, but nonetheless promises to be just as hilarious as always.    From there, it's the same Kaguya-sama that steamrolled through our hearts in the previous seasons. The characters are still a blast, and the direction is as committed as ever to ridiculous, eclectic, and endlessly creative visual gags to sell every joke. It's not doing anything particularly new for the series, but that's a “don't mess with perfection” situation if ever there was one. I can attest to having a stupid smile plastered on my face across the entire premiere, and I busted out laughing as these kids tried to Death Note their way through being left on read, or when an homage to the soundtrack of Over The Top started playing during their arm-wrestling tournament.

The opening sketch is perhaps the weakest of the three, since it focuses on Yu trying to deal with Miko not realizing that people can hear the weird crap she listens to when she's studying, and neither of these characters are the strongest of the ensemble. The joke about Miko's weird listening habits is also just not terribly funny, though that might be because that my own ADHD has had me go to some truly strange and avant garde places in search of distracting sounds to play when I'm trying to focus.    The other two scenes are golden, though, and they show off a wide variety of Kaguya-sama's strengths. The “Read Receipts” sketch is a masterpiece of observational humor, mining Kaguya's technological naivety and featuring Miyuki in full-on petty-goblin mode. It's one of those bits where the show manages to generate horror movie levels of tension on behalf of these loveably awkward children and their inability to just have a normal conversation. We also get a lot of good Ai content, which is always a bonus.    The “Arm Wrestling” sketch is just as hilarious, mostly because it's one of those showcases that gets the whole cast in on a silly mess-around that allows the artists at A-1 Pictures to really strut their stuff. It would already have been funny to have Chika get so obsessed with putting on an arm- wrestling contest, but Kaguya-sama goes the extra mile by animating the ever-loving hell out of it all. I demand a raise specifically for whoever got to handle the cut where Miyuki's face nearly implodes against the fury of Kaguya's sweat-hands fury (we've all been there, girl, there's no shame in it).    Do you honestly need me to tell you that Kaguya-sama's third season is mandatory viewing for this spring? Of course not. It's proven itself time and time again. Still, in case it needs to be said: Yes, the show is great, and you should absolutely watch it. Duh-doy, Britta.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               There really is nothing else quite like Kaguya-sama is there? Even as a self-proclaimed connoisseur of romcoms, it's hard to think of another series that managed to take such a simple premise and spin it into one of the most infectiously hilarious – and consistent – anime comedies of the past decade. But whatever alchemy is happening between the source material and the always exuberant adaptation team is still firing on all cylinders, and they've come back from season two without missing a step.    The series isn't resting on its laurels for this sequel either. It'd be easy to throw us back in with a classic Kaguya vs Shirogane battle, but instead they used the opportunity to demonstrate just how much good the previous season did for the show's weakest characters. Not only are Ishigami and Iino capable of carrying a skit almost entirely on their own, but they're able to do it in a way that capitalizes on all of  Ishigami's growth from the previous arc, going from the show's go-to punching bag to the kind of selfless idiot-genius that butters this show's bread. It's an unconventional way to welcome viewers back, but nonetheless promises to be just as hilarious as always.    From there, it's the same Kaguya-sama that steamrolled through our hearts in the previous seasons. The characters are still a blast, and the direction is as committed as ever to ridiculous, eclectic, and endlessly creative visual gags to sell every joke. It's not doing anything particularly new for the series, but that's a “don't mess with perfection” situation if ever there was one. I can attest to having a stupid smile plastered on my face across the entire premiere, and I busted out laughing as these kids tried to Death Note their way through being left on read, or when an homage to the soundtrack of Over The Top started playing during their arm-wrestling tournament. It's the kind of layered, high-effort joke that sets this show apart from the rest of its subgenre, and it's just so nice to have it back.    If you've missed this runaway train of a show, there probably aren't enough creatively directed romantic mind games in the world to convince you at this point. But if you're already a fan who was just worried the magic might have run out after all this time, you've got nothing to worry about. Kaguya-sama is back and in championship form once again.

14-04-2022,anime,4,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/preview-guide/2022/spring/kaguya-sama-love-is-war-ultra-romantic/.183619,Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic - The Spring 2022 Preview Guide - Anime News Network:SEA,"            How would you rate episode 1 of Kaguya-sama: Love is War -Ultra Romantic- ?                     Community score: 4.6              What is this?   Kaguya Shinomiya and Miyuki Shirogane are two geniuses who stand atop their prestigious academy's student council, making them the elite among elite. But it's lonely at the top and each has fallen for the other. There's just one huge problem standing in the way of lovey-dovey bliss—they're both too prideful to be the first to confess their romantic feelings and thus become the “loser” in the competition of love.    Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic is the latest entry in the television anime based on Aka Akasaka's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                I can't believe that in one day, two of my favorite romances had new seasons start! Premiere season is tough, but days like this make it worth it. Kaguya-sama: Love is War has returned for a third season, picking right back where the previous season left off, and boy, am I glad to see these kids with all their weird little quirks and foibles again.    I wasn't totally sold on Miko Iino by the end of the previous season, unsure of where she would fit into the group dynamic with rigid prudishness as her primary character trait. So of course, the episode leads with a skit between her and Ishigami, who once upon a time was one of the worst characters but is now one of the best. Miko's strange listening habits, and Ishigami's attempt at taking the fall for her, made her feel more like a little weirdo, and by now, a bit of weirdness is basically a requirement to be a student council member.    This is important because there's a playfulness inherent to Kaguya-sama that Iino's rigidity seemed antithetical to, but ended up on full display for the rest of the episode. Teenagers aren't my area of expertise, but they're still kids, and kids need to play! They need to be awkward and obsess over things like read receipts on messaging apps and boast and set up arm-wrestling tournaments instead of doing their actual work. Their personalities are exaggerated and caricatured, but few comedies capture those special moments where you get a strange idea and just keep going with it.    That playfulness extends to the visual presentation as well. The animation in this season has so far been fairly middle of the road, and thus I haven't commented on it much, but Kaguya-sama has some of the best goddamn direction and animation in the medium. Mamoru Hatakeyama and his team almost always manage to elevate the manga's punchlines into something special, and they held nothing back this episode. From the camel wandering around in the background as Iino studies, to Shirogane's shifting body language as he realizes he has the upper hand on Kaguya over the phone, to making the picture quality look like a VHS transfer – every frame has something joyful and unexpected. Big gags and subtle expressions alike have been animated with equal levels of care.    If you haven't watched Kaguya-sama: Love is War yet… why not? It's seriously one of the best anime comedies ever made. Why deprive yourself?       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               After having watched two full seasons, it's become perfectly clear that Kaguya-sama isn't for me (except in the rare cases where it is). Being mostly a series of short gags—usually involving instant karma as one of the student council members attempts to assert dominance over the others in some way—means that there's not much to further develop the characters or progress the love story between Shinomiya and Shirogane. The episodes of the series I most enjoy tend to be the final few of the season where meaningful things happen and there is real drama and tangible stakes. This season premiere was most certainly not one of those episodes.    Now, that's not to say I don't find the humor of the show funny in its own right. From Ishigami futilely trying to stop Iino from embarrassing herself to Shinomiya's ignorance about the differences between email and texting, there are a ton of great gags in this episode. The final self-contained story about the arm wrestling tournament takes things to a whole other level—especially with its post-credits scene showing that Fujiwara was just talking trash the whole time and couldn't win without cheating.    But what takes all these gags to the next level is the animation that merges what's really going on with what the characters are thinking to create something as funny as it is surreal. From the large camel making noises in Iino's ear to the mountain of bodybuilders supporting Shinomiya, it's all but impossible not to laugh.    So while Kaguya-sama isn't my cup of tea in general, I wouldn't say that this is a bad episode. In fact, it is pretty much the epitome of what Kaguya-sama is at its essence. If you ever need a laugh, Kaguya-sama is eager to deliver—just don't expect anything more.       James Beckett  Rating:               One of the “benefits” of being a teacher is getting to essentially serve as a kind of covert anthropologist that specializes in that most elusive and influential of species: The modern teenager. I'm like Jane Goodall; I live among them, in their native environment, and since they give absolutely zero shits about what I think, I have free reign to study the peculiar social rituals and developmental adaptations that these hormonal and aggressive pack animals undergo. As such, I feel like I can say, with legitimately authoritative expertise, that one of the things that makes Kaguya-sama: Love is War such a smashing success is how well it understands the interior lives of teenagers. Specifically, it has a comprehensive understanding of all the ridiculously dumb shit that teenagers will do to and with one another when left to their own devices. More importantly, it gets that all of this inane tomfoolery, no matter how stupid, will feel to a teenager like the most earth-shatteringly consequential events that will ever occur in their lifetimes.    Kaguya-sama: Love is War –Ultra Romantic– is essentially more of the same, in that regard. The goofy kids of Shuchiin Academy's student council spend their days getting into the most ridiculous of shenanigans, while Kaguya and Miyuki sloooooooowly progress along their romantic destinies with one another. “More of the same” can come across as a backhanded compliment, but that couldn't be further from the truth in the case of an anime like Kaguya-sama, considering that the “same” in question happens to be some of the most consistently hilarious and expertly animated comedy in the business.

They simply didn't have enough time and I wouldn't be surprised that's the reason a relatively minor studio takes over now – Brain's Base simply couldn't fit another 2-cour anime airing only one year later into their schedule. NHK was probably adamant to keep the schedule, so I'm really not confident about the quality of season 2.

People really need to stop with this whole ""they were lazy"" nonsense. You don't work as an animator to be ""lazy"" and as Blackiris explained above, most of these situations can be easily explained by a bad schedule.

They simply didn't have enough time and I wouldn't be surprised that's the reason a relatively minor studio takes over now – Brain's Base simply couldn't fit another 2-cour anime airing only one year later into their schedule. NHK was probably adamant to keep the schedule, so I'm really not confident about the quality of season 2.

People really need to stop with this whole ""they were lazy"" nonsense. You don't work as an animator to be ""lazy"" and as Blackiris explained above, most of these situations can be easily explained by a bad schedule.
