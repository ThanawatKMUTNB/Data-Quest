News Nausicaä Kabuki Stage Play Gets New Run in Tokyo in July   posted on 2022-04-26 17:58 UTC-8 by Crystalyn Hodgkins         Onoe Kikunosuke V, Yonekichi Nakamura V star in new run    Shochiku's official kabuki Twitter account revealed on Tuesday that the previous kabuki stage play adaptation of Hayao Miyazaki's Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind manga is getting a new run at Tokyo's Kabukiza theater from July 4-29 titled Kaze no Tani no Nausicaä Ue no Maki: Shiroki Majo no Senki (Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind First Volume: Battle Chronicle of the White Witch).    The new run of the play will be the third act of an overall performance each day, which starts at 6:30 p.m. (the first two acts featuring other plays start at 11:00 a.m. and 2:40 p.m. respectively).    G2 is again directing the play alongside Onoe Kikunosuke V. Onoe Kikunosuke V is also starring in the play as Princess Kushana, although he played Nausicaä in the previous run. Nakamura Yonekichi V will play Nausicaä. Other cast members include Nakamura Kinnosuke as Charuka, Bando Yajuro as Yupa, and Nakamura Matagoro II as Priest of the Mani Tribe.    The previous play (pictured at right) ran in December 2019.    Miyazaki created the original Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind manga in Tokuma Shoten's Animage magazine before adapting part of the story for a 1984 anime film. While the film was made before Studio Ghibli was founded, it is often retroactively considered to be part of the studio's body of work, as many of the film's key staff that would eventually form the studio. The story follows a warrior princess who protects her land amid wars in a post-apocalyptic Earth. Miyazaki drew the manga from 1982 to 1994. Viz Media publishes the manga in North America. Shout! Factory and GKIDS most recently released the film on home video.

News Nausicaä Kabuki Stage Play Gets New Run in Tokyo in July   posted on 2022-04-26 17:58 UTC-8 by Crystalyn Hodgkins         Onoe Kikunosuke V, Yonekichi Nakamura V star in new run    Shochiku's official kabuki Twitter account revealed on Tuesday that the previous kabuki stage play adaptation of Hayao Miyazaki's Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind manga is getting a new run at Tokyo's Kabukiza theater from July 4-29 titled Kaze no Tani no Nausicaä Ue no Maki: Shiroki Majo no Senki (Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind First Volume: Battle Chronicle of the White Witch).    The new run of the play will be the third act of an overall performance each day, which starts at 6:30 p.m. (the first two acts featuring other plays start at 11:00 a.m. and 2:40 p.m. respectively).    G2 is again directing the play alongside Onoe Kikunosuke V. Onoe Kikunosuke V is also starring in the play as Princess Kushana, although he played Nausicaä in the previous run. Nakamura Yonekichi V will play Nausicaä. Other cast members include Nakamura Kinnosuke as Charuka, Bando Yajuro as Yupa, and Nakamura Matagoro II as Priest of the Mani Tribe.    The previous play (pictured at right) ran in December 2019.    Miyazaki created the original Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind manga in Tokuma Shoten's Animage magazine before adapting part of the story for a 1984 anime film. While the film was made before Studio Ghibli was founded, it is often retroactively considered to be part of the studio's body of work, as many of the film's key staff that would eventually form the studio. The story follows a warrior princess who protects her land amid wars in a post-apocalyptic Earth. Miyazaki drew the manga from 1982 to 1994. Viz Media publishes the manga in North America. Shout! Factory and GKIDS most recently released the film on home video.

News Nausicaä Kabuki Stage Play Gets New Run in Tokyo in July   posted on 2022-04-26 17:58 UTC-8 by Crystalyn Hodgkins         Onoe Kikunosuke V, Yonekichi Nakamura V star in new run    Shochiku's official kabuki Twitter account revealed on Tuesday that the previous kabuki stage play adaptation of Hayao Miyazaki's Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind manga is getting a new run at Tokyo's Kabukiza theater from July 4-29 titled Kaze no Tani no Nausicaä Ue no Maki: Shiroki Majo no Senki (Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind First Volume: Battle Chronicle of the White Witch).    The new run of the play will be the third act of an overall performance each day, which starts at 6:30 p.m. (the first two acts featuring other plays start at 11:00 a.m. and 2:40 p.m. respectively).    G2 is again directing the play alongside Onoe Kikunosuke V. Onoe Kikunosuke V is also starring in the play as Princess Kushana, although he played Nausicaä in the previous run. Nakamura Yonekichi V will play Nausicaä. Other cast members include Nakamura Kinnosuke as Charuka, Bando Yajuro as Yupa, and Nakamura Matagoro II as Priest of the Mani Tribe.    The previous play (pictured at right) ran in December 2019.    Miyazaki created the original Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind manga in Tokuma Shoten's Animage magazine before adapting part of the story for a 1984 anime film. While the film was made before Studio Ghibli was founded, it is often retroactively considered to be part of the studio's body of work, as many of the film's key staff that would eventually form the studio. The story follows a warrior princess who protects her land amid wars in a post-apocalyptic Earth. Miyazaki drew the manga from 1982 to 1994. Viz Media publishes the manga in North America. Shout! Factory and GKIDS most recently released the film on home video.

Titles with less than 4 votes are removed from the list but are still counted in the ranking. This explains why there may be gaps in the ""#"" column.

Titles with many votes will tend to be at the top, but this is modified a little by the ratings. In other words, the popularity is the straight average score of a title (the value in the rating column) multiplied by the number of votes.

The Steam version, featuring English, Chinese, and Japanese support, will arrive on PCs around the world on September 8, 2022.  Produced by veteran director and composer Naoya Shimokawa and penned by Utawarerumono writer Munemitsu Suga, with support from the studio's superb art direction and character designer Mi, Monochrome Mobius: Rights and Wrongs Forgotten focuses on the heart of every great RPG: the story.  Monochrome Mobius: Rights and Wrongs Forgotten on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1962430/Monochrome_Mobius/  Story In the small province of Ennakamuy, on the frontiers of the great empire of Yamato, there lived a young man with his mother and sister. One day, at the local lord's behest, the young man was investigating a small irregularity when he came across a girl he had never met.  It was the words she spoke that shocked him: She told the man that his father was still alive. Seeing a trace of his father in her and resolving to learn the truth, the young man set out together with the girl towards the fabled land of Arva Shulan—a country that doesn't appear on the map.  Faced with trials and perils, the boy chases his father. He meets new friends and comrades who join him on his mission. There will be struggles and victories and failures and partings. The fickle vagaries of fate will place an epoch in the young man's hands—  And one day, this man will be sung of in legends.

The Steam version, featuring English, Chinese, and Japanese support, will arrive on PCs around the world on September 8, 2022.  Produced by veteran director and composer Naoya Shimokawa and penned by Utawarerumono writer Munemitsu Suga, with support from the studio's superb art direction and character designer Mi, Monochrome Mobius: Rights and Wrongs Forgotten focuses on the heart of every great RPG: the story.  Monochrome Mobius: Rights and Wrongs Forgotten on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1962430/Monochrome_Mobius/  Story In the small province of Ennakamuy, on the frontiers of the great empire of Yamato, there lived a young man with his mother and sister. One day, at the local lord's behest, the young man was investigating a small irregularity when he came across a girl he had never met.  It was the words she spoke that shocked him: She told the man that his father was still alive. Seeing a trace of his father in her and resolving to learn the truth, the young man set out together with the girl towards the fabled land of Arva Shulan—a country that doesn't appear on the map.  Faced with trials and perils, the boy chases his father. He meets new friends and comrades who join him on his mission. There will be struggles and victories and failures and partings. The fickle vagaries of fate will place an epoch in the young man's hands—  And one day, this man will be sung of in legends.

One day, at the local lord's behest, the young man was investigating a small irregularity when he came across a girl he had never met.  It was the words she spoke that shocked him: She told the man that his father was still alive. Seeing a trace of his father in her and resolving to learn the truth, the young man set out together with the girl towards the fabled land of Arva Shulan—a country that doesn't appear on the map.  Faced with trials and perils, the boy chases his father. He meets new friends and comrades who join him on his mission. There will be struggles and victories and failures and partings.

However, 40-something chapters actually is a a decent run compared to how some titles get axed even earlier. Having not read this series yet, maybe this particular series was intended on having a short run and maybe not.

The average chapter length is also around 12 instead of 19 pages. It does feel like it was cut short though.   This series was a basic romance that worked well enough, focusing on how the two leads get easily embarrassed. It seemed like it was about to get better after a strong arc where the guy meets his girlfriend's dad, but then it just ends.

Having not read this series yet, maybe this particular series was intended on having a short run and maybe not.            This wasn't a WSJ title, so it was probably given more of a chance. The average chapter length is also around 12 instead of 19 pages. It does feel like it was cut short though.   This series was a basic romance that worked well enough, focusing on how the two leads get easily embarrassed. It seemed like it was about to get better after a strong arc where the guy meets his girlfriend's dad, but then it just ends.

In shonen maybe. In seinen not so much. Another thing: ""He's being dishonest with himself, flippant with Miyako Godai when he isn't disregarding her support as romantic interest, and is otherwise an all-around little ... Jumpei is a very typical middle school boy.""   Neuroscience tells us that female adolescent brains develop faster than males. (Yes, I do mean ""on average"" so no rejoinders please.) There is a particular difference in brain areas related to the development of verbal and social skills. It could even be extrapolated as to why ""most"" boys would gravitate to martial arts and soccer rather than dance, and why they resort to fighting and bullying to settle conflicts instead of dialogue. And with females, it could also explain why female bullying is more likely to rely on verbal abuse - as well as social tactics like exclusion - than simple violence.   In other words, since we know - and have for quite some time as these neuroscience studies were done ages ago - why adolescents are the way that they are, why don't we choose to act like it instead of resorting to gendered bashing? After all, I can't imagine this reviewer referring to Usagi from Sailor Moon as ""vain, superficial, irrational and irresponsible ... so basically a typical middle school girl."" You know, the description that Jack Nicholson's character gave of women in ""As Good As It Gets"" ... except without the ""Melvin is a misanthropic misogynistic racist homophone so his bigoted views are false"" angle. The reviewer's ""typical middle school boy"" description is the same except the reviewer was actually serious.   https://www.zerotothree.org/resources/1380-are-there-any-differences-in-the-development-of-boys-and-girls-brains      Back to top                  NobaraBG    Joined: 05 Jan 2022 		    Posts: 7       Posted: Mon Apr 25, 2022 8:29 pm            I think that's why I do like the show so far...because Jumpei acts very realistically, likeable or not. He's not too perfect. I'm interested in his journey.   Plus the dancing animation is really well-done so far.

In shonen maybe. In seinen not so much. Another thing: ""He's being dishonest with himself, flippant with Miyako Godai when he isn't disregarding her support as romantic interest, and is otherwise an all-around little ... Jumpei is a very typical middle school boy.""   Neuroscience tells us that female adolescent brains develop faster than males. (Yes, I do mean ""on average"" so no rejoinders please.) There is a particular difference in brain areas related to the development of verbal and social skills. It could even be extrapolated as to why ""most"" boys would gravitate to martial arts and soccer rather than dance, and why they resort to fighting and bullying to settle conflicts instead of dialogue. And with females, it could also explain why female bullying is more likely to rely on verbal abuse - as well as social tactics like exclusion - than simple violence.   In other words, since we know - and have for quite some time as these neuroscience studies were done ages ago - why adolescents are the way that they are, why don't we choose to act like it instead of resorting to gendered bashing? After all, I can't imagine this reviewer referring to Usagi from Sailor Moon as ""vain, superficial, irrational and irresponsible ... so basically a typical middle school girl."" You know, the description that Jack Nicholson's character gave of women in ""As Good As It Gets"" ... except without the ""Melvin is a misanthropic misogynistic racist homophone so his bigoted views are false"" angle. The reviewer's ""typical middle school boy"" description is the same except the reviewer was actually serious.   https://www.zerotothree.org/resources/1380-are-there-any-differences-in-the-development-of-boys-and-girls-brains      Back to top                  NobaraBG    Joined: 05 Jan 2022 		    Posts: 7       Posted: Mon Apr 25, 2022 8:29 pm            I think that's why I do like the show so far...because Jumpei acts very realistically, likeable or not. He's not too perfect. I'm interested in his journey.   Plus the dancing animation is really well-done so far.

Another thing: ""He's being dishonest with himself, flippant with Miyako Godai when he isn't disregarding her support as romantic interest, and is otherwise an all-around little ... Jumpei is a very typical middle school boy.""   Neuroscience tells us that female adolescent brains develop faster than males. (Yes, I do mean ""on average"" so no rejoinders please.) There is a particular difference in brain areas related to the development of verbal and social skills. It could even be extrapolated as to why ""most"" boys would gravitate to martial arts and soccer rather than dance, and why they resort to fighting and bullying to settle conflicts instead of dialogue. And with females, it could also explain why female bullying is more likely to rely on verbal abuse - as well as social tactics like exclusion - than simple violence.   In other words, since we know - and have for quite some time as these neuroscience studies were done ages ago - why adolescents are the way that they are, why don't we choose to act like it instead of resorting to gendered bashing? After all, I can't imagine this reviewer referring to Usagi from Sailor Moon as ""vain, superficial, irrational and irresponsible ... so basically a typical middle school girl."" You know, the description that Jack Nicholson's character gave of women in ""As Good As It Gets"" ... except without the ""Melvin is a misanthropic misogynistic racist homophone so his bigoted views are false"" angle.

REVIEW: I'm Quitting Heroing             Note: this is the discussion thread for this article     Anime News Network Forum Index -> Site-related -> Talkback    View previous topic :: View next topic     Author Message        meiam    Joined: 23 Jun 2013 		    Posts: 3221       Posted: Mon Apr 25, 2022 12:08 pm            I like the show in concept, but execution is... not quite what I'm interested in.   It seems like the show priorities are (in order):   1. Establish how awesome Leo is (cause he's just so awesome at everything!).  2. Fan service  ... massive gap...  3. Be a fun workplace show with a fantasy twist.   I could maybe overlook episode 1 since its just the start, but episode 2 clearly showed its priorities.   We start with Leo just bursting in the general room, followed by this creepy slow pane over her sleeping just to have Leo show off his awesome magic. We then get this long lore dumb about magic reactor work just to have Leo, once again, show off how awesome his magic is and how regular limitation don't apply to him. The message of delegation is completely lost since its not clear it would have been possible to delegate the task without Leo (who is, once again, just too awesome guys!).

The MC is the typical OP Chad, but unlike an isekai where you basically have a deliberate incongruence between the person in their original world and their new world to explain in an indirect way why they're OP, Leo's setup is just so lazy.    As a result, his activities likewise seem very lazily structured. We never get a remotely decent explanation as to why he was in Shutania's room first thing in the morning. He makes a big deal about how he was demonstrating how efficient it was to delegate responsibility, but he spends all that time lazing in her office remote ogling her chest, instead of going about the rest of the castle and seeing if there was other work he could get started on, start planning, or anything remotely productive. That doesn't even get into the fact that without even really knowing her well he assumed that 1) she never considered or attempted to delegate tasks to anyone (which as the review points out is utterly improbable for an army of this alleged size), and 2) that she wouldn't have understood if he simply explained his idea to her. Heck, the very fact that her and the generals were even interviewing in the first place meant she clearly understood to some extent the what and how of delegation of work tasks.    It feels too much like the events of Ep 3 will not carry very far right now. It's a step in the right direction, but it's very easy to see it fall back off after this.      Back to top                   Takkun4343    Joined: 19 Jul 2007 		    Posts: 1258 		    Location: Englewood, Ohio 		        Posted: Mon Apr 25, 2022 4:38 pm            Three episodes in and I can safely say I'm enjoying this one so far, but then again, I enjoy almost every show I watch, so that's nothing new. I don't mind Leo being presented as ""the best"", though that probably has everything to do with my just not caring whether or not a character is a Gary Stu. His jerkass attitude in some respects is definitely amusing, and made the populace's ostracization of him sting a lot less than it would have were he more a potato than an oversized radish. (I wouldn't be surprised if the ostracization was partly because his party went back to the capital after he abandoned them and started spreading word about how much of an ass he is.) And I'll have to contest the idea of fanservice being a higher priority than the workplace elements. Sure, you had Shutina in her nightie and some literal male gaze in episode 2, but nothing has been obviously cheesecakey, let alone straight-up ecchi. Even Lily's gimmick about wanting to marry Leo right here and now is way less sexual than I could feasibly see it being in the hands of a different writer. Any LN adaptation with waifu-looking characters that gets at least one TV-PG-worthy episode in its first three clearly doesn't have fanservice as its highest priority.   Out of everything in Yuuyame, though, I'm most curious about the world itself and how it came into being. It looks and operates like your typical medieval fantasy realm, sure, but there seems to be this running implication that instead of existing separate from our Earth, it sprung up as a result of some cataclysm that affected our Earth. The very first scene taking place in what looks like a ruined Tokyo, the vine-covered structures throughout the royal capital that look like abandoned office buildings, the chamber in which the Philosopher's Stone is held looking like a cloning lab, the pie charts and bar graphs in Leo's initial presentation to Echidna... They're obvious hints, yeah, but I'm still interested in seeing what the show does with it, if anything.

I'm a little more interested now just to see how they do on working that into the overall narrative, but a part of me feels like it's just plastered on ""what's the craziest thing we can come up with"" type plotting.

REVIEW: I'm Quitting Heroing             Note: this is the discussion thread for this article     Anime News Network Forum Index -> Site-related -> Talkback    View previous topic :: View next topic     Author Message        meiam    Joined: 23 Jun 2013 		    Posts: 3221       Posted: Mon Apr 25, 2022 12:08 pm            I like the show in concept, but execution is... not quite what I'm interested in.   It seems like the show priorities are (in order):   1. Establish how awesome Leo is (cause he's just so awesome at everything!).  2. Fan service  ... massive gap...  3. Be a fun workplace show with a fantasy twist.   I could maybe overlook episode 1 since its just the start, but episode 2 clearly showed its priorities.   We start with Leo just bursting in the general room, followed by this creepy slow pane over her sleeping just to have Leo show off his awesome magic. We then get this long lore dumb about magic reactor work just to have Leo, once again, show off how awesome his magic is and how regular limitation don't apply to him. The message of delegation is completely lost since its not clear it would have been possible to delegate the task without Leo (who is, once again, just too awesome guys!).

The MC is the typical OP Chad, but unlike an isekai where you basically have a deliberate incongruence between the person in their original world and their new world to explain in an indirect way why they're OP, Leo's setup is just so lazy.    As a result, his activities likewise seem very lazily structured. We never get a remotely decent explanation as to why he was in Shutania's room first thing in the morning. He makes a big deal about how he was demonstrating how efficient it was to delegate responsibility, but he spends all that time lazing in her office remote ogling her chest, instead of going about the rest of the castle and seeing if there was other work he could get started on, start planning, or anything remotely productive. That doesn't even get into the fact that without even really knowing her well he assumed that 1) she never considered or attempted to delegate tasks to anyone (which as the review points out is utterly improbable for an army of this alleged size), and 2) that she wouldn't have understood if he simply explained his idea to her. Heck, the very fact that her and the generals were even interviewing in the first place meant she clearly understood to some extent the what and how of delegation of work tasks.    It feels too much like the events of Ep 3 will not carry very far right now. It's a step in the right direction, but it's very easy to see it fall back off after this.      Back to top                   Takkun4343    Joined: 19 Jul 2007 		    Posts: 1258 		    Location: Englewood, Ohio 		        Posted: Mon Apr 25, 2022 4:38 pm            Three episodes in and I can safely say I'm enjoying this one so far, but then again, I enjoy almost every show I watch, so that's nothing new. I don't mind Leo being presented as ""the best"", though that probably has everything to do with my just not caring whether or not a character is a Gary Stu. His jerkass attitude in some respects is definitely amusing, and made the populace's ostracization of him sting a lot less than it would have were he more a potato than an oversized radish. (I wouldn't be surprised if the ostracization was partly because his party went back to the capital after he abandoned them and started spreading word about how much of an ass he is.) And I'll have to contest the idea of fanservice being a higher priority than the workplace elements. Sure, you had Shutina in her nightie and some literal male gaze in episode 2, but nothing has been obviously cheesecakey, let alone straight-up ecchi. Even Lily's gimmick about wanting to marry Leo right here and now is way less sexual than I could feasibly see it being in the hands of a different writer. Any LN adaptation with waifu-looking characters that gets at least one TV-PG-worthy episode in its first three clearly doesn't have fanservice as its highest priority.   Out of everything in Yuuyame, though, I'm most curious about the world itself and how it came into being. It looks and operates like your typical medieval fantasy realm, sure, but there seems to be this running implication that instead of existing separate from our Earth, it sprung up as a result of some cataclysm that affected our Earth. The very first scene taking place in what looks like a ruined Tokyo, the vine-covered structures throughout the royal capital that look like abandoned office buildings, the chamber in which the Philosopher's Stone is held looking like a cloning lab, the pie charts and bar graphs in Leo's initial presentation to Echidna... They're obvious hints, yeah, but I'm still interested in seeing what the show does with it, if anything.

I'm a little more interested now just to see how they do on working that into the overall narrative, but a part of me feels like it's just plastered on ""what's the craziest thing we can come up with"" type plotting.

REVIEW: I'm Quitting Heroing             Note: this is the discussion thread for this article     Anime News Network Forum Index -> Site-related -> Talkback    View previous topic :: View next topic     Author Message        meiam    Joined: 23 Jun 2013 		    Posts: 3221       Posted: Mon Apr 25, 2022 12:08 pm            I like the show in concept, but execution is... not quite what I'm interested in.   It seems like the show priorities are (in order):   1. Establish how awesome Leo is (cause he's just so awesome at everything!).  2. Fan service  ... massive gap...  3. Be a fun workplace show with a fantasy twist.   I could maybe overlook episode 1 since its just the start, but episode 2 clearly showed its priorities.   We start with Leo just bursting in the general room, followed by this creepy slow pane over her sleeping just to have Leo show off his awesome magic. We then get this long lore dumb about magic reactor work just to have Leo, once again, show off how awesome his magic is and how regular limitation don't apply to him. The message of delegation is completely lost since its not clear it would have been possible to delegate the task without Leo (who is, once again, just too awesome guys!).

The MC is the typical OP Chad, but unlike an isekai where you basically have a deliberate incongruence between the person in their original world and their new world to explain in an indirect way why they're OP, Leo's setup is just so lazy.    As a result, his activities likewise seem very lazily structured. We never get a remotely decent explanation as to why he was in Shutania's room first thing in the morning. He makes a big deal about how he was demonstrating how efficient it was to delegate responsibility, but he spends all that time lazing in her office remote ogling her chest, instead of going about the rest of the castle and seeing if there was other work he could get started on, start planning, or anything remotely productive. That doesn't even get into the fact that without even really knowing her well he assumed that 1) she never considered or attempted to delegate tasks to anyone (which as the review points out is utterly improbable for an army of this alleged size), and 2) that she wouldn't have understood if he simply explained his idea to her. Heck, the very fact that her and the generals were even interviewing in the first place meant she clearly understood to some extent the what and how of delegation of work tasks.    It feels too much like the events of Ep 3 will not carry very far right now. It's a step in the right direction, but it's very easy to see it fall back off after this.      Back to top                   Takkun4343    Joined: 19 Jul 2007 		    Posts: 1258 		    Location: Englewood, Ohio 		        Posted: Mon Apr 25, 2022 4:38 pm            Three episodes in and I can safely say I'm enjoying this one so far, but then again, I enjoy almost every show I watch, so that's nothing new. I don't mind Leo being presented as ""the best"", though that probably has everything to do with my just not caring whether or not a character is a Gary Stu. His jerkass attitude in some respects is definitely amusing, and made the populace's ostracization of him sting a lot less than it would have were he more a potato than an oversized radish. (I wouldn't be surprised if the ostracization was partly because his party went back to the capital after he abandoned them and started spreading word about how much of an ass he is.) And I'll have to contest the idea of fanservice being a higher priority than the workplace elements. Sure, you had Shutina in her nightie and some literal male gaze in episode 2, but nothing has been obviously cheesecakey, let alone straight-up ecchi. Even Lily's gimmick about wanting to marry Leo right here and now is way less sexual than I could feasibly see it being in the hands of a different writer. Any LN adaptation with waifu-looking characters that gets at least one TV-PG-worthy episode in its first three clearly doesn't have fanservice as its highest priority.   Out of everything in Yuuyame, though, I'm most curious about the world itself and how it came into being. It looks and operates like your typical medieval fantasy realm, sure, but there seems to be this running implication that instead of existing separate from our Earth, it sprung up as a result of some cataclysm that affected our Earth. The very first scene taking place in what looks like a ruined Tokyo, the vine-covered structures throughout the royal capital that look like abandoned office buildings, the chamber in which the Philosopher's Stone is held looking like a cloning lab, the pie charts and bar graphs in Leo's initial presentation to Echidna... They're obvious hints, yeah, but I'm still interested in seeing what the show does with it, if anything.
